FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Since 1960, Mexico's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown in real
terms at an average annual rate of about 7%. Maintenance of this growth rate
is heavily dependent on rapid growth of export earnings and management of
external debt, which, in turn, hinges on an improved fiscal position. Other
problems to be faced are gross maldistribution of income, growing unemploy-
ment and underemployment, and placement of new additions to the labor force.
ii.       Government policy in relation to agriculture has a triple objective
of rapidly increasing food production for both domestic and export markets,
improving income distribution, and creating a maximum number of new jobs
consistent with the first two objectives. Approximately 40% of the country's
population is engaged in the agricultural sector. It contributes 10% of GDP,
nearly all domestic food requirements, and 50% of commodity exports. Food pro-
duction is growing at about 4% per annum but, as demand is growing at about 4.5%
increasing agricultural production must have high priority. Maldistribution
of income is the second serious problem facing Mexican agriculture, which has
a small percentage of relatively large efficient producers, and a large percent-
age of subsistance producers. Labor absorption possibilities in the non-
agricultural sectors fall short of the expected increase in the labor force,
making agriculture's ability to employ larger numbers a matter of great
concern.
iii.      The proposed fourth loan to the Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la
Agricultura, Ganaderia y Avicultura (FONDO) would support achievement of such
objectives. As under the previous three projects, it would, under the General
Sub-Project (GSP), finance investments for development of livestock and crops
and for establishment of agro-industries, but it would, in addition, provide
credit and technical services to low-income producers under the Low-Income
Producers' Sub-Project (LIPSP). 1_/ To itensify technical services to farmers
and ranchers, particularly under the LIPSP, production-oriented studies, demon-
strations, and farmer training would be undertaken. Total Project cost would
be about US$272 million equivalent as follows: GSP, US$216 million equivalent;
LIPSP, US$52 million equivalent; and studies, training and demonstrations,
US$4 million equivalent. The proposed loan of US$110.0 million, or 40% of
total Project cost, would finance all the foreign exchange costs (US$84 mil-
lion, or about 31% of Project cost) and 14% of the local currency costs (US$26
million, or about 9% of Project cost).
1/ The criterion for separating loan beneficiaries between the GSP and LIPSP
would be level of income.

iv.       As in the previous projects, the FONDO would be responsible for
loan implementation.  The FONDO was established in 1955 by the Government of
Mexico to provide the combination of funds and technical services necessary
lo make a significant impact on agriculture and livestock development.
Lending was to follow commercial criteria and FONDO was directed to operate
through private credit institutions tby refinancing their loans. In 1965,
re,,Lonal banks of the Government-owned Banco Nacional Agropecuario system
were granted access to the rediscounting facilities of the FONDO. It is now
-roposed that Banco Ejidal and Banco Agricola, two public banks, be granted
-ccess to the rediscounting facilities of the FONDO to help in execution of
the LIPSP.
v.        In the early years, FONDO concentrated on providing medium- and long-
term refinance to small farmers at less than market rates of interest under a
program called "ALPRO" (Alliance for Progress). This program is assisted by
two loans, totaling US$41.5 million, from the U.S. Agency for International
Development (US$20.0 million in 1963 and US$21.5 million in 1966) and by two
loans, totaling US$52 million, from the Inter-American Development Bank (US$20
million in 1968 and US$32 million in 1971).
vi.       In 1965, IBRD made its first loan to the FONDO (Loan 430-ME for
US$25 million) to support a project for providing medium- and long-term invest-
ment funds to farms and agro-industries. This was followed by a second loan
in 1969 (Loan 610-ME for US$65 million) when the first loan was fully disbursed
in December 1968, ahead oz schedule, and by a third loan in 1971 (Loan 747-ME
for US$75 million) when the second loan was, likewise, disbursed ahead of
schedule.
vii.      In order to fully realize the objectives of development, an IBRD
goal was to strengthen FONDO, both as a lending institution and as a technical
service organization. During the course of the first three Projects, measures
were adopted to accomplish this and FONDO is now a sound and efficient organi-
zation. The previous Projects are progressing satisfactorily and loan collec-
tions are extremely good. The Third Project, whose closing date is September
1975, is proceeding about 20% behind disbursement projections but loan funds
are expected to be fully committed by December 1973. The Fourth Project would
continue the program and initiate a development program for low-income pro-
ducers.
viii.     As in the previous Projects, all loans to primary borrowers would
be based on FONDO-supervised evaluations as to technical and financial vi-
ability; participating banks (official and private), who would generally
assume lending risks, would determine borrowers' creditworthiness. The lend-
ing and rediscounting terms and conditions would be generally the same as
those prescribed under the Third Project -- they have worked successfully.
However, because interest rates to sub-borrowers under the GSP would be in-
creased from the range of 10% to 11% to the range of 10% to 12%, rediscount
rates would also increase. This would help in the continuing effort to
strengthen FONDO's financial soundness and, at the same time, help partially



- iii -
offset the rate of 4.6% per annum proposed for rediscounts of loans to low-
income producers (lending to low-income producers would be at the maximum
rate of 7.6% per annum prescribed by the Banco de Mexico for loans to such
producers).
ix.       On the average, under the GSP, farmers and livestock owners would
contribute about 15% of their development requirements and agro-industry bor-
rowers about 20%; low-income producers would contribute around 5%. The rest
would be financed by a loan from a participating bank, which would then be
refinanced by FONDO to the extent of 81% (on average) in the case of loans
under the GSP and 90% in the case of loans under the LIPSP.
x.        As in the first three Projects, local trade channels would be gen-
erally appropriate for procurement. There are many manufacturers and equip-
ment dealers in Mexico, mostly under manufacturing franchise from interna-
tional firms. Competition is keen among them and repair facilities and ser-
vices are widespread and good.  However, in the procurement of machinery and
equipment for agro-industries when the cost of machinery and equipment in a
single investment exceeded US$100,000 at least five bids from at least three
countries would be required. In addition, FONDO would be required to recruit
an agro-industries expert to help it, among other things, evaluate these bids.
xi.       The Fourth Project is expected to provide significant increases in
the production of beef, export feeder steers, milk and milk products, and pork.
Of a wide range of crops that would be produced, cotton, alfalfa, sorghum,
avocados, and grapes are expected to show the most marked increases.  No sig-
nificant marketing problems are foreseen for the increased output of any of
the crop or livestock products.
Xii.      The estimated rate of return to producers' incremental investments
under the GSP would range from 18% to 50% and from 16% to 55% under the LIPSP.
The rate of return to the Mexican economy is estimated at around 29%.
xiii.     With appropriate assurances, the Fourth Project would be suit-
able for an IBRD loan of US$110 million for 20 years, including a four-year
grace period. The proposed loan would finance, as in the Third Project, 56%
of FONDO's refinancing requirements. The borrower would be Nacional Financiera,
S.A., the designated Government entity for borrowing from IBRD, and Government
would assume the foreign exchange risk.






MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF
FOURTll LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico has requested a Bank loan to help finance
an agricultural 1/ project to increase food production and processing, both
for the domestic and export markets. The proposed loan would be the eighth
agricultural development loan to Mexico 2/ and the fourth for agricultural credit.
1.02      Generally, the Bank's experience with agricultural projects in
Mexico has been satisfactory. The first two loans for agricultural credit
(430-NE for US$25 million and 610-ME for US$65 million) were both disbursed
ahead of schedule and the third loan (747-ME for US$75 million), which became
effective in September 1971, is expected to be fully committed by December
1973. It is to continue the latter project for supplying long-term agricul-
tural credit to the entire agricultural sector that Govermnent has requested
this fourth loan, which would, in addition, also provide funds for low-income
producers, such as ejidatarios 3/ and other small farmers, who were not covered
under previous agricultural credit loans.

A. General
2.01      Mexico's overall economic performance since 1960, as judged by
growth of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has been matched by few developing
countries. During that time GDP, in real terms, grew at an average annual
rate of about 7.0%, and the average annual rate of inflation was about 3.5%.
Prospects for a continued growth rate of 6% to 7%, however, are heavily
dependent on the rapid growth of export earnings and on external debt manage-
ment, which in turn hinges on an improved fiscal position. The resource gap
in 1971 was US$459 million.

in May 1966 for US$19 million; Loan 527-ME in January 1969 for US$25 mil-
lion; Loan 610-ME in 1969 for US$65 million; and 747-MIE in 1971 for
US$75 million.

2.02      Income distribution is very skewed in Mexico, where the top 10% com-            6
mands 52% of national income and the lowest 20% only 4%. Furthermore, there
are great income disparities between urban and rural areas. Average per capita
Gross National Product (GNP) in Mexico is US$744 but for rural people it is
only one-fourth of this.
2.03      The population of Mexico, at just over 54 million, is increasing at
about 3.4% per year and will reach about 100 million by 1990. Of this total,
21 million, or 41%, are rural 1/, and about 13% live in the Federal District
(FD). In 1970, the labor force was estimated at 13.0 million workers, of which
5.1 million (39%) were in agriculture, 3.0 million (23%) in industry, 4.1
million (32%) in services, and the remaining 0.7 million (6%) is unallocated.
Reliable data on unemployment and underemployment are lacking, but it is be-
lieved that these are among the toughest problems facing the Mexican Government
and people.
B. Agricultural Sector
2.04      The first problem of Mexico's agriculture is its seeming inability
to keep pace with the growth of demand for agricultural products (Annex 1).
Agriculture's share of GDP has fallen from about 23% in 1950 to approximately
10% in 1972. Nevertheless, the sector still supplies almost all of Mexico's
domestic food requirements and about 50% of the country's merchandise export
earnings.  Because total demand for food is projected to increase at about 4.5%           0
per annum while agriculture is growing at only about 4%, a problem is develop-
ing. Because of this, Government recognizes that efforts to raise the growth
rate of agriculture must be given priority in Mexico's agricultural development
strategy. Tnis is essential, not only to meet growing domestic demand but also
to continue agriculture's substantial contribution to export earnings, and thus
h-elp ease the balance of payments constraint to growth of GDP (para 2.01).
2.05      With the exception of a few crops like maize, the main constraints
to expanding agricultural production are on the supply side and may be sum-
marized as follows:
(a)  the weak technical level of nearly all people involved
in agriculture, ranging from farmer to extension and
even research workers (paras 2.14 and 2.15);
(b) the lack of access to long-term credit by a large
segment of producers (para 2.20); and
1/   Defined as people who live in villages of less than 2,500 population.



-3-
(c)  the faulty production and distribution system for
fertilizers and improved seeds (para 2.12).
2.06      Maldistribution of income is the second serious problem facing
Mexican agriculture (para 2.02). The average annual family GNP in rural
areas is about US$1,000. Of the approximately 3.75 million rural families,
about 40%, or 1.53 million, have net annual family incomes of less than
US$480. It is further estimated that only about 15% of rural families
have net annual family incomes exceeding US$2,000. 1/
2.07      A growing unemployment and underemployment problem is the third
major problem of agriculture (para 2.03). The rural population is expected
to continue growing at 1.5% p.a. Given the limited opportunities for absorb-
ing new workers in the non-agricultural sectors, increasing attention is being
focused on the employment creation potential within agriculture.
2.08      Of Mexico's total land area of 196.7 million ha, approximately 45.8
million ha is unproductive, 43.6 million ha is forest land, 78.0 million ha
is range or pasture land, and 29.3 million ha is potential crop land. Only
about 14.6 million ha of the latter were harvested in 1972. Mexico also has
about 12 million ha that are suitable for irrigated farming but so far only
about 4 million ha have actually been irrigated.
2.09      The agricultural population consists of two principal tenure groups:
(a) ejidatarios; and (b) small land owners. Since it is estimated that there
are about 1.86 million ejido parcels and about 0.96 million privately-owned
farms, about 0.93 million rural families are landless. It is estimated that
if all the farm land of Mexico were divided among the 3.75 million rural fam-
ilies so as to equalize their incomes, then each family would be entitled to
about the equivalent in earning power of 4 ha of irrigated land under cereals.
2.10      Of fundamental importance to the growth of modern agriculture in
Mexico has been the development, over the past 25 years, of the modern complex
of irrigation facilities in northern Mexico, to which IBRD financing has con-
tributed. Concurrent with water resource development, and contributing great-
ly to the success of irrigated agriculture, research workers were able to
develop superior production systems and improved varieties. Moreover, a selec-
tive price support program was used to enhance the profitability of certain
lines of production. The irrigated areas now produce slightly more than half
of the value of crop output and absorb the major share of the commercial
fertilizer used.
1/   This is about equivalent to 1,000 times the legal daily minimum wage
which is defined by the Mexicans as separating low-income producers
from others (para 4.30).

2.11      Minimum support prices, administered by Compania Nacional de Subsis-
tencias Populares (CONASUPO), are offered by the Government for a number of food
products, including maize, wheat, sorghum, and vegetable oil seeds, and pros-
pects are also favorable for most of the crops not covered (Appendix 1-2).
Besides the established good export markets for cotton, sugar, feeder cattle,
and beef, the US offers an excellent market for fruits and vegetables. In
general, the marketing system in Mexico for agricultural products functions
quite efficiently, and adequately serves the interests of producers and coII-
sumers.
2.12      The marketing of improved seeds and fertilizers, however, leaves much
to be desired, with pricing and availability as the primary problems. Guanos
: Fertilizantes, a state body, has a virtual monopoly in the handling of fer-
tilizers similar to that of Productora Nacional de Semillas in the ha-ldling of
improved seeds. Fortunately, these institutions are beginning to fully ap-
preciate the importance of the two inputs to modern agriculture, and initial
steps are being taken to find solutions.
Research and Demonstration
2. 13     Most of the crop research has been concentrated in irrigated areas,
with little being done in the more extensive rainfed regions. This situation,
however, is slowly being corrected (Appendix 1-3). The scope for livestock
research in the wet and dry tropical regions, based on experience in other
tropical countries (notably northern Australia), looks particularly promising
(ADpendix 1-3).
In spite of progress to date, the agricultural sector has been poorly
serviced by research, and much greater efforts should be made to solve a host
of very practical problems needing urgent solution in order to remove serious
-i:straints to Increased production.
Vxtension Services
:.15      Extension services are provided by the federal and state agricultural
extension services, the Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la Agricultura, Gana-
1eria y Avicultura (FONDO), various Government agencies and credit institu-
tions, but, in general, they have not been effective in introducing new produc-
tion techniques and management methods. An important reason for this has been
the large proportion of inexperienced young staff in the services resulting
from the high turn-over of professional staff and the lack of transport for
field officers. A more fundamental reason was the failure of the research es-
tablishment to produce results suitable for implementation at the farm level
(para 2.14).



-5-
D.  Agricultural Credit Services
2.16      Farm credit is provided by both official and private credit institu-
tions.  The Government's Banco Nacional de Credito Ejidal (Banco Ejidal) lends
to ejidatarios, the Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola (Banco Agricola) con-
centrates on lending to small-scale farmers, and the banks of the Banco
Nacional Agropecuario system (BANAGROs) lend to any farmer for tec4nically-
assisted farm projects.  Comercial banks and financieras 1/ account for
almost all private institutional lending to the agricultural sector, but about
70% of all lending is by official institutions.
2.17      FONDO was established by Government in 1955 as a trust fund in Banco
de Mexico (BANXICO) to carry out a program that would provide a combination of
financial support and technical service for directed developments in agricul-
ture (Annex 2). Under the terms of its trust, FONDO refinances technically
evaluated loans of previously authorized participating credit institutions,
and supervises project implementation, thus placing lending to agriculture
purely on a banking basis. FONDO operations have expanded rapidly. Besides
those assisted by IBRD, it is now responsible for projects financially assisted
by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) through two loans to-
taling US$41.5 million (US$20.0 million in 1963 and US$21.5 million in 1966),
and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through two loans totaling US$52
million (US$20 million in 1968 and US$32 million in 1971), as well as for the
ones it finances exclusively from its own resources. Under the previous IBRD-
supported projects, long-term interest rates charged to sub-borrowers varied
from 10% to 11%.  Given the low rate of inflation in Mexico (para 2.01), this
gave a real interest rate of about 7%. Under the USAID- and IDB-supported pro-
jects, the long-term interest rate is now 7.6% but it originally started in
1963 at 5.5% and has increased steadily since.
2.18      Operations of the Banco Ejidal (Annex 3) have been hampered by lack
of funds (funds come from Government appropriations and loans from the Banco
Nacional de Comercio Exterior) and by serious loan collection problems. As
a consequence, 75% to 80% of its loans are for short term and the rest for
medium term. Similarly, funds available to the Banco Agricola (Annex 4) have
remained at practically the same level over the last 10 years and have limited
its operations. Realizing the value of these two banks to any effort to help
low-income producers, Government has recently taken steps to improve them:
top management has been reorganized, loan accounts are being examined and bad
debts written off, accounting and lending routines are being mechanized, and
field personnel (technical and promotional) are being trained and more are
being hired. These institutions, with their large numbers of branch offices,
1/ Investment banks which have the power to issue bonds and other forms of
indebtedness, purchase and hold securities of other enterprises, and
grant loans up to 30 years maturity.



- 6 -
will continue to play an important role and Government is planning to channel
more funds to them through the FONDO and to introduce stricter rules for
their use ( para 4.32).
2.19      Farm loans by commercial banks have generally been for short-term
while financieras' involvement in the sector has been limited.  During the
last five or six years, however, with a greater amount of rediscounting and
technical assistance facilities available from FONDO, coimercial banks and
financieras have shown greater interest in investment lending to agriculture.
Evidence of this is the fact that many private banks have been rapidly estab-
lishing and expanding agricultural credit departments and hiring significant
numbers of agricultural technicians annually.
2.20      The maldistribution of rural income (para 2.06) poses another pro-
blem needing solution. Even a vigorous land redistribution program could not
by itself solve the rural poverty problem since the size of holdings that
would result from equal distribution would be too small to be economically
viable (para 2.09). It is for this reason that Government is concentrating
on developing "group farming" among the ejidatarios and other small farmers.
Group farming, in theory at least, enables the ejidatarios to benefit from
economies of scale. Hlowever, because the ejidatarios do not own their land,
they lack collateral and, therefore, have been effectively barred from obtain-
ing long-term credit from nearly all financial institutions, except the public
Banco Ejidal, which, however, has largely concentrated on short-term credit.
The result has been that investments to date on ejido land have lagged far
behind those made on privately-owned lands.  Then, in 1972, Government agreed
to guarantee 60% and, in exceptional cases, up to 80% of the long-term loans
made by private financial institutions to groups of ejidatarios or other small
farmers.  With such back-up assured, the Mexican private banking system can
now consider starting long-term lending to this large group of farmers.
2.21      It mist be emphasized that the 0.93 million landless families (para
2.09) would he helped only marginally by any agricultural credit project.
Nevertheless, where almost all long-term credit previously went to rural fami-
lies with net family incomes in excess of ITS$2,000, the changes mentioned above
now make it possible to channel development funds to the 1.86 million ejidata-
rio families. Agriculture can contribute greatly to improving the living stan-
dards of these people as well as other small farmers.
III.  ?FFXORMANCE UNDER TmE FIRST, SECOND AND TIIRD PPROJECTS
A. Introduction
3.01      The first IBRD loan of US$25 million in 1965 (430-NE), the second
loan of US$65 million in 1969 (610-ME), and the third loan of US$75 million in
1971 (747-NE) were all intended to help finance medium- and long-term invest-
ments (Annex 5). Loans were to be granted by participating banks and then



be refinanced to the extent of 70% to 90% by FONDO.  By agreement with IBRD,
FONDO would refinance only those loans that had been evaluated by competent
technicians and judged to be technically and financially feasible. Loan
maturities would conform to the particular repayment capacities of sub-bor-
rowers, according to projections of cash receipts and disbursements, and
suitable grace periods would be allowed upon FONDO recommendation to the
National Banking Commission.
B. Lending and Rediscounting Operations
3.02      An important objective was to put operations on an economic basis and
to get sub-borrowers to pay interest rates at on-going commercial rates. Thus
in the First Project, all sub-borrowers paid a loan interest of 10% per annum
regardless of loan size. In the Second and Third Projects, however, larger
operators were charged 11% and smaller ones 10%. Rediscount rates were struc-
tured to allow participating banks adequate margin to cover risks (which they
fully assumed), but, more importantly, to encourage them to participate in the
program. The size of the margin was varied, for different rediscount percen-
tages, from the First to the Third Project so as to encourage the banks to
retain a larger percentage of loans granted for financing from their own funds
(para 3.03). Under Loan 747-ME, the margin varies from 5% to 3%. Furthermore,
in the First Project, PONDO refina- ced'up to9%X- of any-loan regardless of
size, but in the Second Project, 90% of rediscounts were available only for
loans of US$40,000 or less, and in the Third Project, 90% financing is restric-
ted to loans of less than US$20,000 and then only if made by banks with paid-in
capital of US$400,000 or less.
3.03      On average, in the First Project, participating banks rediscounted
with FONDO 85% of the value of loans. In the Second and Third Projects, IBRD
avd FONDO tried, through changes in the rediscount rate schedule, to entice
the participating banks to increase their contribution. The effort was quite
successful. By the Third Project, participating banks on average had in-
creased their contribution by 33% and are now rediscounting with FONDO about
80% of the value of loans granted to sub-borrowers.
3.04      The following is the distribution of loan funds by enterprise:
First Project      Second Project      Third Project*
Livestock   ........         61%                61%                 59%
Annual Crops  .....          19%                28%                  28%
Perennial Crops               5%                 8%                  9%
Agro-Industries              15%                 3%                  4%
*As of December 31, 1972.

C.  Prolect Performance, Financial Condition, and Impact
Performance
3.05      The three IBRD-assisted projects have succeeded in widening the role
of the banking system in technically-assisted lending for farm development.
In addition to the regional banks of the BANAGRO chain, about 120 private banks
have also been participating. The participating banks have increased their
technical staff and their contribution to individual sub-loans (para 3.03),
and have been availing themselves of credit lines with FONDO at the satisfac-
tory usance percentage of approximately 75.
Financial Condition
3.06      The special fund created for the IDB and IBRD-appraised projects is
in good financial condition. All rediscounts have been collected at maturity,
and all claims are against sound financial institutions.
Impact of Lending
3.07      A total of 18,043 loans were approved for rediscounting under
the First and Second Projects. Of this total, 17,811 loans were made to farms
and ranches, and 232 loans were made to agro-industries.
3.08      A sample survey 1/ of 719 farm and ranch sub-borrowers reveals that
there was substantial variation between the various types of enterprises and
within the different enterprises. The average individual loan size on the
sample farm/ranch was US$13,600 but since about 27% received repeat loans,
the average borrowing per farm/ranch was US$18,350. Average borrowing per
farm/ranch ranged from about US$40,000 for poultry to US$13,700 for beef in-
vestments. The contribution of farm/ranch sub-borrowers to total investment
averaged 15%. This is in line with IBRD expectations at time of appraisal.
3.09      The breakdown of investment expenditures on the sample farms/ranches
was as follo-.'s: land improvement, 19%; irrigation, 5%; machinery and equip-
ment purchases, 25%; buildings, 15%; and livestock for breeding purpose, 36%.
3 .10     On the average sample farm/ranch, the gross value of farm production
almost doubled between pre-development and calendar year 1971, while net cash
operating income per farm increased by 45%. The greatest improvement in net
cash operatin. income was on the beef and dairy farms (doubling) and the least
on perennial crop farms (8%).
3.11      The sample survey also tried to compare production coefficients be-
fore development and in calendar year 1971. For this purpose, a few key co-
efficients were selected. On beef farms, the average herd size increased from
1/   Carried out by a consultant, who was hired by FONDO, in accordance with
the terms of the Second and Third Project Agreements.

98 cows to 134 cows, but, the weaning percentage did not change significantly.
However, stocking rate improved about 10%. In addition, the average annual
weight gain in calves was about 8% higher in calendar year 1971 than before
development. These improvements in production coefficients are consistent with
the FONDO emphasis on improving grazing conditions. However, the failure to
raise weaning rates is disappointing.  In the case of crops, it was generally
found that production coefficients did not change appreciably.
3.12      The survey of agro-industries involved a sample of 54 firms and in-
cluded respondents from 13 different industries. Only 30% of the sample firms
were in existence prior to the initial project loan, and some 39% of the sam-
ple were cooperative-type undertakings. About 26% of the firms had multiple
loans. On average, sub-borrowers contributed 40% of investment cost. Average
investment was US$235,000 distributed as follows: land, 3%; buildings, 31%;
machinery and equipment, 64%; and other, 2%. The average cost of creating a
new job in an agro-industry was US$26,000. The agro-industries surveyed were
generally in good financial condition and were making a satisfactory level of
profits.
IV. THE FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A. Brief Project Description
4.01      The Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Development Project (Fourth
Project) is a program for long-term investments in livestock and crop produc-
tion and in agro-industries. It would consist of two sub-projects: a General
Sub-Project (GSP) and a Low-Income Producers Sub-Project (LIPSP). It would
also provide funds for studies, special training, and demonstration.
4.02      The objectives of the Project are:
(a)  to expand food production so as to enable Mexico to con-
tinue meeting from local resources nearly all her domes-
tic food requirements  and also to continue agriculture's
substantial contribution to easing the balance of pay-
rents constraint to growth of GDP; and
(b) to improve the distribution of income by giving long-term
credit and complementary technical services to low-income
producers.
General Sub-Project
4.03      The GSP would continue the countrywide livestock and agriculture
development program started in 1965 by FONDO with IBRD assistance. As before,
any agricultural activity that was judged to be technically, financially and
economically sound would be eligible for financing under the GSP. As under the
previous projects, participating private credit institutions and regional
BANAGROs would extend loans to producers at commercial rates of interest



- 10 -
on the basis of technically and financially evaluated development plans.
Plan implementation would be supervised by FONDO technicians or by FONDO-
trained and approved technicians. As before, FONDO would refinance the primary
loans at varving rates of interest designed to encourage participation of more
local funds in the GSP (para 4.31).
Low-Income Producers Sub-Project
4.04      The LIPSP would initiate an agriculture development program aimed
specially at ejidatarios and other small farmers who meet certain requirements
(para 4.30). Loans would be granted by both official 1/ and private credit
institutions to: (a) such low-income producers legally formed into associations
or groups where each member would be jointly and severally liable for all
debts incurred by the "group", and (b) such individual small farmers who were
not ejidatarios. Loans would be based on technically and financially
evaluated plans, and the same standards observed in previous IBRD-assisted
projects would be maintained. Technical assistance would be provided by
FONDO technicians or by FONDO-trained and approved technicians.

4.06      Under the GSP, loans would nearly always be made to individuals, so
about 11,000 families would be direct beneficiaries of credit.  In the LIPSP,
however, the 1,746 loans would be made to about 22,600 families for develop-
ment as follows: (a) 149 beef ranches by 3,060 families; (b) 165 dairy farms
by 3,150 families; (c) 58 other livestock undertaking such as pigs and poultry
by about 1,150 families; (d) 723 annual crops farms by 8,676 families; (e) 645
perennial crop farms by 6,450 families; and (f) six agro-industries by about
120 families. Therefore, on average, each LIPSP loan would benefit about 13
families.
B. Detailed Project Features
Project Areas
4.07      The GSP would be countrywide in scope.  The LIPSP would have areas
of concentration (Map IBRD 10284R) in some of the poorest regions, such as the
states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Queretaro and Aquascalientes, and all additional
staff for this Sub-Project would go to such areas (para 4.26). It is important,
however, that FONDO's three regional and 35 field offices lying outside the
areas of concentration (Map IBRD 3283R1) participate in the LIPSP to the maximum
.



-12-
extent possible to gain experience in dealing with low-income producers and
to build the liaison with other institutions so vital for an expanded follow-
up project. In these areas, no additional strengthening would be envisaged
at this time.
Farm/Ranch Development
4.08      Since the inputs financed under the GSP and the LIPSP are similiar
the two Sub-Projects will be treated as one in the following paragraphs dis-
cussing technical features.
4.09      Beef Ranching.  In the wet and dry tropical areas of the east, south-
east and southwest, development efforts would include the introduction of
tropical legumes and the application of fertilizers to increase the productivity
and longevity of artificial pastures. In Northern Mexico, efforts would focus
on introducing new techniques of management to increase extraction rates signif-
icantly.  In general, throughout Mexico, investments would be mainly in breeding
stock (to increase herd numbers more rapidly); in pasture establishment and
land clearing (to provide better quality and more consistent levels of stock
nutrition); and in fencing, water facilities, irrigation, and ranch infra-
structure (to improve farm management) (Annex 6).
4.10      Dairy Farming.  In view of successful dairy farming operations under
the previous projects, investments in dairy development are expected to further
increase in the central highlands and the irrigated north and to expand sub-
stantially in the states oL Guerrero and Oaxaca, especially in areas close to
Acapulco.  Investments would be mainly for milking cows (to improve the quality
of herd and increase numbers more rapidly), pasture establishment (to improve
nutrition levels), and in machinery and farm infrastructure (to increase pro-
ductivity and reduce the cost of production) (Annex 6).
4.11      Other Livestock.  Investments in pig farming as well as in poultry
development are expected to be greatest in Central Mexico. Principal invest-
ments would be in breeding stock, housing and equipment. Other livestock
developmients would include investments in goats, bee keeping, and the raising
of fur-producing animals.
4.12      Annual Cro2s.  About 50% of investments are expected to be made in
irrigated areas, and the rest would be in rainfed areas. In the irrigated
areas, the main investment items would be machinery and equipment, on-farm
irrigation works, and farm installations, while in rainfed areas land clearing
would be a major investment item (Annex 7).
4.13      Perennial S=. About two-thirds of the development in perennial
crops are expected to be in rainfed areas and the rest in the irrigated dis-
tricts. Major investments would be crop establishment, machinery and equipment,
and some on-farm constructions (Annex 7).

- 13 -
*             Agro-Industries
4.14      Under the GSP, about 65% of expected investments (53% of the number
of plants) would be related to the livestock sub-sector (slaughterhouses, pork
processing, feed mixing, and alfalfa drying plants), while the balance would
be for crop processing plants (fruit and vegetable packing- storage and pro-
cessing), fertilizer and insecticide mixing, seed drying and storage, and
wineries. Under the LIPSP, about six logging and saw mills would be financed.
Over 60% of investment cost is expected to be in machinery and related equip-
ment (Annex 8).
Studies, Training and Demonstrations
4.15       ,mphasis would be given to the provision of technical services to
farmers, particularly tihose in the rainfed areas, and to livestock producers,
especiall. those in the tropics.  Ejidatarios and other low-income producers
would receive special attention, not only on technical matters, but on organi-
zational and administrative matters as well. Production-oriented studies and
demonstrations (adapting and integrating research findings into farming systems,
better use of pastures, economical calf-rearing methods, and such) and training
would be undertaken. FONDO's fundamental role would be to provide the initia-
tive (it is in a good positionl to appreciate problems at farm level) and the
funds that would be needed, and, accordingly, as in the Third Project, as-
surance was obtained that FONDO would enter into contractual arrangements
with Government, state, and private entities to undertalke specific programs
on its behalf, and would not, except with IBRD concurrence, perform such ac-
tivities itself.  Such an arrangement w.ould help develon, expand, and streng-
then Mexico's existing agricultural research efforts. Details on cost esti-
mates are show-n in Annex 9.
4.16      In support of the on-going effort to strengtlhen its technical ser-
vices, FO')O would continue to send its tecbnicians for training in and out-
side MIexico. As before, candidates would be selected on the basis of their
basic training, experience, actual performance, and potential for growth and
accordinz- to FONDO's need for specialized technical capability in particular
fields. It is also planned to send selected farmers abroad and within Miexico
for training and observation of new farming technology.  By adopting new Treth-
ods observed, their farms would then become useful demonstrations for FONDO.
C. Cost Estimates
4.17      The total cost of the Fourth Project is estimated at US$271.7 million
of which US$83.9 million, or 31%, represents foreign exchange requirements.
Estimated Project costs, including a price contingency of about 9%, are
summarized below:

As showm above, the Project would be financed from four sources:  (a) the IBRD
loan of US$110 million, or 40% of Project cost, vould finance all the foreign
exchange costs (US$84 million, or about 31% of Project cost) and 14% of the
local currency costs (US$26 million, or about 9% of Project cost); (b) FONDO
would contribute US$86.1 million, or 32% of Project costs; (c) participating
banks would contribute US$39.6 million, or 15% of Project cost; and (d) pro-
dticers US$36.0 million, or 13% of Project cost (15% on average fron producers
under the GSP which is current practice, and 5% in the LIPSP). In addition,
participating banks would provide short-term loans to beneficiaries to cover
their working capital needs.  Assurances to this effect, as well as in regard
to Project cost sharing, were obtained during negotiations.
4.19      The loan would be made to Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), the
designated Government borrowing entity for loans from IBRD, at the current
IBRD lending rate at the time of loan approval., for 20 years, including four



- 16 -
years of grace.  The loan term of 20 years is based on country considerations.
Assurance was obtained during negotiations that NAFINSA would on-lend the
proceeds of the loan to the FONDO at the same IBRD terms and conditions, less
a service charge of 1/8 of 1% of IBRD disbursements, and that Government would
assume the foreign exchange risk. Furthermore, assurance was obtained that
Government would assume payment of principal and interest of funds used by
FONDO for training and research under the Fourth Project.
E. Procurement
4.20      In the procurement of machinery and equipment, when its cost would
exceed US$100,000 in any particular agro-industrial undertaking, at least five
bids from at least three countries would be required. In addition, FONDO
would be required to recruit an agro-industries expert to help it, among other
things, evaluate these bids. Otherwise, procurement would be through normal
commercial channels because the relatively small size of individual purchases
and contracts, the great variety of goods to be procured, the phasing of
individual investments, and the need for standardization would make bulking
of procurement and international tendering impractical. To the extent possible,
FONDO would encourage, as in the Third Project, the seeking of bids from local
suppliers and contractors. These procurement procedures were assured during
negotiations.
4.21      An adequate selection among local and international suppliers of
machinery, tractors, and other agricultural equipment is available to sub-bor-
rowers. Permits are required for the importation of these items, and, in
addition, an import duty of approximately 3% is levied. Import permits, free
of charge, are easily obtained for types of machinery and equipment, and trac-
tors in the size ranges not manufactured in Mexico, but for types of machinery
and equipment or tractors of the sizes manufactured in the country no permit
is granted except when a scarcity arises. Tractors in the 12- to 125-hp range
are manufactured locally under franchises from five major firms (Ford, Massey
Ferguson, International Harvester, John Deere and Worthington de Mexico). The
makes manufactured locally offer a satisfactory range of choice to sub-borrowers,
offer good service and maintenance facilities through an extensive and capable
diealer system, and provide an adequate degree of competition. No substantial
importation of tractors is, therefore, expected.
4.22      Breeding female dairy cattle would be irmported by sub-borrowers
through nortAl commer.ial channels, and inspection and quarantine proceduers
for importation are fully adequate. As in the Third Project, assurance was
obtained that FONDO would require participating credit institutions to
encourage sub-borrowers to obtain quotations from at least three sources of
supply, although it is expected that most of the purchases would be made from
the USA and Canada.
4.23      The procurement procedures described above, except for agro-indus-
trial- machinery and equipment, follow those set out under the previous IBRD-
assisted projects.  They have worked satisfactorily in the past and would
similarly ensLtre economical and efficient use of resources under the Fourth              0
Project.

0                                    F.  Disbursements
4.24      Disbursements to sub-borrowers (which would be related to the phasing
of their investments) would vary from one to three years. Since the loan com-
mitment period is for two years, loan disbursements are expected to cover about
four years. IBRD would reimburse FONDO for 56% of Fourth Project rediscounts
against a certificate of expenditure, the documentation for which would not
be submitted for review but would be retained for inspection by the IBRD dur-
ing the course of Project supervision. IBRD disbursements on the proposed
loan of US$110.0 million are expected to be about US$19.5 million the first
year, US$50.9 million the second, US$35.1 million the third, and US$4.5 mil-
lion the fourth (Annex 10).
G. Organization and Management
Administration
4.25      As under the first three IBRD-assisted projects, FONDO would adminis-
ter the Fourth Project. FONDO is a basically sound and relatively efficient
organization and it has vigorously pursued expansion of its technical staff.
From a total in 1965, of about 135 technicians of varying agricultural discip-
*      lines, the staff rose to about 200 by December 1968, 320 in November 1970, and
465 in November 1972.  Three hundred ninety-two, or 84% of the total, are in
the six supervisory regional offices (established under the Third Project) and
70 field offices. In addition, more than 400 technicians employed by partici-
pating official and private banks have been authorized to service IBRD projects.
FONDO's plans are to continue recruiting around 50 technicians yearly (exclud-
ing those required under LIPSP).
4.26      Technical supervision of group development under the LIPSP would be
considerably mDre intensive than under GSP.  FONDO estimates of the technical
staff requirement, based on its experience in a low-income producers' program
(ALPRO) financed by USAID and IDB, indicate that one technician would be needed
to service each of the following: two dairy farms, or 10 feeder cattle opera-
tions, or two beef breeding/fattening operations, or five annual crop farms,
and/or eight to 10 fruit farms.  On this basis, around 314 technicians would
be required overall:  108 would be hired by FONDO and the rest would be sup-
plied by participating credit institutions and interested agencies such as
Departamento de Asuntos Agrarios y Colonizacion (DAAC), Secretaria de Agri-
cultura y Ganaderia (SAG), and Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos (SRH).  The
FONDO technicians assigned to LIPSP would be paid out of a fund, "Fondo Especial
de Asistencia Tecnica y Garantia para Creditos Agropecuarios" (FEGA) (Special
Fund for Technical Assistance and Guarantee for Agricultural Credits) 1/
created by Government with an initial contribution of US$2.0 million. During
1/   FEGA is also empowered to guarantee 60% (up to 80% in special cases) of
loans granted by private credit institutions to low-income producers
(para 2.20).



- 18 -
negotiations, assurances were obtained that FONDO would seek formal working
arrangeraents with other entities to be involved technically with the LIPSP
(DAAC, SAG, SRH and others) and that such agreements would be finalized
only after their content had been agreed with IBRD. Likewise, assurance was
obtained that Goverament would pay into FEGA funds as may be necessary to
pro-ride adequate technical service to the LIPSP.
4,227     FONDO operates not only as a technical assistance organization but
the rediscounting arm of BAiXICO for development loans to agriculture.  As
such, its policy has been to maintain net income at a low level, while main-
taining financial soundness. Net income has been sufficient to cover expenses
and has been at around 1% of gross income. FONDO is in good financial con-
dition. Trust principal is unimpaired, having grown from US$9.6 million in
December 1966 to US$21.2 million in December 1972. This has been, in large
measure, due to the fact that Government has committed itself to repay Loans
430-ME, 610-ME, and 747-ME, with such repayments (which FONDO would otherwise
have made) to be considered as additional Government contributions to equity.
FONDO's financial operating results are expected to be maintained at least at
the same 'Level as in the past and its financial condition to remain good (un-
der the Fourth Project). Moreover, Government indicated during appraisal, and
confirmed during negotiations, that it would likewise assume the repayment of
the proposed loan to further increase its contributions to FONDO. This is
acceptable to IBRD as it would further strengthen FONDO's financial condition.
Projections of FONDO's fi- incial condition during the disbursement period of
the proposed loan is given in Annex 2.
Lending Policies and Procedures
-4.28      Loan Appraisal and Supervision.  As under the first three IBRD-
assisted projects, loans would be made on the basis of development plans eval-
uated by FONDO technicians or FONDO-approved technicians as to technical
feasibility and whether returns on investments would be satisfactory. Manuals
on appraisal work for each regional office help assure uniformity of appraisal
and supervisory work within regions or areas. 1/ In all cases, approval of loans
has been the sole responsibility of FONDO (as distinguished from the approval
given by a participating bank based on the applicant's creditworthiness).
During negotiations assurance was obtained from FONDO that such arrangement
would be continued under the Fourth Project.
4.29      Starting with the Second Project, FONDO was required to measure
results and impact on selected farms and agro-industries. This they did by
means of a survey. Under the Third Project the monitoring mechanism was
improved by starting a system of record keeping on a sample of farms/ranches
and agro-industries. Assurances were obtained from FONDO that this new
system would be continued under the Fourth Project.
I/   The manuals contain relevant information (updated from time to time) as
to soil classification, rainfall, crop yields, production coefficients,
dLIput requirements, operating costs, market prices, and other appraisal
and supervisory information.



- 19 -
@       4.30      Lending and Rediscounting Terms and Conditions.  All loans under the
Project would be made, as before, solely on the basis of financial and tech-
nical feasibility of the development to be financed and the creditworthiness
of the applicant. LIPSP loans would be granted to groups of low-income pro-
ducers or individual non-ejidatarios who would meet the following criteria
prior to development:  (a) they would be ejidatarios, "ccomuneros" 1/ or small
farmers in legal possession of their land or plots; (b) they would administer
or work their own plots or agricultural enterprise themselves and the result-
ing income would be the principal means of economic support for their families;
and (c) the family yearly net income of each participant would not be greater
than 1,000 times the legal daily minimum rural wage prescribed for that economic
zone (para 2.06). During negotiations, assurance on the above was obtained.
4.31      FONDO would rediscount loans granted by participating official and
credit institutions in accordance with the following schedule:
Maximum of    Rediscount Rates    Interest Rates
Sizes of Loans         Loan       to Participating         to Bene-
to Beneficiaries   Rediscounted         Banks             ficiaries
GSP Loans
Up to US$12,000 ........       90                7.5%               10.0%
US$12,000 to US$20,000 .       85                8.0%               10.5%
US$20,000 to US$40,000 .       80                9.0%               11.5%
0          US$40,000 to US$80,000 .        70                9.0%               11.5%
More than US$80,000  ....      70               10.0%               12.0%
LIPSP Loans ...............       90                4.6%                7.6%
The proposed interest rates to beneficiaries under the GSP, and the rediscount
rates charged participating banks would generally be higher than those under
the Third Project and would reflect the continuing objective of making long-
term interest rates in agriculture more in line with commercial rates. Interest
rates under the LIPSP would be at the maximum rate of 7.6% p.a. prescribed by
BANXICO for loans to low-income farmers.  Assurance was obtained that FONDO
would adopt the proposed rediscount and interest rates and tat, in general, it
would grant loans under the Fourth Project under terms and conditions agreed
with IBRD.  Repayment terms for development loans would be flexible and would
reflect the forecast cash flows of the enterprise to be financed. Terms would
range from three to 15 years and would include grace periods of one to three
years however, in exceptional cases, and with the prior approval of IBRD,
loan maturities may be for up to 20 years.
1/   A "cumunero" is a member of a group of peasants who occupy and work land
on a communal basis. Their existence antedates the agrarian reform and
their claim to the land is, therefore, based on tradition.
.



- 20 -
4.32      To ensure that FONDO funds are used solely by participating banks
for purposes which it has authorized, assurance was obtained that FONDO
rediscounts would be secured by, and would have the same maturities as, the
promissory notes representing loans disbursed to sub-borrowers under the Fourth
Project. In the cases of Banco Ejidal and Agricola, it was also assured during
negotiations that a special account would be established within each of these
ban'ks for all transactions pertaining to the Project and that IBRD supervision
missions would have access to these accounts.
H. Accounting and Auditing
4.33      The accounting system of FONDO is satisfactory.  Auditing is per-
formed by a unit in the FONDO directly responsible to the Auditing Department
of BANXICO which operates in an independent manner. In addition, auditing
is performed by an independent private auditing firm. Assurances were obtained
that FONDO would continue to submit to IBRD certified statements of operating
results and financial condition not later than three months after the end of
each FONDO fiscal year.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND MARKETING, AND PRODUCER BENEFITS
A.  Production
5.01      A wide range of livestock products and crops would be produced by
ranches and farms participating in the Project. Farmers are expected to shift
to the most profitable crops or livestock products as farming conditions change.
However, the most significant increases are likely to occur in beef, feeder
steers, pork, milk, cotton, and sorghum and alfalfa to support the expanding
livestock industries. Compared to overall Mexican production, small increases
in poultry, vegetable oils, and fruit tree crops are anticipated, and the cur-
rent shift away from maize to sorghum is expected to continue.
5.02      If present production trends are maintained in Mexico, the best esti-
mates of increased production arising from the Project (compared to 1972 na-
tional production levels) are as given in the following table:

Grapes '000 tons                    160        27            27           17
B. Markets and Marketing
5.03      Mexico's population is presently growing at about 3.4% p.a. (para
2.03) and real per capita income by about 3% p.a.  Assuming an income elas-
ticity of demand for food of approximately 0.37 and a continuation of the pre-
sent trends in nopulation and per capita income growth, this would result in
about a 4.5% annual increase in the quantity of food demanded (para 2.04).
Through 1982, deficits in the domestic market at present price levels are pro-
jected for the majority of food items expected to be produced by the Project.
This is particularly true of beef, millk, pork, cotton, and tree crops, which
are commodities expected to increase significantly in output as a result of
the Project (para 5.02).
5.04      In 1966, the monopoly of the municipal abattoir in slaughtering cat-
tle for the FD (Mexico's principal beef and milk market) was broken by the
Government. This increased the flow of beef to the FD, since it allowed pro-
cessors and producers to sell directly to wholesalers and retailers at higher
prices. As the supply of beef to the FD improved, Government relaxed its
enforcement of price controls and quotas. The Project, by further expanding
production in tropical areas, would further encourage this trend. Beef mar-
keting prospects are, therefore, encouraging and incremental Project produc-
tion would be handled satisfactorily by the system now in effect.
5.05      Mexico, which is free of foot-and-mouth disease, is the largest
exporter of feeder cattle to the United States, and since the United States
imposes no quotas, opportunities for expansion are excellent.
5.06      Milk is subject to official retail price controls, especially in the
FD, although they have not been enforced since 1964. The current retail price
levels are satisfactory from the producer viewpoint, and Government is unlikely
to reinforce controls.



- 22 -
5.07      Project incremental broiler and egg production would be easily han-
dled by the present system. Enhancing future marketing prospects in the
broiler industry is a trend toward integrated production and processing units,
which, if continued, would strengthen the industry's abilitv to offer a stan-
dard superior product directly to retail outlets at lower prices. Pork nro-
duction under the Project would similarlv be marketed satisfactorily through
existing channels. Incremental production of feed grains, especially sorghum,
would be readily absorbed by the expanding pig and poultry industries.
5.08      Mlexican strict middling cotton (1-1/6") has always had ready accep-
tance on world markets because of good quality.  Most is handpicked and is
grown in arid climates. Major markets are Japan and Europe. The increased
export availability likely to arise from the Project would not even enable
Mexico to reach former export levels since exports fell from 1.8 million bales
in 1965 to 1.0 million in 1970. World cotton prices are projected to decline
by approximately 15% during the 1970s but Mfexican cotton exports would still
be competitivce (tAnnex 11).

some annual crops to eight years for some perennial crops and for beef develop-
ment.

these investments attractive (Annex 12). In addition to the incremental net
income shown above, each family, on average, would have about UTS$450 as a
wage income from the enterprise.



-24 -
VI.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The economic rate of return of the Project is estimated at approxi-
matelv 29%, having incorporated all significant adjustments to producer bene-
fits that were necessarv to better reflect real costs and returns to the
economy. The economic rate of return on the GSP and the LIPSP are estimated
at 26% and 41%, respectively. If labor on the LIPSP were charged at the full
monetary wage, then the return on this Sub-Project would drop to 25%. Assuming
further that the agro-industries component of the Project remains unchanged,
but that actual incremental production from the other components is valued at
10%n, less, due either to a drop in all output prices or a short-fall in produc-
tion, then the economic rates of return on the GSP and the LIPSP would be
21% and 31%, respectively. Should investment costs be 10% higher than proj-
ected, then the economic rate of return on the Project would be about 27%
(Annex 13).
6.02      Government considers that the principal objectives of the GSP
are the expansion of food production and export earnings. These objectives
are of primary importance because: (a) foreign exchange is a factor in
scarce supply in Mexico; and (b) growth of agricultural production is tend-
ing to lag behind growth of demand (para 2.04). A basic Covernment policy
objective is to prevent food prices from rising too rapidly, because of their
effects on the welfare of the urban poor, but more especially to keep down
wage levels, which, in turn, affect the countrv's ability to export industrial
products.
6.03      The LIPSP has the twin objectives of expanding food supply and
improving income distribution. Approximately 23,000 rural families would be
direct beneficiaries. Even though the beneficiaries are not the poorest
of the rural people, they are much poorer than the type of person who
traditionally has been the beneficiary of agricultural credit in Mexico.
This departure from tradition is a very desirable feature of the Sub-Project.
6.04      At full development, incremental tax returns to all levels of Govern-
ment would be increased by approximately US$8 million annually.  This estimate
is based on current levels of all taxes, principally sales taxes but including
income taxes, levied on agricultural and agro-industry producers.
6.05      The Project would generate additional foreign exchange earnings from
expanded exports and from import substitution.  The following table shows the
foreign exchange costs and benefits for investments, the development period
which is through vear-4, and at full development in year-in:

Balance                (34)                 160                154
These figures are calculated without taking account of the capital inflow
from, or cost of servicing the IBRD loan. The main foreign exchange benefits
are expected to result from the increased value of cotton and feeder cattle
exports and from the foreign exchange savings from increased milk, beef, pork,
and crop output.
6.06      In addition to the benefits specified above, there would be indirect
benefits that are difficult to quantify. One of the most important is that,
by supporting the FONDO through a Fourth Project, the means to channel in-
creasing amounts of development credit, coupled with technical services to
the farm sector, would be further strengthened. The Project would not only
train staff and strengthen the credit mechanism, but would also increase in-
vestment project planning capability at the regional level. by demonstrating
that lending to ejidatarios is sound economically, apart altogether from the
social implications, the LIPSP could have a profound effect on the future
course of rural development in Mexico.
VII.  RECOMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following main assurances were obtained:
(a) Government would:
(i)  assume payment of principal and interest of funds used by
FONDO for training and research under the Fourth Project
(para 4.19); and
(ii) pay into FEGA funds as may be necessary to provide adequate
technical service to the LIPSP (para 4.26);
(b) FONDO would:
(i)  ensure that procurement would be in accordance with the
procedures outlined in paragraphs 4.20 and 4.22;
(ii)  seek formal working arrangements with other entities to
be involved technically with the LIPSP and that such
agreements would be finalized only after their content
had been agreed with IBRD (para 4.26);



- 26 -
(iii) be responsible for the approval of all Fourth Project
loans on the basis of development plans evaluated as to
technical feasibility and satisfactory return on invest-
ments (para 4.28);
(iv) measure results and impact on selected Fourth Project
farms and agro-industries under the existing system
started in the Third Project (para 4.29);
(v) grant LIPSP loans to low-income producers who meet
criteria specified in paragraph 4.30; and
(vi) ensure that a special account would be established within
both Banco Ejidal and Agricola covering all transaction
pertaining to the Project and that IBRD supervision missions
would have access to these accounts (para 4.32).
7.04      With the indicated assurances, the proposed Fourth Project consti-
tutes a suitable basis for an IBRD loan of US$110 million equivalent, for a
term of 20 years, including four years of grace.

MEXICO
FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 1,
A. Background
1.        Mexico is the third largest country in Latin America.  With the
wide range of latitudes and altitudes it has an exceptional variation in cli-
mates and ecological zones which, in turn, makes for a considerable variation
in agricultural production and gives it a potential for great diversification
(appendix 1-1). A very large part of the country is arid or semi-arid and,
for the most part, supports only an extensive type of beef cattle ranching on
natural rangelands. The Bahio area (primarily rainfed highland north of the
Federal District) has been referred to as Mexico's bread-basket but, with irri-
gation developments north of that area and with further development in the
tropical zones along both coasts, the bulk of increased production is coming
from elsewhere, leaving serious rural poverty in the Bahio.
Crop Production
2.        A recent Bank of Mexico study classified the Mexican farmers into
three groups: (a) modern - farmers using modern technology; (b) traditional -
farmers producing cash crops by antiquated methods, and (c) subsistence -
farmers producing relatively little for the cash market. The results of this
study are summarized as follows:
1/   Appendix 1-1 has a more detailed discussion on production, Appendix 1-2
on markets and marketing, and Appendix 1-3 on education research and
extension.

/a   Apparently includes some pasture or woodland as well as cropland.
3.        Vith the unusually wide variety of annual and perennial crops
that can be produced in Mexico, it is noteworthy that about 61% of all culti-
vated lands are still planted to corn and beans. The very small percentage
of all farms that are classified as modern are producing most of the cotton,
sorghum, sugarcane, vegetable oil seeds, fruits and vegetables. This coin-
cides wit'h the heavy concentration of production in the small proportion of
total cropland area that is irrigated.
4.        The so-called "modern" farmer characteristically has modern
machinery and equipment; uses fertilizers and improved seed; fights insects,
disease and weeds with recommended chemicals and very often pays for technical
assistance. Even so, in many instances he lacks information that would enable
him to increase production and reduce costs. On the other hand, the traditional
and subsistence farmers, most often suffer for want of the right package of
inputs and the technical knowledge of how to use them.



ANNEX I
Page 3
0            Cotton
5.        The current year's estimate of cotton production (1.71 million
bales) is about 870,000 bales short of the 1965 production and prospects
for further recovery are not good, in view of declining world prices,
increasing production costs in some areas and competition from other, lower
risk crops.
Fruits and vegetables
6.        Mexico shows great promise as an important producer of fruits
and vegetables for export, as well as for domestic consumption. Although
fruits occupy only about 3.3% of the total cropland area, they produce close
to 20% of total crop value. The relative advantages of fruits and vegetables
over other crops are considerable - both in terms of profits and employment.
Livestock Production
7.        Beef.  Beef cattle production in the northen arid and semi-arid
rangelands is primarily oriented to supply a TJ.S. market. However, growing
domestic demands for beef are imposing constraints on this normal trade and,
although in theory the wet and dry tropical areas have adequate grassland
resources to satisfy domestic consumption, there is a lack of data on how
best to manage these grasslands.
8.        1ilk.  The dairy industry is largely concentrated in the central
plateau and the north, supplemented by milk that comes as a by-product of
beef cattle production. Most of the milk is produced under a high cost man-
agement system, based on confinement and using alfalfa from irrigated lands.
Costs could be reduced by adopting a pasture-grazing management system similar
to that of New Zealand, but production studies are needed to demonstrate this
in the Mexican environment.
9.        Pork.  Recently, a considerable part of the hog production has
shifted from the Bahio to the Northwest irrigation districts, where grain
sorghum feed is an important factor. Breeding and production methods are
changing in accord with market demands but colume of production can and
should be increased substantially.
10.       Poultry and Eggs.  This important industry has practically reached
the point where it can readily adjust itself to the market. Modernization
of the industry has resulted in reductions in prices and consumption is ap-
parently increasing quite rapidly.
The Rural Population
11.       Some 41% of Mexico's 54 million people are rural.  Since the total
population probably will top 100 million in the 1990's (based on 4.5% urban
and 1.5% rural growth rates), pressure in rural areas will continue to build
up. Furthermore, while the rural population supplies some 39% of Mexico's
total labor force, the contribution of agriculture to GDP (now close to 10%)
0             is declining.



ANNEX I
Page 4
12.       The agricultural population includes the two principle tenure groups
of ejidos 1/ and pequenos propietarios (small landowners).  As revealed in the
following table the ejido group continues to grow at the expense of the small
landowner class, which is also largely disadvantaged:

Small Landowners                             1,338,000        950,000
In 1960 -- 44% of ejidatarios had less than 4 ha. of usuable land and only
15% had more than 10 ha.
13.       Income distribution in Mexico is very skewed.  Although the overall
annual per capita GNP - about US$744 and rising at a rate of about 3.0%
per year -- is one of the highest in Latin America, the rural average is only
about one-fourth of this. 2/  About 40% of the rural population have per capita
incomes of less than US$90 and only 15% exceed US$340. Using FONDO's definition
of a "poor farmer" - one having a net annual family income of less than
US$2,000 -- about 85% of the farmers are  'poor" and over 40% (with family in-
comes of US$482 or less per year) can be classed as "extremely poor".
14.       The nutritional level of most Mexicans is still inadequate, especially
in animal proteins but these deficiencies are most serious in siral areas, due
to lower inco.nes. For example, the traditional rural diet of corn, beans and
chile has one of the world's lowest protein levels. In urban areas, however
(notably Mexico City), conditions are closer to those in more developed coun-
tries. The Federal District, with about 13% of the total population, accounts
for over one-third of all the meat consumed in Mexico.
1/  Tlue ejido is a -overnment-owned property for the settlement of ejidatarios.
The ejidatario, when properly registered, has permanent rights to a parcel
of land or to a share in communal lands within the ejido, subject to regu-
lations and supervision of the Department of Agrarian Affairs.

Land Use
15.       Although some 40% of Mexico's total land area is classified as
"range or pasture land", it supports a relatively small percent of the rural
population. Thus, most of the rural families are dependent on about 14% of
the total land area that is "suitable for cultivation". Ulnfortunately, only
50% of the cropland was actually planted and harvested in 1970 and 61% of that
harvested area was used for the production of corn and beans. The present
irrigated area -- 4.1 million ha. -- can probably be tripled, as indicated
below:

B. Major Problems and Constraints
Production
16.       The agricultural sector of the Mexican economy has given a credit-
able performance during the past 10 or 15 years but its future ability to
contribute its expected share of economic growth is in doubt. The main pro-
blem is the fact that the great majority of farmers have not yet learned and
adopted modern technology. Consequently, average yields are too low and the
demands for agricultural products are growing more rapidly than the country's
ability to produce.  Public efforts have been heavily concentrated on the con-
struction of irrigation facilities and future public investments may follow the



ANNEX I
Page 6
same trend. Unfortunately, however, the use of these new irrigation facilities 6
is deficient with large areas within irrigation districts not now being cropped,
mainly because the farmers with access to irrigation water lack certain on-farm
complementary facilities and technical know-how.
17.       In past years Mexico has not only been largely self-sufficient in
food production and her agricultural sector has also provided over 50% of
merchandise exports. This favorable situation appears to be deteriorating.
Cotton, for example, is not expected to regain its 1965 production level, and
eotton exports are now about US$80 million under the 1964/66 level. Although
livestock and beef exports jumped to US$121 million in 1970, they have since
declined. Despite the excellent research on improved wheat varieties, which
are now being used worldwide, Mexico has been slow to adopt them. In 1971
only 30% of the wheat acreage was planted to improved varieties. This is one
reason why Mexico may be importing nearly 2 million tons of wheat, sorghum and
corn from the ITS in 1973. Thus, for several important export commodities it
may be increasingly difficult even to keep up with the growing domestic demands.
18.       The continued very high rate of population growth, coupled with the
projected continued rapid growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) indicates
that domestic consumption may more than double during the next two decades and
even though the country may continue to be self-sufficient in some important
basic foods (corn, beans, potatoes), growing deficits are now projected for
most products.

Land Tenure and Rural Poverty
19.       An overwhelming proportion of all farmers in Mexico are classified
as low-income producers. For example, the 1960 Census revealed that 84% of
all farms reported annual production values of less than US$400 and this 84%
accounted for only 21% of the total value of national agricultural production
value. The private landowners, as a group, are no better off than the
ejidatarios, except for a very small number. There is no reason to expect
that the situation has improved materially since 1960.
20.       Statistics of the Department of Agrarian Affairs and Colonization
(DAAC) prove that as more and more peasants clamor for land, the Government
finds it necessary to create more and more ejidos. According to one official
statistical summary by DAAC, in the 1960-71 period, over 6,600 presidential
resolutions were signed for the creation of ejidos, ejidatario community
centers, or identification of communal lands, covering over 35 million ha of
land and affecting some 693,000 ejidatarios.  Consequently) :- the ejidatario
population increases, the "pequeno propietario" class decreases. Thus, the
land tenure system of Mexico has been converted from one dominated by
"latifundistas" (owners of very large proporties) to one that is now
dominated by "minifundistas".
21.       The low-income producer must have long-term credit for productive
investments, in order to improve his family's welfare.  Unfortunately, as an
individual farmer, he is only rarely eligible for credit, for want of land
and other assets with which to guarantee repavments. When ways and means are
found to offer him credit, through organization of poor, small farmers into
cooperative groups he still has an intense need for technical assistance and
training, in order to make the best possible use of his credit. But the low-
income producer is also usually stymied for want of certain basic or minimum
essential infrasturctural facilities.
22.       The fact that only a half of the available cropland was harvested
in 1970 (para 15) indicates need for more land clearing which, in many
instances can be done most efficiently with heavy equipment. Although
Mexico has a creditable record in the construction of farm-to-market roads
manv communities are still isolated and lacking ready access. Such access
roads are best built as local or state projects, with self-help by the commu-
nity. In a similar vein, many communities suffer for want of electricity
which is especially critical with reference to irrigation from deep wells.
The same sort of deficiencies are noted with reference to a number of other
community facilities (storage warehouses, small consumer goods stores, health
clinics, potable water and so forth). Altogether, the lack of such community
facilities represents a big constraint that, fortunately, is clearly recognized
by the present administration.
23.       The multiplicity of rural problems and constraints are reflected in
rural underemployment, lack of training and lack of opportunity as well as in
the fact that the rural labor force is relatively unproductive. It is quite



ANNEX. I
Page 9
apparant that Mexico's agrarian reform efforts have fallen short of the goals
and while it is true that millions of people have been resettled who otherwise
might have greatly aggravated the serious urban slum situations, it is equally
true that most of the ejidos and most of the small landowner communities must
still be viewed as depressed areas. Obviously, a great need exists for helping
the low-income producers to work together on some sort of a group or coopera-
tive basis but such a movement cannot be successful unless it is coupled with
much greater efforts in training, applied research and teclnical assistance.
C. Government Services
24.       The Government's recent new emphasis on rural welfare and develop-
ment is a hopeful sign. Several public agencies concerned with agriculture
are being given increased responsibilities and budgets and special attention
is being directed to the ejidos and to other groups of low-income producers.
Additionally, the banking systems -- both public and private -- are being en-
couraged to increase greatly their medium and long-term lending for improve-
ments designed to increase productivity and family incomes. The proper coordi-
nation and orientation of these renewed efforts will be of vital importance.
Agrarian Affairs
25.       The DAAC is the agency directly responsible for most aspects of
ejido establishment, supervision and improvement.  According to the General
Secretary of ejido promotion and organization of DAAC (a former FONDO technician),
all of the following measures are required in order to solve the problem of the
poor rural communities:
(a) Organize groups of farmers, especially for the purchase of
inputs and for marketing;
(b) Improve basic infrastructure -- access roads, water facil-
ities, electrification and miscellaneous community facili-
ities;
(c) Greatly increase medium to long-term credit for production
improvements;
(d) Provide much more training of key community leaders or
technicians, and
(e) Establish more small industries and service enterprises.
26.       DAAC is increasing and upgrading its staff from a present 360 to
750 technicians, most of them in the sub-professional (perito) class and a
special institute has been created (but lacks financing) to train ejidatarios
to better manage their own affairs). DAAC is keenly aware of its own limita-
tions and of the great need for well coordinated assistance by a number of
other agencies, including the public and private banks.



ANNEX I
Page 10
27.       The Fondo Nacional de Fomento Ejidal (FONAFE) is closely related to
DAAC and manages funds that have been acquired by ejidos from timber sales,
land expropriations and various other sources. With the approval of ejido
councils FONAFE uses these funds to establish small industries, to help finance
land clearing for housing, to build ejido food stores and for other enterprises.
Agricultural Education, Research and Extension
2(R.      The present Government has demonstrated its appreciation of the
fundamental importance of well coordinated agricultural education, research
and extension services by substantially increasing budgets and upgrading
staffs (Appendix 1-3). The very small percentage of Mexican farms that can
now be classified as "modern" is a clear indication of the great scope of the
job to be done. As described in Appendix 1-3 the FONDO, whose program gives
major attention to the livestock industry, is cognizant of certain weaknesses
in livestock research and is attempting to provide some necessary assistance
through this Fourth Project. This assistance, however, will be small by com-
parison with the urgent need to increase the production of beef, milk and
pork, as well as a number of other commodities (para 22 and Table 1). Applied
research and demonstrations appear to be high priority requirements for achiev-
ing the kind of breakthroughs that will bring the very substantial production
increases needed.
29.       Education.  Agricultural education facilities in Mexico have showni
great improvements in recent years. The Universities at Chapingo and Monter-
rey are well recognized throughout the hemisphere and more post graduate de-
grees are being offered. The schools offering sub-professional degrees, how-
ever, are only beginning to gain recognition but they are important since the
future technical manpower requirements are such that many more sub-professionals
must be emploved in order to free the higher trained personnel so that they can
spend mnore time on technical problems and less time on routine matters.
30.       Research. The structure of research facilities in Mexico appears
to be quite satisfactory, having been developed over the past 25 years with
aid from the Rockefeller Foundation and other agencies. In general, the crop
research is more advanced than livestock research, probably because work with
livestock has been heavily oriented toward disease control rather than manage-
ment. Despite some outstanding exceptions (e.g. wheat) agricultural research
has failed to satisfy the needs of the Sector.  There is an urgent need for a
considerable increase in many aspects of crop and livestock research. The
main focus should be a production oriented research program that provides
sound data on which to base more productive and viable farming operations.
31.       Extension.  At the present time, agricultural extension services are
undergoing a very substantial reorganization and expansion. Besides the con-
ventional type of services supplied by the Federal and State Governments, sim-
ilar assistance is being provided by banks and a number of Government agencies
to selected clients and all are being expanded. With all of this new build-up,
however, it mlust be recognized that the needs for technical assistance by the
ittraditional" and "subsistence" farmers (para 7) are both extremely urgent and,
as yet, largely unsatisfied.

0           Marketing Aids
32.       Price supports are offered by Compania Nacional de Subsistencias
Popularies (CONASUPO), a major federal agency that has become heavily involved
in a number of activities associated with the production, marketing and con-
sumption of basic food items. Thus, CONASUPO is primarily concerned with both
the rural problem of low-income producers and the urban problem of low-income
consumers.
33.       In cooperation with other agencies, CONASUPO is helping ejido admin-
istrative councils to establish and manage "bodegas" and "tiendas". The bode-
gas serve as warehouses for farm inputs (such as fertilizers, seed and farm
equipment) and also as temporary storehouses for grain and other products.
The bodegas are being built with ejidatario labor to a standard design, with
a 500metric ton capacity, and they are finally turned over to ejido manage-
ment. CONASUPO will rent storage space in the bodegas for price supported
crops and the income so derived will enable the ejido to pay for the cost of
construction. During the next four years another 3,000 bodegas will be built,
The tiendas are stores for the provision and sale of basic subsistence items
that are now being distributed and sold by CONASUPO on a nation-wide basis.
They are financed by FONAFE (para 31) and are built (also standardized designI
with the help of INDECO (National Institute for Communitv Development).
CONASUPO's goal is to place 5,000 tiendas in operation by 1976.
34.       In order to assure proper management of bodegas, tiendas and other
ejido facilities, CONASUPO also has taken the lead in organizing and conducting-
special training courses for ejidatorios (mostly young men, 18 to 30 years of
age). Courses range from one to three months and many bodegas are presently
serving as classrooms. It is planned to step up this program to a point where
30,000 persons will be trained each year.
35.       ANDSA (National Warehouse Company) has been the Government's official
institution for the storage of grain and other commodities since 1936. This
agency has 172 warehouses throughout the country, with a total bulk storage
capacitv of 4 million tons (in addition to 3 million tons of private storage
capacity) and is now in a position to handle all kinds of agricultural commo-
dities including those requiring cold storage. With its professional staff
and modern facilities, A^DSA also provides technical assistance to other Gov-
ernment undertakings such as those described above for CnO'AStPO.
Inputs
36.       With five companies (International Harvester, John Deere, Ford,
Massey Ferguson and Worthington) now manufacturing farm tractors up to 120
hp in Mexico importation (except for some component parts) has stopped. Most
of the related equipment is also now being produced in Mexico at prices that
are fairlv competitive. A new company, "Nacional de Servicios Agropecuarios",
has recerntly been formed as a subsidiary of the Banco Agropecuario to act as
a wholesale distributor of major agricultural inputs. This company operates
by arranging special concessions with manufacturers or producers of agricultural
machinerv and equtpment, fertilizer, agriculture chemicals, seeds and other

ambitious p-a s for expansion as evidenced by its intent to build a plant in
Matarioros f'or storage and distribution of anhydrous aimmonia ant to undertake
a special  crrn production project on 30,000 ha in the state of Mexico, to
save an estimated Mex$490,000 on the cost of inputs.  It was reported that
the other public banks (Ej idal and Agricola) are now engaged in similar enter-
pri,res, as ?, sperlaI service to their farmer clients.

tuai nonoroly on the imntortation and distribution of fertilizers in Mexico.
Sales ,ncreased at an average rate of 13% from 1965 to 1971 and in year 1971/

monopoly over the production and distribution of improved seed but apparently,
much remains tr) be done to produce more improved varieties, increase available
quantit-es, and to promote more improved varieties, increase available quanti-
ties, and to promote more widespread use of better seed. Offers of US com-
mercial seed produicers to invest in Mexico are evidently being resisted by the
Covernrr.ent.
Crop nsurance
39.        Aseguradora Nacional is an autonomous Government agency offering
crop arid livestock insurance throughout Mexico. This agency now has 45 field
offices and 550 inspectors who are in a position to assist credit agencies to
supervise the end use of loan funds. Enterprises to be insilred in various
ecological zones, are dictated by SAG (Ministry of Agriculture) and they are
restricted her risk and availability of services.  Crop insurance rates range
fromn 3 tc .'%, inciading 60% Governnient subsidy but very little insurance has
heer prcv.Jed, as yet, for livestock and fruit enterprises.  All loans from
public funds must now carry crop insurance, whenever it is offered.

APPENDIX 1-1
MEXICO
FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION CHARACTERISTICS
A. Diversity of Production
1.        Because of Mexico's numerous ecological zones, a real potential
exists for great diversity in agricultural production. Along the Gulf Coast,
corn, sorghum, and beef cattle predominate. In the northern part of this
coastal area, cotton was important until recently, but has now been almost
completely replaced by lower risk crops, such as sorghum. Natural pastures
of the dry and wet Ruastecas support a large beef cattle herd, while south,
in Tabasco, beef production is important and cacao, coffee, and bananas are
the major crops.
2.        Similar diversity exists along the Pacific Coast.  The northwestern
region is arid, but some of the largest irrigation projects have been devel-
oped here producing mostly cotton, wheat, vegetable oilseeds and horticul-
tural crops. Farther south, the coastal plain narrows and has a seasonally
wet tropical climate, suitable for tropical fruits as well as for the tradi-
tional basic food crops. In Chiapas, the plain is wider, and corn, beans,
sesame, cotton and beef cattle are important.
3.        The densely populated highlands and central plateau were formerly
known as Mexico's breadbasket but, today, productivity is greater in the low-
lands, mainly due to irrigation development. The arid and semi-arid zones
in the north have good natural pastures, and it is from these areas that the
bulk of the male weaners exported to the US originate. Irrigated areas
around Chihuahua and Torreon produce cotton, wheat, beans, alfalfa and
fruits. An impressive dairy industry based on alfalfa has been developed
in the Comarca Lagunera region around Torreon, and the central altiplano to
the south (states of Jalisco and Michoacan) produces corn, beans, sorghum,
and other food crops for Guadalajara and the FD (Mexico City market). Around
the FD (states of Mexico, Puebla, and Hidalgo), the altiplano is temperate
and dry, producing rainfed corn and beans, while small irrigated areas pro-
duce fruits and horticultural crops. The dairy industry, centered around the
FD, is supplied with alfalfa from this area.
B. Livestock
4.        Approximately 40% of the total area of Mexico, or 78 million ha
is classified as being best suited for livestock production (many beef),
principally on native grasslands. Table 1 shows the trend in livestock num-
bers by decades since 1930 and annually since 1960 for cattle, sheep, goats,
pigs, and poultry.



APPENDIX 1-1
Page 2
Beef Production
5.        Mexico has two major beef cattle production regions:  (a) the arid
and semi-arid northern rangelands and (b) the wet and dry tropics along both
the Gulf and Pacific coasts. The northern region is so situated as to be
geared primarily to the US market. The tropical areas produce exclusively
for the domestic market. The following table indicates the trends in total
cattle production of Mexico:
Item                            1965       1967       1969       1972

Source: Secretaria of Agriculture.
6.        The arid and semi-arid northern rangeland produces feeder cattle,
mainly for the US market under extensive conditions with stocking rates in
excess of one ha per head. British breeds, particularly Hereford and Aberdeen
Angus, predominate.  Only male weaners are exported since the export of
females is prohibited, although this ban was temporarily lifted in 1969
because of drought. In some of the irrigated northern areas, there is a
very small market for export-type cattle for fattening in feedlots. Some
female weaners are used for this purpose when they can be sold to specialty
markets (higher prices), which makes confinement fattening economical. Cull
cows from the northern rangelands account for half the frozen boneless beef
exports to the United States; the other half originates in the central pla-
teau. Weaning percentage varies from 30% to 50%, depending on management
and disease but mainly on nutrition. In this region, a program of deferred
grazing at proper stocking levels should make it possible to increase weaning
rates significantly. Recent attempts to improve the native rainfed patures
by the introduction of Buffel grass have also been quite successful, particu-
larly in the semi-arid areas with more than 15 inches of rain per year.
7.        The wet and dry tropics produce beef almost exclusively for domes-
tic consumption and support about 60% of Mexico's cattle population. Pro-
duction methods are generally inefficient, pastures are underutilized, and
nutritional deficiencies are widespread. Considering the experience of other
countries with similar environments (notably Australia), there is little doubt
but that, with better animal and pasture management, together with the use of
more technology, production could be greatly increased. The most pressing



APPENDIX 1-1
Page 3
need is for grazing studies on both native and introduced pastures in vari-
ous ecological zones, on stocking rates under various conditions, and on
fertilizer requirements. In this work, particular emphasis should be placed
on the importance of legumes in the pasture system. Many native species of
legumes abound in the area but, to date, tropical legumes have not been used
as components of commercial pasture mixtures. The introduction of these
legumes, plus the application of fertilizers where necessary (principally
phosphate and micro-elements) would greatly increase the longevity and pro-
ductivity from these artificial pastures. Work, however, is needed to demon-
strate the best species and to determine the most economical methods of
establishment and management. Although the FONDO is helping to solve these
problems, further more critical studies are needed.
Dairy Production
8.        Approximately 2.8 million cows of recognized dairy breeds, particu-
larly Holstein-Friesian are concentrated in the irrigated districts of the
central plateau and north. In addition, many cows are milked in the tropi-
cal areas but these are crossbred animals of low productivity. In tropical
areas of Mexico, as in most tropical areas of Latin America, milk and milk
products are by-products of the beef industry and provide ranchers with
needed daily income. Accurate information is not available on Mexican milk
production, but it is estimated as follows:
Number of         Number of              Milk Production

9.        Traditionally, dairying has been concentrated principally in the
irrigated districts of the central plateau, and while the Bajio region has
been the most important and traditional milkshed for the FD, nearly 40% of
its supply originates within the FD. Production is generally based on
irrigated and greenfed alfalfa and confinement management. However, in
recent years, intensive dairy production under confinement management has
also been initiated in the irrigated districts of the north and northwest,
particularly around Torreon and the milk from this are is now the principal
single supplier to the FD market. The Torreon dairy coop (producing near a
half million liters per day) also owns pasteurizing plants in both Mexico
City and Acapulco.

10.       Although production levels per cow are very high under this inten-             i
sive system, costs per liter of milk are also high because of the feeding
and capital costs. Under Mexican conditions it should be possible to adopt
lower cost production methods based on grazing herds on permanent grass
legume pastures, such as in New Zealand and Ireland, but studies are needed
to test the validity of this hypothesis.
Pork Production
11.       Commercial pig production has always been concentrated in the
western edge of the Bahio but more recently, emphasis has shifted to the
adjacent northwest irrigated states because of the increasing availability
of grain sorghum there. Approximately 90% of the intensive operations are
combined breeding/fattening under confinement management. The national off-
take rate is approximately 30% but with better management, aimed particularly
at increasing the weaning percentage, this could be improved considerably.
Approximately 85% of the pigs slaughtered in the ED are produced in the
three states of Guanajuato, Michoacan and Jalisco, but northwestern states
are increasing their share. Breeding and production methods are changing to
provide the meat-type animal coming into demand. The remainder of Mexico's
pig production is based largely on the family-type operation whose produc-
tion does not greatly affect the principal FD market.
Poultry and Egg Production
12.       The daily egg production in Mexico is estimated to number about                0
32 million, one-third of which is consumed in the FD and about 360 tons of
broilers are produced daily, a great part of which is marketed in the FD.
The fact that poultry is no longer imported and prices are stable or de-
creasing suggests that the industry grew vigorously in the recent past and
has become stabilized. The principal egg producing areas are located in the
northwest, northcentral, and northeast irrigated zones and in the central
plateau. The typical northern producer has more than 50,000 layers and
practices modern production technology, which has resulted in a reduction
in the costs. Most commercial production of broilers is situated in the
central plateau near Mexico City and in the FD, although such production in
the irrigated northwest is gaining in importance. Poultry numbers, which
remained almost stable until 1965, have increased rapidly since that time.
B. Crops and Irrigation
13.       Crop production under the Fourth Project will be largely concen-
trated on farms that either now are irrigated or that can be improved with
deep wells and related water facilities. Most of the public investments for
agricultural development are still being devoted to irrigation works.
0



APPENDIX 1-1

This heavy emphasis on water facilities development is supported by the fact
that the present total irrigated area of 4.1 million ha represents only about
one-third of the cropland area that can, potentially, be irrigated. Much of
the 61% of all cropland area that is devoted to corn and beans is located in
the rainfed areas. More intensive extension and applied research efforts are
required, along with long-term investment credit, in order to increase yields
and diversify these traditional farming practices.
14.       Only 7.4% of all farms in Mexico (including ejidataris parcels)
are classified as "modern", 40.1% are classified as "traditional" (i.e.
using traditional methods but producing substantial amounts of cash crops);
while the remaining 52.5% are classified as "subsistence" farms (producing
very little for the cash market). The "modern" farm is larger; income per
hectare is four times that of the "subsistence" farm; and most of the modern
farmers have irrigation, and use fertilizers and improved seed. Most of the
corn and beans are produced by the relatively poor traditional and subsist-
ence farmers, while the modern farmers produce most of the cotton, sorghum,
wheat, sugarcane, fruits, and vegetables.
15.       The Government plans to extend irrigation over an additional area
of 1,000,000 hectares during the next five years and considers that the SRH
(Ministry of Tlydraulic Resources) has the capability of handling such a
load. Highest priority is being given to the extension of the Rio Sinaloa
project and development of the Panuco and Papaluapan Basins. The SRH also
is placing special emphasis on the construction of small-scale irrigation
facilities to benefit groups of ejidatarios or similar communities of low-
income landowners. This so-called "community development" effort is of
particular importance in connection with the Low-Income Producers Sub-Project.
16.       Another SRH program effort is of fundamental importance to this
Project.  This program is called Plamepa (Plan de Mejoramiento Parcelario)
and it aims to reduce waste in the use of water, and to improve and diversify
agricultural practices. Since 1967 the Plamepa program has been expanded to
cover 130,000 hectares but the Government now comtemplates a much more rapid
expansion, with IDB financing. The on-farm use of water is notably defici-
ent in Mexico. The Plamepa program, which entails close cooperation with
the public agricultural credit banks, will have a most important bearing on
the future impact of this Bank Project.
Cotton
17.       Although Mexico's cotton production has recovered somewhat from
a 1970 low of 1.44 million bales the current harvest of 1.71 million bales
is still short of the 2.58 million bale 1965 production. With the prospect
of declining prices during the mext several years and with competition from
other crops, the official projections for cotton (1976 and 1982) indicate
that the 1965 production levels will not be repeated. The causes of this
.



APPENDIX 1-1
Page 6
decline are well documented:  severe cutback of the area planted in rainfed
areas due to declining fertility, rising costs, and the like competition from
wheat, sorghum and vegetable oils which enjoy high support prices (Appendix
1-2); and the almost complete withdrawal from cotton production in the northeast,
which is closeest to ocean shipping ports. The most serious cutback, however,
has come in the rainfed areas, which declined from 40% (in 1965) to less than
16% of the harvested area. Continuous production in these areas has led to
serious pest problems, declining yields and great risks of crop failure. In
fact, in some areas the Government has stopped offering crop insurance, thus
causing farmers to turn to other crops like sorghum, for which insurance and
price supports are available.
18.       In irrigation districts, the cutback in area planted to cotton has
been less marked than in rainfed areas, inspite of the counter attractions
of price-supported cereal and oil seed crops which offer little risk. How-
ever, pest and disease control costs have also increased because of inade-
quate crop rotations, the continuous frowing of small number of varieties,
and inefficient spraying techniques. The cost of fertilizers and pesticides
(including application) now make up roughly 40% of cotton production costs
in many cotton farming areas. Seasonal labor shortages have also contributed
to the decline.
19.       Cotton growing is now concentrated in the most appropriate areas,
although some high-risk cotton will continue to be grown by rainfed farmers,
with unpredictable results.  Intensive investigation is currently underway
though to find ways of boosting cotton production, and FONDO's technical
services and credit facilities are assured of playing a key role in any pro-
gram devised.
Fruits and Vegetables
20.       Mexico shows great promise as an important producer of fruits and
vegetables for export, as well as for the rapidly growing domestic market.
Over 30 fruits are now rated as commercially important and, while tomatoes
are currently the outstanding vegetables a number of others are also gaining
importance. Fruits are being produced by about 50,000 farmers on about
3.3% of the total cultivated area (some 511,000 ha); yet they account for
close to 20% of total crop value. Annual fruit production is valued at more
than Mex $6 million. Although the citrus fruits and bananas now cover half
of the total orchard area, avocado, strawberries, mango, melons, papaya,
guava, pecans, apples and others are of grow-ing importance. The comparative
advantages of fruits over annual crops may be seen from the following data:

The employment aspect of fruit production is of particular importance in
Mexico.  The average orchard requires an estimated 123 man days per ha
versus 50 man days per ha for annual crops.  Additionally, industrialization
of fruit in 1966 involved 370 plants and 30,000 employees.
21.       In 1970, total agricultural exports to the US came to US$513 mil-
lion, of which nearly 40% was for fruits and vegetables. The major export
commodity was tomatoes, due essentially to the fact that Mexico can produce
vine-ripe tomatoes at about one-third the cost of production in Florida.
Appreciable volumes of peppers, cucumbers, onions were also exported and
three important foreign food processors have recently become involved in
asparagus, partly, however, at the expense of strawberry production.

MEXICO
FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Markets and Marketing
1.        Mexico's population is presently growing at about 3.4% per annum
and per capita income by about 3.0% per annum. Assuming an income elasticity
of demand of about 0.37, this results in approximately a 4.5% annual increase
in the quantity of food demanded. The expanding domestic market should
readily absorb most of the expected incremental Project production (Table 2).
This is true of beef, milk, eggs, broilers, pork, and tree crops. Most of
the incremental production of feeder cattle and cotton would be exported.
Beef Cattle
2.        The domestic market comprises local markets and the large urban
centers. The Federal District (FD) of Mexico City is the most important,
and, although it has only about 13Z of Mexico's population, approximately
one-third of all meat is consumed there. In attempting to better satisfy
the urban markets at acceptable price levels, the Government has, in the
past, resorted to interfering with the free market mechanism. The inter-
ference has taken two forms:  (a) price controls on beef at the wholesale
0            and retail levels; and (b) requirement that exporters of boneless beef and
feeder cattle send a quota of live cattle, based on the volume of exports,
to the FT and other urban centers. The situation in the FD was further
complicated by the monopoly position of the municipal abattoir (Ferreria) 1/.
Quotas are also applied by the Government to the quantities of boneless
beef and male feeder cattle that can be exported.
3.        An ideal situation in beef marketing would exist in Mexico if the
northern areas were free to export their feeder cattle to the United States
at prevailing lucrative price levels and if the domestic market could be
satisfied from tropical areas. Realization of this situation, however, has
so far been prevented by the inability of tropical areas to satisfy domestic
markets at acceptable price levels.
4.        The trend in marketing is toward the above, or free market, system.
In 1966, the monopoly of the Ferreria in slaughtering cattle for the FD was
broken by the Government, due to the pressure of producers and allegations
of mismanagement. Following this, ranchers in the states of Tabasco and
Veracruz started to slaughter their own cattle and to sell directly to
wholesalers and retailers in the FD, a practice that has prevented the
Ferreria from reasserting a monopoly position. As the supply of beef to
the FD has improved, the Government has relaxed its enforcement of price
controls and quotas, and, when the tropical areas are capable of assuring
1/   The official name of the abattoir is Industrial de Abastos, S.A. but it
G   -    is commonly known as Rastro de Ferreria.



APPENDIX 1-2
Page 2
an adequate beef supply sufficient to satisfy domestic demand at acceptable               0
price levels, Government intends to eliminate them completely. Consequently,
the best way to rationalize the Mexican beef marketing system is to boost
production in the tropical areas. The recent IBRD-supported Livestock and
Agricultural Development Projects had this as a primary objective, and the
proposed Project would continue the effort. Furthermore, the Project would
help the marketing of beef by providing funds and technical services for
slaughterhouses in tropical areas. Elsewhere in the country, main slaughter-
ing facilities appear adequate.
5.        The ban on the export of females is a disincentive to production
in northern areas but its permanent removal will come only when the domestic
market is fully independent of supplies from the northern areas. Generally,
the ban is rigidly enforced, except in drought years like 1969/70 when the
export of 242,000 females was authorized.
6.        Mexico is the third largest exporter of frozen beef to the United
States. In 1971, boneless beef exports to that market amounted to 41,360
metric tons, down from 50,933 metric tons in 1970. On June 26, 1972, the
United States suspended, for the rest of 1972, the quota system on beef
imports and, because of rapidly rising meat prices in the United States,
the President of that country recently suspended quotas on beef imports for
the remainder of 1973. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the future
of this market means that ranchers and meat processors in Mexico have to
greatly discount any future growth prospects.
7.       ?hexico is the largest exporter of feeder cattle (male weaners) to
the United States and, since the United States imposes no quota, opportunities
for expansion are excellent.
Milk
S.        Mexico imports large quantities of dairy products, particularly
evaporated and non-fat dried milk. The value of imported evaporated and
condensed milk reached Mex$120 million in 1970 and averaged about Mex$100
million for the years 1966-70. Milk is subject to official retail price
controls and the official controlled price for first-class milk in the FD,
Mexico's principal milk market, is Mex$2.20 per liter. In 1964, milk
producers sought and obtained a "temporary" court injunction against selling
at the official prices. This injunction, which is still in effect, has
enabled milk prices in the FD to reach a level close to the free market
level. The current retail price in the Fl) is about Mex$2.60 per liter for
first-class milk and about Mex$2.25 per liter for second class.
9.        Government regulations, originating 20 years ago, stipulate that
first-class milk must be pasteurized on the farms producing it, but in the
past, this led to a proliferation of uneconomic sized plants. Although the
law is still in existence, special exemptions are granted by the Secretaria
de Sanidad, Salubridad y Assistencia, who is charged with administering the
law.

APPENDIX 1-2
Page 3
10.       The milk marketing system, despite its limitations, is evolving
toward a rational system, mainly from the pressure of producer organizations
that have entered the field in recent years. Many cities and towns are in
need of good quality, reasonably priced milk, and the Project, by supporting
pasteurization plants, credits and technical services to dairy farm producers,
and research into cheaper production systems, would play a vital role in
helping to provide this essential commodity to more and more Mexicans.
Pork
11.       Pork to supply the FD originates mainly in the Central Plateau,
although production is increasing in the grain producing areas.  National
demand is growing rapidly as is production despite the high feed grain
prices, because producer profit margins are normally good. The present
marketing system is satisfactory for the Project.
Eggs
12.       Production resulting from the Project can easily be handled by the
present system. The Federal Government, however, should carefully study the
barriers to growth and rationalization of the industry arising from the
tendency of states to protect their own producers by impeding the free move-
ment of eggs across state boundaries. The Project would support egg packing
plants required to handle increased production in the years ahead.
Broilers
13.       Until 1969, it was illegal for private processing plants to supply
broilers to the FD. That ban has been lifted and private plants now exist
in the FD as well as in Hermosillo, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The monopoly
position held until 1969 by the Ferreria in the FD broiler market was a
serious disincentive to increased production, and it led to inefficiencies
in marketing, especially by strengthening the position of middlemen. Even
today, the producer is effectively barred by the middlemen from selling
directly to processors. The inevitable result is high marketing costs from
the producer to the retailer.
14.       Poor presentation of broilers to the consumer is recognized as a
deterrent to market penetration, but, in January 1970, a law was passed to
regulate the quality of broilers offered to the public and to eliminate
abuses.
15.       The industry at the producer level is high cost and fragmented.
Many of the producers lack the technical and business ability to manage a
flock of sufficient numbers to realize all economies of size, but large
integrated production and processing units are beginning to emerge. Such
units would have the market power to transform the system and to survive if
prices decline. The profit margins of these large integrated units are wide
and their ability to offer a standard superior product directly to retail
outlets is appealing, especially to supermarkets.

16.       The Project would support production units that have good possi-               0
bilities of low cost efficient production. Integrated production and pro-
cessing plants would be preferred because of their greater chances of sur-
vival should a serious price decline occur.
Cotton
17.       Mexican strict middling cotton (1-1/16"') lias always had ready
acceptance on world markets because of good quality.  Most is hand picked
and is grown in arid climates. Major markets are Japan and Europe. The
increased export availability likely to arise from the Project -- about
300,000 bales -- would not even enable Mexico to reach its former export
level of 1.8 million bales in 1965, since it had fallen to 1.0 million by
1970 (Table 3). World cotton prices are projected to decline by approxi-
mately 15% during the 1970's but Mexican cotton exports would still be
competitive (Annex 11).
18.       Mexico's cotton marketing system is efficient.  Ginning charges,
although rising, are low because of the large volume handled per gin, low
cost labor, and low tare.  Storage is not normally needed by handlers because
of the usually dry climate and quick disposal of the cotton crop. Further-
more, keen competition among merchants and low labor charges make it possible
to keep the cost of moving cotton from gin to shipside at a minimum.
Wheat, Corn, Sorghum, Vegetable Oilseeds, and Beans
19.       All these crops have Government-guaranteed minimum prices to the
producer, which assures a market for Project production (Table 4). Presently,
the prime responsibility for these programs rests with the Compania Nacional
de Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), in cooperation with agricultural banks
and the Government's grain storage corporation, Almacenes Nacionales de
Deposito, S.A. (ANDSA). ANDSA has increased its capacity from 80,000 to
about 4 million tons in the past 30 years, and there is a private grain
storage capacity of close to 3 million tons. To further help grain market-
ing, the Project would support some on-farm storage facilities, especially
in conjunction with expanded livestock production.
2n.       Sorghum is the main feedgrain whose production is expected to
increase significantly under the Project. Sorghum production has doubled
since 1966 but market prices are still above the guaranteed price, as in-
creasing quantities are demanded for milk, pig, and poultry industry expansion.
Fruits and Vegetables
21.       The importance of Mexico as a supplier of fresh vegetables and
fruits to the U.S. markets has increased in recent years.  This trend should
continue for a number of commodities, although Mexico's projected future
capacity to supply export demands is not assured.

22.       Tomatoes continue to be the most important vegetable, with ex-
ports valued at around US$100 million per year, and Mexico is now supply-
ing over half of the fresh winter tomatoes (December to May season) being
marketed in the U.S. Costs of production and marketing have been rising in
both countries but more so in the U.S. (Florida), thereby strengthening
Mexico's advantage. Mexico should continue to increase exports of vine-
ripe tomatoes, while Florida production will probably decline. The total
U.S. market for fruits and vegetables is now close to US$200 million per
year.
23.       It is expected that Mexico will also find an increasing U.S.
market, especially for winter cucumbers, fresh peppers, and eggplant. More
recently, a few important foreign companies began to produce asparagus in
the Bahio region for the U.S. market, partly at the expense of strawberry
production.
24.       At present, the principal fruit exports are melons (mostly canta-
loupe) and strawberries, although potential markets exist for a rather
wide variety of other fruits (citrus, bananas, avocado, mango, tamarind,
guava, and such). Since U.S. production of cantaloupe is practically non-
existent during the cold months, Mexico enjoys a captive market in the
winter and early spring, despite rising costs of production and marketing.
Mexico also holds a comparative advantage over the U.S. in strawberries, so
that this export market should continue to expand.

According to Bank of Mexico projections the 1982 total cotton production value will be almost equal to
the 1968 value or about 3.5 billion pesos. In 1982, however, the total demand for cotton, including
exports, is projected to reach 6.2 billion pesos; leaving a deficit of 2.6 billion pesos.

MEXICO
FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND EXTENSION
A. Introduction
1.        Mexico's agricultural education, research, and extension services
have been expanding steadily for the past five years and are now regarded
as among the best in Latin America. In general, however, they are still
insufficient to cope with the needs of anything but a small proportion of
Mexico's farmers. Nevertheless, they provide a good basis on which to plan
future expansion.
B. Agricultural Education Services
Higher Education
2.        There are 15 agricultural undergraduate schools in Mexico.  Of
these, five are major schools with a combined enrollment of about 6,600
students which this year will award about 1,150 Ingenieros Agronomos degrees.
Standards vary between schools, and, in many cases, laboratory and library
facilities are inadequate, but, in general, it can be said that the main
weakness of most schools is their failure to provide practical orientation.
Three of these schools have postgraduate courses, namely, the National
School of Agriculture at Chapingo, the Technical Institute of Monterrey,
and the "Antonio Narro" Superior School of Agriculture. Chapingo, the
biggest and oldest postgraduate school, has nine departments offering
Masters Degrees and two have recently begun offering Doctors Degrees. The
Chapingo Graduate School has 230 students and, to date, 207 Masters Degrees
have been granted. It is estimated that about 8,000 students have obtained
primary degrees from these schools and about 25%, or 1,550, are employed
by either public or private farm credit institutions.
3.        There are nine veterinary schools in Mexico, with a total enroll-
ment of about 4,200 undergraduate students, about 700 of whom are expected
to graduate this year. The only postgraduate school is located at the
Mexican National University. In total, there are about 3,000 qualified
veterinary scientists registered in Mexico, and the fact that most of them
work in the clinical and animal diseases fields and very few directly in the
field of animal production reflects the relative emphasis placed on these
topics in all undergraduate courses.
4.        Most of the agricultural and veterinary colleges are financed
from federal and state sources but, in general, the funds are insufficient
to allow for anything but modest expansion and in some cases are even in-
adequate for current needs. Considerable financial help is necessary to



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 2
equip these colleges (and perhaps establsih others) so that they will be
able to produce the numbers of qualified personnel required to assist in the
urgently needed expansion of the country's agricultural output. In most
cases, however, additional finances are not the only constraint to the
effectiveness of higher agriculture/veterinary education in Mexico. Courses
are often inadequate and unrelated to the needs of the country, and, as was
stated earlier, too little emphasis is placed on practical studies which
are directly related to production problems.
5.        It is apparent that a study of the higher agricultural/veterinary
education in Mexico is needed and the terms of reference for any such work
should emphasize (a) reorganization of the system to best meet the rapidly
growing demands for agricultural products; (b) closer cooperation between
the various colleges, particularly those teaching agriculture and those
teaching veterinary science; and (c) closer cooperation between the various
federal and state organizations responsible for agricultural research, ex-
tension, credit, and land reform.
6.        The National Agricultural College is the best known and the biggest
of all the higher agricultural institutions in Mexico. Falling under the
administrative arm of SAG, it is unique, and, in addition to carrying out
its teaching programs, it also serves as a regional center for agricultural
research, training, demonstration, and extension. In this it has received
foreign support from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, USIAD, IDB, and
FAO/UNDP.  The FONDO has drawn heavily on Chapingo for recruiting its staff
and the college offers a special course for technicians from the FONDO and
public and private institutions associated with the FONDO program.  The
FONDO has also recently established a "residencia" at Chapingo to coordinate
activities of the various institutions engaged in agricultural and livestock
research and to promote the rapid application of relevant research findings
at the farm level.
Sub-professional Agricultural Education
7.        There are seven technical agricultural and livestock schools in
Mexico financed jointly by SAG and state governments. The student popula-
tion is about 2,400 and about 700 graduate yearly. These schools have
difficulty in finding and keeping competent staff, and employment opportun-
ities of the graduates within public and private institutions have been
limited because of a lack of appreciation of the role of sub-professionals
as technical assistants to augment the effectiveness of the better qualified
professional graduate employees. This situation, however, is now changing
within the FONDO, which proposes to employ a number of sub-professional
agricultural technicians to work under the direction of its experienced
professional credit agronomists. If this trial is successful in releasing
the professional for more on-farm advisory work, the FONDO could become an
important employer of the sub-professional agriculturalist.
8.        In addition to technical training, vocational courses in farm and
livestock husbandry are available at 159 secondary schools where three-year
courses are given in farming, livestock husbandry, or the handling and



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 3
maintenance of farm machinery and equipment.  Unfortunately, qualified
teachers are few and these schools suffer from lack of facilities, partic-
ularly those needed to teach livestock husbandry.
C. Research and Demonstration
9.        The two major agricultural research institutions in Mexico are the
Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas (INIA) and the Instituto
Nacional de Investigaciones Pecuarias (INIP). Both are located in SAG,
administered respectively by the Under Secretaries of Agriculture and Live-
stock, but there is little coordination between them. Some research
specifically related to the activities of a number of other institutions
such as the National Forestry Service, Institute for Improvement of Sugar
Production, Mexican Coffee Institute, Ministry of Hydraulic Resources (SRIH),
the Center for Agrarian Research, and the Mexican Institute of Technological
Research is also carried out, and programs are underway at a number of
universities, mainly at those with graduate schools. The Rockefeller Founda-
tion has given significant support to agricultural research in Mexico since
1943, and has provided a demonstration and training function over the past
25 years which has influenced greatly the establishment and expansion of
most of the research institutions at present in existence, particularly
IIA and INIP.  Government plans to continue to support both these institu-
tions and proposes a growth rate of about 20% for at least the next few
years.
Crop Research
10.       Most of the research to date in this field has been concentrated
in the irrigated areas, with little being done in the more extensive dry
land regions. INIA has started to correct this imbalance, however, and now
has eight regional research centers and 35 experimental stations, compared
with six regional centers and 21 experimental stations in 1969. All are
located in the main ecological areas of the country. The centers and ex-
perimental stations carry out research in genetics, plant pathology, entom-
ology, soils and fertilizers, and general agronomy in relation to a wide
range of cereal, horticultural, oil seeds, forage, and pasture crops. Of
the present research staff of 456 graduates, 32 are Ph.D.'s, 55 M.Sc.'s,
and the remainder are Ingenieros Agronomos. INIA's budget, which increased
from Mex$43 million in 1969 to Mex$75 million in 1972, is expected to rise
a further 35% in 1973.
11.       The Rockefeller Foundation made a particularly outstanding con-
tribution to Mexican agricultural research in the breeding and development
of basic food cereal crops. Its high yielding Mexican-bred wheats, for
example, are rapidly replacing traditional lower yielding wheats in many
countries. In maize breeding also, the high lysine varieties bred in
Mexico hold the promise of improved nutritional standards in the lower
income sectors of many countries where maize is the staple food. In spite
of this excellent work, however, it is alarming to note that in 1971 only



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 4
30% of the wTheat and 9% of the maize areas in Mexico were planted with im-
proved seeds.  Of concern also is the fact that, in 1972, Mexico once again
became a net importer of wheat and maize after a number of years as a net
exporter. A major reason for this is that farmers in the dry farming areas
have been much less ready to accept improved seeds than have farmers with
irrigation, which indicates that more studies are needed on seed adaptability
to non-irrigated areas before a change can be expected.
12.       While it is recognized that Mexican crop research has achieved much
over the past decade, it has been deficient in a number of important areas.
Relatively little work, for example, has been done on the adaptation and
-Ltegration of individual research findings into farming systems within the
context of the needs of Mexican agriculture. This work not only involves
the quantification of the effects of new inputs (such as seeds and fertil-
izers) on outputs in physical and financial terms, but their integration
into the crop (and perhaps pasture) rotation patterns which will ensure and
sustain a high level of production while maximizing returns. Such programs
are needed in both rainfed and irrigation areas. Also, in the irrigation
areas, much more work needs to be done on on-farm water reticulation systems,
layout, and designs. Quantitative data is also needed on the efficiency of
water use expressed in terms of yields per unit of water applied, since the
supply of water is a major limiting factor in almost all of the irrigation
districts in the country.
13.       With the growing support being given to IMLA by Government, it is
apparent that this organization is going to assume an increasingly important
role in performing the country's agricultural research.  It would be unwise,
however, to try to push expansion beyond the capacity to recruit and train
a high caliber staff since the quality of work depends more on the quality
of staff than on its size. In this context, it is therefore essential that
the proportion of Ph.D. and M.Sc. graduates be increased. However, because
it is doubtful that existing graduate schools will be able to fulfill all
these needs immediately, adequate funds for overseas scholarships will be
needed for some time.
14.       INIA should also put much more effort into production-oriented
research, both in crops and animals, planning its programs so that they are
closely coordinated with the research activities of other institutions,
particularly INIP, SRH, and FONDO. Finally, INIA should maintain a close
relationship with the country's extension services to ensure (a) the rapid
application of research findings at the farm level, and (b) an effective
clhannel for rapid feedback of production problems on which to base research
programs more closely related to the needs of the farmer.
Livestock Research
1,.       INIP is the major organization responsible for Mexican livestock
research. It currently has a professional staff of 130 (including five
Ph.D.'s and 15 Masters) whose expertise includes genetics, nutrition, re-
production, forage and pasture management, diseases and parasites, extension,
economics, seriology, and the routine production of vaccines. In addition



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 5
to the main Palo Alto laboratories in Ilexico City, field facilities are
provided at 10 experimental stations located in most of the major animal
production areas in the country. The institute budget expanded significantly.
from Mex$5 million in 1965 to Mex$50 million in 1972, while the proposed
expenditure for 1973 is Mex$60 million. Even so, the resources of INIP fall
far short of meeting the research needs of the livestock suhsector. In
addition to financial constraints, INTP's programs in the past have been
oriented mainly to the fields of preventive medicine vaccine production and
genetics, and, with the exception of poultry, little has yet been done in
the study of animal production/management problems more closely related to
irmediate farm or ranch needs.
16.       The lack of data from soundly designed and executed production-
oriented research is far more serious with livestock than with crops.  Of
highest priority is research in the wet and dry tropical regions, where,
based on experience from similar environments in other tropical countries
(notably Australia), production of beef and milk could be increased many
times through better use of pasture, involving both the introduction of new
species and more efficient management of existing pastures. Although a
start has been made by FONDO, INIA, and INIP, with simple trials to test new
legumes and grasses and observe major fertilizer responses, there is an
urgent need for more critical studies to quantify animal production responses
from improved and natural pastures. This involves studying the interactions
between soil, plant, and animal under a wide range of conditions and develop-
ing new pasture management techniques which will sustain production at the
highest and most economic level.
17.       A few well designed and managed stocking rate experiments to
measure the production potential of sown and natural pastures under various
fertilizer regimes would provide most of the data needed to establish a
basis for making more specific recommendations on new production/management
svstems to farmers and ranchers. Many facilities are already available to
execute this work, particularly if the resources of INIA, INIP, and FONDO
were coordinated. INIA and INIP have adequate field stations located within
the wet and dry tropics at which these experiments could be carried out and
both institutions and FONDO have sufficient pasture agronomists, who, with
a minimum of help in initial experimental designs and establishment, would
be fully capable of executing these studies. Thus, under the proposed
Project, funds have been allocated to establish about 1,000 ha of grazing
trials and to set up a supporting plant nutrition unit.  Provision has also
been made to retain the services of a tropical pasture/animal production
expert and a plant nutrition specialist as consultants.
18.       It is proposed that the work be carried out as a collaborative
effort between INIA, INIP, and FONDO and that the funds, which should be
provided bv Government as an interest-free grant, be administered by FONDO,
with the research studies being a part of the normal programs of INIA and
INIP. The workc would be organized through the new FONDO technical coordi-
nation "residencia" at Chapingo (para 6). The conduct of these studies would



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 6
bring additional benefits in that the resources of the three institutions
would be concentrated in a large collaborative program for the first time,
and there would be valuable opportunities for training research and exten-
sion technicians in the performance of production studies.
Role of FONDO in Livestock Research and Demonstration
19.       Although its activities in these fields are minor relative to its
main function as a crediit cum technical service institution, FONDO has carried
out a number of important programs with its own staff and resources to provide
technical information needed for better servicing of farmers and ranchers
participating in the Project. The most outstanding has been a research pro-
gram on low cost calf rearing in the arid, semi-arid, and temperate dairy
regions with the objective of encouraging farmers to rear their own calves
and thereby reduce the need to continue the currently large and costly im-
portation of milk cows. The cost of this program, designed and executed by
a young FONTDO nutrition specialist, has been less than US$200,000, which is
small compared with the potential benefits. If the results of the work were
applied countrywide, involving a number of similar calf-rearing ce-nters,
the annual savings to the dairy industry would be at least US$25 million.
This is a prime example of the value of well designed and executed production-
oriented studies.
20.       In addition to its tropical pasture program in the wet and dry
tropics, FONDO has also supported the establishment of The Mexican Society
of Animal Production's Training Center for Animal Production by financing
k.ey staff and some facilities.  Although this support has been of great
assistance, it nonetheless has fallen far short of that provided for in
the Third Project, in which it was envisaged that FONDO would assume the
major responsibility for equipping and developing the Center through free
grants. Unless more help is forthcoming, therefore, it is unlikely that
the Center will be able to provide effectively the much needed training
facilities in tropical pasture/animal management for FONDO technicians as
planned.
21.       FONDO is also in the process of establishing two farms to demon-
strate new techniques for dairy and crop production in wet and dry tropical
regions. One of these is located on an ejido in Tabasco and the other in
the LIPSP project area at Altamirano. It is proposed that the latter, being
set tip in collaboration with SRH, serve as a center for the study of low
cost farm building methods, pastures, and tropical dairy cross-breeding
programs as yet untried in Mexico, as well as for the training of technicians
and ejidatarios.
D. Agricultural Extension
22.       Extension services in Mexico are provided by the Federal and State
Agricultural Extension Services, SRH, the FONDO, and other associated public
and private credit institutions. In the specialized irrigation areas pro-
ducing fruits and vegetables, the larger farmers also often employ their



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 7
own professionals to provide technical services for their operations. Ex-
tension services, however, are still inadequate to meet the needs of Mexico's
2.82 million farmers. The Federal Service, the biggest of these, now has
about 1,840 officers, 1,500 of which are graduates in either agriculture
or veterinary science and 340 are sub-professionals, but these numbers are
sufficient to service effectively only a very small percentage of the
agricultural sector. SRH extension services are concentrated specifically
in irrigation areas, while the FONDO, with 397 graduate credit technicians,
and the associated public and private credit institutes, with about the
same number, provide planning and supervisory sercices to farmers receiving
credits under the FONDO programs.
23.       Government has realized the need for improving its extension
services and last year increased the budget for the Federal Service by 88%.
The service was also reorganized within SAG, raising it to the Directorate
General level, and a new highly qualified director was appointed. Addition-
ally, extension workers' salaries have been made more competitive within
the agricultural profession, which should reduce the high turnover of staff,
a serious obstacle to building an efficient organization.
24.       To date extension services of both SAG and SRII have been concen-
trated in the irrigation areas, while the dry land and cropping and ranch-
ing areas have been relatively neglected. The FONDO and its associated
public and private credit institution technicians have also tended to be
concentrated in the centers of highest agricultural production although
services are provided in all areas of the country where FONIDO farm credit is
disbursed.
25.       In general, the existing extension services have not been suf-
ficiently effective in introducing new production techniques and management
methods, even among the farmers with whom technicians have worked.  An
important reason for this has been the large proportion of inexperienced
young staff in the ranks of the SAG and SRH services resulting from the
high turnover rate of professional staff.  Lack of transport for field
officers has also been a serious drawback, particularly in the SAG service,
but this is now being corrected by the introduction of a scheme whereby SAG
officers will be helped to purchase vehicles and paid mileage when on duty.
26.       Although the problems mentioned have not been serious within the
FONDO service, which is recognized as having the best team of credit/exten-
sion specialists in the country, its performance to date in extending new
production and management technology to its borrowers has been disappointing.
It was shown in a recent survey that the investment of more than US$250
million, under the First and Second Livestock and Agriculture Projects,
had a marked impact on increasing production and profits, but these gains
were "primarily as a result of scale of expansion rather than improved
production efficiency" (Annex 5). There is little doubt that they would
have been even greater had the FONDO technicians devoted more time to
technical supervision. Although most FONDO technicians recognize this
shortcoming and would like to do more technical/advisory work with borrowers,



APPENDIX 1-3
Page 8
they are restricted because of the burden of administrative and routine
responsibilities.  Many also complain of the lack of sound quantitative in-
formation, applicable to their districts, on which to base their recommenda-
tions. The FONDO administration is slowly realizing the significance of
these findings and has taken some steps to correct the situation. The
recruiting of sub-professionals to help the graduate technicians (para 7)
is one of these. Also, the FONDO has become directly involved in a number
of research and demonstration programs, mainly low cost calf rearing and
tropical pasture development, directly related to the needs of its program.
27.       To summarize, it is apparent that there is an urgent need for
goaatly expanded and better coordinated extension services in Mexico. Recent
moves by Government to upgrade SAG and provide better facilities are promising
as are also the moves being made to achieve better coordination between FONDO,
SAG, and SRP. However, these improvements, which are yet to be put into ef-
fect, will have little lasting impact unless SAG and SRH are prepared to (a)
offer career opportunities of trained agricultural professionals equal at all
times to alternative fields; (b) improve in-service training opportunities and
facilities; and (c) maintain closer contract with agricultural and veterinary
education and research services and influence them to becoming more closely
oriented to the priority needs of Mexican agriculture.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
FONDO DE GARANTIA Y FOMENTO PARA LA
AGRICULTURA, GANADERIA Y AVICULTURA
A. Objectives and Powers
1.        The Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la Agricultura, Ganaderia y
Avicultura (FONDO) was established in 1955 by the Government of Mexico
(Government) to provide a combination of funds and technical assistance
necessary to make agricultural and livestock development effective in Mexico.
FONDO is empowered to:
(a) extend loans to private credit institutions and regional
Banco Agropecarios (regional BANAGROs) so that they may,
in turn, grant credit to livestock and agricultural
producers;
3                  (b)  rediscount paper of private credit institutions and
regional BANAGROs, representing loans of all maturities
to such producers;
(c) guarantee the repayment of loans that private credit
institutions and regional BANAGROs may grant to such
producers; and
(d) carry out such other operations as may be necessary in
the furtherance of livestock and agricultural development.
2.        Because it was determined that lending operations should be con-
ducted on a business-like basis, private banks were designated, at the outset,
as channels for FONDO. In 1965, the first regional BANAGROs were authorized
to use FONDO rediscounting facilities.
3.        In August 1972, concomitant with its stepped-up program for develop-
ment of ejidatarios and other low-income producers, Government created the
Special Fund for Technical Assistance and Guarantee for Agricultural Credits
(FEGA). The purpose of FEGA is:
(a) to organize, provide, and defray the cost of identification
evaluation, technical assistance, and supervision services
required for agricultural production projects designed to
improve income of ejidatarios and small-holders, and;



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(b)  to guarantee the recovery of up to 60%, and in special                         0
cases, 80%, of principal balances due and unpaid of farm
loans granted by private credit institutions for projects
that are appraised as technically feasible and economically
viable and supervised as provided for under (a) above.
The Government has started FEGA with a contribution of Mex$25 million (US$2.0
million).
B. Organization and Management
4.        In general, policies and regulations are set for FONDO by a Techni-
cal Committee composed of ten members: one representative each from the
iMinistry of Finance and Public Credit; the Ministry of Agriculture and Live-
stock; the Banco de Mexico (BANXICO); the National Bank for Foreign Commerce;
the Banco Nacional Agropecuario (the holding company for regional BANAGROs
headquartered in Mexico City); the National Insurance Company for Agriculture
and Livestock; the Bankers' Association; and a representative each of farmers,
ranchers, and ejidatarios. However, those policies and regulations concerning
the operations of the IBRD-assisted projects and those financed with IDB help
(Special Fund) are determined by a smaller Technical Committee composed of
six members: two from the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, two from
the Banco de Mexico, one from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, and
one from the Banco Nacional Agropecuario.
5.        On the other hand, policies and regulations for FEGA are set
by a Technical. Committee of ten members: two from the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, and one each from the lfinistry of Agriculture and Livestock,
BANXtICO, Banco Nacional Agropecuario, Banco Ejidal, Banco Agricola, the
National Insurance Company for Agriculture and Livestock, the National Fund
for Ejidal Development, and the National Farmers Federation.
6.        Fnhe powers of the technical committees for the lending activities
of the FONDO (paras 1 and 4) are:
(a)  to authorize the kind and scope of operations, in general;
(b)  to establisn interest rates, premia, and other charges to
be collected on all transactions;
(c)  to approve the annual expenditure budget; and
(d) to exercise such other powers as may be entrusted to them
by lawful decrees, contracts, or trust agreement.
0



ANNEX 2
Page 3
7.        The powers of the Technical Committee for FEGA involve the
following:
(a) formulation of rules to govern FEGA's operations;
(b) examination and approval of the annual expenditure budget,
the programs and cost of technical services, and the
expenses incurred in implementing FEGA's guarantee
operations;
(c) specifying the general conditions under which agreements
to be signed by the trustee (in this case, BANXICO) for
the fulfullment of the purposes of the trust; and
(d) such other powers as may be entrusted to it by Government.
8.        The administration of FONDO's activities (including that of the
Special Fund and FEGA) is under the general supervision of BANXICO, as
trustee.  The FONDO has its own office facilities and personnel, and opera-
tions are carried out under the immediate responsibility of a full-time
director. He is assisted by two sub-directors: one in charge of general
services (administration, accounting, and statistics) and another in charge
of technical services and assistance. Two technical coordinators serve
under the latter sub-director: one in charge of three groups of experts in
the head office (agriculture, livestock, and agro-industries), and another
in charge of the FONDO's network of field offices. A Division of Planning
and Operations functions immediately under the director and is responsible
for studies. All personnel appointments are made by BANXICO, and FONDO
employees enjoy the same benefits as those allowed BANXICO employees. FONDO's
organization chart appears in WB5553(2R), while an organogram, showing the
functions of the various FONDO units, is given in WB5552(2R).
9.        FONDO's head office is in Mexico City.  In the field, it maintains
an adequate network of 70 offices and agencies, supervised by six regional
offices.
C. Technical Services
10.       Because of its commitment to technical evaluation of and assistance
to farm projects, FONDO has vigorously pursued expansion of its technical
staff. From a total of about 135 technicians of varying agricultural dis-
ciplines in 1965, the staff rose steadily: to about 200 by December 1968,
to 320 in November 1970, and to 465 in November 1972. Three hundred and
ninety two, or 84% of the total, are assigned to field offices. FONDO
recruits about 50 to 55 top university graduates per year, who then undergo
training, with emphasis on agricultural credit, before assuming their duties.
Likewise, seminars and short courses are given to permanent staff and overseas
training provided to selected staff.

11.       Field technicians evaluate loans, verify borrower's use of loan
proceeds, and render technical advice and assistance. Loan evaluation in-
volves an examination of the borrower's operation before the contemplated
investments and an appraisal of the technology and management to be adopted
once the loan is made and also of the proposed investments to be made. At
present, 75% to 80%, on the average, of a field technician's time is involved
in loan evaluation.
D. Lending Operations and Source of Funds
12.       FONDO makes short-, medium-, and long-term loans in three areas of
operations:
(a) the ALPRO (Alliance for Progress) Program, financed from
USAID and IDB loans, which provides medium- and long-term
funds to low-income farmers and ejidatarios at relatively
low rates of interest;
(b) IBRD-assisted projects (Loans 430-ME, 610-ME, and 747-ME),
which provide medium- and long-term finance for all types
of farm and agro-industry investments at market rates of
interest; and
(c)  short-term rediscounting program involving complementary
production finance to the first two programs.
ALPRO Program
13.       Under the ALPRO Program, loans are made only to borrowers that
engage in farming as a major activity; have farming assets of no more than
three times the amount of the loan (loans are limited to no more than
Mex$150,000, or in exceptional cases, up to Mex$250,000), and earn an annual
gross income of no more than Mex$100,000 (US$8,000). Loans are based on
technically and financially evaluated plans and are of 2 to 15 years maturity.
Primary borrowers pay 7.6% for loans, while participating credit institutions,
in turn, pay 4% to 4.6% on rediscount funds, depending on the portion of the
amount refinanced by FONDO. Rediscounts are limited to 70% to 90% of a loan
granted.
14.       The ALPRO Program has been assisted by two loans from USAID totalling
US$41.5 million:  the first one in 1963 for US$20 million, at 3/4 of 1% per
annum payable in 40 years and the other for US$21.5 million, in 1966, at 3.5%
per annum for 25 years. To continue the Program, IDB, in 1968, extended a
loan of US$20 million at 3% per annum for 25 years and another in 1971 for
US$32 million, also for 25 years at 3% per annum.

ANNEX 2
Page 5
15.       From the inception of the Program to September 30, 1972, a total
of about Mex$848.4 million (US$67.9 million) in rediscounts had been granted
to refinance primary loans of approximately Mex$942.7 million (US$75.4
million). Loan collections are being reloaned and outstanding loans under
the Program have remained at a more or less constant level of about Mex$450
to 500 million (US$36 to 40 million) during the last three years.
IBRD-assisted Projects
16.       Lending operations under projects assisted by Loans 430-ME, 610-ME,
and 747-HE are discussed in detail in Annex 5.
Short-Term Rediscounting Progran
17.       Projects assisted by FONDO must demonstrate ability to secure work-
ing capital. To this end, participating banks are encouraged by FONDO to
provide the short-term financing necessary and, accordingly, they operate a
rediscounting program designed to refinance such assistance. Rediscount
funds are at 6 to 8% per annum (depending on portion being rediscounted),
while loans to farmers are at no more than 12% per annum.
18.       Funds for short-term operations come mainly from rediscounts from
BANXICO and from collections of loans. The FONDO short-term rediscount
portfolio has been consistently increasing and reached about Mex$524 million
(US$41.9 million) on September 30, 1972, as compared to Mex$120 million on
December 31, 1966. This fact may be considered as evidence of production
growth in participating farms.
E. Financial and Operating Conditions
19.       Total income has grown as FONDO operations have expanded.  Whereas
in 1966 total income was only Mex$51.3 million, in 1969 it more than doubled
to Mex$106.3 million and almost quadrupled to Mex$185.1 million in 1971.
During the first three quarters of 1972, total income was Mex$167.2 million,
which should be about Mex$220 million for the entire year of 1972. Interest
from rediscounts is the main source of income and has constituted during the
last three years around 75 to 90% of the total.
20.       FONDO's expenses have, likewise, increased as its operations have
grown, with interest on money borrowed showing the most significant gain.
Whereas, in 1966, this item was only about 21% of total income during the last
three years, it has ranged from 52 to 59% of total income, due mainly to the
higher costs of funds from IBRD.  However, it is noteworthy that salaries
and employee benefits, inspite of maintained expansion of technical staff,
have remained at around 28 to 30% of total income.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
21.       FONDO operates as a low-profit organization in achieving the objec-
tives for which it was created. Total income has been sufficient to cover
expenses. Details of FONDO operations from January 1, 1968 to September 30,
1972, are shown in Appendix 2-1.
22.       FONDO is in good financial condition (Appendix 2-2).  Trust principal
(Government equity, including accumulated net income) has grown from Mex$120
million (US$9.6 million) on December 31, 1966, to Mex$264.7 million (US$21.2
million) on December 31, 1972.  The increase is due largely to contributions
by Government to the Special Fund (para 4) of about Mex$99.8 million during
1q66-72 after the original contribution of M1ex$5 million in 1965 (para 24).
23.       FONDO has not provided for possible losses from bad debts, but such
a provision is not deemed necessary because FONDO's risk assets represent
claims against sound banking institutions whose financial condition is periodi-
cally monitored by BANXICO. Moreover, the operations of these credit insti-
tutions (actually all Mexican banking institutions) are examined, under the
law, by the National Banking Commission. All FONDO rediscounts have been
paid at maturity.
24.       During fiscal years 1973 to 1977, which covers the proposed dis-
bursement period of the Fourth Project, FONDO's financial operating results
are expected to be maintained at least at the same level as in the past
(Appendix 2-3) and its financial condition to remain good (Appendix 2-4).
Government contributions will increase during this period and beyond because
of Government commitment to repay IBRD loans, with such repayments (which
FONDO would otherwise have made) to be considered as additional Government
contributions to the Special Fund.
25.       FONDO's accounting system is satisfactory.  Auditing is performed
by an independent unit responsible to the Auditing Department of BANXICO.
In addition the accounts are audited by an independent private auditing firm.

BANCO NACIONAL DE CREDITO EJIDAL, S.A.
A. Introduction
1.        The Banco National de Credito Ejidal (Banco Ejidal) was established
in 1935 by the Government of Mexico to provide funds as well as technical and
other assistance to ejidatarios. Its main functions are to:
(a) establish local credit societies, or ejidos, and finance,
through these societies, the agricultural and livestock
activities of ejidatarios;
(b) provide technical and economic guidance to ejidatarios,
while ensuring that their activities are in line with the
general aims of Government agricultural policy;
(c) facilitate the supply of farm inputs at minimum cost and
the disposal of farm produce at maximum prices; and
(d) establish agro-industries as may be desirable to maximize
the value of farm products and the returns to ejidatarios.
B.  Organization and Ianagement
2.        General policies and regulations are set by a Board of Directors,
headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and
composed of representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock,
the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Colonization, the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit, the Banco de Mexico, the National Bank for Foreign Com-
merce, and the Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola.
3.        The operations of Banco Ejidal are carried out under the direction
of a General Manager and an Assistant General Manager, who are assisted in
their administrative and planning duties by three recently established ad-
visory units: the Administrative Commission, the Organization Methods Unit
and the Programming Unit. Except for the Controller's Department, which
reports directly to the General Manager, all head office departments, branches,
agencies, and zone offices, as well as the three Bancos Agrarios (wholly-
owned subsidiaries of Banco Ejidal), report through the Assistant General
Manager.
4.        The Banco's assistance to ejidatarios is monitored largely by its
five operating departments: Credit, Organization, Commercial, Rural
Engineering, and Industrial Plants; while the service departments, i.e.,
Administration, Accounting, Data Processing, Economic Studies, Legal, and
Treasurer, are primarily engaged in performing staff functions.

C. Lending Operations and Sources of Funds
6.        The Banco Ejidal makes three basic types of loans, which may be
defined as follows:
(a) loans to Ejidos, or local credit societies:
(i)  Short-term agricultural production and livestock loans,
for periods not in excess of one year, to assist their
members in financing production expenses in seeds, fer-
tilizers, insecticides, irrigation water, small repairs
and the like;
(ii) Medium- and long-term agricultural and livestock loans
for land clearing, pasture improvement, small irrigation
works, plantations, silos, dwellings, machinery and
equipment, breeding stock and the like.
(b)  Working capital and investment loans to ejidos for the estab-
lishment, expansion, and operation of warehousing and indus-
trial processing facilities and for the establishment of
cattle fattening yards and the like.
Rate of Interest
7.        Until late 1972, the rate of interest applicable to all types of
loans was 10% per annum. In a few special cases, a higher or lower rate
might be charged, but only with the specific approval of the Board of Directors.
Now, however, the interest rate is 7.6% to conform with the legal rate to
low-income producers established by the Bank of Mexico.

Volume of Business
8.        The volume of business carried out by the members of the Banco
Ejidal system during the past four years was as follows:
1968     1969      1970     1971
(Millions of Mex$)
Short-term loans                    1,069    1,194    1,337    1,713
Medium- and long-term loans           172      246       374      428
TOTAL                         1         12440       7      2,141
Overdue Loans
9.        While the available information on overdue accounts is fragmentary,
recent data for the Banco Ejidal proper, exclusive of the Bancos Agrarios,
points to an improvement in the collection of loans over the past four years:

1968                     1,121             2,403          68.2
1969                     1,121             2,532         59.6
1970                     1,963             2,740          58.3
1971                     2,769             2,930          51.4
10.       Over the years, the Government has directed Banco Ejidal to make
credit funds available for projects, inspired by social or political consider-
ations, although it was realized at the outset by all concerned that such
advances would, at best, be only partially recovered. The present Government
has recognized that such projects should be financed by outright Government
grants and, furthermore, that farm development costs for such things as land
clearing and leveling, road construction, fencing, well digging and small
irrigation works ought, in the case of ejidatarios, to be financed from
Government subsidies. In line with this, an important land clearing and
development program (paras 20 and 21) has just been announced. These changes
in Government policy should be reflected in an improved loan collection rate
of Banco Ejidal, especially since the latter, under new management (para 22)
is also directing considerably more attention to the collection of due and
overdue loans. Future financial statements should, therefore, show a rapidly
reducing overdue loans balance.
Sources of Funds
11.       The volume of lending of Banco Ejidal is determined by the Bank
each year, in consultation with several Government ministries, on the basis
of analysis of farm plans and the availability of lending resources, and



ANNEX 3
Page 4
the figure must be approved by Government before it becomes final. Approxi-
mately 75% of the funds required by Banco Ejidal for short-term production
loans is borrowed (at 8% interest) from the Banco Nacional de Comercio
Exterior; 20% is obtained as a grant from the Government of Mexico; and 5%
represents the portion which must be re-deposited by borrowers. In the case
of funds required for the medium- and long-term lending program, main sources
are Government grants and borrowings from the private sector; these sources
are complemented by the Banco Ejidal's own resources.
D. Technical and Other Services to Ejidatarios
Technical Services
12.       The Banco Ejidal provides some technical assistance to ejidatarios
through its 1,774 field inspectors, only 133 of whom are qualified agrono-
mists. These inspectors are primarily engaged in loan-use supervision (ad-
vising the Banco when the various tranches of approved credits should be
disbursed and verifying the borrowers' use of loan proceeds) and they have
little time to devote to technical assistance activities. Other assistance
is provided by the Banco's Rural Engineering Department which helps Ejida-
tarios in solving technical problems associated with the mechanization of
their farm operations and with irrigation. Additionally, it guides ejida-
tarios in defining their requirements and provides training to some members
in the operation and maintenance of machinery and equipment, thus ensuring
satisfactory returns on investment. Finally, the newly formed Organization
Department is responsible for organizing and reorganizing local credit
societies.
Commercial Services
13.       The bank's Commercial Department assists borrowers in purchasing
inputs and equipment at minimum prices and in selling their produce at
maximum prices by eliminating dealers and other intermediaries. Data on
the volume of commercial business carried out by the Bank for ejidatarios
is not available, but losses on this activity have averaged Mex$3.5 million
per annum over the past four years.
Agro-industries
14.       In October 1972, 156 agro-industrial plants, either owned or
financed by Banco Ejidal, were engaged in processing the surplus production
of ejidatarios and nine additional plants were under construction. The most
important categories were as follows:
41 coffee plants               8 chile dehydrating plants
39 sisal plants                6 sugar mills
20 cotton seed plants          5 resin extraction plants
9 rice mills



ANNEX 3
Page 5
0           Some 70 of these units are now owned by associations of ejidatarios, which
have purchased them with the financial assistance of Banco Ejidal. It is
expected that, in time, the others will also be acquired by such associations.
15.       The volume of business of the bank-owned industrial units increased
from Mex$143 million in 1968 to Mex$174 million in 1971, and consistent net
losses over the period have averaged about 41% of gross income. A serious
effort is currently being made to reduce operating expenses and some indus-
trial units may be closed down as a result of the analysis of the operational
data which is presently being carried out.
E. Operating Results and Financial Condition
16.       Total banking income, other than that received as Government
subsidies, has fallen rather sharply since 1969. Interest earned and col-
lected is, of course, an important component and it is noteworthy that,
while the effective rate of interest on the bank's loans was 10% per annum,
interest collected, expressed as a percentage of the bank's total loans
outstanding (including overdue loans), fluctuated between only 2.4% and 3.5%
per annum during tihe 1968-72 period. In fact, the bank has not even collected
an interest of 10% on its "loans in good standing" during this period.  On
the other hand, interest paid by Banco Ejidal, expressed as a percentage of
the bank's commitments, fluctuated between 5.6% and 7.3%.  It can, there-
fore, be seen that unless considerably more vigor is exercised in the col-
lection of interest, uncollected earnings will continue to be a source of
considerable losses to the bank.
17.       Total banking expenses increased quite sharply from 1969 to 1971
due mainly to a substantial rise in the provision for bad debts. General
expenses have risen by about 50% during this period, but have not increased
in relation to the volume of business transacted. The operating data shown
for 1972 is not comparable to that for the previous four years because it
does not include information on the three Bancos Agrarios and also because
there is no provision for bad debts and depreciation.
18.       Total losses on banking operations have thus amounted to Mex$2,058
million in the four-year period 1968-71 and if Government subsidies shown
as banking income are added, the figure becomes Mex$3,218 million. Adding
losses from commercial and industrial operations, the total amounts to
Mex$3,504 million (US$280 million).
19.       Despite this, Banco Ejidal's net worth has risen, owing to sub-
stantial Government injection of equity funds. In the three-year period
1969 to 1971, Government equity contributions, totaling Mex$2,918 million,
brought the net worth position from Mex$(26) million at the end of 1968 to
Mex$1,382 million at the end of 1971. The reserve for losses in past-due
loans and other miscellaneous receivables which, at the end of 1971, cor-
responded to 69% of the value of these assets, is believed to be adequate
tQ cover probable-osses,.,



ANNEX 3

F.  Steps being Taken to Improve the Bank's Performance
20.       It is quite clear that the Banco Ejidal's main problem is its
unsatisfactory rate of loan collection. As mentioned earlier, one of the
principal reasons for the poor loan collection record is that the bank has
been called upon to finance, on a credit basis, agricultural programs which
the Government should have financed from subsidy funds. There is one hopeful
sign, however, that Government policies are becoming more realistic in this
regard. A National Land Clearing Program was recently announced that would
bring into agricultural production heretofore unproductive areas and entrust
them to groups of ejidatarios. Under this program, which will be administered
by Banco Ejidal, some 310,000 ha of timberland (including 124,000 ha in Oaxaca,
Jalisco and Nayarit) will be cleared in 1973 and a total of 1 million ha will
be cleared during the President's current term of office.
21.       The land clearing costs 1/ of the 1973 portion of this program will
be Mex$303 million, which will be paid for from Government budgetary re-
sources, as will the cost of complementary works (drains, access roads,
fences, grass planting, wells, sheds and the like) estimated at Mex$322 mil-
lion. The ejidos will thus receive it fully prepared and seeded and (in the
case of livestock producers) without having to incur any debt. Their bor-
rowing needs for machinery, cattle and such will then be met by Banco Ejidal
and will total an estimated Mex$433 million in medium-term credits, plus,
of course, short-term production loans as required.
22.       Some of the organizational, credit, data processing and administra-
tive reforms, which have taken shape during the past six months, while aimed
primarily at improving the general efficiency of the Banco, should help
considerably in improving its loan granting and collection and performance:
(a) A survey of the bank's present customers was carried out in
July and August 1972, to determine the financial position and
hence the borrowing capacity of ejidos and ejidatarios.
WThile this information will be used first to determine what
portion of the bank's overdue loans should be written off, it
will also help determine the maximum amount of any future
advances which could be made to these borrowers. Thus, it
should be an important instrument for improving the evaluation
of loan requests.
(b) Credit Planning and Study Commissions are being set up in all
branches and agencies of the bank in order to improve the
analysis of the viability of potential borrowers and to caution
those whose repayment record is unsatisfactory.
1/   Historically, loans for this purpose have been the most difficult to collect.



ANNEX 3
Page 7
(c) The reduction in Banco Ejidal's administrative and accounting
personnel, which will be effected through the mechanization
of work systems and the computerization of data collection
and processing, will be offset by an increase in field per-
sonnel. The greater number of inspectors and the fact that
their duties will be redefined and they will be given more
facilities to carry them out should greatly increase the
amount of technical assistance to ejidatarios and, hence,
should improve their earnings and their ability to repay
their loan commitments.
(d) The bank's newly created Department of Organization will
reshape all existing credit societies in such a way that
the Banco will have more effective control of their crops
or livestock, which are the main sources of loan repayment
funds. Furthermore, the bank has decided to enlist presidents
of ejidos to assist field inspectors in the recuperation of
loan advances and to remunerate them for this service.
23.       Finally, the Government's decision, announced on October 24,
1972, to make funds (Mex$500 million a year initially) available to Banco
Ejidal through the FONDO for the first time in the bank's history, for
term loans to low-income ejidatarios at a low rate of interest (7.6%)
will give the Fondo a considerable say in shaping the term-lending activ-
ities, and indeed the entire operations of Banco Ejidal. The simultaneous
announcements that (a) all agricultural credit societies will be reorganized
in order to operate on a basis satisfactory to the FONDO, and (b) the over-
due loans portfolio of Banco Ejidal will be carefully analyzed are clear in-
dications that the Government wants to ensure, not only that credit facilities
for ejidatarios be expanded, but also that the quality and standard of that
assistance and of the institution which will provide it, be improved.

BANCO NACIONAL DE CREDITO AGRICOLA, S.A.
A.  Introduction
1.        The Banco Nacional de Credito Agricola (Banco Agricola), established
in 1926, was the first agricultural bank created in Mexico and for nine years
extended financial and technical assistance to both farmers and ejidatarios.
Since 1935, however, when the Banco Nacional de Credito Ejidal was formed to
take over all government banking and technical assistance activities in the
ejidal sub-sector, the Banco Agricola has served only farmers and ranchers
operating on privately-owned land, concentrating primarily on small farmers,
whether owners or tenants of their farms, who could not easily obtain credit
from private institutional sources. The main functions of Banco Agricola are
to:
(a) finance agricultural and livestock production activities;
(b) assist small farmers in organizing local credit societies
or 'grupos solidarios" through which they could not only
obtain more credit more easily but also purchase their
inputs and machinery and sell their products at better
prices; and
(c) provide assistance to its borrowers not only in connection
with production matters but also with regard to the processing
and marketing of farm output.
B. Organization and Management
2.        The Banco Agricola's policies and regulations are set by a Board
of Directors, headed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock and including in its members representatives of the Ministry of
Finance and Public Credit, the Banco de Mexico, and the lNational Association
of Small Farners. Operations are carried out under the direction of a
General Manager and an Assistant General Manager, assisted in their admini-
strative and planning duties by three recently established advisory units:
the Administrative Commission, the Organization and Methods Unit, and the
Programming Unit.
3.        The Banco Agricola system is composed of six Bancos Regionales
(wholly-owned subsidiaries of Banco Agricola and administered by a Board of
Directors, of which the General Manager of Banco Agricola is President) and
their agencies, the head offices and 25 branches of Banco Agricola, and a
few correspondent agencies. The following table shows, in terms of volume
of business transacted, the relative importance of the various members of
the Banco Agricola system as of October 31, 1972.

C. Lending Operations and Sources of Fund
Types of Loans
4.        The Banco Agricola lends to individual farmers, grupos solidarios
(three to nine members), and agricultural credit societies (ten or more
members) under the following categories:
(a) Production loans. These cover crop or livestock production
expenses and are secured primarily by a pledge of (a) the
iniputs or other materials purchased with the proceeds of
the loan, and (b) the resulting farm production. The amount
of such loans may not exceed 70% of the probable value of
farm products and they must be repaid with the income re-
sulting from the sale of these products.
(b)  Term loans.  These are for land clearing and plantations
and for the purchase of animals, tools, machinery and
equipment, and the like, secured by a mortgage of farm
assets and a pledge of the farm output to be produced over
the repayment period of the loan. Such loan may not exceed
the value of the assets to be acquired or of the improve-
ments to be financed with the loan proceeds and they may
not exceed 50% of the expected value of the farm output
during the loan repayment period. A repayment term of up
to 12 years may be granted.
(c) Commercial loans. Secured by agricultural or livestock
pre-ducts held in storage in warehouses designated by the
Bank, such loans may not exceed in amount 80% of the
value of the security pledged and are repayable in 180 days
or less.



ANNEX 4

(d)  Real estate loans.  Covered under this category are loans
for permanent works, farm buildings, agro-industrial plants,
and such secured by a first mortgage on the assets financed
on other real estate. The amount of such loans may not
exceed 30% of the probable value of the farm output or of
the probable revenue of the borrower during the loan repay-
ment period. A repayment term of up to 20 years may be
granted.
Rates of Interest
5.        Until late 1972, the rates of interest on production loans varied
according to the purpose of the loan and the type of borrower, as follows:
Agricultural         Grupos
Credit Societies    Solidarios    Individuals
For basic crops   ..........   9.5               10.5             11.5
For other purposes   .......  10.5               11               12
For tern loans, the Bank has been charging interest rates of 10 and 10.5%
per annum on the unpaid balance, depending on the nature of the risk but
not on the type of borrower. Now, however, the interest rate is 7.6% to
low-income producers to conform with the legal rate established by the
Bank of Mexico for lending to such producers.
Volume of Business
6.        The volume of business carried out by the members of the Banco
Agricola system during the past four years was as follows:
1968     1969      1970      1971
(Millions of Mex$)
Production loans                     666       594       117       979
Term loans                            41        33        64        52
Commercial and real estate loans    40          52        45        57
TOTAL                          747       679      926    1 088
The above table shows how unimportant term lending has been until now, in
the Banco's overall operations although it has guaranteed some term loans
made by private banks.
.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
7.        The following table breaks down the same data by types of borrowers:
1968     1969    1970    1971
(Millions of Mex$)
Individual farmers              464       439     638      752
Grupos solidarios                121      110      132     145
Credit societies                 162      130      156     191
TOTAL                    747       679     926   1,088
It can be seen that despite the Bank's efforts to encourage the formation of
credit groups, the relative importance of loans to individual farmers and
ranchers has grown from 62% to 69% of total loans in the period under review.
Overdue Loans
8.        Information on overdue loans is available only for the Banco
Agricola proper, exclusive of the Bancos Agrarios, and indicates, as shown
below, marked improvement in collections during the last three years.

1970           665                 1,094           62.2
1971           722                1,244            63.3
9.        As in the case of Banco Ejidal, it is. alleged that the Government
has directed Banco Agricola from time to time to make loans funds available
for non-bankable programs aild this would account partly for the high volume
of overdues. However, there is evidence from recent anouncements that the
Government willput an end to this practice and the importance of such a move
could not be over-emphasized. On the other hand, the Government has asked
Banco Agricola to become considerably more active in term lending, a field
in which loan collection rates tend to be lower and one in which the Banco
has had little experience. Thus, it is crucial that this new course be
pursued very carefully which could be done under the guidance of the FONDO.
Sources of Funds
10.       The volume of lending of Banco Agricola is determined by it each
year in consultation with several Government ministries.  Estimates are



ANNEX 4
Page 5
based on analysis of farm credit plans and the availability of lending
resources but the figures must be approved by Government before it becomes
final. Seventy-five percent of the resources required by Banco Agricola
for short-term production loans are borrowed from the Banco Nacional de
Comercio Exterior and the balance is supplied as a grant from Government
as are all resources to support the Banco's limited term lending program.
Loan repayments, however, have generally not been more than sufficient to
meet its own debt maturities and, therefore, have not been available for
relending.
D. Technical and other Services to Small Farmers
11.       Technical assistance is provided largely by field inspectors
attached to its 116 agencies and zone offices but it is clear that the
Banco Agricola, which does a volume of business only one-half of that of
the Banco Ejidal's with only one-quarter of the staff, does not provide its
borrowers with the same degree of such help as does the latter. The main
duties of its field inspectors are, however, credit evaluation, disbursement,
and supervision and their next most important task is to promote the formation
of credit societies and "grupos solidarios," which leaves them little time
for technical assistance activities. The Banco realizes that, as more and
more credit groups are formed and as the volume of its term lending increases,
its capability to provide technical assistance will have to be better.  Not
only will the number of its field inspectors have to increase but their
qualifications will have to improve. With this in mind, the Banco is taking
a very active part in organizing a joint program for the training of Govern-
ment agricultural bank officers and field personnel, which is due to get
under way early in 1973.
Commercial Services
12.       The Banco Agricola assists small farmers who group themselves in
purchase-sale committees at the agency level in purchasing farm inputs and
equipment and in selling their farm products to best advantage. The volume
of commercial business carried out with such assistance has averaged Mex$63
million annually over the past four years and has yielded a small profit.
Agro-Industries
13.       The Banco Agricola has been reducing its agro-industrial activities
in the past few years and, while it still owns 16 units, 5 have been closed
down and 6 (all cattle-fattening yards) have been rented to a federal agency
called Industrial de Abastos. The volume of business done by Banco-owned
industrial units fell from Mex$49 million in 1968 to Mex$13 million in 1971
and net losses were also reduced during this period. Indications are that
the Banco will endeavor to cease industrial operations altogether as soon
as possible and to dispose of all its industrial assets.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
E. Operating Results and Financial Condition
14,       The large increase in banking income shown for 1971 in the state-
ments of Banco Agricola proper reflects an agreement reached with the Govern-
nent that assistance given to it towards the payment of interest on its obli-
gations would henceforth be treated as a subsidy and included in miscellaneous
income. lience, the Banco's 1971 and 1972 Statements of Income and Expenses
are not comparable with those of previous years.
15.       During the period 1968-72, interest collected on total loans out-
standing, including loans in good standing and loans in arrears, increased
from about 5% to about 6.2%. This is much lower than the average interest
rate of more than 10% which was charged by the Banco on its advances and
would indicate that interest is not being collected on a significant portion
of loans in arrears. Unlike the Banco Agricola proper, the Bancos Regionales
have had greater interest income than interest expense during this period,
reflecting the better quality of their loan portfolio.
16.       In absolute terms, there has been a moderate rise in total banking
expenses during the four-year period 1968-71 but general banking expenses
have decreased as a percentage of the volume of business done, both for
Banco Agricola and for Bancos Regionales. It is noteworthy that very small
charges have been made during this period for the provision for losses on
overdue accounts.
17.       Banco Agricola's financial condition has been greatly improved over
the past two years by substantial Government contributions which have helped
to reduce indebtedness to Banco Nacional de Comercio and to increase lending
resources. Even so, the Banco's financial situation is far less sound than
it appears from the balance sheet because of the failure to build up an
adequate reserve for possible losses on overdue loans. It is indeed a matter
of concern that its reserve for losses on past-due loans and other mis-
cellanous receivables corresponds to only 13% of the face value of these
assets (as compared to 69% in the case of Banco Ejidal) and that the reserve
for past-due loans, taken separately, is only about 5% of the value of such
loans.
F. Steps being taken to Improve the Banco's Performance
18.       As with Banco Ejidal, the main problers of Banco Agricola are
its low interest earnings and its unsatisfactory rate of loan collection. In
tthc past year, however, the Banco Agricola has made important strides in
streamlining its administrative, accounting, and data collection and processing
systems and procedures and has thus improved its overall efficiency, but
administrative reforms alone cannot solve all the problems which are closely
linked to Government agricultural credit policies. To improve the situation,



*                                                                          ANNEX 4
Page 7
the Government has, accordingly, decided to increase the flow of short- and
long-term credit funds to small farmers which should substantially increase
the volume of production loans of Banco Agricola over the next few years.
The Government has also just made available to the Banco, through the FONDO,
Mex$250 million with which to launch a major program of medium- and long-
term lending. The increase in the Banco's lending funds, coupled with the
involvement of the FONDO from the outset in setting up a term-lending program
for the Banco will force it to develop quickly the capability it needs to
operate soundly and effectively; this would have a salutary effect on the
Banco's collection problem.
19.       The Banco would also be required to provide more technical and
commercial assistance to its customers, but since this will more than absorb
the savings resulting from the administrative reforms being implemented,
operating costs will increase. This assistance should, however, increase
the debt servicing ability of customers and, in turn, have a favorable effect
on the loan collection rate.
20.       It is the Government's policy towards the Banco's involvement in
its credit programs, though, that is important to the Banco's performance in
the future. The Government has indicated that assistance to farmers for
purposes other than production increases would henceforth not be financed
from loan funds but from outright grants or subsidies.  Furthermore, it has
stressed that official agricultural banks should assess loan requests with
more care in order to improve the quality of loans and hence the rate of
loan collection. It remains to be seen how much leniency will be exercised
toward loan defaulters in the future, but this is clearly the single most
important determinant of Banco Agricola's future performance.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PERFORMANCE UNDER FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD PROJECTS
A. Introduction
1.        The First, Second and Third Projects are livestock and agriculture
lending programs administered by FONDO 1/, as trustee for BANXICO. By agree-
ment with IBRD, all farming and ranching enterprises or processing industries
financed under the above Projects must have development plans that have had
prior evaluation by FONDO technicians (or FONDO-approved technicians) as to
their technical and financial feasibility. To assure effective use of bor-
rowed funds, these technicians also supervise the performance of sub-borrowers
to assure compliance with the approved development plans.
2.        Medium- and long-term loans to finance viable farm and agro-industrial
developments are disbursed by both private and public credit institutions par-
ticipating in the Projects who rediscount with the FONDO. Under the First
Project, rediscount funds came equally from the proceeds of Loan 430-ME
(US$25.0 million) and from the FONDO's own resources, generally borrowings
from BANXICO. 2/.  Under the Second and Third Projects, the arrangements are
the same except that the rediscount funds are 56.0% from the proceeds of
Loan 610-ME (US$65.0 million), and 747-ME (US$75.0 million), respectively,
and 44.0% from the FONDO's own resources.
B. Lending and Rediscounting
Rediscounting Policies and Procedures
3.        Under the First Project, participating banks (both official and
private credit institutions) rediscounted loans (regardless of loan size)
with FONDO at the following rates:
1/   See Annex 2 for a description of FONDO's powers, organization, and
other operations.
2/   Regulations require private banks in the Federal District to keep a
part of reserves against deposit liabilities in the form of "cattle
bonds" issued by the Government. Proceeds from these bonds are used
by BANXICO to lend to FONDO.

RA2AGROs and private banks rediscounted with FONDO, on average, about 71.1%
and 87.3%, respectively, of eligible loans.  Under the above rediscount rate
schedule, private banks generally obtained the highest return on their own
funds by rediscounting at the 90% level.
4.        One of the objectives of the Second Project was to further increase
fund participation by banks as compared with their contribution to the First
Project.  An attempt was made, therefore, under the Second Project to decrease
the average percentage of loans that may be rediscounted with FONDO; at the
same time, the revised rates were biased in favor of producers operating on
a small scale:

Greater than 1,500       70                  7                 11
Agro-industry loan rediscounts were required to pay 1/2 of 1% more than the
above.
5.        In the Second Project, participating private banks and BANAGROs
rediscounted with FONDO 85.3% and 68.5%, respectively, of eligible loans.
Participating private banks increased their contribution by approximately
16%Z in the Second Project as contrasted with the First, due partly to the
changes in the rediscount rate schedule agreed between the IBRD and FONDO.
The elimination of 90% rediscounts for loans in excess of 'rex$500,000 was
probably the most important factor.
6.        One of the objectives of the Third Project was to still further
increase fund participation by banks as compared with their contributions
to the First and Second Projects. An attempt was made, therefore, under the
Third Project to decrease further the average percentage of loans that may
be rediscounted with FONDO by eliminating the option to rediscount 90% of

loans for all but very small banks, and by introducing changes in the re-
discount rate; at the same time, the revised rates continued to be biased in
favor of small sub-loans:

The requirement that agro-industry loan rediscounts pay 1/2 of 1% more than
others (introduced in the Second Project) was dropped, because it was acting
as a deterrent to borrowing for desirable development.
7.        In the Third Project, participating private banks and BANAGROs
rediscounted with FONDO 80.1% and 76.3%, respectively, of eligible loans.
Participating private banks increased their contribution by approximately
35%0 in the Third Project as contrasted with the Second, due partly to the
changes in the rediscount rate schedule agreed between the Bank and FONDO.
The elimination of 90% rediscounts for all but the smallest banks was prob-
ably the most important factor (para 6).
Lending Terms and Conditions
8.        All loans to sub-borrowers in the First Project were at 10% per
annum. In some instances, however, private credit institutions also required
sub-borrowers to maintain a non-earning deposit account with the lending in-
stitutions equivalent to 10% to 20% of the loan.  This had the effect of
increasing interest cost to the sub-borrower by 1.1% to 2.5% per annum.
Every agro-industrial borrower had to pay a technical service fee of 1% of
the sub-loan amount in addition to these charges. Besides the regular in-
terest, some banks (especially "financieras") charged commissions of 1% of
the loan balance and inspection fees of Mex$200 to Mex$250.



ANNEX 5

9.        In the Second Project, lending terms were somewhat modified.  Loans
of up to Mex$500,000 remained at 10% per annum, while all loans in excess of
this amount were at 11% per annum (para 4). The 1% technical service fee
charged to all agro-industrial sub-borrowers remained. By the time of the
appraisal of the Third Project in late 1970, no evidence was found that banks
any longer required a compulsory non-earning deposit (para 8).
10.       In the Third Project, lending terms were still further modified.
Loans of up to Mex$250,000 remained at 10% per annum, and loans in excess
of Mex$1,500,000 remained at 11% per annum, while loans between Mex$250,000
and Mex$1,500,000 were raised to 10.5% from 10% per annum. The requirement
under the First and Second Projects that all agro-industrial sub-borrowers
pay a 1% technical service fee was modified in the Third Project to effect
only loans of more than Mex$1,500,000.
11.       Generally, private credit institutions deal only with well-estab-
lished producers who are very creditworthy. Accordingly, while the develop-
ment period of a sub-loan might be much longer, actual terms of repayment
are shorter--generally from three to five years.
12.       The BANAGROs are prepared to deal with less well-established pro-
ducers, and offer better maturity terms and grace periods, therefore, meeting
a demand that private banks find it difficult to fill.
Rediscounting Operations
13.       Loan 430-ME was declared effective on December 8, 1965 and was                 0
fully disbursed on December 6, 1968, but FONDO continued rediscounting using
repayment proceeds. Total rediscounts granted by FONDO during the period
December 8, 1965 to March 31, 1969 amounted to Mex$868.6 million as follows:

14.       Toan 610-ME was declared effective on September 19, 1969, and the
closing date was July 1, 1974. Total rediscounts granted by FONDO during
the period to September 20, 1971, amounted to Mex$1,448.6 million as follows:

15.       The decline in the percentage of eligible loans rediscounted with
FONDO from 85.5% in the First Project to 81.6% in the Second Project results
from two factors: (a) the changes introduced in the rediscount rates sched-
ule (para 4); and (b) the increased role of the BANAGROs (para 12). In the
Second Project, the BANAGROs rediscounted Mex$249.2 million, or 17.2%, of
the total rediscounted with FONDO, whereas under the First Project, the
BANAGROs rediscounted only 9.5% of the total.
16.       Loan 747-ME was declared effective on September 21, 1971, and the
closing date is September 30, 1975. Total rediscounts granted by FONDO dur-
ing the period to September 30, 1972, amounted to 1Iex$690.8 million as follows:

X=z
17.       The further decline in the percentage of eligible loans rediscounted
with FONDO from 81.6% in the Second Project to 79.7 in the Third resulted from
the changes introduced in the rediscount rate schedule (para 6).
Participating Banks
18.       To date, participating banks have opened credit lines with the
FONDO which cumulatively total Mex$3,855.2 million (including First, Second
and Third Projects) against which they have rediscounted Mex$2,929.2 million.
FONDO has encouraged the opening of credit lines to promote the Project and
the participation of private banks in the development of agriculture. Under
the Third Project, there were 117 private credit institutions and six regional
BANAGROs participating as of September 30, 1972.

19.       Most of the private banks have fully used and renewed-their credit
lines. At the start of the Second Project, the Bank suggested that FONDO
periodically review with participating banks their use of credit lines, and
also that FONDO increase its promotional work, both at the level of participa-
ting banks and potential sub-borrowers. This, FONDO has done to the great
advantage of the Second and Third Projects.
Project Lending
20.       In the First Project, loan beneficiaries were commercial producers
operating in three principal regions: (a) tropics, (b) central plateau, and
(c) north Mexico.  The allocation of loan funds forecast by IBRD and the
actual distribution are quite comparable (see following table):
Forecast of Loans                 Actual Loans/
Number    Mex$    % of           Number    Mex$    % of

General Crops              610     160.9      23           943      -190.0      19
Fruit and Tree Crops       175      64.4       9           319        52.9      5
Agro-industries             65      88.4      12           199       156.4      15
Total         1,700      715.1    100         5 484    1 016.2    100
/1   Actual loans as of March 31, 1969 and includes lending using collections
from past loans since Loan 430-ME was completely disbursed on December
6, 1968.
An important trend has been a diminishing average loan size. Whereas IBRD
in 1965 forecast an average loan size of about Mex$420,600, the actual average
loan size by June 30, 1968 was Mex$236,000. Furthermore, between June 30,
1968 and March 31, 1969, about 2,867 loans were granted with an average size
of only Mex$151,700. This is a dramatic decrease of 36% in average loan size
in six months. Under the Second Project, the average loan size dropped even
further to Mlex$133,800. Todate, under the Third Project, average loan size
is Mex$157,000.
21.       As of September 20, 1971, participating banks had granted MIex$1,774.4
million of loans under the Second Project, of which Mex$1,448.6 million had
been rediscounted with FONDO. The percentage distribution of loan funds fore-
cast by IBRD in autumn 1968, and the actual distribution to September 1971,
differ rather widely (see following table):

22.       The Second Project was based on a three-year commitment period and
on a five-year disbursement. By September 20, 1971, the loan was fully dis-
bursed. Actual livestock lending was compatible with the forecasts, but
there was a much stronger demand for crop development loans (especially for
annual crops), while loans for agro-industries was less than expected. In-
creasing numbers of crop farmers were seeking loans under the Project as a
consequence of favorable lending conditions (for instance, suppliers' credit
is generally at 18% p.a. for no more than two years), and more banks were
using FONDO's rediscounting facilities for their clients as more technical
services become available. Inadequate organization of FONDO's Agro-industries
Division, which under the Third Project FONDO tried to remedy, also contributed
to the slow agro-industry lending.
23.       As of September 30, 1972, participating banks had granted Mex$866.5
million of loans under the Third Project, of which Mex$690.8 million had been
rediscounted with FONDO. The percentage distribution of loan funds forecast
by IBRD in autumn 1970, and the actual distribution to September 30, 1972 are
very similar (see following table):
Forecast of Loans               Actual Loans

24.       The Third Project was based on a two-year commitment period and a
four-year disbursement period.  Agro-industry lending continued to lag despite
efforts to improve the organization and functioning of the FONDO's Agro-
industries Division.

25.       Livestock Development.  Of the total livestock lending under the
Third Project, beef cattle ranching received about 67%, dairying 19%, and
pigs and poultry 14%. About 68% of the investment in beef cattle ranching
and dairying was for the purchase of breeding animals, compared with an es-
timated 47% at appraisal. This reflects the situation in many areas where
most ranches, particularly the smaller ones in the wet tropics, are grossly
understocked and are not able to utilize their pasture properly.  In such
cases, it is uneconomic to invest extensively in on-ranch improvements unless
sufficient animals are available to fully utilize these investments.
26.       In the beef sub-sector half the loans and a third of the loan funds
went to ranchers with less than 300 ha.
27.       Crop Development.  About half the annual crop loans went to farmers
with less than 100 ha each, whereas about half the perennial crops went to
farmers with less than 50 ha each. Annual crop loans were concentrated in
the west, northwest and northeast, and perennial crop loans were mostly made
in the west and northeast.
28.       The most important inputs financed by annual crop loans were:
(a) farm machinery and equipment, 36%; and (b) on-farm irrigation works, 13%.
Perennial crops loans financed mostly establishment and maintenance of crops,
58%; farm machinery and equipment, 15%; and on-farm irrigation works, 13%.
29.       Agro-industries Development.  In the First Project, FONDO made ap-
proximately 319 loans for agro-industries, slightly less than 50% for live-
stock processing industries, and the remainder for crop storage and processing.
Investments in the tropics for agro-processing industries were minimal. Under
the Second Project, there were about 56 loans for agro-industries, and under
the Third Project (up to September 30, 1972), there were about 35 loans for
agro-industries.
C. Project Performance and Impact
Performance
30.       The project has succeeded in widening the role of the banking system
in technically-supervised lending to farm development. The technical services
of FONDO and participating banks have improved throughout the lives of the
three IBRD Projects. Adjustments to the organization of FONDO, made in 1969
at the request of IBRD, have been successful in strengthening FONDO technical
staff work. Adequate ranch and farm plans are now being prepared and super-
vision of investments has improved considerably.  There are still, however,
insufficient supervision and technical services, especially after the on-farm
investments are made; consequently, insufficient technical advice and guidance
are being given the individual sub-borrower, especially in livestock. This
has limited the Project's ability to introduce new technology to many producers.



ANNEX 5
Page 9
31.       Evaluations in agro-industries are generally satisfactory though
certain weaknesses exist in the ability of FONDO staff to manage this field
of activity. The Agro-industries Division of FONDO needs strengthening in
its leadership. FONDO also needs to develop a marketing capability at least
sufficient to enable it to evaluate marketing studies done by other individuals
or organizations.
Results of Operations and Financial Conditions of FONDO
32.       The Special Fund created for IBRD Projects is in good financial
condition. All claims are against sound financial institutions.
33.       Aside from the IBRD Projects, FONDO is also trustee for other
lending programs. The results of FONDO's entire operations are fully dis-
cussed in Annex 2.
Impact of Lending
34.       As agreed under the Second and Third Project Agreements, FONDO has
taken steps to measure development impact on a systematic formal basis. Early
in 1972 FONDO hired a consultant to help them in measuring impact. The results
reported here are based upon two distinct field surveys conducted, under the
supervision of the consultant, during May 1972.
35.       A total of 18,043 sub-borrower loans were approved for rediscounting
under the First and Second Projects. Of this total, 17,811 loans were made to
farms and ranches, and 232 loans were made to agro-industries. Recognizing
the smaller number, and distinctly different character, and average size of
the agro-industry loans, the consultant decided to sample this group separately.
The target sample size he chose was 4% of the farms and ranches, and 25% of
the agro-industries. A total of 721 farm and ranch sub-borrowers, and 54
agro-industries sub-borrowers were selected at random. Questionnaires were
designed, pre-tested and adapted to obtain, on the basis of a single interview,
data on the financial, and production coefficients prevailing before develop-
ment and in calendar year 1971.
36.       The analysis consistently supports the general hypothesis that
borrowers, considered in total, have benefitted greatly from these projects.
No attempt was made to establish a clear cause-effect relationship between
the loan investments facilitated by the credit projects and borrower progress.
The amount of sub-borrower progress achieved to date was measured in several
ways. The basic procedure employed was to compare the current situation
(calendar year 1971) against that which held prior to the initial FONDO proj-
ect loan in each sample case. As should be expected, the amount of progress
varied greatly between individual survey respondents. On the average, however,
all developmental progress measures applicable to the complete business
entity were found to be highly impressive.

ANNEX 5
Page 10
37.       There was substantial average size variation between the various
types of enterprises and within the different enterprises. Overall, the
average size of farm/ranch was 552 ha, ranging from an average of 1,000 ha
for beef ranches to 85 ha in the case of pig producers. The average size
of farm producing annual crops was 394 ha and ranged from 614 ha in arid and
semi-arid areas to 300 in the humid tropics. It should be emphasized, how-
ever, that area of farm is a very poor measure of size of operation in Mexico
due to great variability in water availability and soil quality.
38.       The average individual loan size on the sample farms/ranches was
US$13,600, but since about 27% received repeat loans, the average borrowing
per farm or ranch was US$18,350. Average borrowing per farm/ranch ranged
from about US$40,000 for poultry sub-projects, to US$13,700 for beef sub-
projects.
39.       The contribution of farm/ranch sub-borrowers to total investment
averaged 15%. This is in line with IBRD expectations at time of appraisal.
Perennial crop sub-borrowers on average only contributed 8% of investment
cost, whereas pig and beef sub-borrowers contributed on average 2t% of
investment costs. The reason for the difference is not readily apparent.
40.       The breakdown of investment expenditures on the sample farms/ranches
was as follows: land improvement, 19%; irrigation, 5%; machinery and equip-
ment purchases, 25%o; buildings, 15%; and livestock for breeding purposes, 36..
41.       On the average sample farm/ranch, the gross value of farm production
almost doubled between pre-development and calendar year 1971, while net cash
operating income per farm increased by 45%. The greatest improvement in net
cash operating income was on the beef and dairy farms (doubling), and the
least on perennial crop farms (8%).
42.       The sample survey also tried to compare production coefficient
oeiore development and in calendar year 1971.  For this purpose, a few key
coefficients were selected. On beef farms, the average herd size increased
fron 98 cows to 134 cows, but, the weaning percentage did not change signi-
2cantl,.   cokkever, stocking rate improved about 10o.  In addition, the aver-
age annual weight gairt iu calves was about 8% higher in calendar year 1971
1:han before development.  These improvemants in production coefficients are
.onsistent with the FONDO emphasis on improving grazing conditions.  Nowevex,
the failure to raise weaning rates is disappointing. In the case for crops,
-t as generally found that production coefficients did not change appreciably.
43,       The survey of agro-industries involved a sample of 54 firms, from
the total of 205 such firms who received FONDO loans under the First and
Second Projects. The survey included respondents from 13 different industrie6,
so generalizations are very difficult. Nevertheless, there are some interest-
ing findings.  Only 30% of the sample firms were in existence prior to the
initial project loan, and some 39% of the sample were cooperative type under-
taking.  About 26% of the firms had multiple loans.  On average, sub-borrowers
0



ANNEX 5
Page 11
contributed 40% of investment cost for their undertaking. An average invest-
ment was US$235,000 distributed as follows: land, 3%; buildings, 31%; machinery
and equipment, 64%; and other, 2%.  A rather surprising finding is that on
average 9 new jobs were created per firm, at a cost of US$26,000 per job.
Financial indicators were very satisfactory for the group as a whole.
44.       This study by no means captures the ultimate, potential impact of

FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PRoJECT
THE OUTLOOK FOR COTTON
A. The World. Outlook 1/
'.         Cotton is produced in varying quantities in more than 80 countries.
Roughly one-third. of the world, crop is produced for export in raw (fiber)
form and significant amounts are exported by producing countries as textiles.
The United States, the USSR and Mainland. China are the world's three largest
producers, accounting together for about dne-half of the world. output. The
bulk of the remainder is produced. by a large number of developing countries.
2.         The United. States remains the world's leading cotton exporter,
although its share in the world. cotton trade has been declining historically.
During the past ten years U.S. exports accounted on the average for 22 per-
cent of the world's total exports. Over the same period, centrally planned.
countries accounted for another 13 percent and developing countries for the
remaining 65 percent (Appendix 11-1).
3.         The present world, cotton situation is in many respects different
from what is was throughout most of the past and. especially the early and.
mid-sixties. Since 1966-67 world, cotton consumption has been rising by only
0.9 percent a year compared to the annual growth rate of about 2.2 percent
experienced. in the preceding 11 years. On the other hand., production, which
had. increased by 2.1 percent a year during the period between 1955-56 and.
1965-66, declined sharply in 1966/67 and 1967/68 and remained below consunp-
tion for five consecutive years.
4.         These changes in the demand-supply relationship which took place
in the late sixties changed c5siderably the world. cotton position.  From
a peak of 30.7 million bales - at the beginning of the 1966 season (August)
- equivalent to 7.2 months of world. consumption - stocks declined to 19.0
million bales by August 1972, or to the equivalent of little more than four
months' consumption, a leyel considered as below minimum normal requirements
by consuming countries..2' The distribution of stocks also changed. consid-
erably: the United. States held in August 1971 23 percent of world. stocks
(compared. to 55 percent in August 1966), centrally planned. countries 18 per-
cent (11.4 percent in 1966) and the rest of the world. 59 percent (33.6 per-
cent in 1966). Reflecting these changes in the demand.-supply balance, the

consumption.

grade of so-called medium-long cotton - which was 28.1 cents per pound in
August 1966 rose to 31.0 cents per pound. in August 1970 and continued to
increase throughout most of the 1970/71 season to reach the peak of 40-41
cents per pound in January-February 1972.
5.         A strong supply response to the high prices which prevailed during
the 1970/71 season, however, materialized in the following season and almost
as rapidly as they rose in the preceding 9-10 months, cotton prices began to
decline in the Spring and. Summer of 1972. During the current cotton season
(1972/73), moreover, world cotton supply is forecast to be abindant (at 2-3
A,'lion bales above expected total consumption). This expected excess
supply wi1l considerably ease the world stock position and bring again
cotton stocks to more desirable levels (about 23 million bales).
6.         World cotton prices in current terms are expected to decline by
some 15 percent from recent high levels (1969/70-1971/721/) by the mid-
seventies.  Tn terms of Mexican SM 1-1/16", a representative grad.e of medium-
long cotton which normally accounts for more than 60 percent of total world
cotton output, this means a price of about 28a0 U.S. cents per pound, c.i.f.
Liverpool.  By the end of the seventies, c.i.f. Liverpool cotton prices, in
current terms, are forecast to be only marginally above l97 /,6 levels at
some 29.0 U.S. cents per pound. In 1972 U.S. dollar terms, /2 Mexican SK
1-1/16" cotton prices are expected tu be at about 26.0 cents per pound by
the mid.-seventies and at 25.b cents per pound by 1980.
7.         The expected downward trend in price over the medium-term reflects
a number of assamptions:  (a) that the current high prices are tenporary and
reflect a demand-supply imbalance caused largely by a temporary supply short-
age; (b) that in the tbsence of a decline in prices production will tend
again to outpace consuLption in the mid-seventies;3/ (c) that inter-fiber
competition will continue to limit the growth of cotton consumption but that
no major breakthrough in man-made fiber technology will greatly accelerate
recent substitution trends; and (d) that price adjustments will take place
within the framework of a relatively f1reer, more competitive market. This
in turn implies continued competition among some sixty exporting countries
(mary of them heavly dependent on cotton exports); absence, in future U.S.
price support and cotton export policies, of the elements which made that
country a residual supplier in the world market and. led to recurring stock
accumLlation in the United. States; and, finally no international cotton
agreement.
1/ See Appendix 11-2.
2/ The purchasing power of the U. S. dollar is assumed to decline by 2.0
percent per annum during the seventies.
3/ Available information on government plans or intentions (as supplied to
the International Cotton Advisory Committee in October 1972) indicate
that world cotton production could. exceed. demand in the mid-seventies
by some 5-7 percent.



ANNEX 31
Page 3
8.         The future growth of cotton production depends not only on the
natural supply response to change in price but also - and quite crucially -
on the cotton policies of the major producers. The United States and.the
USSR account together for almost 39 percent of world cotton production.
Their production policies necessarily influence the growth path of world
cotton supply. In our supply projections we have assumed. a 'normaliza-
tion" of U.S. cotton output by 1975 to about 13 million bales (in line with
U.S. stated intentions and current policies) and total output of about 11
million bales in the Soviet Union (again in line with its expansion plans).
The combined output share of the two countries would therefore remain the
same as during the past five seasons. Should the U.S. cotton output remain
around. the 10-11 bales of the past three seasons and the USSR output stabilize
at 10 million bales, the 1975 projected surplus situation would turn, other
things being equal, into one of rough demand-supply equilibrium and lead to
actual prices 5 percent higher than those forecast in paragraph 4,
9.         Demand uncertainties, however, call for a certain degree of pru-
dence in forecasting cotton prices. World cotton consumption is projected
to grow at an average annual rate of 1.6 percent during the next ten years.
Even this modest growth rate of cotton eonsunption presupposes some further
improvement in the quality composition of cotton and progress in promotional
activity, and furthermore, that no new breakthrough in the production of man-
made fibers would occur - and lead to a faster substitution of cotton with
man-made (especially synthetic) fibers. As mentioned before, cotton consump-
tion did. in fact slow down considerably in the late sixties and. grew at a very
modest average aanual rate of 0.9 percent between 1966/67 and 1971/72. The
declining trend in cotton utilization in developed countries since the mid-
sixties - largely due to greater competition from man-mad.e (especially non-
cellulosic) fibers - was less than fullyooupenutei for by increased consump-
tion in developing and centrally planned countries. Competition from synthetic
substitutes, although particularly strong in industrialized countries, is by
no means restricted to these markets, In Central America, South America and
South Asia synthetic fibers have already penetrated the market and further
inroads are expected. during the next decade. During the past ten years, while
cotton's share of world total fiber market fell from nearly 66 to 44 percent,
the market share of man-made fibers increased from 29 to 50 percent.
10.        Inter-fiber competition hinges upon two main factors:  relative
prices and product performance. Prices of man-mad.e fibers (especially poly-
ester fibers) declined considerably in the past five years thereby moving
price parities in favor of man-made fibers. Recent high cotton prices, more-
over, are likely to accelerate the trend in substitution of cotton with poly-
ester fibers, particularly in developed countries. The quality or product
performance of man-made fibers is superior to cotton in some crucial end-uses
(e.g., apparel) where cotton lacks, the "easy-care" properties characteristic
of synthetic fibers (alone or blended.with cotton). Although further sharp
declines in the prices of the most important non-cellulosic fibers do not
appear very likely in the short ran, the possibility of increased competition
from these fibers still remains quite strong, given the technical advrantages
that man-made fibers have in new high-speed spinning and. weaving machines.
This could seriously affect cotton demand and slow down its growth to a very
modest 1 percent per annum over the next ten years.



ANNEX 11
Page 4
11.        At projected equilibrium levels of demand, supply and price for
the mid-seventies, world raw cotton exports would epVerience a growth rate of
around 1.2 percent per annum between 1967-69 and 1975, although developing
countries' exports may grow at a higher rate (between 1.5 and 2.0 percent per
annum). Assuming that world cotton prices move in the late seventies toward
long-term equilibrium levels, world raw cotton exports may continue to grow
throughout the late seventies at approximately the same rate envisaged for
the earlier period.  Export shares, however, become more difficult to predict,
given their dependence on possible future policy actions by major producing
and exporting countries such as the United States and the USSR.
12.        The export performance and prospects of individual developing
countries will continue to vary depending, inter alia, on availability of land,
trends in yields, quality ed marketability of cotton grown, domestic consump-
tion trends and. cotton textiles trade balances. Competition among producing
countries is expected to continue and small producing countries with limited
production alternatives are likely to push output and succeed in expanding
their small shares. The world market growth, however, is expected to be a
slow one throughout the seventies.  Competing man-made fibers will continue
to exert pressure on cotton and to limit its growth.  The balance hetween
advancements in cotton agronozy and man-made fiber technology, although
difficult to predict, is likely to remain tilted in favor of competing man-
made fibers.

ANNEX 13
MEXICO
FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICEJITURE DEVELOPNENT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.         The economic rates of return of the Sub-Projects, General and
Low-Income Producers, were calculated on the basis of data shown in
Appendixes 13-1 and. 13-2. Key assumptions and adjustments made were that:
(a) the prices of investment and operating cost items, in real
terms, would remain at current price levels;
(b) the prices of all outputs, in real terms, would remain at
current price levels, with the exception of cotton prices,
which are assumed to decline by 15 in the 1970ts and remain
at that level thereafter for the life of the Project (these
assumptions are based.on commodity price projections);
(c) incremental herd values were credited to the Project at the
end of the life of the investments;
(d) the official rate of exchange is equal to the shadow rate of
exchange;
(e)  all FONDO administrative and technical services provided. to
the Project were charged to the Project;
(f) the cost of banking services provided to the Project by
participating private and public banks were estimated and.
charged to the Project;
(g) taxes, which would, be transfer payments, were not charged
to the Project;
(h) the opportunity cost of labor employed on the General Sub-
Project is equal to the monetary wage because most of the
workers are semi-skilled agricultural laborers; and
(i) the opportunity cost of labor eployed on the Low-Income
Producerst Sub-Project, on average, is 25% of the monetary
wage level.
2.         Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return of the
Project is estimated at approximately 29%, having incorporated all signifi-
cant adjustments to producer benefits that were necessary to better reflect
real costs and returns to the economy. The economic rate of return on the
General Sub-Project and the Low-Income Producerst Sub-Project are estimated
at 26% and. 41a, respectively.  If labor on the Low-Income Producers' Sub-
Project were charged at the monetary wage, then the return on this Sub-



AMNEX 13
P age 2 
Project would drop to 25%. Assuming further that the agro-indhstries
component of the Project remains unchanged, but that actual incremental
production from the other components is valued at JC% less, due either to
a drop in all output prices or a short-fall in prodaction,then the economic
rates of return on the General Sub-Project and the Low-Income Prodboers'
Sub-Project would be 21% and 3 %, respectively. Should investment costs
be 1% higher tban projected, then the economic rate of return on the
Project would be about 27%.
