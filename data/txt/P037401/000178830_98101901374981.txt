APPRAISAL OF
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
IRELAND
SUMIARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Industrial Credit Company, Limited (ICC) was established by the
Government in 1933 to provide long-term finance for the industrial sector.
During the past four decades, ICC has diversified its activities to include
hire-purchase financing and leasing of equipment, finance for ship-building
and for distributive trades, underwriting and issue house services. Through
its subsidiaries, it engages in arranging mergers. It assists under-capi-
talized firms and is involved in the operations of the Reconstruction Fi-
nance Corporation. Since 1969, ICC has accepted deposits, which are guar-
anteed by the Government.  During the past three years ICC financed an aver-
age of 8% of manufacturing investment in Ireland.
ii.       The Government exercises no influence over the day-to-day opera-
tions of ICC and makes a point to respect its autonomy. ICC's management
and staff are experienced and highly qualified. Its project appraisals and
supervision are adequate, and ICC is upgrading its appraisal work further.
iii.      ICC's volume of business has registered sharp growth during the
past five years, except for 1972 when there was a downturn in investment ac-
tivity.  Its total commitments reached E 30.4 million in FY1974 which is more
than three times the average annual level attained in the previous four years.
Term loans to industrial enterprises constituted 37% of its comnitments in
FY1970-1974. ICC's total portfolio inicreased from E 21.7 million to I 44.1
million. ICC's portfolio is sound and provisiorns for possible losses are
adequate. Overall profits improved considerably over the past few years;
its net profit amounted to i 943,000 in 1974 representing 10.7% of the
share capital and 8.4% of the average net worth. The current average spread
on borrowed funds is around 1%, which will increase as the percentage of the
old loans bearing lower interest rates in ICC's loan portfolio is reduced.
iv.       ICC has historically depended on the (Government for replenishing
its resources and continues to do so, though to a lesser extent. It has
made a great effort in the past four years to diversify its resources.  In
the domestic market, it was successful in increasing deposits by seven tiTnes
during tthis period.  Howeiver, it has never raised funds in the domestic bond
market because the Government prefers to centralize the resource mobilization
efforts of government agencies. Aside from the first Bank loan of $10 million
made in 1971, the only long-term funids in foreign currency obtained by ICC
are from the European Investment Bank.



- ii -
v.        Projecting an average growth of business at 20%, ICC's commitments
(excluding shipping loans) would reach E 96 million by the end of FY1978.
ICC's average annual contribution to manufacturing investment would reach
10% during the projected period. The total resource needs amount to E 97.8
million. ICC expects to obtain i 58 million from the Government and other
domestic sources including deposits. It will be able to borrow more from
ECGD and EIB; the total to be raised from such sources is estimated at i 15
million. Therefore, the net resource gap would be i 24.8 million during
February 1, 1975-October 31, 1978. The proposed Bank loan would fill approx-
imately 55% of ICC's resource gap during the period ending October 31, 1978.
ICC is expected to make an extensive effort to raise an additional E 11.2
million in international capital markets in order to fill its projected re-
source gap.
vi.       With the help of the proposed Bank loan, ICC will give more emphasis to
the needs of projects in the less developed regions and in the small industries
sector in line with Government policies. ICC has outlined its objectives in
this regard in a Strategy Paper, and as operational targets for the next three
years during which the Bank funds are expected to be committed, ICC will en-
deavor to allocate 70% of its resources for industrial financing to projects
outside Dublin County and 30% of such resources to projects sponsored by small
enterprises. ICC has agreed to use the entire proceeds of the proposed Bank
loan to finance projects outside Dublin County and 40% of the loan for pro-
jects of small enterprises. ICC is an appropriate vehicle to achieve the
Government's objectives to reduce regional imbalances and to strengthen the
small industries sector, considering its long involvement and experience in
such activities. ICC is a sound and creditworthy institution and is a suit-
able borrower of Bank funds.



APPRAISAL OF
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMlTED
IRELAND
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Industrial Credit Company, Limited (ICC), was established in
1933 by the Industrial Credit Act of that year to provide finance for in-
dustry in Ireland. ICC envisages an increasing role as it is becoming more
active in supporting projects in the less developed regions of Ireland and
in providing assistance to small industries, in keeping with Government de-
velopment policies. ICC received a Bank loan of $10 million in 1971. The
loan was fully committed in December, 1974. During FY1974, ICC's volume of
operations increased sharply, reflecting a rise in industrial investment
principally as a result of Ireland's entry into the EEC. Confronted with
a shortage of long-term resources, ICC has applied to the Bank for a second
loan.
1.02      The following report, based on an appraisal mission to Ireland in
February/March, 1975, recommends a second loan to ICC in the amount of $30
million.
1I. ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
A. Recent Economic Developments
2.01      Following a period of sluggish growth in 1970-72, economic activity
was strongly revived in 1973. Ireland's entry into the EEC, high world beef
prices, and the discovery of mineral deposits pushed investment and incomes
upward and real GNP grew by 7% compared with an annual average of 3% during
1970-72. Industrial investment amounted to i 110 million in 1973 in current
prices, while direct foreign investment more than doubled, reaching E 60 mil-
lion; this compares with an average of t 29 million during 1970-72. Indus-
trial exports rose by 37% over the preceding year. However, recent events
in the international economy, in particular the sharp increase in oil prices,
the dramatic decline in cattle prices and the world recession, have adversely
affected the open Irish economy. Real GNP grew only by 0.2% in 1974. ln-
dustrial investment did not increase over 1973 and unemployment climbed to
10%. Inflation accelerated to 17% compared with 11% in 1973, mainly due to
increases in import prices and rapidly rising wages. Nominal wages, which
are negotiated annually between employers and workers, continued to rise
faster than productivity gains and increases in the price level, causing
concern about the competitive position of the Irish export industries. The
deficit on current account rose from E 92 million in 1973 to an unprecedented
EL 300 million in 1974. Private capital inflows and official borrowing in-
creased substantially, enabling Ireland to finance the deficit and to main-
tain its external reserves at i 495 million as of December 31, 1974, equiva-



-2-
lent to about four months of imports. The primary concern of the Government
in the past three years has been to promote the growth of output and to re-
duce unemployment. To this end, the Government pursued moderately expansion-
ary fiscal policies in the belief that, due to the openness of the Irish econ-
omy, demand management can have a limited effect on the rate of inflation.
However, recently the Government has pursued moderately contractionary mone-
tary policies to curb inflation and to strengthen the external account, but
with limited success.
B. The Industrial Sector
Recent Trends
2.02      For the past decade or so, industrial development with a strong ex-
port orientation was instrumental in transforming the Irish economy from a
situation of heavy dependence on agriculture to a more balanced mix of agri-
culture and industry. It also helped reduce significantly the traditional
dependence of Ireland on the UK market. The share of industry in GDP rose
from 30% in 1960 to 35% in 1973, with export industries growing more rapidly
than traditional ones, while the share of agriculture dropped from 25% to
about 20%. During the same period, industrial exports expanded from 35% of mer-
chandise exports to 60%, reaching i 512 million. Industrial output increased
at an average annual rate of 7% during 1960-69, but declined to an average of
4% in 1970-72, affected by the slow-down in economic activity during that
period. Industrial output rose by 10% in 1973 and by an estimated 2% in 1974.
Despite the economic growth achieved, regional imbalances are still quite
pronounced. In 1971, Dublin County accounted for 45% of the country's in-
dustrial employment, while its per capita income was 30% higher than the na-
tional average.
2.03      Irish industry is now in the difficult process of adjusting to free
trade conditions. Tariffs on imports from the UK have been eliminated by July
1, 1975, based on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement signed in 1965, and
tariffs on imports from the EEC will be eliminated by January 1, 1978, through
annual reductions of 20% which started in 1973. As tariffs are being elimi-
nated, traditional industries have been under increasing pressure from imports,
while facing growing costs and higher wage rates. Their situation has wor-
sened during the recent decline in economic activity. It is in these tradi-
tional sectors that the number of jobs continues to decline. The more dynamic,
export-oriented--and more capital-intensive--sectors have not been able to
generate employment opportunities at such a pace as to absorb the redundancies
from traditional industries and the continued "drift from the land." This ac-
counts for the persistent relatively high levels of unemployment in Ireland.
Industry absorbs about 34% of the labor force.
2.04      Although the dismantling of tariffs will be gradual and special
arrangements have been negotiated to ease the transition, traditional firms
and industries will have to make major adjustments to survive in freer trade



-3-
and to further grow. Rationalization of production to increase efficiency--
which may necessitate mergers or take-overs particularly among small and
medium-size firms--and a drive to develop new markets abroad, are major tasks
facing Irish industry. Industrial incentives and extension of long-term fi-
nance by state-owned financial institutions, including ICC, are expected to
facilitate the reorganization and reorientation of industry.
Industrial Objectives and Policies
2.05      The main policy goals of the Government are to expand industrial
exports; achieve a more balanced regional development; provide employment
opportunities for skilled labor; rationalize and modernize the small-scale
industry; assist industries in adjusting to free trade conditions; and to
attract foreign investment. To broaden the industrial base of the country
and to restructure industry, the Government relies on a system of incentives
which includes grants for capital expenditures and training, tax reliefs,
research and development grants to encourage new products or processes, spe-
cial depreciation allowances, and provision of prefabricated factories and
industrial estates (details in Annex 1). The incentives are administered by
the Industrial Development Authority (IDA), which is also responsible for
the preparation and implementation of the regional industrial plans. The
administration of the incentives in the midwest region has been entrusted to
the Shannon Free Airport Development Corporation (SFADCO). Several institu-
tions provide support services, such as export promotion, research and
advisory services on technical matters, training, etc.
2.06      Although the system of incentives has been under constant review,
no quantitative evaluation of the costs and benefits has yet been made. A
study is now being undertaken by the Irish authorities and the results are
expected to be made available by the end of 1975. The Irish economy has
derived tangible benefits from the incentives system, namely increased for-
eign investment, industrial diversification, increased exports, new employment
and more rapid industrial growth. Upon entry into the EEC, Ireland agreed
that its scheme of incentives would be under review and kept in line with
EEC's overall policies. Nevertheless, the prevailing view in Ireland is that
the economic and social gains that could be associated with the establishment
of grant-aided industries have represented a reasonably satisfactory return
to date on the Government allocations for financing the scheme, and that the
incentives should be continued. The geographical situation of Ireland, its
distance from main markets, the relative underdevelopment in much of the
country, and the fact that extensive benefits have been offered by other
countries to their industry (e.g. Northern Ireland, the British development
areas, etc.) are factors that have supported the maintenance of the system.
Between 1960 and 1973, some 800 new industrial projects were set up with the
help of the incentives program and of these about 560 (or 70%) were sponsored
by overseas firms, representing a total investment by foreign firms of b 257
million. IDA's grants as a percentage of fixed industrial investment dropped
from 29% in 1971 to 20% in 1974; they are projected to reach 26% during the
next several years (see Annex 3). The Government's industrial development



- 4 -
program has been largely responsible for arresting the outflow of labor,
turning a net emigration figure of 44,000 in 1960 into a small net immigration
in 1972 and 1973. Past criticism about the lack of linkages of grant-aided
industries with the rest of the economy, as well as their relatively high
capital/labor ratio, has led IDA to become more selective in the approval of
grants. Criteria for selection include use of domestic resources, preference
for industries using sophisticated technology (e.g. scientific instrumentation,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, engineering, electronics), export-orientation,
employment generation, and industrial location and contribution to less
developed regions.
2.07      The Government has been supporting the development of small-scale
industries as one of the means to correct regional imbalances, create employ-
ment opportunities in less-developed areas where establishment of large-scale
industry would call for excessive investment in infrastructure, and to promote
indigenous entrepreneurship. It is estimated that small industries account
for about 20% of the employment and gross output of industrial enterprises.
A Small Industries Program, implemented by IDA, has been in operation with
satisfactory results. Since the inception of the program seven years ago,
some 1,160 projects involving 940 firms were approved, with a total investment
of fixed assets amounting to E 21.5 million (of which E 10.3 million IDA grants
or 4% of IDA's total grant commitments), and 11,250 net jobs were created or
10% of the total new employment generated during 1967-74 (see also Annex 2).
Small industries concentrate in fields such as light and precision engineering,
fine chemicals, pewterware, metalwork, repair shops, etc. Support services
(see para. 2.05) are also available to small scale industries. In addition,
IDA provides assistance on financial and marketing aspects of the projects.
(For details on the Small Industries Program, see Annex 2; the incentives ex-
tended to small-scale industry are described in Annex 1.) ICC considers the
definition of small industries under IDA's Program too restrictive and this
view is shared by the Confederation of Irish Industries. In assisting small
scale industrial enterprises, ICC considers it desirable to set higher limits
for both the value of fixed assets and number of workers employed, in line
with the definitions applied in other EEC countries and taking into account
the high rate of inflation in Ireland (see para. 4.24).
C. Financial Setting
2.08      Ireland has a long-established and well-developed banking system
with the major UK and North American banks represented. Interest rates are
determined by market forces and are significantly dependent on those prevail-
ing in the UK. As of February 1975, lending rates for term loans ranged from
12% to 17%, depending on maturity. About 30% of the merchant bank loans have
maturities of one to five years and 20% from five to seven years. The stock
exchange is not an important source of funds for the Irish industry. In a
system of free capital transfers between Ireland and the UK, the London mar-
ket, by virtue of its sheer size, has overshadowed completely the small Irish
market. In addition, family-controlled firms have been reluctant to "go



- 5 -
public" while many firms could not offer attractive securities. The steady
decline of stock prices in recent years also affected adversely the new issues
market. During 1972-74, there have been no industrial bond issues while
equity issues amounted to a meager b 18.5 million.  Insurance companies invest
about 80% of their resources locally, but mainly to the construction sector.
In 1974, about 50%' of industrial funding camie from self-financing and sponsors'
funds, 20% from IDA grants, 17% from the banking sector, and 13% from ICC 1/.
III. ICC - INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
A. Establishment, Corporate Status and Branches
3.01      ICC was established by the Industrial Credit Act of 1933 with wide
powers (as set out in its Memorandum of Association) enabling it to provide
loans, equity financing, underwriting and guarantees. It has two branch of-
fices--one in Cork and one in Limerick. It has three wholly-owned subsidia-
ries--Mergers Ltd., Shipping Finance Corporation Ltd. (SFC) and Irish Film
Finance Corporation Ltd. Mergers Ltd. operates essentially as a consulting
service for business consolidation, take-over negotiations and related mat-
ters. SFC handles the processing of shipping loans, funding these from spe-
cial allocation of funds from the Government for shipping financing. The
Irish Film Finance Corporation Ltd. financed films produced in the 1960's
but has since been inactive.
B. Ownership
3.02      The public issue of ICC's shares on its establishment and two sub-
sequent issues were underwritten by the Government. These issues, however,
failed to attract any public interest and the Government now holds all but
E 642 of the paid-up capital of i 8.8 million.
C. Board of Directors
3.03      ICC's Board of seven members (Annex 4) is appointed by the Govern-
ment. Only two members are the same now as when the Bank appraised ICC in
1970. The new Chairman, N-lr. Denis Herlihy, was appointed in 1971, replacing
Dr. James P. Beddy who had been associated with ICC since its founding.
Mr. Herlihy, a dynamic and a highly respected person, is the Managing
Director of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and Director of Aer Lingus.
Mr. Casey, General Manager, became a member of the Board in September 1974.
1/ For the prospects of the Irish economy see para. 6.01



6-
All Board members are well-qualified private businessman, industrialists and
bankers. The Board meets once a month.
3.04      Since the new Chairman assumed office, there has been more delega-
tion of authority to the Management which now has the authority to approve
loans and investments up to i 30,000 within the exposure limits set forth
in the Policy Statement. This has speeded up significantly investment deci-
sions on smaller projects.
D. Management and Staff
3.05      There have been no significant changes in the Management of ICC
since the Bank's previous appraisal. Mr. Frank Casey has been ICC's General
Manager since 1969. His recent appointment to ICC's Board is a reflection
of the Government's and the Board's confidence in the competent way in which
he has managed ICC. He is assisted by two Assistant General Managers --
lr. Heelan and Mr. Ryan -- both professionally qualified and experienced.
3.06      Operations of ICC and its subsidiaries are handled by eight divi-
sions at headquarters and two branch offices, each headed by a divisional
manager (see Organization Chart, Annex 5). Under the close supervision of
the two Assistant General Managers, the various units of the institution
are operating efficiently.
3.07      ICC has a total professional staff of 64 including 8 Division and
2 Branch Managers. The staff is well qualified and works effectively as a
team, particularly at the managerial level. ICC generally recruits staff
with high academic qualifications and with heavy emphasis on professional
background in accountancy and financial analysis. Staff frequently parti-
cipates in seminars and specialized courses at the University of Dublin and
the cost of studies for professional examinations is partially reimbursed.
Relations with the Government and Other Financial Institutions
3.08      In spite of the Government being virtually the only shareholder,
it exercises no influence over the day-to-day operations of ICC. No Gov-
ernment representative attends Board meetings. The Government wants ICC
to maintain its full independence and to compete with other financial insti-
tutions on a normal commercial basis. For more than four decades, ICC has
been successful in maintaining its autonomy and keeps all its dealings with
the Government at arm's length.
3.09      When the Government uses the services of KCC, as it often does,
a normal commercial fee is charged. Currently, ICC provides management and
administrative services for the State Reconstruction Finance Company (Foir
Teoranta) which assists firms considered of particular importance for the
national economy but which are unable to raise funds on commercial terms.



-7-
3.10      ICC works closely with the Industrial Development Authority (IDA)
through memberships on Advisory Committees and at all levels in implementing
the development policies and various projects which receive IDA grant aid.
Recently, there has been an increasing coordination between IDA's Regional
Offices and ICC's staff in the two branches at Cork and Limerick. ICC's
project promotion officer, who travels constantly in various parts of the
country, together with the staff of the branches, also maintains good con-
tact with the County Development Officers and the local Chambers of
Commerce which have key roles in industrial development.
3.11      ICC has also good working relations with other financial institu-
tions, particularly the merchant banks. Most of the larger projects sup-
ported by ICC are jointly financed with commercial banks and merchant banks
which provide short and medium-term funds.
E. Policies and Procedures
Statement of Policy
3.12      ICC's Statement of Policies, approved by its Board on November 12,
1974, is shown in Annex 6. The Statement in effect formalized, for the first
time, operational policies developed by ICC over 40 years of its operations.
These policies have proved to be adequate and sound.
3.13      With a view to playing a more active role in Ireland's industrial
development, ICC sharpened its operational policies by developing a strategy
spelling out the particular areas and sectors where it will get more deeply
involved in the next three years. A Strategy Paper containing the essential
elements of its strategy was approved by ICC's Board on July 30, 1975 (Annex
7). In its resource allocation, ICC is geared to play an increasing role in
implementing the regional development policies of the Government. It will
therefore become more active in supporting projects in the under-developed
regions and those sponsored by small scale enterprises.
Project Appraisal
3.14      Appraisals are handled by the New Business Division for new clients
and the Securities Division which processes applications from existing clients.
ICC has simplified procedures to handle small projects. Division and Branch
Managers are authorized to approve loans up to E 15,000 and the Case Review
Committee (composed of ICC's top management) can approve loans up to E 30,000.
3.15      ICC has made a conscientious effort to improve its project appraisal
work in line with suggestions made by the Bank at the time of the first Bank
loan in 1971. One engineer and one economist were employed in 1971. however,
ICC subsequently felt that such personnel could be better utilized if they
were assigned to do overall appraisal and supervision work instead of focus-
sing only on the technical or economic aspects of a project. The engineer
was thus appointed Manager of the Securities (Repeat Business) Division and
the Economist assigned to the New Business Division as a Senior Executive.



- 8 -
ICC feels that it is not practical to expect one or two engineers (who are
usually specialized in a particular field of engineering) to provide a useful
technical input for the wide variety of projects supported by ICC. It, there-
fore, employs outside consultants and has recourse to the Institute of Indus-
trial Research and Standards (IIRS) whenever necessary.  ICC is determined to
further upgrade its project appraisals in the future. However, as far as the
economic evaluation of projects is concerned, ICC's management feels that
calculation of economic rate of return is unnecessary in the context of the
Irish free economy which is generally export-oriented and whose tariff barriers
vis-a-vis Common Market countries are being eliminated in accordance with the
agreement with EEC. The Bank's staff has come to the same conclusion.
Supervision Procedures
3.16      Supervision of all projects is handled by the Securities Division
which has developed adequate procedures. The Division receives annual audit
reports, quarterly or semi-annual financial statements and in many cases,
monthly trading results from its borrowers. The staff also aims at visiting
each of the projects under supervision at least once a year. Because of rapid
growth of its loan portfolio, however, this has not been entirely achieved.
ICC does, however, assign high priority to visiting projects in difficulty.
Projects under construction are visited, on average, about twice a year. Some-
what more frequent visits might be desirable but, judging from the results
(see para. 5.09), the practice seems to be adequate.
Procurement
3.17      Procurement procedures are satisfactory.  Large clients generally
go through competitive bidding before selecting suppliers. Medium and small
clients either do an international shopping before presenting their selection
to ICC or are able to justify otherwise their selection to ICC. ICC's ap-
praisal reports, however, do not include a review of procurement or a dis-
cussion on prices, suitability and basis for selection. ICC has agreed to
include such assessment in future projects submitted for financing under
the Bank loan.
Disbursement
3.18      Disbursements are made by ICC on the basis of certification pro-
vided by the auditors of the borrowers. The auditors examine the detailed
vouchers and evidence of payment prior to certification. ICC also ensures
that its disbursements are made after sponsors' equity participation and
proportionate contribution from other debt financing and IDA grant. In
view of the very high professional standards of auditors in Ireland, this
procedure is acceptable.
3.19      Nevertheless, for disbursement of Bank funds, ICC has been obtain-
ing detailed invoices and other documentation for submission to the Bank in
accordance with the Bank's disbursement procedures. Collection of such docu-
ments from small and medium-size business clients, which do not maintain very
sophisticated records and which either have construction work performed by



- 9 -
small cont-actors or procure imported equipment off-the-shelf from local sup-
pliers and carry out their own construction work has required an inordinate
amount of time and expenditure for ICC. This, in fact, was partly responsible
for the lag in disbursement under the first Bank loan.
3.20      To facilitate the use of the proposed loan for projects of the small
enterprises, ICC has requestedi the Bank, and the Bank has agreed, to simplify
its disbursement requirements. For disbursements for small enterprise loans,
the Bank has agreed to accept certificates issued by reputable firms of public
accountants acceptable to the Bank.  Such certifications will be in all such
detail as specified by the Bank and be countersigned by ICC as being satis-
factory for its own disbursements to its clients.
IV. ICC's OPERATIONS
A. Principal Operations
4.01      ICC is active in five major fields:  Industrial Term Loans, Distri-
bution Loans, Hire-Purchase and Leasing, Shipping Finance and Equity Invest-
ments. Annex 8 shows ICC's total approvals, commitments and disbursements in
FY 1970-1974 and the first quarter of FY 1975 broken down by its activities,
the principal features of which are discussed below.
Industrial Term Loans
4.02      Industrial term loans constitute the most,important part of ICC's
operations. Except for FY1972 when there was a sharp fall in investment
activity in Ireland, ICC's term loan commitments to manufacturing enterprises
increased steadily from b 3.2 million in FY1970 to E 10.1 million in FY 1974.
Approximately 37% of all ICC's total commitments since FY 1970 have been for
industrial term loans, compared with 25.5% for shipping loans, 22.9% for hire-
purchase and leasing, 13% for distribution loans and 1.6% for equity invest-
ments.
Distribution Loans
4.03      ICC has been making distribution loans to finance storage facilities
(including cold storage), transport equipment, buildings and equipment of
wholesalers, export agents, and retail firms. Such loans have recorded sub-
stantial increases in the past two years, increasing from an average of b
678,000 in FY 1970-72 to an average of b 3.4 million in FY 1973-74. Except
for the purpose of the loans, there is little difference in ICC's appraisal
(including security requirements) and supervision procedures for this type of
loans.
4.04      Use of Bank funds for distribution loans was excluded under the
first Bank loan to ICC. Projects financed by such loans are, however, of
considerable importance for industrial development. Especially the distribu-
tive firms including transport enterprises are closely related to the



- 10 -
manufacturing end and can play a significant role in eliminating any bottle-
necks of manufacturers. It is recommended that the proposed Bank loan be
used also to finance projects sponsored by firms in the distributive field,
with the exception of those whose principal business is pure retailing.
Hire-Purchase and Leasing
4.05      Started in 1962, hire-purchase financing and leasing have grown
steadily in importance and constituted approximately 14% of ICC's total com-
mitments in the past two years and 18% of its portfolio at October 31, 1974.
ICC finances only new machinery, up to a maximum of 75% of its costs. Size
of loans varies greatly from i 300 to as high as i 500,000. Hire-purchase and
leasing contracts are generally for 2-5 years and interest rates are higher
than rates for term loans. The effective rate currently charged is 19% compared
to base rates for term loans of 14.5% - 15.5%. Approximately 75% of ICC's
hire-purchase financing has been provided to small industries with fixed assets
below i 100,000.
4.06      Because of their short maturity period, hire-purchase loans and
leasing were not financed under the first Bank loan. ICC has been financing
such types of operations with deposits, medium term loans from the U.K. and
its own cash flow. ICC is not expected to face any shortage of funds for
these purposes. Financing of such operations will therefore be excluded under
the proposed loan.
Loans for Shipping
4.07      Shipping loans are made through ICC's wholly-owned subsidiary -
Shipping Finance Corporation, Ltd. (SFC). SFC's loans for shipbuilding are
financed through a separate and specific allocation of funds by the Government
for this purpose. However, SFC bears the risks on projects financed. Loans
are generally for large amounts and extended to well-established shipping
companies for building ships at the Verolme (Cork) Dockyard. The borrowers
are charged a concessionary rate of interest (now 8% minimum) and SFC earns
a spread of 1%. As in the first Bank loan, the proposed loan will not be
used for financing shipbuilding projects.
Equity Investments
4.08      Equity commitments in the last five years amounted to 1.6% of total
commitments and the proportion of equity investments in total portfolio de-
creased from 18% in FY 1970 to 11% in FY 1974. ICC's low profile in equity
participations is only partly explained by the reluctance of its management to
accept more venturesome financing. More important perhaps is the lack of
potential opportunities for equity investments. A significant proportion of
projects financed by ICC, particularly the small and medium scale enterprises,



willing to offer equity participation to ICC. Wholly-owned subsidiaries of
foreign companies have shown a similar reluctance. The need for equity fi-
nancing by institutions such as ICC has in fact been reduced with the avail-
ability of IDA grants for most projects initiated in recent years. Given the
situation described, it seems unlikely that ICC's equity operations will in-
crease much in the next few years.
Mergers Limited
4.09      ICC continued to provide services through its wholly-owned sub-
sidiary, Mergers Limited, established in 1969, for mergers of companies, in-
cluding introduction of firms to suitable partners, valuation of assets of
merging partners, and arrangements for finance. In FY1973 and 1974, the
company arranged four mergers, bringing the total number of mergers assisted
to thirteen. The company charges fees on time basis, but for the "fall-out"
cases it collects only one fourth of the regular fee. It has a few compe-
titors but, nevertheless, anticipates a growing demand for its services.
Finance for Under-Capitalized Concerns
4.10      ICC continued to be the responsible agency for implementing the
Program for Provision of Finance for Under-Capitalized Concerns initiated in
1969. This program is intended to assist the concerns whose owners cannot
provide sufficient equity capital to qualify for term loans on commercial
terms. The Government bears the risk of this type of operations. As of
February 28, 1975, approximately I6 250,000 had been made available to the
under-capitalized firms, of which E 6,000 had been repaid.
B. Characteristics of Operations
Operations by Sub-sectors
4.11      Annex 9 indicates the trend in sectoral distribution of ICC's total
loans and equity portfolio since 1967. In contrast to the earlier years when
there appeared to be an over-exposure in textiles, ICC's industrial portfolio
by 1974 was well diversified with none of the industrial subsectors consti-
tuting more than 15% of the total portfolio. Exposure in textiles has de-
creased from 26.5% of total portfolio in FY 1967 to 11.4% by FY 1974. Although
commitments in food processing have been relatively high in FY 1973 and FY 1974
(Annex 10), total exposure to this sub-sector amounted to 12.2% of portfolio at
the end of FY1974. The rapid expansion of ICC's distribution loans in recent
years has resulted in increase of these loans' share in portfolio to 18.5%.
Geographical Distribution
4.12      Comparison of ICC's portfolio by geographic location in FY 1968 and
1974 indicates that there is little change in concentration of its operations
in the two provinces of Leinster and Munster, which include Dublin and Cork
Counties respectively. These two provinces accounted for 89% of ICC's disbursed



- 12 
funds as of October 31, 1974, compared with 82% as of October 31, 1968. For
Dublin County alone, the percentages were 45% and 47% respectively. A break-
down of ICC's industrial loan portfolio at the end of FY1974 is shown in
Annex 11. ICC's industrial loan operations in Dublin County, though fluc-
tuating from year to year, has, on the average, not changed significantly over
the past five years, and loans outstanding in Dublin County in FY 1974 amounted
to 45.4%--about the same as in 1968.
4.13      ICC is very aware of the need for increased assistance to industry
in the less developed regions in Ireland. Consequently it has set a target
in its Strategy Paper that within the limit of its resources to be allocated
for industrial projects, 70% of such resources should be allocated to projects
outside Dublin County in FY 1976-1978. This compares with 55% actually
attained during FY 1974. When this target is achieved, ICC will have allocated
additional resources amounting to E 8.3 million (approximately $18.2 million)
to the regions outside Dublin Country during FY 1976-1978 for financing in-
dustrial projects. In implementing this policy, ICC has agreed to use the
entire proceeds of the proposed Bank loan for financing projects outside
Dublin County.
Size of Projects Financed and ICC Loans
4.14      Annex 12 shows the relationship between the size of industrial proj-
ects financed by ICC and the loans made in FY1973 and FY1974. In FY1973, ap-
proximately 42% of the total amount of the industrial term loans was made to
finance projects costing less than i 200,000 each while only 21% was made to
projects costing more than i 800,000. In FY1974, the pattern was quite dif-
ferent: while 19% of ICC's term loans were extended to projects costing
6 200,000 or less, 42% was made available to projects costing E 800,000 or
more. The average size of ICC's loans to small projects (below E 400,000 in
terms of cost) was E 42,900 in FY1973 and i 54,900 in FY1974 while the average
of its loans to large projects (above b 800,000) was E 380,000 in FY1973 and
i 708,000 in FY1974.
4.15      ICC's operations consist of a large number of term loans of rela-
tively small size. In FY1973, 58 out of 75 term loans were for amounts of
less than i 75,000 representing 30% of the total amount of term loans. In
FY1974, 52 out of 81 loans representing 13% in amount belonged to this cate-
gory. The two largest of the 156 term loans made in these two years amounted
to E 1 million each. The average size of all ICC's term loans was L 72,500
in FY1973 and i 124,500 in FY1974.
4.16      While it has been ICC's consistent policy to support small industries
there is still considerable room for expansion in this sector. ICC has been
stressing security requirement in its lending to small industries and this can
be relaxed somewhat so that more small industries projects would be able to
benefit from its financing. In order to play a more active role in financing



- 13 -
the small industries sector, ICC will aim at devoting 30% of its resources
for industrial projects to finance projects sponsored by the small enterprises
with total fixed assets below 1 400,000 and number of workers below 100 in
FY 1976-1978. This target has been included in its Strategy Paper. With this
target in mind, ICC is expected to accelerate its efforts to promote small
industries projects as well as making more funds available to them. The
additional allocation to this sector is estimated to exceed E 5 million in
FY 1976-1978. As far as the proposed Bank loan is concerned, ICC will en-
deavor to use 40% of the loan for projects qs small scale enterprises within
the category described above.
4.17      It is understood that the targets set out in ICC's Strategy Paper,
both with regard to projects in regions outside Dublin County (para. 4.13)
and small small industrial enterprises (para. 4.16) will be subject to revi-
sion in consultation with the Bank in the light of future developments in
the economic situation in Ireland. The basic objectives, however, are firmly
agreed upon.
Term of Loans
4.18      Over two-thirds of ICC's term loan conmitments (Annex 14) in FY
1973/74, both in number and amounts were for loans of over eight years since
borrowers are normally able to obtain financing up to seven years from com-
mercial and merchant banks.
Foreign Exchange Risk
4.19      All of ICC's loans are disbursed and repayable in Irish pounds.  The
exchange risk under the first Bank loan to ICC was borne by the Government.
Except for subsidiaries of foreign corporations earning substantial foreign
exchange through exports, businesses in Ireland are not willing to contract
foreign term-borrowing with the exchange risk. Since the Irish pound is
freely convertible, firms normally convert the local funds into the currency
required for procurement of plant and equipment abroad. ICC has been unable
to relend the proceeds of the first EIB loan of E 2.5 million contracted in
1974. because the borrowers have been unwilling to accept the foreign ex-
change risk. 1/
4.20      Under the circumstances, it would be even more difficult to pass
the exchange risks to small and medium-scale businesses since these firms are
least capable of bearing such risks. It is clear that if the Bank were to in-
sist on passing the risk to the borrowers, ICC would not be able to utilize
1/   The Government did not provide the protection against foreign exchange
risk on this loan from EIB because such protection was not given for
other EIB loans received by other Government institutions.



- 14 -
the loan for any small and medium-scale projects. The Government will there-
fore, continue to cover the risk for the second Bank loan and its agreement to
this effect has been obtained during negotiations. However, and in spite of
discouraging experience to date, ICC will continue its efforts to pass the
exchange risk to borrowers who are able to assume such risk. In order to
make such option sufficiently attractive, ICC will offer the Bank funds (as
well as other foreign exchange funds) to borrowers who accept the exchange
risk at a lower interest rate, say 13%. In periods of high interest rates
(as at present with interest rate on local funds at about 15-17%) there mi,ht
be some firms which would find such offer sufficiently attractive.
Interest Rates and Spread on Bank Loan
4.21      ICC's minimum lending rates, including "base rates" on term loans
and "flat rates" on hire-purchase financing, are fixed by its Board subject
to periodic review and amendment. In fixing these rates, ICC follows very
closely the prevailing financial market conditions and rates offered by its
competitors. The Government has never imposed restrictions on ICC's lending
rates.  Annex 15 shows the interest rates charged by ICC in recent years.
Actual rates on term loans negotiated with clients generally tend to be 1 to
1.5% higher than the "base rates" depending upon size of loan, security
offered, etc.
4.22      ICC is currently operating under very high interest rates.  Rates
of up to 10-12% are currently offered to depositors and, since August 1974,
ICC's base rates on term lending have been 14.5-15.5%. Rates on some recent
term loans have been as high as 17%. The effective rate on hire-purchase
loans is approximately 19%.
4.23      The questions of exchange risk, ICC's interest rate and spread on
Bank funds are closely related. It is expected that most of the proceeds of
the proposed second Bank loan will be on-lent to borrowers who will not
exercise the option of bearing the exchange risk which will be on account of
the Government. Unless the rates on term loans drop sharply during the next
2-3 years, ICC's spread on Bank funds is likely to be very high (currently
running at 6 1/2-8 1/2Z.)
4.24      In view of the high interest spread on the Bank loan, discussions
on limitation of the spread to ICC and proper utilization of the excess portion
of it were held during the loan negotiations.  The idea of giving some compen-
sation to the Government for its bearing of the foreign exchange risk was
dropped because the Government does not expect any compensation of this nature
related to the proposed Bank loan. The agreement arrived at was that since ICC
is expected to play a more significant role in assisting small scale enterprises
and supporting Government's regional development efforts, it could use the
excess portion of the spread for financing its promotional activities. It was
agreed that the net spread on the Bank loan accruing to ICC will be limited to



- 15 -
4% and the balance will be paid to a Fund to be called the Development Fund
which will be administered by ICC. The Development Fund will be used to
finance ICC's activities directly related to the promotion of small scale
enterprises and regional development. It was also agreed that those enter-
prises which have a total amount of fixed assets not exceeding E 400,000
and employ no more than 100 workers are classified as small scale enterprises.
The size is twice that defined under the IDA Small Industries Program. In
view of the high rate of inflation in Ireland and the comparative criteria
used by the EEC countries, the expansion of the definition currently applied
by IDA is justifiable. The costs of employing additional staff and outside
consultants, publicity and other promotional expenses will be defrayed under
the Fund. In the initial years, ICC is prepared to make necessary advances
to the Fund so that the promotional activities can be started without waiting
for the Fund to build up. ICC has also agreed that not later than six months
after the date of the Loan Agreement, it will prepare and begin to implement,
in consultation with the Bank, a comprehensive Program for the promotion of
small scale enterprises and for regional development in Ireland. This Program
will be subject to review by the Bank and ICC yearly. In implementing this
Program, ICC is expected to cooperate closely with the responsible agencies
in Ireland concerned with the promotion of small scale enterprises and
regional development.
Free Limit
4.25      The free limit under the first Bank loan was fixed at US$100,000 and
the aggregate free limit at US$3.5 million (35% of the loan amount). In view
of the Bank's general satisfaction with ICC's appraisals and the improvements
noted, an increase of the free limit to US$500,000 for the second loan is
justified. It is estimated that approximately 30% of the loan will be utilized
for 8-10 projects above the free limit ("A" projects).  Since about 40% portion
of the loan is to be used for small-scale projects, the number of projects
under the free limit ("B" projects) is likely to be high. No aggregate free
limit is proposed for the loan. Such a limitation could be a disincentive to
ICC's intention to engage actively in the promotion and financing of small
rather than large projects since, once the aggregate free limit had been
reached, all projects, regardless of size, would have to be given the time-
consuming treatment, in ICC and in the Bank, of "A' projects.
C. ICC's Role and Economic Impact
4.26      Funds made available by ICC since its inception to the industrial
sector in-various forms amounted to E 88 million as of October 31, 1974. ICC's
share in the fixed investment in manufacturing industries increased from an
average of 6% during 1966-1970 to approximately 8% during 1971-1974.



- 16 -
4.27       ICC has contributed to the development of capital market in Ireland
by underwriting over half of the underwritten equity capital raised by indus-
trial enterprises on the capital miarket since 1933 although most recently its
role was not significant because of the chronically depressed equity market.
In its own resource mobilization, ICC has increased the diversification, thus
reducing the share of Government funds from 86% in 1971 to 64% in 1975. The
achievement in mobilizing domestic savings has been more impressive with the
amount of deposits increasing seven times during the past four years. ICC's
services related to mergers have contributed to the desired structural changes
in Irish industry.
4.28       ICC has in the past taken considerable risks on a number of indus-
trial projects which were of vital importance to the economy but yielded poor
financial results. As a result, ICC's own profitability suffered. In 1967,
a Reconstruction Finance Company (called Taisci Stait which was subsequently
changed to Foir Teoranta) was established by the Government to provide finance
on concessionary terms to avert a closedown of enterprises which were unable
to raise further capital on commercial terms because of doubts concerning
their viability. ICC provides management services to this company. The
Reconstruction Finance Company has helped ICC to reduce its risks to some
extent by providing additional finance to those of ICC's clients whose employ-
ment and capital were significant and whose closure would have had serious
repercussions.
4.29      In 1973, the exports of the companies having received ICC financing
totalled b 75.7 million, representing 15% of total industrial exports, and
43% of the industrial exports to the U.K.
4.30      Projects financed by ICC created some 1,350 new jobs in 1973 and
738 in 1974. The average investment per job created amounted to In 5,034
($12,082 equivalent) in 1973 and E 7,790 ($18,700 equivalent) in 1974 compared
to the average of the IDA-financed projects of E 5,917 and E 8,135 in 1973
and 1974 respectively. The sharp cost per job increase in 1974 is attri-
butable in part to inflation and in part to the increasing number of large
capital intensive projects sponsored mainly by foreign companies and moderniza-
tion projects of existing Irish firms which contribute to a slight net increase
in employment.
V. ICC's FINANCIAL SITUATION
A. Resource Position
5.01       ICC has historically depended on Government loans for the major
part of its resources and continues to do so, though to a lesser extent.
ICC had never raised funds from abroad until 1971 when the first Bank loan
was extended. Since then, ICC has made a great effort to mobilize addi-
tional foreign resources in U.K. and the European continent, but most of the



- 17 -
loans it obtained were relatively short term (less than 5 years). In July,
1974, ICC obtained a 12-year loan for E 2.5 million from the European Invest-
ment Bank, which is the only long-term foreign loan from sources other than
IBRD. As for its domestic resource mobilization, apart from Government
loans, it has been successful in increasing its deposits by about seven
times during the past four years. These deposits are normally for a maxi-
mum of six-month period, although a good proportion of these are renewed
every six months. They are fully guaranteed by the Government. ICC has
sound procedures to maintain adequate liquidity against such deposits.
Approximately 50% of the deposits is used for medium-term loans (3-5 years);
the rest is being held in short-term investments and loans. ICC has never
issued long-term bonds because the Government prefers to centralize the re-
source mobilization efforts of government agencies in the domestic bond
market. As of January 31, 1975, ICC's outstanding resources totalled E 59.5
million compared with i 26.2 million as of October 31, 1971 as shown below:
Oct. 31, 1971        Jan. 31, 1975

26.2         100       59.5       100
5.02      Bank funds amounted to 7% of ICC's total outstanding resources as
of January 31, 1975 including deposits and ECGD loan whose term varies from
2 to 5 years depending on subborrowers' maturities, and to 8.3% of ICC's
long-term resources.
5.03      Total resources available for disbursement at January 31, 1975
amounted to E 13.5 million (Annex 16) while its undisbursed commitments
amounted to b 15.3 million, i.e. a resource shortfall of about E 1.8 mil-
lion. However, since ICC has not been able to use the EIB money, the short-
fall is in fact larger. ICC has just completed negotiations for a third
ECGD loan of b 2.5 million which is expected to be signed shortly.
B. Financial Performance and Position
Profitability
5.04      ICC's income statements for the last four fiscal years are shown
in Annex 17. ICC's profitability has, in the past, been very low. Net



- 18 -
profit of L 354,000 in FY1971 repesented 4% of the share capital and 3.5% of
the average net worth. ICC's paid dividends of 2.5 % in 1970/72, increased
to 3% in FY1973 and 3.5% in FY1974. Overall profits have, however, improved
significantly over the past three years and the net profit of i 943,000 in
FY1974 amounted to 10.7% of the share capital and 8.4% of the average net
worth. Operating profit (before taxes and provisions) increased from 6.9%
of average net worth in FY1971 to 12.6% in FY1974 (Annex 18).
5.05      ICC's low profitability in the past is attributable to the low
spread it earned on its loans, poor performance of its equity investments
and the low debt leverage in its financial structure. There has been a
steady improvement as older loans are repaid and loans with higher interest
rates constitute an increasing proportion of its loan portfolio. Yields on
equity investments have also improved. ICC's long term-debt/equity ratio
has increased only slowly but is expected to increase faster in the next
five years (para 6.08 below), helping profitability.
Financial Position
5.06      Annex 19 shows ICC's audited balance sheets for the past five years.
Total assets of E 22.2 million as at October 1970 almost doubled to E 42.9
million by October 1974. Most of the growth was financed through additional
term borrowings and deposits, which increased from I 10.8 million to b 29.3
million over the same period.
5.07      ICC has, in the past, maintained a very low debt/equity ratio.  Total
term-debt/equity ratio was only 1.4:1 in FY1971 and 1.9:1 in FY1974, well below
the limitation of 3:1 agreed upon in the first Bank loan agreement.
C. Quality of Loan Portfolio
5.08      The breakdown of ICC's loan portfolio, arrears and provisions for
the last three years is stated in Annex 20. Total loans outstanding at
October 31, 1974 amounted to L 36.0 million. Of this E 6.0 million (16.7%)
was for shipping, and L 7.3 million (20.2%) for hire-purchase and leasing
contracts. The quality of ICC's shipping and hire-purchase loans is gener-
ally very sound and special provisions are not considered to be necessarv.
5.09      Outstanding loans to approximately 380 companies engaged in manu-
facturing and distributive trade, amounting to i 22.7 million, constituted
the remaining portion (63.1%) of ICC's loan portfolio at October 31, 1974.
Loans to 28 companies had been in arrears for more than three months. The
delinquent principal was L 90,000 and interest was E 214,000. Total princi-
pal of the loans affected by the arrears amounted to E 1,023,000, represent-
ing 4.5% of the term loan portfolio.  TCC has made provisions of i 459,000
to cover possible losses on these loans, which is considered adequate.



- 19 -
Equity Investments
5.10      ICC's equity holdings in 49 companies amounting in total to b 4.4
million at October 31, 1974 (11% of its total portfolio) are shown in Annex
21. Investments in 37 companies operating profitably amounted to E 3.2 mil-
lion, representing 73% of total equity investments.
5.11      Of the 11 investments in companies in financial difficulties, by far
the largest investment of i 500,000 in a tire manufacturing company (Ferenka,
Ltd.) is guaranteed by a well-known Dutch group (AKSO) and ICC's investment
is fully protected. ICC has made specific provisions of E 339,000 against
the other 10 investments with a total book cost of i 448,000.
5.12      ICC's cost of investment in the companies quoted on the Irish Stock
Exchange amounted to b 1.9 million compared to a total market value of i 0.9
million at October 31, 1974. The decline in value of b 1.0 million is partly
attributable to particularly depressed stock market conditions in 1974. It
is difficult to assess what proportion if any of the shortfall represents a
permanent diminution in the value of ICC's holdings. However, in addition
to specific provisions of i 389,000, ICC has made general provisions of
b 530,000 which adequately cover potential losses on its equity investments.
D. Audit
5.13      ICC's annual financial statements are audited by Coopers and Lybrand--
an internationally reputed firm of chartered accountants. Unqualified certi-
fying statements on ICC's accounts have been included in the audit reports.
The quality of audit is satisfactory.
VI. ICC's PROSPECTS
A. The Environment
6.01      The outlook for Ireland's economic development is strongly influenced
by world events.  Recovery from the current economic recession in Ireland is
expected to begin in early 1976. Total fixed capital formation in 1975 is ex-
pected to be maintained at the 1974 level, but fixed investment in the indus-
trial sector is expected to record some growth, partly resulting from disburse-
ments of projects approved in 1974 but postponed. Tentative estimates indicate
that fixed investment in the industrial sector in 1975-1977 would reach an aver-
age annual growth rate of 16%. Foreign investment is expected to continue the
increasing trend started in 1973, as companies seek to take advantage of the
labor surplus and generous incentives in Ireland as well as of the free access



- 20 -
to the EEC. The level of unemployment is not likely to fall much below the
present high level of 10% before 1976. Consumer prices are likely to rise at
least as fast in 1975 as in 1974, but are expected to decline in 1976 provided
that world prices would decline and wage increases would be contained within
cost of living increases. Industrial exports may grow marginally due to the
weak demand abroad, but beef and milk prices are expected to rise sharply.
As a result, the current account deficit in 1975 is projected to decline to
E 175 million, compared with E 300 million in 1974. Even with further in-
creases in the inflow of private capital and higher transfers from the EEC,
Government borrowing would have to remain at a high level. However, the Gov-
ernment finds it increasingly more difficult to raise funds in overseas
capital markets.
B. Forecasts of Operations
6.02      ICC's forecasts of approvals, commitments and disbursements for
1975-1979 are shown in Annex 22. Assumptions are given in Annex 23.
6.03      ICC estimates that its commitments (excluding shipping loans) in
1975 would amount to i 19.8 million which equals the level of operations
reached in 1974. Given the economic downturn and weakening demand for in-
vestment credit in the first half of 1975, this would be the maximum that
ICC can expect to achieve for the year. In the next four years (1976-1979),
ICC's commitments are expected to grow at an average rate of about 20% per
year. Compared with an actual growth of 25% in 1973 and 45% in 1974, ICC's
forecasts are reasonable, and possibly on the low-side, particularly since
such projections include the effect of inflation, recently around 22% per
year.
6.04      Total disbursements of i 47.3 million over 1975-1977 represent,
on average, about 10% of total estimated fixed investments in the industrial
sector. ICC's contribution, in terms of its disbursements, to capital forma-
tion in the industrial sector is expected to maintain the 10% level in the
next four years.
C. Resource Requirements
6.05      Based upon the above forecast of operations, ICC's total commitments
(excluding shipping finance) over the next four years is expected to amount
to h 108.8 million. ICC's resulting resource requirements for the period
February 1975 to October 1978 and tne expected sources to finance them are
shown in Annex 24. Almost 60% of the estimated total resource needs of i 97.8
million for the period from February 1, 1975 to October 31, 1978 is to be fi-
nanced from local sources including E 13.5 million in Government loans, i 13.0
million in additional deposits and E 29.5 million from ICC's own cash generation.



- 21 -
Foreign borrowings (Bank excluded) are expected to contribute E 15.0 million.
ICC expects to borrow E 6.5 million from EIB during 1976-78, provided the ex-
change risk problem is resolved. ICC already negotiated a third loan from
ECGD (UK) of i 2.5 million and expects to borrow i 2.0 million in the next
three years. The resulting resource gap as of October 31, 1978 amounts to
b 24.8 million ($54 million). The proposed Bank loan of US$30 million (En 13.6
million) will provide about 55% of the resource gap and 14% of ICC's overall
resource needs (excluding shipping finance) during the period when the loan
is expected to be committed (1976-78). No specific plans have been formulated
to finance the balance of the gap of about E 11.2 million. ICC expects, how-
ever, that additional borrowings from the Government and EIB will be arranged.
Mainly, ICC expects to borrow from the international capital markets.
D. Financial Prospects
6.06      Annex 26 shows ICC's projected income statements for FY1975-1979.
Both because of higher interest rates and increased debt leverage, the recent
improvement in overall profitability is expected to continue. Assuming an
average lending rate of about 15% over the next few years, the spread on ICC's
borrowed funds, which has averaged less than 1% in the past, is expected to
increase to about 2%. Operating profit (before provisions and taxes) is ex-
pected to increase from 10.7% of average net worth in FY1975 to 17.7% by
FY1979. Return on equity should average about 9% from 1976 onwards. Interest
coverage is forecast at a satisfactory level of about 1.3%.
Financial Structure
6.07      With the level of operations foreseen for the next five years, ICC's
total assets are expected to increase from about E 60 million at the end of
FY1975 to about in 148 million by FY1979 (Annex 27). Total long-term debt is
expected to increase from h 37 million in FY1975 to En 104 million by FY1979.
The long-term debt/equity ratio would increase from 3:1 in 1975 to 4.8:1 in
1977 and 6.5:1 in FY1979, assuming no addition to equity other than retained
profits.
Debt/Equity Limitation
6.08      In view of ICC's sound portfolio, adequate provisions and its
adequate appraisal and supervision procedures, it is recommended that the
limitation on ICC's debt/equity ratio be increased from 3:1 to 6:1 under the
proposed loan. ICC is expected to reach that limitation in 1979. Although
no plans have yet been made for an increase in share capital, the Government
can be relied upon to contribute additional equity to conform to the limita-
tion agreed upon between ICC and the Bank.



- 22 -
VII. THE LOAN - ITS OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The proposed loan to ICC is justified because it could be utilized
(i) to support Ireland's efforts in reducing regional imbalances in the indus-
trial development within the country; and (ii) to support the expansion of
small scale industrial projects. A more balanced industrial development
should be accompanied by higher levels of employment and sustain the more
intensive utilization of the domestic labor force and entrepreneurial skills.
Both of these objectives figure high on Ireland's strategies for economic
development which the Bank in its evaluation considers appropriate and de-
sirable.
7.02      ICC itself has been playing its role in the context of these objec-
tives. As discussed in the report (paras. 4.12-4.17), ICC's financing of
projects in the less developed areas as well as small-scale projects has been
significant. It has formulated strategies for its own operations for the next
five years which gives an emphasis in general term to these two objectives
(Annex 7). In order to assure that these objectives will be achieved, ICC
has stated its targets in concrete terms, and included these targets in its
Strategy Paper approved by its Board.
7.03      ICC is a well-established, well-managed and experienced institution.
As would be expected, the institution-building impact of Bank lending to ICC
has been less significant than in most other Bank/DFC operations. Neverthe-
less, ICC's association with the Bank has had its fringe benefits in terms of
improved project appraisal and supervision procedures. Improvements have also
been achieved in internal reporting and management information.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS AND AGREEMENTS REACHED
8.01      ICC continues to be a creditworthy and suitable borrower of the Bank.
It is capable of using the Bank's funds to meet the objectives of the loan.
A loan of US$30.0 million equivalent is recommended. The loan should be made
on the Bank's normal terms and conditions as applicable to DFC loans, includ-
ing a standard commitment charge, with a repayment schedule not to exceed 15
years including a grace period of approximately three years and reflecting
composite repayments of sub-loans. The loan will be used to finance the for-
eign exchange component of ICC's loans to and equity investments in industrial
projects. The proceeds of the loan may also be utilized to finance ICC's
distribution projects (i.e. warehouses, transport equipment, cold storage
facilities) with the exception of retail outlets.  As under the first Bank
loan, the second loan will be available to finance:
(i) 70% of the invoice price of imported goods purchased from
domestic suppliers;
(ii) 35% of factory construction costs.



- 23 -
8.02      In view of ICCTs sound portfolio and adequate provisions and its
acceptable appraisal and supervision procedures, it is recommended that the
debt/equity limitation be increased to 6:1 (para 6.08). ICC's free limit for
sub-projects should be increased to US$500,000 equivalent, with no aggregate
free limit (para. 4.25).
8.03      In order to enable ICC to use the proceeds of the proposed loan for
projects sponsored by small enterprises, it is recommended that for the pur-
poses of disbursements for projects sponsored by such enterprises, the Bank
should accept certificates issued by reputable firms of public accountants
acceptable to the Bank and counter-signed by ICC (para. 3.20).
8.04      During loan negotiations, the following agreements were reached:
(i) ICC would adopt a policy that of its resources to be allocated
for industrial projects in FY1976-78, 70% would be allocated
to projects in regions outside Dublin County. This policy is
included in ICC's Strategy Paper which was approved by its
Board on July 30, 1975. In line with this policy, the entire
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be used for the finan-
cing of projects located in such regions (para. 4.13).
(ii)  ICC would allocate 30% of its resources for industrial projects
in FY1976-78 to small scale enterprises with total fixed assets
of no more than i7 400,000 and employing no more than 100 workers.
ICC will endeavor to use 40% of the Bank loan to finance proj-
ects of small scale enterprises (para. 4.16).
(iii) It is understood that the targets spelled out in the Strategy
Paper and the intended allocation of Bank funds for projects in
regions outside Dublin County and small enterprises will be
subject to revision in consultation with the Bank in light of
the economic situation in Ireland (4.17).
(iv)  ICC will make an effort to pass the foreign exchange risk
on Bank funds to the sub-borrowers. Since not many sub-borrowers
are likely to accept this risk given the situation in Ireland,
the Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on that
portion of the loan on which such risk cannot be passed to the
sub-borrowers (paras. 4.19 and 4.20).
(v) ICC's net spread on the proposed Bank loan will be limited to
4% with the balance to be paid to the Development Fund which will
be used by ICC to finance its activities for regional development
and the promotion of small-scale enterprises (para. 4.24).






AA\T4EX I
INCENTIVES FOR INDUSTRY IN IRELAND
The system of incentives for industrial development in Ireland
has evolved since the early 1950's, when the country turned from import
substitution to export oriented industries. Ireland's entry into the EEC
has not altered the system; the protocol signed between the EEC and the Irish
delegates permits the country to keep its full package of incentives. However,
these incentives must be reviewed by the EEC to see if they are in line with the
provisions of the Treaty.  No formal position has yet been taken; it has been
agreed, however, that if some incentives require modification, Ireland will
be allowed to substitute them by a revised package that would be equally
attractive to promote industrial development.
1. Tax Reliefs
Industries are completely exempt from taxes on profits derived
from exports of goods manufactured in Ireland for fifteen consecutive years.
Thereafter they are entitled to partial tax relief, accounting to 80% for
the first following year, and 65%, 50%, 35% and 15% for the second, third
fourth and fifth years, respectively. In no case will the tax relief be
extended after April 1990.
Projects located in the Shannon Airport Free Zone are totally
tax exempt until 1990.
2. Double Taxation Agreements
Ireland has agreements with a number of other countries to avoid
or mitigate the effects of double taxation. Many agreements establish verJ
favorable tax treatment in the foreign countries in respect of profits
repatriated from Ireland when these are export tax exempted in Ireland.
3. Depreciation Allowances
In calculating profits for tax purposes, depreciation deductions
are allowed as follows:
(a)  Plant and Machinery
Annual allowances may vary with the estimated useful life
of the different types of plant and machinery. In the
case of new plant and equipment (excluding road vehicles)
the annual allowance may be of 10%, 12.5% or 25%o
In the Designated Areas there is no limit on depreciation in
relation to new plant and machinery (except road vehicles)
brought into use at any time. For the remainder of the
country, free depreciation applies to plant and machinery
brought into use in the period April 1, 1971 to April 1, 1977,



AMiEX 1
Page 2 of 14
Where free depreciation is not claimed, there may be an
initial allowance for capital expenditure in the period April 1
1971 - April 1, 1977 of 100% of the total expenditure.
In addition, manufacturers in the Designated Areas are given
an investment allowance for tax purpose of 20% of capital
expenditure on new plant and machinery incurred up to April 1,
1977 (thus a total of 120% of the cost can be deducted for
tax purposes).
(b)  Industrial Buildings
An initial allowance of 50i, may be claimed for capital expen-
diture incurred up to April 1, 1977  on the construction
of an industrial building or structure.
For buildings which qualify for the initial allowance described
above, an annual allowance of 5% may be deducted in the following years.
4. Grants
The scheme of grants to industry was first introduced in 1952. The
system is at present implemented by the Industrial Development Authority
(IDA), created in 1950. The grants are integrated in the Regional Industrial
Plans 1972-77, which are in the process of being revised to incorporate recent
developments. Grants are given by IDA after the analysis of the projects and
their likelihood to fulfill the goals of industrial development, in particular
employment creation and effect on the less-developed areas.
4.1 New Industry Program
New industries may receive grants to finance fixed assets and the
cost of training workers.
For fixed assets, the limit for capital grant is:
(a) In the Designated Areas, 50% of eligible fixed assets.
(b) In the Non-Designated Areas, excluding County Dublin, 35%.
(c) In County Dublin the new industry is encouragedby grants
only when its location in other areas of the country is not
feasible.
Training grants are determined by the conditions of each individual
project.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4
L.2  Small Industries Program
This Program was introduced in April 1967 and it includes both
capital and training grants. Eligible firms are those with fixed assets
of I 200,000 or less and not more than 50 employed in the Designated areas.
For the non-Designated areas, the limits are f 120,000 for fixed assets
*              and 30 for employment0  In the Dublin area only small industries in specified
sectors qualify for the program.
The capital grants can be up to a maximum of 60 percent of the
cost of fixed assets in the Designated Areas, and of 40 percent in the Non-
Designated Areas. Training grants are flexible decided on case by case.
4.3 Re-equipment Grants
The program for modernization, improvement or expansion of existing
industries has been effective since March 1, 1968. Grants can be given to
finance modernization of plant and machinery and for training. The maximum
limits are 35 percent of eligible costs in the Designated Areas and 25 per-
cent in the Non-Designated Areas. There is a maximum grant of E 350,000 per
firm.
4.4 Product and Process Development Scheme
Research and development grants to encourage new products or new
processes were introduced in April, 1970. Expenditures of up to E 15,000 on
the development costs of each product or process can receive a 50 percent
grant; expenditures include labor and material costs, and the system is the
same for all the country. In addition, grants for capital expenditure on
research and development facilities can be given up to a maximum of 35 per-
cent in the Designated Areas and 25 percent in the Non-Designated Areas.
5. Ready-built Factories and Industrial Estates
IDA has industrial estates in several sites, such as Galway and
Waterford. It provides ready-built factories for purchase or renting,
housing for workers, power, water, roads, telephone and other facilities.
6. Shannn Free Airport Development Company
The Shannon Free Airport Development Company acts on behalf of IDA
to promote the establishment of new projects in the mid-west region. General
IDA grants apply to this area, but there are special provisions for firms
operating at Shannon Airport. New projects established at Shannon Airport
can receive grants of up to 50% of the cost of new machinery and 100% of the
cost of buildings.

7. Training Centers
The Industrial Training Authority (AnCO) operates a number of
training centers i.e., at the industrial estates at Galway, Waterford and
Shannon, and at Athlone, Gweedore, Tralee, Cork and Dublin.

ANNEX 2
THE SMALL INDUSTRIES PROGRAM
OF THE INDUSTRIUL DEVELOPMENT
AUTHORITY
1.         The Small Industries Program, implemented by IDA, was established
in 1967 to encourage the promotion of viable small-scale industries in view of
their complementary role in industrial development.  Moreover, small industries
are expected to provide a considerable number of jobs in many less-developed
areas where establishment of larger scale industries is constrained by the
heavy investments in infrastructure that vould be required.
2.         Small scale industries are defined as follows:
(a) Designated (less developed) Areas: enterprises with net fixed
assets not exceeding I 200,000 and employing up to 5b workers;
(b) Non-Designated Areas: enterprises with net fixed assets not
exceeding E 120,000 and employing up to 30 workers.
3.         Small industries can apply for the benefits provided by the Small
Industries Program if:
(a) they are manufacturing industries; this includes genuine
m anufactures (including crafts), industrial servicing and
specialized scientific services;
(b) they are financially viable and potentially competitive under
free trade conditions;
(c) they do no propose to produce solely for a local market
(i.e. bakeries), or to produce goods which are not suited
for sall scale units (such as cotton spinning and
weaving);
(d) they are not entrants into a sector where there is over-
-capacity (i.e. furniture);
(e) they are not building and construction industries, and
(f) they are not located in Dublin Area, except for projects
involving new products, or employing sophisticated techno-
logies, or projects producing craft products such as silverware,
jewellery etc.
Projects involving cooperation or joint action by several small industries
may be c6nsidered for the Program. The industrial incentives are also
applicable to Small Industries.



AhNEX 2
Page 2 of 2
~;ni. tingDecisions on grants are taken by IDA's Small Industries Committee,
consisting of officials from participating Government Departments and Govern-
nent-Sponsored bodies, such as the Industrial Credit Company, the Irish
Export Board and the Irish Productivity Center. The desirable features of the
projects are: export possibilities, import substitution, fostering or preservation
of crafts ani3 skills, employment of new technology, high standard of design, use
of local raw materials, linkage with other industries, and high labor content.
5.         IDA has worked out a scheme with the comnercial banks whereby loans
are extended to small industries to meet their working capital requirements. The
amount of z lo-in is determined by the firm's requirements and ability to repay;
it cannot 'vxceed E 10,000 per applicant.  The period is up to five years, including
a grace period of one year. Each loan is subject to normal term lending procedures
an(d the rate of interest depends on the cluration of the loan. Security wi2l be
sought where possible but its provision wvill not always be regarded as essential.
Consideration is given to obtaining insurance cover from the key man, pro-viding
the cost is not prohibitive. While the purpose of the scheme is to establish
cooperation between banks and IDA in securing working capital for smal2 industries,
there is no prior commitment by any bank participating in the scheme to grant a
loan in any particular case, and the decision on any application rests with the
bank. The scheme is subject to review every two years.
6.         Up to December 1974, 1.,156 projects had been approved imder the 3Sall
Industries Program; the number of firms involved was 941. While some projects
remained small, others had grown to mediua size and employed 60 to 100 people
each. A summary of data on the Small Industries Program since it was established
follows:
Total capital investment                   L 29,012,700
Investment in fixed assets                 I 21,512,700

ANNEX 6
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
Statement of Policies
(Approved by the Board on November 12, 1974)
I.  The purpose of this statement is to indicate the objectives of the company
(including its subsidiaries) and the policies to be followed in the attainment
of the objectives. The objectives and policies will be subject to review in
the light of the development of the company's activities.
II. Objectives
The objectives of the company are to stimulate and contribute to national economic
growth by:
(a) providing a wide range of facilities to encourage the expansion and development
of industrial, service and distributive concerns;
(b) developing the capital market by underwriting capital issues, by acting as an
issuing house for such issues and by dealing in investments;
(c) assisting in rationalisation in the industrial, service and distributive
sectors through amalgamations of concerns with a view to achieving greater
efficiency.
III. Investment Policies
1. The company will provide facilities needed for the fulfillment of the objectives
set out in II above. These facilities include the following:
(i) The Industrial Credit Company, Limited:
(a) Underwriting services, public issues, offers for sale, stock exchange
introductions, placings and rights issues.
(b) Issuing house services for capital flotations.
(c) Term loans (including a special scheme of finance for under-capitalized
industrial concerns) with particular reference to loans repayable over
periods of 5 to 15 years.

ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3
(b)  Encouracgement of desirable mergers and takeovers and the prc-vision
of adv.ice and assistance in ccnnection therewith - provided by Mergers
Limited.
2.  The company wi'Ll finance projects which may reasonably be expected to contribute
to the economic growth of the country, and which will be soundly managed and
appear, on careful investigation, to be financially sour.d and economically and
technically well conceived.
3.  Finance will be provided for the establishment of new enterprises as well as for
the expansion and development of existing enterprises.
4.  The company will provide finance to enterprises in the private sector including
enterprises quoted on the stock exchange. Finance may be provided for an enterprise
in which the State has an interest an(d which is engaged in an industria , service
or distributive activity.
5.  In examining projects the company will consider whether the size of the facilities
which it is asked to provide will constitute a reasonable proportion of the total
financial requirement of the project and whether the amount and form of the finance
to be provided fron all sources will result in an appropriate capital structure of
the enterprise.
6. As the company is a financial institution, its object will be to finance productive
enterprises, not to manage them. However, the company may seek powers to secure
the appointment of one or more noRd.nee director(s) to the boards of enterprises
financed by way of loans and/or share investment and, where it considers it
appropriate, it will avail itself of this right.
7.  The company will not usually seek a controlling interest in any enterprise it
finances, leaving the management and control in the hands of the pronoters.
8.  The company will provide financial assistance from its range of facilities in any
form or combination of forms, which it considers appropriate.
9. The company will pursue a prudent policy in its lending and investment operations.
In particular, it will aim at restricting its stake in any enterprise to:
(a) not more than 10% of its total investment; and
(b) not more than 33-l/3% of the total assets of the borrower.
10. Development of Capital Market:
(a) The company will have as one of its major objectives assisting in the growth
and development of the capital market.
(b) The company will, where appropriate, engage in joint underwriting and issuing
house operations with other finencial institutions, both domestic and foreign
(c) The company will seek to rotate its investxeent portfolio as opportunity arises.



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
(d) The company will study measures in the fields of taxation, fiscal policy,
foreign exchange regulations and accounting practices necessary to assist
the development of the capital market and will, in cooperation with other
interested organizations in the public and private sector, make appropriate
recommendations for the adoption of such measures.
IV. Financial Policies
1.  Security for Loans:
The company will acquire such security, if any, for the loans it provides as it
considers appropriate. It will have regard not only to the adequacy of the security
available, but also to the prospective ability of the enterprise to make profits
and to cover repayments.
2.  Borrowing by the Company:
(a)  To finance its operations the company will accept deposits and borrow in Ireland
or abroad by entering into loan agreements and/or by the issue of bonds.
(b) In regard to the exchange risk on borrowings in foreign currencies the company
will look to the Minister for Finance to undertake the risk or seek to pass on
such risk in making loans.
(c) The company will aim to arrange its borrowings so as to maintain an appropriate
relationship between the duration of its liabilities and the duration of its

ANNEX 7
THE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT COMPANY, LIMITED
Strategv Paper /i
Finance for Regional Development and for Small Scale Development Enterprises
1.        This strategy paper has been prepared by ICC in consultation with
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and
concentrates on the important areas of finance for regional development
and small scale development enterprises. The paper should be read in the
context of ICC's overall aim of at least maintaining a share of approximately
10 percent of capital formation in the industrial sector and sustaining a
reasonable level of profitability. The strategy will be kept under review
by the ICC and may be changed from time to time in agreement with the Bank.
Regional Development
2*        ICC's strategy in financing regional development will be implemented
in accordance with Government policies, which are designed to reduce the
regional imbalances in Ireland while also achieving growth in the economy as
a whole on a scale commensurate with the major national economic problems.
The main objectives of the Government's regional policies are to provide for
the maximum spread of development, through all regions, giving an increased
and wider range of economic and social opportunities and so minimizing
population dislocation through internal migration.
3.        ICC's strategy will also have regard to the recognition by the
European Economic Community (EEC) that the whole of Ireland is a development
region.
)X.       Subject to the foregoing ICC will give priority to projects located
outside Dublin. ICC will seek to achieve the aim of allocating 70 percent
of industrial loans committed by it in 1976-1978 to such projects. However,
it is recognized that there is also need of increased industrial investment
in the Dublin area, particularly as Dublin is facing serious unemployment
problems caused by the current worldwide recession anti increasing competition
brought about by the freeing of trade in recent years. Promotion of industrial
development in Dublin therefore continues to be a major policy goal of ICC.
5.        The IGC regional development strategy will be implemented as
follows:
(a)  maintaining and developing contacts and collaboration with the
Industrial Development Authority (IDA) and other Irish and
EEC agencies concerned with regional development;
(b) building on development and promotional work already undertaken
by ICC's Cork and Limerick offices. Consideration will be given
to the opening of new regional offices as appropriate;
- Approved by ICC's Board on July 30, 1975.



ANNEX 7
Page 2of 2
(c)  supporting and servicing the regional teams based in Head Office
and responsible fo. promotion of projects in the areas rot covered
by (b);
(d)  encouraging the expansion and development of projects by existing
ICC clients located outside Dablin;
(e)  continuing and developing promiotional seminars and conferences in
regional centers.
Small Scale Development Enterprises (SDEs)
6.        ICC has over the years pursued a flexible policy in its financing
operations. For much of its history it has placed a special emphasis on the
financing of SDEs.  In recent years the accelerating development of Irelandts
industrial sector has called for increased investment in larger scale projects
and ICC has responded to that need in its own financing policies. While large
projects continue to be required if Ireland's industrial progress is
to be maintained, it is clear that a renewed emphasis on 5DEs will be called
for. SDEs will develop local entrepreneurship and will provide a network of
industrial backup services which can support the larger companies. ICC will
aim to apply 30% of its industrial lending to the financing of SDEs, i.e.
firmsof up to 100 workers with total fixed assets not exceeding E 400,000.
Achievement of this aim will be assisted by:
(a)  the introduction into the staffing structure of a greater degree of
specialization in catering for the financing and other needs of
SDEs;
(b)  a strong promotional program designed to stimulate investment by
SDEs with provision for a regular updating of that program;
(c) use of ICC's intensified regional program for the identification
of SDEs suitable for ICC's financial assistance;
(d)  in due course, the introduction of advisory (accounting, costing,
and other) services, particularly for the benefit of the smaller
scale enterprises;
(e)  ICC's continued participation in the IDA's Small Industries Program
which is directed primarily at the smaller scale enterprises; and
(f) participation in the joint IDA/IMI management training program
for entrepreneurs and in the financing of suitable projects that
may emerge from that program.
7.        Should economic or social circumstances indicate that the strategies
outlined above are no longer fully responsive to the developing situation of
Ireland, ICC will consult with the Bank with a view to making the apporpriate
changes.
