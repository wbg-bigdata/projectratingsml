THAILAND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND (TOT)
Appraisal of the Third Telecommunications Project
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      The Government of the Kingdom of Thailand has requested World
Bank assistance in financing part of the foreign costs of the FY78-84
program prepared by the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT) for
development of domestic telephone services in Thailand.
1.02      The Bank has been associated with the telecommunications sector
in Thailand since 1972 through two loans to TOT--Loan 864-TH (US$37 mil-
lion) in November 1972 and Loan 1253-TH (US$26 million) in May 1976. The
projects financed by these loans provided for rehabilitation and expansion
of the domestic telephone network, improving quality of service, introduc-
tion of automatic subscriber trunk dialing (STD) service for long-distance
calls and improving access to service. The project proposed for the third
loan of US$90 million complements the first two projects. It provides for
further development of telephone services, with particular emphasis on im-
proving access to service in rural areas. The borrower and the beneficiary
of the proposed loan would be TOT. The loan would be guaranteed by the
Government.
1.03      This report is based on the information obtained from TOT and
the findings of the mission composed of Messrs. R. Saunders, D. Joshi and
D. Mattiske which visited Thailand in October/November 1977.

II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
_ackground and Organization
2.01      Three-fourths of the 44 million population of Thailand depend
for a living on agriculture which makes the largest contribution to GDP (30%).
'Rice, the staple food of the people, and the main export, is produced
throughout the country. The production of other major export items such
as sugar, cassava, maize, rubber and tin is widely dispersed. The geo-
graphic spread of export items, the development of industry in different
regions, increased allocation of resources to rural areas, decentraliza-
tion of decision making to village levels, development of tourism (fourth
Largest foreign exchange earner in Thailand) and effective use of trans-
lport facilities, all place special demands on telecommunications for the
quick flow of information between business centers.
2.02      The public telecommunications facilities in Thailand are state-
owned and are administered by two autonomous entities within the
portfolio of the Ministry of Communications--the Telephone Organization
of Thailand (TOT) for domestic telephone services and the Communications
Authority of Thailand (CAT) for the telegraph, telex and all international
services. A third entity, the Post and Telegraph Department (PTD) under
t:he same ministry, has the functions of radio frequency management and of
representing the Government on all international telecommunications matters.
Ntumerous government agencies and large private commercial entities have
established private VHF radio telephone networks of their own (para. 2.09).
Domestic manuf'acture of telecommunications facilities is limited to tele-
phone subsets and a few types of cables and wires produced in three
privately-owned factories.
Access to Service
2.03      The quantity and quality of telephone services in Thailand are
poor compared to other countries in similar stages of development.
Annex 1 gives data on telephones in service in some other countries for
J'anuary 1976. There were 366,862 telephones in Thailand as of September
1.977 distributed geographically as follows:
No. of     Percent Distribution (%) Telephone
Telephones   Telephones   Population    Densityl/
Bangkok                279,894        76.3          13.2        4.79
Rest of Country         86,968        23.7          86.8        0.23
Total Thailand       366,862       100.0         100.0        0.83
1/  Telephone density:  number of telephones per 100 population.



Thailand's telephone density of 0.83 is low compared to Malaysia - 2.42;
the Philippines - 1.17; and Papua New Guinea - 1.96. Though 76.3% of the
country's telephones are in Bangkok, which has 13.2% of the country's
population, the telephone density in Bangkok of 4.79 is low compared to
Manila - 23.3; Kuala Lumpur - 21.0; and Singapore - 14.0.
2.04      Of the 660 amphurs (districts) in Thailand, only 136 have access
to telephone service (Annex 2). Of the 128 amphurs with a population in
excess of 100,000 each, 53 have no telephone service. In Bangkok, there
is currently one public pay telephone per 2,880 people, up from one per
7,630 people in 1970. In the Provinces, the telephone service is concen-
trated in about 110 urbanh/ localities with about 17.6% of the total
population (Annex 3). Rural areas have no long-distance call offices and
are, therefore, without any access to telephone service.
2.05      Waiting lists for potential subscribers are not officially main-
tained. To acquire a telephone, a potential subscriber must wait for TOT
to advertise the availability of lines in his exchange area and then apply.
Subscribers in immediate need of telephones sometimes acquire them by rent-
ing a business office or residence which has a telephone connection, or by
purchasing a line from an existing subscriber on the open market.
Telephone Service Usage
2.06      The distribution of telephone lines between business and residen-
tial premises and of calls originated therefrom as of September 1977 are
given below. The dispersion of telephone lines between various types of
businesses for a few representative exchanges in the Provinces is given in
Annex 4.
Percent Business      Percent Residential
Lines     Calls       Lines         Calls
Bangkok                47         71         53            29
Rest of Country        79         81         21            19
Thailand             55        72          45            28
The above data significantly understates the actual business telephone usage.
Prior to September 1975, business telephone subscribers were charged higher
tariffs than were so-called residential subscribers; as a result, in case
of small businesses, many telephones were asked to be located in residential
quarters adjacent to the business premises even though the telephone was
intended primarily for business. Further, the traffic data includes only
calls made from telephones in officially designated business premises but
not business-related calls originating in other telephones. The business
l1 Localities having municipalities or population concentration of 5,000
or more are classified as urban.



ard government calls tend to originate during the mid-morning and mid-
afternoon periods, generating traffic peaks which determine the system's
design and costs. Hence, the impact of business-related usage on the
system is much greater than the figures indicate.
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
2.07      The telephone facilities in Thailand as of September 30, 1977 are
listed in Annex 5. The main parameters reflecting the quality of service
are listed in Annex 6. In Bangkok, about 29% of total local calls dialed
by subscribers over a 24-hour period are unsuccessful. During peak business
hours, over 50% are unsuccessful--35% due to called number being busy
and 15% due to other reasons (congestion, wrong dialing,no reply from called
number, etc.). Technical faults in the system also exist due to poor quality
of overhead distribution network (cables and drop-wires), and house wiring
and telephone subsets in subscribers' premises. TOT has instituted remedial
measures to improve quality of both installation and maintenance.
2.08      The quality of long-distance service is also poor due to shortage
of long-distance circuits and manual positions to operate the available cir-
cuits. About 15% of all calls booked are subsequently cancelled by callers
because of unacceptable delays. Over 52% of effective calls take over six
hours to complete. Good quality rapid long-distance service will be avail-
able to some important administrative and commercial centers in the country
frDm late 1979 with the expansion of long-distance facilities and introduc-
tion of STD service under the Second Project. However, large areas would
still be without access to service.
Sector Constraints
2.09      The idleal and most cost effective sector organization for telecom-
munications is to have one entity responsible for the provision and operation
of all telecommunications services. In Thailand, however, the sector is
fragmented with two state entities responsible for public telecommunications,
and with many government agencies and private entities having their own net-
works (para. 2.02). This fragmentation leads to diseconomies and high-cost
soLutions for development of telecommunications facilities to meet the needs
of the economy as a whole. For example, with most VHF radio frequencies
having been used up by other agencies for their private networks, TOT is
being forced to go in for more expensive UHF radio systems for expansion of
public services in rural areas. As a first step towards sector consolidation,



- 5 -
the Government has appointed an ITU (International Telecommunications
Union) expert under PTD to regulate allocation and management of radio
frequencies and a committee to regulate future licensing of private
telephone networks. During negotiations, the Government also agreed
that, by December 31, 1980, (a) further licensing of private telephone
networks will be restricted to very special cases (such as agencies
connected with national security); (b) to the extent possible, all tele-
phone needs of the public and private agencies shall be provided
exclusively by TOT; and (c) all private radio networks will be
charged a license fee of a scope and magnitude to discourage use of the
limited radio frequencies for private networks. This should promote use
of public telephone facilities.
2.10      The main reason for the proliferation of private networks has
been the financial inability of TOT to keep up with the expanding demand
for telephone services. Domestic telephone services in Thailand have
been developing without any substantial government budget support or
significant local borrowings for capital expansion. Consequently, expan-
sion has been and is tied to TOT's capacity for generate funds from internal
sources and to borrow externally. For TOT to maintain in future a growth
rate in telephone development adequate to meet a reasonable part of the
demands for telephone services as they arise, and in order to meet govern-
ment's directive that public utilities in Thailand should develop without
government support, TOT should generate adequate revenues for financing of
a reasonable proportion of the capital expenditure (para. 7.08).
Sector Objectives
2.11      Considering the present state of development and the financial
constraints, TOT has, with Bank encouragement, set itself the following
long-term objectives for development of telephone services in Thailand by
1990:
(a) telephone densities (telephones per 100 population) of 25.0 in
Bangkok, and 2.0 in the rest of country to give overall density
of 5.1 in Thailand; and
(b) all villages and towns with population of 2,000 and over to have
access to telephone service.
2.12      The objectives are reasonable and capable of achievement.  The
tempo of development under the proposed project--which is designed with
the above objectives in view--will be appreciably higher than under the
previous projects both in terms of investment and physical installations
and is expected to be as follows:

Investment Program
2.13      The broad distribution of main plant investments under the Third
Telecommunications Project between local networks in urban and rural areas,
and the long-distance network, which in Thailand primarily benefits the
population of rural areas, is as follows:
Cost          Percent of
(US$ Million)     Total Cost
Local service in Bangkok             120.8               55
metropolitan area
Local service in provincial           29.4               13
areas
Long-distance network                 37.1               17
Rural public call office              31.6               15
facilities
Total                             218.9               100
2.14      To finance the heavy expansion program while remaining financially
viable, TOT proposes to significantly increase the telephone tariffs during
the project period. As a first step, effective July 1, 1978, the local call
charge was increased. The financing plan for the FY78-82 program, approved
by the Government, also provides for the further tariff increases in FY80
(para. 7.08). As a result, TOT's internal funding ratio during FY78-82
will average almost 30%. Such tariff increases are consistent with govern-
ment's overall policy of encouraging public savings through realistic pricing
policies which assure self-sufficiency of public enterprises. The tariff
increase would also provide some measure of price rationing of demand.
Economic Study
2.15      An economic study of telecommunications is desirable in order to
identify clearly the economic benefits of telecommunications and to improve
the quality of investment decisions so that future programs are better
matched to the needs of the economy. Such a study would investigate: demand
and usage including peak and off-peak usage patterns for different user cate-
gories; costs including economies of scale and incremental costs for urban
and rural local, long-distance and international services; benefits to various
user categories; tariffs and the effects of price rationing; cross-subsidiza-
tion among user categories with particular attention to access to service in
new areas; etc. The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB)
agreed in 1975 to undertake such an economic study but, in spite of Bank's
reminders and efforts to assist, NESDB has made little significant progress.



It was therefore proposed that, as the premier telecommunications organiza-
tion in the country, TOT should undertake the economic study. During
negotiations, TOT agreed to undertake and commence work on the economic
study from January 1, 1979 (para. 6.06). The Bank would guide TOT in pre-
paring the terms of reference for the study and on the detailed steps for
collection of data and their evaluation.
The Bank's Role
2.16      The Bank's role in the sector so far has been to provide much
meeded financial assistance which has enabled higher levels of investments
by TOT than would otherwise have been made. Equally important has been
the Bank's contribution towards steady institutional reforms within TOT
such as internal reorganization, improvements in methods and procedures
for construction and maintenance of physical assets, improvements in
accounting and budgeting systems, rationalization of tariffs, reduction
of accounts receivable from Government, etc. These have not only enabled
more efficient: use of the investments but improved TOT's managerial,
t:echnical and financial performance. The Bank's continued participation
iin the sector would further assist TOT in its endeavors to achieve the
sector objectlives (para. 2.11), including improved access to service in
rural areas, further strengthen its organization through institutional
refinements and raise tariffs for maintaining its financial viability
and providing an adequate level of internal funding of its capital expend-
iture. The Bank would also be able to guide TOT towards correct decisions
cn procurement at a time of rapid technological changes and in undertaking
the Economic Study of Telecommunications in Thailand which should enable
both TOT and the Government to improve the quality of investment decisions.

III. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
Demand for Local Service
3.01      Given the large unsatisfied demand for telephones, the lack of
telephone penetration into rural areas, and the relatively poor quality
of service, it is difficult to accurately forecast the demand in Thailand.
Waiting lists are not officially maintained; hence, records of historic
and current demands are, even where available, of limited usefulness and
provide little indication of the rapidity with which the demand will grow
as waiting time for telephones decreases, access to service is expanded,
the quality of service improves and subscriber trunk dialing is introduced
in 1979.
3.02      Nevertheless, on the basis cf analysis of demographic data, and
historical evidence relating to the extent to which increased penetration
into unserved areas has stimulated previously unknown demand, the identi-
fiable demand for telephone connections in Bangkok and the Provinces has
been estimated as per details in Annexes 7 and 8. The average growth rate
in demand has been forecast at 11.4% per annum during FY78-82. This is
considered conservative and below the norm of about 15% in most developing
countries. In spite of the fact that, through addition of about 314,700
new lines in the local network (an increase of 120%), over 61% of the
total demand in 1982 would have been met against 48% in 1977. Even so,
the unsatisfied demand of about 365,600 in 1982 would be 27% higher than
the unsatisfied demand of 286,800 in 1977. Because of this, the risk of
overprovisioning is negligible.
3.03      The important parameters for the demand and its satisfaction for
1972 (commencement of first project), 1977 and 1982 are summarized below:

Waiting Lists
3.04      Given the difficulties in forecasting the demand for telephones even
in areas currently served, to ensure more accurate forecasts of demand and
equitable distribution of resources, TOT should maintain waiting lists of
potential telephone subscribers for all areas, including those without service
al: present. During negotiations, TOT agreed to establish and maintain official
waiting lists :in all areas from January 1, 1979.
Demand for Long-distance Service
3.05      In the past, the growth of long-distance service has been consid-
erably hampereci by shortage of long distance circuits and manual operating
positions. Also, due to lack of local telephone facilities in rural areas,
the long distance traffic potential of the rural areas has not been fully
exploited.  With the expansion of local networks, particularly the improved
access to service in rural areas, and gradual introduction of STD service from
1979, the long distance traffic growth has been forecast at an average annual
rate of about 27% over the project period and facilities provided accordingly.
Given these circumstances, the forecast is very conservative based on exper-
ience under similar conditions in other countries.  However, in case the fore-
cast traffic growth is not realized, any excess provision in facilities would
be used up by additional traffic generated through future expansion of the
local networks.

IV. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      In 1976, TOT drew up a two-phased program of development of
telephone services in Thailand up to 1984--Phase I incorporating the pro-
posed third project for 1977-82 and Phase II for FY79-84. This program
was approved by the Government in September 1977. On review, the Bank
felt that: (a) the rate of growth provided for under the program was very
low and failed to deal adequately with the expected levels of demand; (b)
proposals for improving access to rural areas were inadequate; and (c) fi-
nancial performance of TOT based on current tariffs would be unsatisfactory
throughout the program period. On Bank's recommendation, TOT enlarged Phase
I including the proposed third project to provide for a higher rate of growth
and provide access to service to more rural areas. To finance the increased
development costs and provide for a higher level of internal funding, TOT
agreed to propose to the Government an increase in telephone tariffs. Be-
cause of these changes and the need for government approval of the enlarged
program and tariff proposals, TOT rescheduled the two phases of the develop-
ment program as Phase I:  FY78-82 and Phase II:  FY80-84.  The revised
program, together with increases in telephone charges, were approved by the
Government in May 1978.
The Program
4.02      TOT's FY78-82 works program comprises the following components:
(a) ongoing works under the FY72-80 development program (paras. 4.04
and 4.05);
(b) the third project proposed for Bank financing (para. 4.07); and
(c) initial works under the FY80-84 program (para. 4.06).
4.03      The estimated cost of the engineering program is B 13,732.4 million
(US$673.2 million) including foreign costs of B 6,857.2 million (US$336.1 mil-
lion), and B 563 million (US$28 million) on office equipment and facilities.
The total increase in assets will be B 14,295 million (US$701 million). A
summary of the engineering costs of the different components of the program and
the sources of financing of foreign costs are set out in Annex 9. The annual
engineering investments for the years FY78 to FY82 are detailed in Annex 10.
Ongoing Works
4.04      The First Project:  The project suffered a delay of nearly two years
at its very commencement in late 1972 due to the political situation, and a
delay in finalization of co-financing. In 1975, the project was reviewed by
the Bank. The project period was extended by two years and the cost estimates
revised as follows: total costs from B 2,137.6 million (US$102.8 million) to
B 3,856.0 million (US$188.1 million); foreign costs from B 1,178.0 million
(US$56.6 million) to B 1,789.6 million (US$87.3 million). The increased costs
were covered by redistribution of costs due to the drop in price of copper in
1974 and changes in the allocations of the Bank loan and the Japanese bilateral



- 12 -
lcans. No further change is expected in the project costs. For the
Bank-financed items, the project is maintaining the new time schedule.
US$36.1 million (97%) of the Bank loan has been committed and the
balance will be committed in 1978. However, the contract award for
the long-distance equipments for this and the Second Project financed
under a Japanese OECF loan was delayed by over a year due to a contro-
versy within the Government over selection of the supplier.  The
contract was finally signed on November 1, 1977. In consequence, im-
provements in the quality of long-distance service and introduction of
SlD service will be delayed until mid-1979. The project is now expected
to be completed by September 1979, about two years and nine months
behind the appraisal schedule.
4.05      The Second Project is currently at the procurement stage.
US$13 million (50%) of the Bank loan has been committed and the balance
is expected to be committed in 1978. However, there has been a year's
delay in procurement of the long-distance equipment under a bilateral
credit (para. 4.04). Because of this, the project completion is now
expected by September 1980, about nine months behind schedule. The
cost estimates are unchanged from appraisal forecasts - total:
B 1,929.7 million (US$94.1 million); foreign: B 979.0 million (US$47.8
million).
Works Under the FY80-84 Program
4.06      Phase II of TOT's FY78-84 program (para. 4.01) will commence in
FY80. The total investment on Phase II works during FY80-82 is estimated
at B 4,632.1 million (US$227.1 million) with foreign costs of B 1,900.0
million (US$93.1 million).
The Third Telecommunications Project
4.07      The five-year (FY78-82) Third Telecommunications Project pro-
pcsed for Bank financing is designed with the sector objectives (para.
2.11) in view and provides for a self-contained, balanced and integrated
development of domestic telephone facilities. It comprises the follow-
ing installations:
(a) about 185,000 lines of local exchange equipment (Bangkok:
140,000) with associated cables and subscribers' plant for
connecting about 170,000 new subscribers (Bangkok: 129,500)
and about 6,000 public call offices (Bangkok: 4,500);
(b) about 3,000 lines of local exchange equipment to replace old
equipment and mobile exchanges in Bangkok;
(c) about 13,000 lines in seven existing tandem exchanges in Bangkok
for inter-exchange traffic;



- 13 -
(d) about 15,000 lines in existing trunk automatic exchange (Bangkok:
8,500) for STD traffic;
(e) microwave radio systems on two new routes and upgrading, replace-
ment and/or addition of radio equipment on 12 existing routes, and
adding about 12,500 channel ends;
(f) about 200 UHF and other transmission systems and station equipment
for 210 rural call offices for extension of service to areas now
without service;
(g) vehicles for carrying out the project; and
(h) civil works and other facilities for implementing the project.
Details of the local facilities to be added are given in Annexes 11 and 12.
The map (IBRD - 13391) shows the routes on which new microwave systems are to
be installed and the existing systems are to be upgraded to higher capacity.
Project Costs
4.08      The total cost of the project is estimated at B 6,266.1 million
(US$307.2 million) with foreign cost of B 3,672.0 million (US$180.0 million).
The schedule below sets out the costs of different components. The costs are
based on prices paid by TOT in recent local and foreign contracts for ongoing
works updated to mid-1977 and are reasonable. The local costs include import
duties averaging about 30% of foreign costs of equipment, cables and vehicles.
A Bank loan of US$90.0 million is proposed to finance 50% of the foreign costs
of the project. Financing arrangements for balance costs of the project are
given in para. 4.11.

- 15 -
Contingencies
4.09      The provisions for equipment and civil works are based on detailed
designs and engineering. Also, the continuous and dispersed nature of tele-
phone development with simultaneous installations at a very large number of
locations allows adequate flexibility for adjustments as unforeseen additional
requirements at some points are compensated by unexpected reductions at others.
Hence, a physical contingency provision at 2% of annual local and foreign base
costs is considered adequate (Annex 13).
4.10      Telecommunications equipment contracts are normally fixed price
contracts. To cover possible increases in price up to the date of contract
for international procurement, a price contingency of B 549.5 million (US$26.9
million) equivalent to about 17.6% of base foreign costs plus physical con-
tingency has been included. To cover likely increases in local costs due to
increase in wages and costs of civil works, a price contingency of B 427.3
million (US$20.9 million) equivalent to 19.7% of base local costs plus physical
contingency has been included. The year-by-year increases in local and foreign
costs and the contingency calculations are detailed in Annex 13.

Through an agreement signed in February 1978, TOT received a loan of
US$22 million equivalent from OECF of Japan. During negotiations,
TOT confirmed thLat, in addition to the US$22 million already arranged,
negotiations are in progress with the OECF of Japan for a second OECF
loan to TOT of about US$40 million equivalent and with commercial banks
for a loan of about US$30 million equivalent to TOT. Assurances were
given that no difficulties are expected in finalizing these loans and they
are expected to be finalized by March 31, 1979. The project schedule
indicates that these funds are required from 1980 onwards and would,
therefore, be available in time.
Items for Bank F'inancing
4.12      The allocation of the Bank loan to the project items is set
out below. Allocation of other foreign loans is given in Annex 14.

Contingencies                       17
Total                             90
Procurement
4.13      All itiems to be financed through the Bank loan will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
Group's guidelinies applicable to such procurement. A 15% preference, or
cusLoms duty whichever is lower, will be allowed for domestic manufacturers
of cables, outside plant materials and telephone subsets. To meet any emer-
gency requirements, TOT will be permitted to purchase locally off-the-shelf
items with the proviso that the cost of each such item shall not exceed
US$10,000.
4.14      Under foreign loans (total:  US$180 million), goods worth about
US$:L56 million w:ill be procured through international competitive bidding
and the balance US$24 million through negotiated purchase from suppliers
of existing equipment for purposes of compatability and economy.
Pro'ject Implementation
4.15      The schedule for project implementation is set out in Annex 15.
Annual installati'ons in the local network are listed in Annex 16. TOT has
built up its efficiency and experienced staff steadily during the last four
years and now has adequate capability to implement this program and



- 17 -
operate the facilities installed. It has the necessary expertise to
prepare engineering designs and bid documents (including technical
specifications), evaluate bids and prepare contracts. TOT will also
install and commission all equipment, but with suppliers' supervision
in cases of new designs of sophisticated equipment. For administrative
reasons, TOT proposes to have the radio equipment for new microwave sys-
tems, and the primary and junction cable networks in Bangkok (the latter
financed through Japanese loans) installed by the suppliers. The third
project overlaps the first and the second projects during FY78-80. How-
ever, all installations under these projects are due to be completed by
FY80 when the major installations under the third project are due to
commence. No problems or delays are anticipated in implementation of
the project which is expected to be completed by September 30, 1982.
Disbursements
4.16      Disbursements would be made for 100% of foreign expenditures
for directly imported goods including cost of supplier supervision where
necessary, 100% of ex-factory prices of locally manufactured items and
65% of the costs of items procured locally off-the-shelf. Estimated
quarterly disbursement schedule is given in Annex 17. Bank disbursements
are expected to be completed by December 31, 1982.
Risks
4.17      With TOT's experience on the implementation of the first two
projects and the large pending demand for services, the project offers
little risk. If delays occur in a few works due to unforeseen circum-
stances, this will not normally prevent the use of other newly installed
assets. A sensitivity analysis has been made in Annex 18.



- 18 -
V. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
5.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to TOT's FY78-84 invest-
ment program of which the Bank project is an integral part.
Efficiency in )evelopment
5.02      TOT's investment program is designed to reinforce government's
policies of stimulating economic development and administrative decentrali-
zation in provincial areas while at the same time abiding by the governmental
goal of pursuing a pricing policy which encourages public savings by main-
taining the financial self-sufficiency of TOT. In Thailand, lack of swift
and reliable communications is becoming a bottleneck as government increases
investments in agriculture, industry and electricity in rural areas.  Because
oif the lack of an adequate public telecommunications network, a large number
oi private VHF communication networks have evolved in the Provinces.  From a
national resource point of view, such fragmentation of communications facili-
ties is a relatively inflexible and high cost solution.
5.03      Currently, only 56% of the identified demand for telephones has
been met in Bangkok, which is the hub of the communications network in
Thailand. This thwarts business and government communications both within
the metropolitan area and with the rest of the country since it is difficult
to call into the Bangkok network during business hours.  The project which
will add 140,000 lines in Bangkok will alleviate this pressure somewhat,
thereby providing better communications to the Provinces and to urban busi-
ness sectors such as the service industry, which is higly dependent on
telephone communications and which is Thailand's fastest growing employment
sector. Also, to the extent that good telephone communications is a sub-
stitute for face-to-face communication, the additional lines in Bangkok
should slow the growth of vehicle traffic congestion and petroleum consump-
tion.
5.04      In the Provinces, installation of 44,800 lines will provide more
convenient telephone access to about 13 million more people. An additional
235 out of the 524 currently unserved amphurs will receive some form of
telephone service, 25 through new exchanges and 210 through rural long-
distance links. This development, combined with proposed licensing and
regulation of private networks (para. 2.09), should reduce demands for
costly and inflexible private telecommunications systems. Improved tele-
phone access will also promote the government's goals of stimulating
economic development in the rural areas, encouraging administrative decen-
tralization, the essential social services, and a reduction of the transport-
related costs of projects in priority sectors. In particular, the provision
of services related to health and welfare in rural areas involves, in many
cases, use of staff with limited expertise who obtain direction and advice
over the telephDne from more qualified personnel at main centers.



- 19 -
Distribution of Benefits
5.05      There are both economic efficiency and social equity aspects to
the distribution of benefits from the proposed program. Given the sig-
nificant unsatisfied demand for telephone services in Thailand, measures
such as the Subscriber Bond Scheme (para. 7.09) introduced in 1976 and the
increase in tariffs in FY78 should help assure that, in serviced areas,
individual telephone connections will be rationed in such a way that, at
the margin, those subscribers who are willing to pay the highest price for
telephones (and therefore presumably derive the most benefits from having
a telephone) will receive telephones the most rapidly. Available data
suggests that, in both Bangkok and the Provinces, most new subscribers
will be business or government, or business managers who will use resi-
dential telephones partially in connection with their employment.
5.06      Internal cash based on the proposed higher tariffs will finance
30% of TOT's FY78-82 expansion program and provide the Government with
surplus revenue. In effect, resuming in FY80, telephone tariffs will be
used as an administratively simple form of taxation which will generate
for the Government the local currency equivalent of US$61 million over
the years FY80 to FY82. The revenue accruing to Government can be used
in other national priority development sectors, or allocated back to the
telecommunications sector for more rapid expansion in provincial areas.
If it is used for programs primarily impacting on the general population,
the telephone tariff tax, in addition to mobilizing domestic resources,
is likely to have favorable income distribution implications.
5.07      With regard to a direct impact on low income population, the
program is designed to provide significantly increased telephone access
to rural dwellers (para. 5.04). In Bangkok, lower income population will
be provided more convenient access through public pay telephones which
will be increased from the current one per 2,880 people to one per 525
people by the end of the program period. Thus, a more equitable distri-
bution of telephone access will be achieved under the program. Finally,
the differential in the price of Subscriber Bonds between Bangkok and the
Provinces (para. 7.09) allows lower income rural dwellers to acquire an
individual telephone much more cheaply than their higher income metro-
politan counterparts.
Least Cost Solution
5.08      As outlined in para. 3.03, there is a significant excess demand
for telecommunications services which the planned FY78-82 investment pro-
gram will not eliminate. Though the waiting time for new connections will
be reduced because of the faster rate of giving connecitons, the total
unsatisfied demand in the country at the end of project period (1982) will
be about 27% higher than at its beginning (1978). Given this, the least
cost solution for the implementation of the program depends on (a) making
correct technical and economic decisions when the networks are planned and
(b) following the optimum path in the design, dimensioning and timing of
the many installations which comprise telecommunications development.



- 20 -
Given TOT's existing network and the fact that the proliferation of
private networks has virtually exhausted existing VHF radio frequencies,
the dimensioning and timing of the works under the program, of which the
Bank project is an integral part, are based on engineering studies designed
to determine the least cost technical means for improving service to exist-
ing subscribers, partially meeting new demands, and expanding service into
some of the areas now without service.
Reaturn on Investment
5.09      The internal rate of return on the program, defined as the dis-
count rate which equalizes the stream of expected program revenues which
would have been generated if tariffs had not been increased in July 1978,
w:ith capital and operating costs at FY78 price levels, was negative. Such
an inadequate rate of return simply indicated that (a) telecommunications
tariffs were too low and that subscribers were not being given an adequate
opportunity to express the value of telecommunications to them and (b) the
modest expansion program which is being proposed could not be justified
without significant increases in tariffs. With the likely assumption that
consumers willingly pay the increases in tariffs introduced in July 1978
and proposed for 1982, the rate of return on the program is 18%.
5.10      A rate of return based on willingness of consumers to pay proposed
tariffs is an underestimate of benefits since, among other things, it does
not include the consumer surplus which subscribers and other callers receive.
In Bangkok, an estimate of a portion of this consumer surplus was made
taLking into account the apartment and office rent differentials which
some consumers now pay in order to have a telephone. Accounting for
these observed rent differential payments in Bangkok, the quantifiable
economic rate of return on the program is approximately 21% (Annex 18).
This rate of return is still, however, an understatement of total program
benefits since it does not include other elements of consumer surplus and
a complete estimate of the value of time which will be saved through a
reduction in the proportion of unsuccessful call attempts. It also does
not take into account many of the benefits incurred by receivers of calls,
by existing subscribers when new subscribers join the system, and by those
who benefit indirectly through the better administration of regional devel-
opment, health, transport, agriculture, and rural electrification programs,
including increased urban and regional business and government efficiency.
5.11      Benefits are also underestimated because, while the costs
included in calzulating the internal rate of return are those for extend-
ing and upgrading the network and providing facilities in the newly served
rural areas now, the available capacity of various components of equipment
will only be fully utilized when additional investment is made in the
fuc'ure. Thus, the costs incurred during the FY78-82 period will generate
additional untabulated benefits during the period following FY82.

VI. THE BORROWER
Organization
6.01       TOT, an autonomous state enterprise, is administered by a seven-
member Board of Directors. It comprises the Chairman (who is the Under-
Secretary, Ministry of Communications), the Managing Director of TOT (who
is its Chief Executive), and five other external directors appointed by
the Government. The Board lays down broad policies; the Managing Director
has the full responsibility for day-to-day operations. TOT operates on
commercial lines and has an acceptable degree of autonomy but, like most
state enterprises, its investment plans, capital budget and tariffs have
to be approved by the Government.
6.02       TOT's organizational structure (Annex 19) and the functional
responsibilities of the various departments follow the pattern of similar
organizations in other countries and are satisfactory. The top and middle
management levels are staffed by competent, well-qualified and experienced
officers, capable of managing the present and expanded operations resulting
from assets to be added under the project.
Institutional Aspects
6.03       With the assistance of the consultants appointed under the first
project, TOT has introduced a number of institutional improvements over
the last few years (para. 6.09). These will be further consolidated during
the proposed project. TOT is also being asked to maintain waiting lists of
potential subscribers (para. 3.04), revalue its assets for the purpose of
setting tariff levels (para. 7.04), and fix tariffs at levels sufficient
to provide an adequate rate of return (para. 7.08). The following addi-
tional institutional and procedural refinements would further improve TOT's
in-house capability and performance.
6.04      Procedures for Connecting New Telephones:  At present, TOT calls
for applications from potential subscribers through newspaper advertisements
after the basic exchange and cable facilities are commissioned. During the
several weeks it takes to process the applications and to complete the wiring
and installation of telephones at subscribers' premises, the installed ex-
change and cable facilities remain idle. This results in loss of revenue.
From January 1, 1979, TOT will be maintaining waiting lists (para. 3.04)
and thus have a record of potential subscribers. During negotiations, and
with effect from January 1, 1979, TOT has agreed (a) to review the pending
applications and complete the administrative formalities and technical in-
stallations so that service to new subscribers can be given simultaneously
with the commissioning of the additional local exchange and/or cable facili-
ties, or immediately thereafter; and (b) until such time as waiting lists
are available for each exchange, TOT will advertise for applications for
new lines well in advance of scheduled date for exchange commissioning.



- 22 -
6.05      Management Information System:  TOT should develop an adequate
management information system to provide the top management with continuous
and adequate data on the technical and financial performances of the various
services, trends in expenditures and revenues, progress on works, incoming
new demands, and data on other parameters which would enable the management
to decide on a timely basis on remedial measures to rectify deficiencies and
take correct decisions on investments and priorities of development. TOT
has the capability of designing, implementing and operating the management
information system without external assistance. During negotiations, TOT
agreed to introduce a suitable management information system by September 30,
1979.
6.06      Fundamental Planning Unit:  TOT should also establish a fundamental
planning unit within its organization to: assess the long-term (10 to 20
years) telecommunications needs of the country and set sector development
objectives and priorities in consultation with other government agencies and
private national organizations; study latest technology in telecommunications
and modifications, if any, necessary to meet needs peculiar to Thailand;
assess likely trends in development and operating costs; based on these,
determine least-cost solutions for meeting the development objectives; pre-
pare broad short-term (three to five years) plans; estimate requirements of
material, financial and manpower resources for each plan; examine the ade-
quacy of tariffs to generate the required funds; propose changes, if any,
wa.th their time schedules, in the organizational structure and functions
within TOT (such as decentralization of detailed planning, plant engineering
and construction to field units, establishment of a research and development
unit, etc.); consider justification and basis for domestic manufacture for
telecommunications facilities, etc. The fundamental planning unit, which
should comprise engineers, financial analysts and economists, would also
undertake the economic study of telecommunications in Thailand (para. 2.15).
TOT has internal capability of organizing and staffing the proposed group
and performing the functions outlined above. During negotiations, TOT
agreed to establish a fundamental planning unit within its organization by
September 30, 1979. The Bank will guide TOT in drawing up suitable terms
of reference for the unit.
Staff and Training
6.07      Staff:  Annex 20 gives the distribution of total staff between
various categories in 1977, their pay scales and other benefits. Currently,
TOT has a staff of about 9,500 equivalent to about 26 per 1,000 telephones,
less than in many other developing countries. At the end of the project
period, the number of staff would increase to about 11,800, that is about
15 per 1,000 telephones. This improvement in staff-telephone ratio would
be achieved through increased productivity, economies of scale due to
increased size of unit installations, and improved organizations for con-
struction and operations. The staff pay scales are reasonable. The staff
also receive a bonus amongst other benefits (Annex 20). TOT has no dif-
ficulty in recruiting staff of requisite quality and staff turnover is
negligible.



- 23 -
6.08      Training:  The Telecommunications Training Center (TTC) in
Bangkok was established in 1969 with the assistance of the International
Telecommunication Union under a UNDP project. TTC has a capacity for
training about 400 technical, administrative and financial personnel of
different grades at a time including vocational training of lower grades
of staff, higher level training of engineers and in-service training of
existing staff in new techniques and procedures. (In 1977, in-service
training was given to about 19% of total staff). In order to provide
for future additional training needs, TOT proposes to decentralize the
vocational training of lower categories of staff such as operators,
cable jointers and overhead line staff who are usually recruited and
employed on a regional basis, through establishment of four new regional
training centers. This decentralization would lead to economies in
stipends and transport costs for trainees, and also result in releasing
accommodation in TTC in Bangkok for catering to additional higher-level
training requirements. The tools and training equipment required for
expanded training facilities would be financed from TOT's own resources.
With the proposed arrangements, TOT will have adequate training facili-
ties to cater to the additional staff to be recruited for execution of
the project and for operation of the expanded network.
Consultants
6.09      The Swedish Telecommunications Consultants AB (SWEDTEL),
financed by the Bank under Loan 864-TH, have been assisting TOT as con-
sultants since January 1973. They have advised on reorganization within
TOT, given engineering assistance in improving plant maintenance and
operation, organization of installations, preparation of technical spec-
ifications, and tender evaluations. They have also recommended changes
in accounting, budgeting and stores inventory systems which are under
implementation. Their performance to date has been satisfactory. TOT
justifiably feels that it has now developed adequate internal capability
and will not need further assistance of the consultants after the expiry
of SWEDTEL's current contract in 1979.
Accounting System
6.10      The main weakness in TOT's accounting system is lack of proper
chart of accounts and works accounting system. Also, the budgetary sys-
tem needs to be more fully coordinated with the accounting system.
Recognizing these weaknesses the consultants SWEDTEL have, at TOT's
request, recommended changes (which are sound) in the existing systems.
A local firm of chartered accountants has been appointed to prepare the
necessary forms and translate the instructions on the revised system
from English into Thai and generally assist TOT in their implementation.
Progress on implementation will be reported by TOT to the Bank as part of
the normal reporting requirements.



- 24 -
Dpreciation
6.11       In ac:cordance with government directives for state enter-
prises, TOT uses a straight-line method of depreciation based on
historic costs of assets; on this basis, annual depreciation charges
appear reasonable. At present, the assets are classified into over
40 categories, but the method by which the assets are classified and
the asset lives used is often inappropriate to telecommunications
assets. TOT and the Audit Council have agreed to review the current
procedure, along the lines suggested by the consultants who have
examined the problem. During negotiations, TOT agreed to implement
in its financial accounts for FY80 onwards a more appropriate classi-
fication of assets for the purpose of calculating depreciation charges.
Auditing
6.12       TOT has an Inspection and Audit Division responsible to the
Director, Office of the Managing Director. This group carries out regu-
lar and ad-hoc inspections and audits of stock holdings, petty cash and
staffing records. Their programs are adequate to provide the surveil-
lance needed to ensure proper functioning of the organization. The
external audit of TOT's accounts is performed by a group of National
Audit Council officers. The audited statements which the Bank has been
receiving have been audited in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. During
negotiations, TOT agreed to continue under the proposed loan the auditing
arrangements described in Loan Agreements 864-TH and 1253-TH.
Bonuses
6.13      TOT is required under the TOT Act to pay the Board of Directors
and the staff a bonus of 9% of net operating profit earned subject to a
maximum of Baht 400,000 for the Board of Directors and five times the
average monthly pay during the year for TOT staff. This is generally in
line with other state enterprises in Thailand. While the bonus payment
will increase with the increase in net operating profit as a result of
raising tariffs, bonuses are not expected to exceed three times the aver-
age monthly pay of employees during the project period. This is considered
satisfactory in relation to wages paid the staff of other state enterprises
and the need to compete with private industry.
Billing and Collection
6.14      TOT's billing system is computerized and satisfactory.  However,
the collection system needs improvement. At present, TOT employs bill
collectors to make house-to-house collections of its dues. The collections
are banked every day by the bill collectors into TOT's accounts with a few
comnercial banks. This system is inefficient and inadequate to cope with
the requirements of an expanded network. It is desirable that TOT should
progressively replace the existing system by arranging for subscribers to
pay their bills either at designated commercial banks, post offices, or
payment counters located in TOT's own offices or exchanges, or through
the post using return envelopes enclosed with the bills. The bill collec-
tors currently employed can be given other duties within TOT. During



- 25 -
negotiations, TOT agreed to examine and decide on one or more alternative
improved methods of bill collection, and progressively introduce the new
system(s) from October 1, 1980 with the target of complete changeover to
the new system(s) by September 30, 1982.
Insurance
6.15      The Government and TOT have not seen fit to insure TOT's
fixed assets against losses from natural catastrophies or from fire
and theft. Cost of such insurance is very high and TOT feels that
the wide geographical spread of its assets provides reasonable dis-
persion of risk. This is reasonable and in line with the approach
adopted by many telecommunications entities.
Coordination with CAT
6.16      TOT and CAT, the two entities responsible for development
and operation of public telecommunications services in Thailand, coor-
dinate their activities through joint committees. Also, the Managing
Director of TOT is a member of CAT's Board of Directors and the Presi-
dent of CAT is a member of TOT's Board of Directors. This ensures
high-level coordination of policy issues relating to the two entities.
The present arrangements are adequate.

VII. FINANCES
Past Finances
7.01      TOT'"  financial performance in recent years (Annexes 21-23)
has generally been adequate to meet requirements; its present financial
position is sound. Detailed financial results for the period FY74 to
FY77 have been influenced by some moderation in the rate of inflation
and by a steady growth in earnings, and have been generally in line
with the forecasts during the appraisal of the second project.  In FY75,
due to reduced revenues arising out of reduced rates of connections of
new subscribers, the 9.1% financial rate of return based on historically
vaLlued assets was slightly lower than the covenanted 10%.  Over the period
FY74-77, TOT waLs able to finance about 36% of reduced investment require-
ments from internal cash generation against the 19% forecast.  Salient
features of TOI's earnings for FY74 through FY77 are as follows:

Due to an initial slow start in the first two projects and delays in
construction (paras. 4.04 and 4.05), TOT did not execute fully the fore-
cast investment program for the period FY74-77. The Government did not
invest the Baht 300 million in TOT's capital as required under the pro-
visions of the first loan agreement. However, as TOT had normally been
required to remit 30% of its net profit to the Government Treasury, the
Government, in order to meet its commitment, suspended payment of these
remittances from FY77 onwards until the foregone payments amounted to Baht
300 million. TOT is expected to resume these remittances in FY80.
7.03      TOT's financial position as of end FY77 was as follows:
Baht Millions

Total fixed assets                      4,332                 96

Total capitalization                  4,532                100
TOT's overall financial position was satisfactory. The debt/equity ratio
was 46/54 and the current ratio 2.7.

Revaluation of Assets
7.04      TOT has made a preliminary trial assessment of the current value
of its assets and as a result, it is estimated that TOT's assets are under-
valued in FY78 by about 18% (Annex 24). During negotiations, TOT agreed
to review the possible methods of making a more accurate estimate of the
current value of its assets, and to select by June 30, 1979, a suitable
meLhod, satisfactory to the Bank, for revaluing its assets annually.
Since, in Thailand, Government entities are required to publish their
official financial statements with assets valued on an historical cost
basis, TOT has agreed to keep supplementary memorandum accounts (Annexes
24 and 26) in wlaich the financial implications of revaluation can be seen.
Revalued assets will be used to measure TOT's rate of return for the
purpose of setting tariffs from FY80 onwards (para. 7.08). Trial esti-
mates of rates of return on revalued assets are presented in Annex 26.
Th,a Bank will assist TOT in the revaluation study, as necessary.
Financing Plan
7.05      The rate of investment during the period FY78-82 will be appre-
ciably higher than under the previous projects (para. 2.12). A summary
of TOT's financial requirements for the period FY78-82 and the sources
from which these will be met is given below.  Full details are given in
Annex 25.

7.06      During the period FY78-82, TOT expects to provide 307 of its
total requirements from net internal cash generation.  The proposed Bank
loan of US$90 million, which will be for 20 years including five years'
grace and bears interest at the Bank's current lending rate, will finance
12% of TOT's requirements. Other borrowings include (a) the balance of
US$34 million from Bank Loans 864-TH and 1253-TH; (b) Japanese bilateral
loans of US$57 million from OECF negotiated in 1976, 1977 and 1978;
(c) subscriber bonds, estimated to be US$132 million; (d) customer de-
posits of US$37 million required as security against accounts settlement
and bears no interest; and (e) a further US$71 million from OECF (Japan)
and commercial banks, under negotiation and expected to be available



- 30 -
by March 1979 (para. 4.11). The plan also provides for an estimated
US$227 million for works to be undertaken in FY80-82 relating to the
next phase of TOT's development program. Borrowings of US$93 million
have been assumed for these works. Full details of foreign loans are
given in Annex 25. TOT capitalizes interest accruing to capital works
under construction; the financing plan includes US$20 million of such
interest (Annex 26).
Tariffs
7.07      Until the recent change in July 1978 (para. 7.08), telephone
tariffs in Thailand had not been changed significantly for nearly 23 years,
a:Lthough minor changes were made in 1975 and 1976. In 1975, the free
call allowance was eliminated, but rentals were reduced to compensate.
In the same year, tariffs for government subscribers, which until then
had been substantially lower than those for other subscribers, were
brought on par with general tariffs. Since late 1976, new subscribers
have been required to purchase subscriber bonds (para. 7.09) as a con-
dition for obtaining service.
7.08      During appraisal, the Bank drew the attention of TOT and the
Government to the need to increase tariffs to provide a sound financial
base from which to meet the funding requirements of the proposed develop-
ment program. As a result, the local call charge was increased from
Baht 1 to Baht 1.50 from July 1, 1978, which is adequate to meet funding
and rate of return requirements for FY78 and FY79. Full details of TOT's
tariffs as of July 1978 are set out in Annex 27. The financing plan for
TOT's development program provides for tariffs to be increased further
in FY80 (para. 2.14) and depending on the amount of new traffic generated,
an additional increase in tariffs of about 10% may be needed in FY82
(Annex 26). The proposed new tariffs are considered reasonable for a
developing country which is expanding its telephone services at a rate
similar to TOT's. With the forecast revenues for the project period,
TOT should realize an annual rate of return of not less than 13% on his-
torical costs of assets and not less than 11% based on revalued assets
(para. 7.04). During negotiations, TOT agreed to review by June 30
each year, the adequacy of its tariffs to meet its funding requirements
for the next financial year, and to inform the Bank of its findings.
TOT also agreed that (a) tariffs would be adjusted, if necessary, to
realize an annual rate of return of at least 10%, and (b) the annual rate
of return for FY80 and thereafter will be based on the average current
value of its net fixed assets in operation (para. 7.04).
Subscriber Bonds
7.09      To raise local funds for its capital expenditure program, TOT
in 1976 adopted a policy requiring new telephone applicants to purchase
Subscribers Bonds, the value of which depended upon location (para. 5.05)
and, in the case of Bangkok, the urgency of the application. In Bangkok,



- 31 -
applicants pay B 30,000 or B 10,000 depending upon whether service is
required within three months or later; in the provinces, the subscrip-
tion rate is B 3,000 or B 1,000 for exchanges above and below 1,000
lines respectively. TOT now plans to connect all categories of appli-
cants to newly installed network capacity simultaneously with
commissioning, or immediately thereafter (para. 6.04). In order to
make sure, however, that those in Bangkok who need telephones urgently
can still get priority access, TOT is considering allocating a signifi-
cant proportion of new exchange lines, as they become available to the
B 30,000 applicants. The B 10,000 applicants will receive all lines
left over after the B 30,000 demand is satisfied or after the B 30,000
quota is filled, whichever is larger.
Fiscal Impact on Government Treasury
7.10      TOT will receive Baht 100 million (US$5 million) from Govern-
ment sources in FY78 to finance local costs. However, during the project
period, TOT will pay import duty on goods and equipment for its develop-
ment program (expected to total about US$100 million), and on current
forecasts, will resume remittances to Government in lieu of income tax
in FY80. These remittances are expected to total about US$61 million
over the project period (para. 7.02). These latter payments represent
an average annual rate of return on Government equity of about 6%. The
net effect of all loans and payments between FY78 and FY82 is that TOT
will contribute about US$156 million to the Government Treasury.
Accounts Receivable
7.11      TOT's accounts receivable from private subscribers are at a
satisfactory level. Collections from private subscribers and discon-
nection procedures for delinquent accounts are adequate. In 1976,
during the appraisal of the second project, the Government's attention
was drawn to the unacceptable high level of TOT's accounts receivable
from Government departments and agencies. The subsequent second loan
Guarantee Agreement required the Government to take measures to settle
its telephone accounts with TOT on a current basis. In October 1977,
the Government issued a directive to all Government departments and
agencies, that from FY79 onwards, all telephone charges must be settled
on a monthly basis and that the Budget Bureau shall allocate funds for
the liquidation within five years, of arrears due to TOT by Government
sectors. During negotiations, the Bank suggested that the Government
should forego resumption of TOT's remittances to the Government Treasury
to the extent of the outstanding telephone accounts belonging to the
Government departments and agencies. The Delegation explained that as
the Government had already considered the issue of the outstanding ac-
counts as recently as October 1977, it was unlikely that it would agree
to amend its previous Cabinet Decision. The Bank accepted this explana-
tion. The financial forecasts incorporate the assumption that the
estimated Baht 160 million of long-term outstanding Government accounts
at the beginning of FY79 will be settled in five equal installments from



- 32 -
FY79 onwards. The non-current portion of these debts has not been
included in current assets and amounts to (in Baht millions): FY78-
128.0; FY79-96.O9; FY80-64.0; FY81-32.0; and FY82-nil.
Future Financial Performance
7.12      A summary of important financial indicators of TOT's expected
financial performance for FY78-82 is given below.  Further details are
given in Annexes 24 to 26.

7.13      The projected results are satisfactory.  The forecast balance
sheets (Annex 24) indicate that TOT's financial position will remain
sat:isfactory. They indicate that TOT will be able to continue expanding
its network beyond FY82 at the rate planned during the project, without
exceeding a debt/equity position of 65/35. In fact, the ratio as cal-
culated understates TOT's equity position because the current value of
TOT's existing assets would be more than the stated book value. The
forecast levels of TOT's cash holding are considered adequate to meet
its liabilities in a timely fashion. Debt service coverage by internal
cash generation over the project period would not be less than 2.0 in
any financial year. During negotiations, TOT agreed not to incur long-
term debt without the Bank's prior approval, unless the preceding 12
months' internal cash generation would cover future debt service at
least 1.5 times.

VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) By December 31, 1980, the Government will restrict
licensing of new private telephone networks to special
cases, all telephone needs of public and private agen-
cies shall, where possible, be provided by TOT. A
license fee will be imposed on all private radio net-
works (paragraph 2.09);
(b) TOT will undertake the economic study of telecommuni-
cations in Thailand from January 1, 1979 (paragraph 2.15);
(c) Commencing January 1, 1979, TOT will begin compiling
waiting lists of potential subscribers in all areas
including those now without service (paragraph 3.04);
(d) TOT will revise its procedures for giving new connections
such that, from January 1, 1979, new lines can be connected
to subscribers simultaneously with the commissioning of
additional local exchange and/or cable facilities, or
immediately thereafter (paragraph 6.04);
(e) TOT will introduce a proper Management Information System
by September 30, 1979 (paragraph 6.05);
(f) TOT will set up within its organization a Fundamental
Planning Unit by September 30, 1979 (paragraph 6.06);
(g) TOT, with the assistance of the Auditor General, will
implement by FY80, a more appropriate classification of
its assets in its financial accounts, for the purpose of
calculating depreciation charges (paragraph 6.11);
(h) The present auditing arrangements as described in Loan
Agreements 864-TH and 1253-TH shall continue (paragraph
6.12);
(i) TOT will progressively introduce a new system of bill
collection from October 1, 1980 and complete the change-
over by September 30, 1982 (paragraph 6.14);
(j) TOT will conduct a study of methods of determining the
current value of its assets, and select, by June 30,
1979, a suitable method, satisfactory to the Bank, for
revaluing its assets annually (paragraph 7.04);



- 34 -
(k)  Before June 30 each year, TOT will review whether its
tariffs in the following financial year will realize a
10% rate of return, based on assets revalued in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank. The rate of return will be
maintained at a level of at least 10% (paragraph 7.08);
(1)  The Government will continue with measures established
under Loan Agreement 1253-TH for clearance of past
accounts receivable by TOT from government departments
and agencies by September 30, 1983 and for government
departments and agencies to settle their accounts with
TOT on a current basis (paragraph 7.11); and
(m)  No long-term debt will be incurred unless debt service is
covered 1.5 times by preceding 12 months' internal cash
generation (paragraph 7.13).
8.02      Subject to the above, the proposed project constitutes a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$90 million for a term of 20 years
including a five-year grace period at the current rate of interest.

Return on Investment
1.        Scope of the Analysis:  Because it is not possible to isolate
either the revenues or the costs accruing to the specific elements of the
program financed by the Bank, and because the Bank-financed components of
the program are an integral and necessary part of the total telecommunica-
tions network, the return on investment analysis incorporates the effect
of the whole program.
2.        Benefit Period:  The benefit period of the program extends from
FY78 to FY99, when the equipment provided under the program is expected to
have substantially completed its useful life.
3.        Capital Expenditures:  Pre-investment prior to the project period
and price contingencies have been excluded from the estimated total capital
expenditures; equipment costs have been stated in average FY78 prices.
4.        Operating Costs:  These exclude remittances to government and
depreciaton charges and are stated in average FY78 prices calculated by
using a deflation factor of 8.5% per annum from FY77-84. It has been
assumed that 20% of the incremental operating costs in FY78 are due to
increases in the network as a result of the program and, in a like manner,
for FY79 the percentage is 70%. One hundred percent of the incremental
costs are applicable to the program in FY80-82. In FY83, 80% of the in-
cremental costs are assumed to be the result of additons to the network
during the prior program period, but brought into service during that
year, and therefore applicable to the program. Similarly, 30% of the
incremental costs in FY84 are applicable to the program.
5.        Revenues:  In a like manner to operating costs, incremental reve-
nues have been calculated assuming 20% of the increase in revenue in FY78
results from the work carried out during the program; as does 70% of the
incremental revenue in FY79; 100% in FY80; 80% in FY83; and 20% in FY84.
Tariff increases have been assumed in accordance with previous financial
projections, but the amounts are stated in terms of 1978 price levels,
assuming an 8.5% rate of inflation from FY79-84.

6.        Net Revenues - Internal Rate of Return:  A summary of the program's
cost and revenue streams at 1978 prices is as follows:

Year        Expenditures    Costs         Revenues      Revenues

1979             1662.8         102.8         316.9       -1448.7
1980             2096.1         210.6        902.9        -1403.8
1981             2375.2         353.3       1431.5        -1297.0
1982             2454.4         530.4       2016.1        - 968.7
1983                            616.7       2512.2         1895.5
1984-99                         685.5       2663.4         1977.9
The internal rate of return for the net revenue stream is 18.5.
7.        Sensitivity Analysis:  The sensitivity analysis produced the
fIDllowing results:
Rate of return on assumed net revenue stream:
10% increase in capital expenditures   16.4%
10% increase in operating costs          17.8%
10% decrease in revenues                 15.5%
Two years delay in program completion  15.2%
Combination of all above factors          9.6%
8.        Estimate of Partial Consumer Surplus:  In Thailand, some telephone
subscribers reveal a willingness to incur a telephone-related cost greater
ttkan that reflected in the official TOT tariff schedule by paying higher
monthly rental charges, or incurring higher costs each month just to have a
telephone.  Local businessmen and middle and upper income foreigners and
Thai citizens, sometimes obtain telephones by renting furnished offices or
furnished residLences in which, legally, the telephone can be transferred as
one of the furnishings.  In Bangkok, the practice of obtaining a telephone
through a property rental or purchase transaction is commonly facilitated
through local realty brokers.
9.        Estimates made of the extent of the monthly rent differentials
which exist for representative offices and apartments which are identical
except for the existence of a telephone, are somewhat imprecise due partly
to the variety of other factors involved in finding "identical" facilities,
and partly due to the small and necessarily ad hoc nature of the sample.
Nevertheless, differentials of between US$50 and US$100 and more per month
were observed for facilities that were similar except for the presence of
a telephone. It was also found that property located in the more desirable
business locations commanded the largest rent differential premiums, and
that the larger and more luxurious apartments or business offices tended



- 63 -
ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 3
to command larger telephone premiums (US$100 per month and up) since
presumably higher income businessmen and larger business firms tend to
categorize a telephone as more of a necessity. Given these findings,
an estimate of consumer surplus for the montly rental of a telephone in
Bangkok is made using the following assumptions:
(i) the demand curve for telephone rentals in Bangkok is down-
ward sloping and is shaped in such a way that a relatively
small proportion of the total population is willing and
able to pay high monthly rentals for telephone service while
the majority of the population would be willing and able to
pay only relatively lower telephone rental charges; as such
the demand curve is represented as being convex to the origin
of the price and quantity axis,'/ and
(ii) two points on that demand curve are--2,800 telephones
(approximately one percent of the total) at a price of
US$76.50 per month (the official rental fee of US$1.50 per
month plus US$75 representing a typical rent differential
payment) and 280,000 telephones (the approximate number of
telephones in Bangkok at the end of 1977) at the most com-
mon official rental price of US$1.50 per month.
10.       Calculating the area under the demand curve above a monthly
price of US$1.50 and below a monthly price of US$76.50 and between the
quantities zero and 280,000 telephones, and dividing that by 280,000
gives an average of US$5.97 per telephone per month, or US$71.64 per
telephone per year. Thus, for purposes of benefit estimation, the
value of renting a telephone in Bangkok may be taken to be an average
of US$71.64 per year more than the average rental actually paid to
TOT. With a revised benefits stream including the increased rentals
for Bangkok, the rate of return on the program is 21.4%.
1/ Mathematically, the demand curve is specified as a rectangular
hyperbola with an elasticity of one. This is thought to be a
conservative assumption since empirical estimates of the price
elasticity of demand for telephone services are generally sig-
nificantly less than one (more inelastic).

Notes and Assumptions on the Forecast Balance Sheets
for the Financial Years 1977-1984
Fixed Assets
1.        Gross plant in service has been stated at historical costs.
2.        The depreciation rate on average gross plant in service has been
assumed to be as follows: FY77-4.6%; FY78-4.7%; FY79-4.8%; FY80-4.9%;
FY81-5.0%; and FY82-5.2%. The increases are due to an expected change in
the mix of assets installed. The proportion of assets with shorter lives
will increase over the proiect Deriod.
3.        It has been assumed that the amount of assets transferred into
service is 50% in FY78 and FY79 and 60% thereafter, of the sum of plant
under construction at the commencement of the year and the capitalized
value of the construction program for that year.
4.        For the purposes of this appraisal, TOT's preliminary trial
estimate of the current value of fixed assets in FY78 has been used.
This estimate suggests that TOT's gross fixed assets and the correspond-
ing depreciation reserve are undervalued by 18% at the end of FY78.
Thereafter, it has been assumed that assets and depreciation will be
revalued by 4.5% annually. The latter estimate is based on the assump-
tions that Thailand's currency will continue its history of stability,
local inflation will remain at its present relatively low level, and
imported telecommunications plant and equipment will continue past trends
of price increases, which have been kept low by advances of technology
and economies of scale.
Sinking Fund
5.        Under terms of a previously negotiated government loan to alleviate
cash shortages in 1976, TOT is required to establish a sinking fund in a
government bank. The sinking fund will be credited with Baht 100 million
in FY79, and Baht 200 million in FY80. The sinking fund is netted against
long-term debt liabilities in the balance sheets.

Current Assets
6.        Cash:  TOT pays the staff bonus and the remittance to Government
early in their financial year and consequently substantial holdings of
cash are required at the end of the previous financial year for this pur-
pDse. Other requirements for cash other than for normal operating purposes
are for local costs of capital expenditure and for debt service. Cash
holdings have been kept to a prudent but adequate minimum level.
7.        Accounts receivable:  Forecast levels of accounts receivable are
13% of operating revenue plus the diminishing Government department out-
standing accounts. The non-current outstanding Government receivables have
been classified as non-current assets. It has assumed that these accounts
are to be amortized over a five-year period starting in 1978. The estimated
values of the non-current outstanding Government accounts are (in Baht mil-
l:Lons): FY78-]L28.0; FY79-96.0; FY80-64.0; FY81-32.0; and FY82-nil.
8.        Inventories:  The balance sheet records only those items held in
stlores for operations purposes.  All stores items purchased for capital works
are recorded as plant under construction.
Long-term Debt
9.        Details of the Debt Portfolio are set out in Attachment 2.

THAILAND
TELEPHONE ORGANIZATION OF THAILAND (TOT)
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions on the Forecast Income Statements
For the Financial Years 1976-82
Revenues
1.        Reveinues are shown at FY77 tariffs to enable a measure of traffic
growth during the project period. Tariff increases include the effects
dujring each year of all tariff increases above the FY77 levels.
Staff Remuneration
2.        Salaries have been assumed to increase by an average of 12.5%
per annum over the project period.
Depreciation
3.        Depreciation has been calculated on the historic cost of assets
in accordance with Government requirements for state entities (see Annex 24,
At:tachment 1, Paragraph 1).
Bonus Payment
4.        The total bonus payments assumed are Baht 400,000 to TOT's Board
of Directors, the maximum permissible under the Act, and 9% of annual net
profit to employees. The latter is equivalent to the number of months of
average employee salary as follows: 1977-1.2; 1978-1.2; 1978-1.2;
1980-2.4; 1981-2.7; 1982-3.0.
Payment to Government
5.        It is assumed that remittances to Government of 30% of net
profit will be resumed in FY80 after the accumulation of suspended pay-
ments reaches Baht 300 million as prescribed under the first project.
