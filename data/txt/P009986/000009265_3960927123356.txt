NEMORAbDUM AND RECO)OENDNTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED WAN TO THE INDIAN OIL CORPORATION FOR A
PETROLEUM IRANPORT PROECT
*   1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for US$340 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan to the Indian Oil Corporation would be at the standard
variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including a five year
grace period. The Government of India would guarantee the loan. The proposed
loan would help finance the expansion of infrastructure for the transport of
petroleum and contribute to IOC's efforts to improve the efficiency of its
refinery and pipeline operations.
2.          Background.  Energy remains a critical element in India's strategy
for accelerating economic growth. It is one of the main obstacles to faster
growth of the industrial sector, where persistent power shortages continue to
disrupt production and encourage enterprises to make costly investments in
'captive' power generation. It is also a major factor in increasing
agricultural productivity and reducing the vulnerability of India's
agriculture to fluctuations in rainfall. To meet the rapidly growing energy
demand, the Government currently allocates almost one-third of its investment
resources to the development of indigenous energy resources. In addition, it
spends slightly more than 20% of foreign exchange earnings on imports of crude
oil and oil products.
3.          After successfully reducing its dependence on oil imports over the
past decade, India faces again a widening gap between the demand for oil
products and indigenous production. The widening gap results from several
factors. First, despite pricing policies which kept oil-products prices well
above border prices, demand continues to grow at more than 7% a year. Second,
production from the Bombay High oilfield, which accounts for 70% of domestic
oil production, has now reached a plateau; and third, in spite of large
investments in oil and gas exploration, no major new oil or gas discoveries
have been made during the past decade.
4.          To reduce the growing deficit in oil products, the Government has
three basic courses of action: First, it can, within narrow limits, increase
production from existing oil fields, and step-up the pace at which already
discovered oil fields are brought on stream; second, it can accelerate the
development of indigenous energy resources, in particular natural gas, which
can be used to meet part of the demand for oil products; third, it can import
crude oil or oil products. The options for increasing indigenous energy
production in the short and medium term are quite limited, and so are the
options for substituting other fuels for oil products. This leaves India with
the option of increasing its imports of crude oil and/or oil products. An
increase in crude-oil imports would require costly investments in the
expansion of refinery capacity. Although the Government has been actively
seeking increased private sector involvement in the financing of new refinery
capacity, the prospects of 'rnmparatively-low refining margins for oil products
in international markets mU.,e it economically more attractive for India to
rely, in the years ahead, increasingly on imports of oil products.

5.          The growing demand for imported-oil products will require new
investments in expanding the existing irnfrtstructure for the transport and
distribution of these products within India. With congested conditions on
most major rail atnd road routes, the Government has adopted a transport policy
which gives priority to the expansion of the pipeline network. Experience
with various transport modes has shown that, above certain minimum volumes,
crude oil and oil products can be transported more efficiently through
pipelir.s compared to rail and road transport. Pipelines eliminate the return
movement of empty tankers and wagons, they provide for faster and more
reliable delivery than any other mode of transport; they are also more energy
efficient, and lower the risk of environmental pollution and product loss
during transit. Construct'on of an oil-product pipeline thus provides the
most efficient means of providing India's northwsestern region with the oil
products it needs to meet its rapidly growing demand.
6.          The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is India's largest refining and
marketing company of oil products. IOC operates six refineries with a total
refining capacity of about 21 million tons per year. IOC's extensive
marketing facilities include a 3,850 km pipeline network, 15 LPG bottling
plants, 150 products-storage and distribution terminals serving 13,500 service
and retail outlets. Its share in the Indian oil products market is currently
58%. IOC, which is fully owned by the Government, is also India's largest
commercial enterprise. It has an annual turnover exceeding Rs 140 billion,
and employs more that 32,000 people. IOC's financial performance has been
quite satisfactory, allowing IOC to fund the majority of its investments out
of internally-generated funds. To meet the projected growth in the demand for
refined products, IOC's management has adopted a strategy that is aimed at (a)
increasing the import of oil products, (b) participating jointly with the
private sector in the construction of new refineries, and (c) expanding IOC's
pipeline and distribution system so it can handle a larger volume of crude oil
and oil products. To meet these strategy objectives, IOC has decided on an
investment program for FY90/94 which amounts to Rs 91.7 billion (equivalent to
US$6.3 billion).
7.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The main objectives of the Bank's
assistance in the energy sector are to support the Government in:
(a) implementing an investment program that would provide a "balanced
approach" (i.e. between refinery expansion and reliance on product imports),
to meeting the country's oil needs, improving the efficiency of energy use,
mobilizing additional resources from outside the public sector, and enhancing
the managerial and operational efficiency of public sector energy enterprises;
and (b) mobilizing external financing in the form of cofinancing, borrowing in
international capital markets as well as through direct foreign investment.
The proposed project fits well into this strategy. The pipeline, which will
be financed under this project, gives the IOC increased flexibility in
supplying the domestic market with oil products. It saves the cost of
expanding domestic refining capacity, and permits IOC to take advantage of
favorable conditions in international oil-product markets. The other
components contribute to improving the overall efficiency of IOC's refinery
operations, especially in critical operational areas such as modernization of
instrumentation, process control optimization and computerization, areas in
which the country has been relatively isolated from recent technological
advances. IOC sought the Bank's assistance primarily as part of its efforts
to improve its organizational and managerial efficiency, as well as to ease
its access to international capital markets. Technical assistance during



3
project implementation will contribute to IOC's own efforts to become more
efficient. With its investment needs expanding considerably during the Eighth
Five Year Plan (1990 - 95), IOC will also need to mobilize considerable
external financing. This loan from the Bank is intended to facilitate IOG's
access to capital markets, suppliers' credits and other sources of external
finance. In line with this objective, the Government agreed that the loan
should be made directly to IOC. This would be the first time that a fully
government-owned company in India has borrowed directly from the Bank.
8.          Project Obiectives.  The project is designed to support the
Government's and IOC's prudent investment strategy of meeting future domestic
demand for oil products, with greater flexibility and efficiency, thro".h:
(a) reducing the cost of domestic transport of oil products; (b) providing IOC
with the means to respond quickly to shifts in oil-product demand through
imports, thus reducing costly and risky investme,Ics in new refinery capacity;
and (c) strengthening IOC's capabilities in operating and maintaining its
pipeline network and distribution facilities. The project would also assist
IOC in its efforts to improve the overall efficiency of its existing refinery
operations and to meet the Government's more stringent environmental standards
in reducing the lead content of gasoline, which will come into effect in 1992.
9.          Prolect DescriDtion.  The proposed project will include (a) the
construction of a 1,454 km oil-products pipeline from the Port of Kandla to
Bhatinda; (b) the construction of a second Single Buoy Mooring System (SBM) at
Salaya, which would reduce ship waiting time and provide the necessary
capacity for imports of crude oil at the Koyali and Mathura refineries;
(c) installation of catalytic reforming units at the Barauni and Digboi
refineries, which will enable these refineries to reduce the lead content of
the gasoline produced by them from 0.56 to 0.15 grams per liter as required by
the Government's new guidelines; (d) installation of distributed digital
control systems at the Guwahati, Barauni, Koyali, Haldia and Mathura
refineries, which will improve the efficiency of the processing at these
refineries, (e) installation of two gas turbines for power generation at the
Digboi Refinery; (f) expansion of the lubrication oil manufacturing complex
and installation of a sulphur plant at the Haldia Refinery; (g) implementation
of an energy conservation and yield optimization program at the Guwahati,
Barauni, Koyali, Haldia and Mathura Refineries, and (h) provision of technical
assistance and training aimed at improving the operational and managerial
efficiency of IOC's operations.
10.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$944 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$368 million (39.0%).
Cofinancing of about US$75 million in exports and suppliers' credits will be
sought to finance the acquisition of the pipes for the Kandla-Bhatinda
pipeline. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. The proposed loan includes also a provision for up to US $20 million for
retroactive financing. IOC would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate
risks. Amounts and modalities of procurement and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project-processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in India are provided in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7588-IN,
dated March 31, 1989 is being distributed separately.
11.         Agreed actions.  Agreement has been reached with the Government
and IOC on the following actions:



4
(a)   the current refinery pricing and remuneration system will not be
changed in a way that would adversely affect IOC's :inancial
viability;
(b)   IOG will maintain: (i) a current ratio of not less than 1.2; (ii)
a debt/equity ratio below 60:40; and, (iii) a debt service
coverage of not less than 2.C
(c) IOC will review annually its FY90-94 investment -rogram with the
Bank and exchange views prior to the implementa on of any
addit.on to the program that would result in an increase of over
US$50 million in the funding requirements for any given year and,
(d)   IOC will arrange for US$75 millioa in co-financing for the
purchase of line pipe.
12.         Benefits.  The pipeline offers substantial savings in transport
costs compared to the next best alternative, rail transpcrt. The SBM will
improve the security of supply of oil products to the northwest of India;
other project components will improve refinery efficiency and have a
beneficial environmental impact through energy conservation and reduced lead
content in gasoline. As a result of the project, IOC will also gain access to
modern petroleum industry technology and management practices, particularly in
key operational areas such as computerization, process control and simulation,
and production optimization. The economic rate of return for the main
investment component, the Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline, is 22%; the economic rates
of return for the other components are: 42% for the Distributed Digital
Control System, and 29% for the Single Buoy Mooring System, 20% for the
Catalytic Reformers, and 48% for the Haldia Lube Oil Block. The overall
economic rate of return of the integrated project is 26%.
13.         Risks.  Possible risks include cost overruns, delays in project
completion and a lower-thbn-projected demand for oil products in India. To
minimize these risks, IOC has agreed to strengthen its project implementation
team. Sensitivity analysis of the effect of different growth rates on the
economic viability of the project have shown that a 25% reduction of the
growth in the demand for oil products would lower the economic rate of return
of the project for the principal project component, the Kandla-Bhatinda oil
products pipeline, from 22% to 18%. The risk of a decline in the growth of
demand for oil products is small. Demand projections carried out in the
course of appraisal indicate that the Government's demand projections are
conservative and that a considerable increase in the demand for oil products
could be expected if the Government's plans to accelerate economic growth to
6% a year during the Eighth Five Year Plan materialize. Environmental risks
are minimal, considering India's strict environmental standards with regard to
pipeline and rt inery operations and IOC's excellent record of compliance with
these standards.
