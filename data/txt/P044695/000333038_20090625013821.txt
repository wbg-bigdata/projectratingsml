      THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL ADVISORY SERVICES PROJECT 

                                              (CR. 3463-UG) 

                                             FOR UGANDA 


I. Introduction

1.       This project paper seeks the approval ofthe Regional Vice President (RVP) to
introduce the following changes in the Uganda, National Agricultural Advisory Services
Project (NAADS) and any accompanying amendments to the project's legal documents,
in response to the Government's request dated June 13,2008.

2.       The proposed changes are: (a) reallocate project cost savings of about 20% to
several categories of expenditure including the agricultural advisory services (AAS)
grants for subproject category so as to scale up agricultural advisory service grants to 83
districts and 1,033 sub counties, reaching over one million farm families by the end of the
project period; (b) adopt simplified community based procurement procedures; (c) revise
the project description and realign the component structure; (d) refme and adjust the
Results Framework (Annex 1); (e) increase the special account ceiling from $6 million to
$9 million; and (f) extend the project closing date by eighteen months, from June 30,
2008, until December 31,2009, to accommodate slow disbursements due to lower than
expected Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) ceilings in the Government's
budget. As these adjustments do not involve changes to project development objectives
and/or associated outcome targets, we are requesting the RVP's approval. The
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) will be amended accordingly to reflect these
changes.



II. Background and Reasons for Restructuring

3.       Project background. NAADS was approved in February, 2001 and became
effective on November 27 ofthe same year. The original credit amount was SDR 35.3
million (US$ 45 million equivalent), ofwhich approximately 39.2 percent in SDR terms
has been disbursed1 as of June 9, 2008. The project is funded by seven development
partners2 and the Government ofUganda (GOU), both at local and national level. The
project's development objective is to assist poor men and women farmers to become
aware of, and to be able to adopt, improved technology and management practices in
their farming enterprises so as to enhance their productive efficiency, their economic


tOver the course of the project life, the dollar has devalued by over 20 percent against the SDR making the
USD equivalent loan amount around 57 million. In historical dollar terms, 45.7% of the original credit
amount had been disbursed by June 9, 2008. Para. 7 indicates why disbursements have been lower than
projections at appraisal.

welfare, and the sustainability oftheir farming operations. Financing is provided for
private advisory and information services to farmers; technology development and
linkage to market activities; support to the capacity building for private sector providers
and development of quality control and regulatory mechanisms for private providers; and
overall project management. The key expected outcomes ofthe project are an increase in
the number of farmers adopting improved technologies as a result of receiving NAADS
related services; anincrease in the productive and economic efficiency ofparticipating
farmers; and increase in the cash income earned by farm families participating in
NAADS.

4.      The project is innovative in many aspects. The project's approach to extension is
pioneering in the region and is based on a participatory and farmer led service delivery
system. A fully integrated basket funding mechanism has been used and has proven to be
quite successful in providing a harmonized support to the program, using Government
flow of funds and accountability mechanisms.

5.       NAADS implementation status is currently rated moderately satisfactory and the
project has shown good progress on achieving its objectives. The program was briefly
suspended by GOU in late 2007 and early 2008 due to the President Museveni's concerns
about implementation modalities of service delivery, including his concern that the
remaining government extension workers were idle as agricultural advisory services are
now contracted to private service providers. The suspension also led to a delay in
processing any amendment of the project until agreement had been reached around
continued implementation arrangements. Outstanding issues have now been resolved,
including agreement on a plan for utilization ofthe remaining front line extension staff.
This is summarized in the "agreed way forward" paper prepared by GOU and the
development partners (see Annex 2), which includes modalities for supporting advisory
service delivery for maximum farmer coverage under NAADS.


6.       NAADS continues to expand rapidly and is widely recognized as having
substantial impact through the delivery ofadvisory services to Ugandan farmers.
NAADS currently operates in 748 rural sub-counties and urban authorities, which cover
all districts, regions and agro-ecological zones of Uganda. In the next financial year
(2008/09), it is planned to cover all the urban and rural sub-counties in the country:

7.      Mid-term evaluations and a recent analysis ofsurveys and studies by the
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the independent performance
evaluation ofNAADS demonstrate that the project is increasing the availability and
quality ofagricultural services available to farmers, and that farmers covered by the
project are adopting technologies that lead to real improvements in yields and farm
incomes. In particular, the IFPRI analysis, which used propensity score matching to
analyze comparable households in NAADS and non NAADS districts, shows the value of
total agricultural production per capita in NAADS districts was higher by 175,000
Uganda Shillings (in 2000 Uganda shillings) than in non NAAD~ districts, The adoption
of improved crop varieties in NAADS districts was around 75% and wasl5 percentage
points higher than comparable households in non NAADS districts,

8.       Rationale for Restructuring. In addition the requirement for the project to take
on board President Museveni's requests (summarized in paragraph 5 above), a number of
factors influenced the need for restructuring:


    (a)       Lower than expected MTEF ceilings. NAADS disbursements have been
              below appraisal projections due to lower than expected ceilings in the
              Government's Medium~Tenn Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Until the
              2006/07 financial year, MTEF ceilings restricted the expansion ofthe
              program, which disproportionately affected IDA and IFAD disbursements due
              to the priority given to grant funds over loan funds within the multi-donor
              basket that finances NAADS. As a result, while NAADS has been able to
              meet its targets in tenns ofdistrict coverage, it has lagged behind in extending
              coverage within sub-counties. The proposed reallocation will be consistent
              with GOU's decision to roll out the NAADS program to the entire country 
              coverage will increase from the original 56 districts envisaged at appraisal to
              all 83 districts and 1033 sub-counties (the increase mostly as a result of
              district and subcounty administrative units being split).

              As a result of the confidence in the program, the NAADS budget allocation in
              the Government's 200712008 MTEF was substantially increased to Uganda
              Shillings (Ushs.) 59 billion (about US$33 million). This represented an
              increase of23% over the previous year. The NAADS allocation in the
              200812009 GOU Budget has increased further, partially due to the President's
              renewed confidence in the program, to Ushs. 99 billion (about US$58
              million), allowing the program to achieve national coverage. An extension of
              the closing date for the project would be required to support the planned roll
              out and deepening ofNAADS, and, importantly, to provide financing until
              follow on development partner support is available.

    (b)       Changes in financing requirements. The bulk ofNAADS expenditures are
              allocated to agricultural advisory service grants (AAS), which finance
              technical advisory services, farmer institutional development, and technology
              development activities. Over the course of implementation, NAADS has
              experienced greater demand for advisory services than originally anticipated.
              The need to build farmers' capacity to participate in and manage advisory
              services required more resources for fanner institutional development than
              originally budgeted. Advisory service provision was also found to have
              greater success when accompanied by technology demonstration and
              development. As a result, AAS grants are expected to require greater
              fmancing as NAADS implements its planned roll out strategy.




3 Further IDA support is planned tor NAADS in FY 10 through an operation which will include support to
the national agricultural research system and other elements ofthe Government's agricultural strategy, the
Plan for Modernization of Agriculture.



                                                      6

           NAADS has also experienced cost savings from the exchange rate
           depreciation and from other categories ofexpenditure. Although NAADS
           was to be fully funded through a multi-donor basket fund, it has received
            some additional financing for technical assistance and goods from bilateral
           donors outside the basket fund. Retrenchment of public extension staffwas
            also expected to require extensive retraining to transform extension workers
            into private service providers. The Government has chosen instead to reassign
           public extension staffto other functions within the Ministry in lieu of
            retrenchment. Both factors have, therefore, created cost savings within certain
            categories of expenditure ofthe IDA Credit.

    (c)     Mid-term Recommendations to improving NAADS component descriptions
            and organization ofactivities. A reorganization ofNAADS activities within
            component categories was proposed during the Mid-Term Review to: (i)
            better align components to project activities and outputs; and (ii) reflect
            project implementation experience which has shown the need for adjustments
            to the component structure as originally envisaged. These changes represent a
            reshuffling ofproject activities, and do not constitute a substantive change in
            the project, nor do they require any change in project objective and/or key
            performance indicators.

III. Proposed Changes

9.      Reallocation among categories of expenditure. The proposed reallocation
among categories of expenditure would: (i) shift the unallocated portion, which
comprises 7% of the Credit, to the remaining categories of expenditure; (ii) decrease the
amount allocated to consultant services; and (iii) increase the funds allocated to advisory
service grants; operational costs and goods (see Annex 3, Table 3 for original and
proposed categories of expenditure). The bulk ofthe reallocation is centered on
increasing the amount allocated to AAS grants to farmers, which represents the project's
core activity, from 53% ofthe IDA Credit to 78% of the Credit.

10.     The reallocation is not considered a major change to the project as the bulk ofthe
reallocation occurs from a shift from the unallocated and consultant services categories
into advisory services grants. This does not alter the range of activities originally
envisioned under NAADS as the reallocated funds are focused on advisory services
grants and directly support the objectives and established NAADS implementation
modalities. Thus, the project development objective and key performance indicators will
not be altered by the proposed reallocation.

11.     Provisions for community procurement. Procedures for community based
procurement were not available at the time ofNAADS approval in February 2001. The
Development Credit Agreement (DCA) would be amended to allow for community based
procurement, with disbursement conditional on the finalization ofthe revised project
implementation guidelines, which will include guidelines for community based
procurement. Community procurement would be fully integrated into current
procurement functions and procedures at the sub-county leveL Under the proposed


                                              7

community procurement guidelines, communities of farmers groups will through their
selected community based selection committees identify suppliers and evaluate
quotations and make awards. The sub-county will be responsible for signing contracts
and performing accounting functions and payments for goods and services on behalfof
the communities. Therefore, unlike most CDD-type projects, funds will not be disbursed
to the communities under the NAADS project. See Annex 4 for proposed arrangements.

12.     Disbursement condition. Revised implementation guidelines are being prepared
for the project, to include community procurement. Submission ofrevised
implementation guidelines acceptable to the Bank will be added as a condition of
disbursement for the Agricultural Advisory Services Grants category ofexpenditure. The
manual is expected to be submitted and approved by the end ofJuly 2008.

13.     Project description. The revised project description can be found in Annex 5.
The main changes, agreed at the mid-term review, now highlight the major activities and
their contribution to the project objectives. These include (i) move farmer institutional
development activities from AAS to a new stand alone component to more clearly
distinguish between service provision and institutional development activities at the
district level and below; (ii) move technology development activities into AAS to reflect
the close and complementary role technology development plays in the delivery of
advisory services; (iii) rename the Technology Development and Linkages with Markets
Component to the Agribusiness Development and Market Linkages Component to reflect
the focus on market and agribusiness linkages and the removal oftechnology
development activities; and (iv) move monitoring and evaluation activities from the
Program Management Component to the Quality Assurance, Regulation and Technical
Auditing of Service Providers Component and rename the component to the Planning,
Monitoring, Quality Assurance and Evaluation Component in order to aggregate all
planning, monitoring and evaluation functions together in one component, and rename
the Program Management and Monitoring Component to the Program Management and
Coordination Component to reflect the removal of M and E.

14.     Revised Performance Indicators. The change in component structure and,
increased funding for AAS has resulted in a change in intermediate indicators. The
Results Framework has been updated and refined, and those refinements in outcome and
intermediate indicators are reflected in the amended Schedule 5 ofthe DCA. (please refer
to para 24 and Annex 1).

15.     Revision of the special account ceiling. The projected increase in budget
expenditures during the final year ofnationwide implementation would also require an
increase ofthe designated account ceiling. The DCA currently sets the ceiling at US$ 6
million, which should be raised to US$ 9 million to accommodate the expected
disbursements in 2008/2009.

16.      Extension of Closing Date. The proposed amendment would extend the project
closing date from June 30, 2008 to December 31,2009. This would be the first extension
of the project's Closing Date.



                                              8

IV. Analysis


17.    Economic and Financial Analysis. The proposed changes would not alter the
underlying economic and financial viability of the project. NAADS has already met the
physical targets established for economic viability at appraisal, which were based on
advisory services contact with at least 420,000 farm households in 56 districts. At
appraisal, the minimum productivity increase required for households adopting new
technologies was found to be at least I %; evidence indicates households participating in
NAADS have been able to achieve such productivity increases. The proposed changes
would finance additional activities that would directly support the adoption of more
profitable technologies and sustain productivity gains among adopting households.


18.    Project costs. A breakdown ofcosts by components and by expenditure
categories are contained in Annex 3.

19.    Institutional Arrangements. The proposed restructuring, including the
introduction ofrevised procurement modalities at farmer group level would not require
any change to NAADS implementation arrangements. A work plan and budget and
procurement plan for the 18 month extension has been submitted by the Government and
cleared by the Bank.


20.    Financial Management and Procurement. The proposed restructuring would
not require additional financial management arrangements to accommodate community
based procurement (see para. II). The project's audit reports are up to date. There are
currently no outstanding audit reports. The audit report for FY06/07 was delayed due to
the suspension, and was modified due to irregularities found in five sub-counties, to
which disbursement offunds have been suspended. A time bound action plan to address
these concerns has been reviewed and approved by the financial management specialist
and is attached as Annex 6.

21.    A draft community procurement manual has been prepared and will be finalized
as a condition ofdisbursement. A procurement plan for the 18 month extension has been
prepared by the Government and cleared by the Bank.


22.    Environmental Safeguards. NAADS is classified as a category B project. An
environmental management plan (EMP) was developed at appraisal and is currently in
use. The additional project activities proposed in the restructuring would have minimal
environmental impact and would not constitute a new class ofactivities. The EMP is
judged sufficient to manage and mitigate any negative impacts associated with the
expansion ofactivities.

23.    Exceptions to Bank policies. No exceptions to Bank policies are required.




                                             9

V. Expected Outcomes


24.     Project Results. The proposed restructuring does not alter the overall project
development objective and/or associated outcome indicators. It is expected that the
proposed restructuring will deepen and broaden the project's results related to
productivity with greater focus on farmers' capacity development and scaling up ofAAS
in districts and subcounties. The scaling up of AAS and the change in component
structure has resulted in some changes in intermediate indicators, which are reflected in
the revised and updated results framework. The originallogframe has been updated into
a revised results framework and refinements of some outcome/intermediate indicators
have been done, which is attached as Annex 1.


VI. Benefits and Risks

25.     Benefits. The proposed restructuring would not alter the type of benefits (direct
and indirect) anticipated in the original project document and as noted in the recent
impact assessment, namely: (i) for the public sector - an agricultural advisory service
which is more efficient and more popular than that ofthe past; (ii) for farmers - an
agricultural advisory service which is more relevant and responsive at helping farmers to
raise their own incomes in sustainable ways through helping them to achieve greater
productivity in their farming operations and to become more effective at participation in
input and output markets; (iii) for the private sector - growth in the agricultural sector as
productivity increases and opportunities for employment in rural areas as service
providers under NAADS; (iv) for consumers - greater and more reliable production of
food; and (v) for rural communities and local governments - greater ownership over local
programs and greater economic growth in rural communities.

26.     Risks and Mitigating Measures. The primary risks under the proposed
restructuring are: (i) the ability ofNAADS to fully reach national coverage due to
capacity constraints at the district or sub-county level or overall funding limits; and (ii)
continued political support for the NAADS model. Risks and mitigation measures
relating to community procurement are listed in Annex 4, and will include a
communications and training program on the revised implementation guidelines. There
now appears to be broad agreement within GOU on the NAADS model and the raising of
the MTEF ceiling will enable accelerated disbursements. Government commitment has
increased with the President's interest in the project. One ofthe risk aspects raised in the
original PAD, the failure to deal decisively on the issue ofutilization offront line
extension workers is finally resolved. Lack ofprogress on other pillars ofthe PMA,
namely microfinance and agro-processing have slowed progress on increasing rural
incomes in general and have a negative impact on NAADS achievements. Plans to move
to a more programmatic mode of support should mitigate this risk. The overall project
risk rating remains moderate.

                Annex 2: Way Forward on Implementation ofNAADS


Preamble

At a meeting held between Government ofUganda (MFPED / MAAIF) and the
Development Partners on NAADS on March 5, 2008, the decision on NAADS by
Cabinet was tabled for discussion. During this meeting, the Development Partners
expressed their appreciation that the partnership principles between the GoU and the
Development Partners are back on track.


Following this meeting, a Technical Committee (composed ofDevelopment Partners,
MFPED, MAAIF / NAADS, MoPS, and PMA Secretariat) was fonned to consider the
issues raised by the Government.


The Technical Committee recognizes the concerns raised by Cabinet leading to the
review ofNAADS implementation. Some ofthese concerns have also been highlighted
in the on-going end ofPhase I evaluation.


Three main aspects pertaining to NAADS implementation were discussed, namely:
    1. Mode ofagricultural serVice delivery
    2. Agro-processing, and
    3. Demonstration, model and nucleus farmers.

1. Mode of Agricultural Extension Service Delivery under NAADS

Issues raised:
    a. Utilization ofgovernment extension workers
    b. Role ofthe research institutions
    c. Role ofpublic private partnerships
    d. Private service provision with Board approval

Way forward

a. Utilization of government extension workers
The Technical Committee recognizes the availability ofunutilized trained resource in the
Production Departments ofLGs, and agrees that the existing government extension
workers can be more effectively utilized by NAADS. NAADS will improve the capacity
development ofextension officers for quality service provision. The extension workers
would convert to performance-based long term contracts (two to three years) under
NAADS and within LGs, with farmers actively participating in their performance
evaluation. The NAADS program will fully facilitate this process.

b. Role of the .research institutions
The Technical Committee appreciates the role ofresearch institutions in capacity
development ofextension service providers in technology development and promotion.



                                             16

NAADS will therefore facilitate the linkages with research to respond to farmers'
technology needs.


c. Role of public private partnerships 

The Technical Committee agrees that this is a sustainable avenue for service delivery and 

provides a clear pullfactor for farmer commercialization. It also enhances linkages to 

markets and industry along the value chain. NAADS should up-scale the support to 

public private partnerships, both at national and district level. 



d. Private service provision with Board approval 

The Technical Committee agrees with the use ofprivate service providers for services not 

provided by (a)-(c) above. This will be with Board approval. 

The Technical Committee recommends that in the proposed changes in service delivery, 

the positive aspects ofthe program, as identified in the NAADS end of Phase I 

evaluation, should be maintained. These include: 

         Full farmer participation;
         Competitive and transparent selection processes for service delivery;
         Performance based service provision;
         Decentralization for local ownership; and
         Flow of funds to the lowest levels of local government.

2. Agro-processing

The Technical Committee acknowledges the importance of agro-processing in
agricultural development, and endorses the Cabinet decision on the expanded NAADS
role in supporting agro-processing. However, the role ofthe program in agro-processing
has to be clearly defined and the resource requirements provided through the appropriate
channels and institutions. The Committee further envisages that this role will constitute a
part ofNAADS Phase II in enhancing farm incomes. This will be specifically through:
(i) public private partnerships; (ii) the development and/or strengthening of higher level
farmer organizations; (iii) introduction and promotion of specific technologies; and (iv)
facilitating linkages throughout the value chains.

3. Typology of Farmers (Demonstration, Model and Nucleus)

The Technical Committee affirms the need for a stepwise approach, as a push factor, for
farmers to move from demonstration farmer through progressive/lead, model and then
nucleus farmers for supporting knowledge acquisition, technology uptake and market
linkage.

The Committee recommends that NAADS develops the criteria for selection of farmers
in the different farmer types (demonstration, lead, model and nucleus farmers), and
guidelines for implementation, building on the existing guidelines. The committee also
affirms the need for a pullfactor, where NAADS works with agro-industries to develop
mechanisms to help model and nucleus farmers' participate in the value chain, carrying
along with them other farmers. NAADS will promote inclusion ofpoor farmers in this



                                               17

progression process. NAADS will also focus on increasing outreach, bringing more
farmers into the process. Maintaining effective levels of service will require adequate
funding levels at the sub-county level.


The nucleus farmers will be increasingly used in multiplication ofplanting and stocking
materials, to support public private partnerships, particularly under the strategic
enterprises program.


4. Phasing of the implementation

The current Phase ofNAADS ends in June 2008. Some Development Partners have
received a request for extension ofNAADS by one year, and have sufficient resources to
support activities through to June 2009. However, it is important that this bridging phase
operate under the existing legal agreements. During this interim phase the process ofre
tooling and utilizing existing public extension workers will proceed.

The modalities for operationalizing the issues raised by Cabinet, together with the results
ofthe on-going evaluation, should be worked out and agreed upon during the bridging
period. This period will also constitute the preparation period for Phase II, which we
hope will be fully implemented by July 1,2009.

In parallel, the committee notes that there is an ongoing process to harmonize the policy
framework for rural development. We look forward to a speedy conclusion to this
process.

The development partners will work closely with Government ofUganda to determine
the budgetary implications of the above proposals and give an indication to the H.E. /
MFPED before April 30, 2008, for the bridging phase. The Development Partners further
look forward to working with the Government of Uganda to begin the design ofPhase 2
with an identification mission in May 2008.
