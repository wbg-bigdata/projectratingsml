H. Restructuring
A first project restructuring (level two) was approved on July 12, 2010, for extending
the closing date by one year from March 31, 2011, to March 31, 2012. The extension
was necessary for completing project activities and adjusting targets after cost
escalations, depreciation of the loan currency, and the rise of labor and construction
input prices following EU accession. The above factors reduced the available project
funds and forced the reduction of the original investment program.
A second restructuring (also level two) was approved on February 8, 2012, for
extending the closing date by three additional months from March 31, 2012, to June
30, 2012, to complete remaining project on-going activities.

                                         viii
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      By 2003, Romania’s agriculture sector accounted for approximately 13
percent of GDP and about half of Romania’s 23 million people were still living in
rural areas. Together with the agro-processing industry, it was generating a quarter of
the country’s GDP, and more than one-third of total employment. The agriculture
subsector represented more than two-thirds of job opportunities and total income.
With 15 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land, two-thirds of which arable, the
sector offered huge potential to produce a commercially-viable and diverse mix of
temperate crops and livestock products. However, the sector was in disarray due
mainly to the problems inherited from the previous socialist regime and difficulties in
implementing transition policies. While the Government of Romania (GOR) was
introducing strong policy reforms, farmers were far from understanding the need to
change, even after more than fifteen years of the fall of the former regime.
2.      Irrigation is vital to Romanian agriculture as it offsets rain deficits in the
country’s semi-arid southern and eastern regions where the average rainfall is less
than 500 mm with uneven seasonal distributions (less than 20 percent occurring in
summer) leaving crops with water deficit of 200-350 mm. Irrigation also minimizes
the climatic risks of agriculture, ensuring the stability in production necessary for
commercial farming. It can also motivate private farmers to convert from field to
higher-value crops (HVCs) such as fruits and vegetables. Drainage is also vital
because the low plains along the Danube River often become waterlogged, especially
in spring when river flows are at high levels. The existing embankment works along
1,200 km of riverbanks allow over 450,000 ha of low-lands to be sustainably cropped.
3.       The old socialist regime had constructed irrigation and drainage (I&D)
facilities during the 1960s and 1970s when irrigation was centrally planned and
supply-driven, covering about 3 million hectares (about 30 percent of the country’s
arable land) and worth around US$12 billion at current values. Most of the existing
schemes relied on systems with high pumping heads, and operated using subsidized
electricity with little regard for real cost, while crops were guaranteed export markets
to other socialist countries. Between 1975 and 1981, the Bank had financed US$545
million in loans for eight projects to develop irrigation on about 1.1 million ha.
4.       As the socialist regime ended, the economics of irrigation completely
changed: irrigation schemes serving large state farms had to be adapted to serve about
4 million small private farms; the collective farms were dismantled and much of the
irrigation equipment was damaged, vandalized, or vanished; the on-farm equipment
was distributed among a large number of small farms; the collapse of state-owned
agro-industries interrupted existing marketing channels; there was no experience with
private businesses complicated with newly fragmented landholdings (averaging 2.3 ha
in 4 to 5 plots); and the liberalization of electricity prices brought huge increases in
pumping costs. The changing scenario led to loss of production scale for the low-
value traditional crops and the irrigated area declined sharply since the early 1990s.
As the overall sector situation became unsustainable, funds from a Bank loan were
used to do a comprehensive irrigation sector review to assist in its recovery.
5.       The existing pricing and subsidy mechanisms were not encouraging economic
irrigation. With the legacy of having supported Romanian irrigation sector during


                                           1
communist times, and the potential of the sector under the new market economy
conditions, the Bank was fully committed in helping to get policies and investments
on the right track. However, most of the early transition period in the 1990s produced
little progress in reforms as Bank advice clashed with the old guard entrenched in the
sector institutions 1.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
6.      The PAD stated original PDO were: (i) increasing agricultural productivity in
project area (PA); and (ii) more economic use of irrigation resources through change
of farmers' and Land Reclamation Agency (LRA)'s behaviors 2.
7.       Project outputs would be measured by the following key indicators (KI): (i)
irrigation canals rehabilitated, improved and operational, measured by length of
canals and number of pumping stations (PSs) rehabilitated, together with the number
of Water Users Organizations (WUOs) benefitting from infrastructure support; (ii) the
State Land Reclamation Enterprise (SNIF) restructured, the new LRA established
(further referred to as ANIF) and SNIF privatization plan developed and
implemented; and (iii) on-farm irrigation management transferred, shown by the
number of WUOs established and its area covered, and by the number of pressure
pumping stations (PPSs) transferred.
8.     Project impacts would be monitored by: (i) increase in agricultural
productivity to be measured by yields, crops’ gross margins, and returns to labor; and
(ii) more economic use of irrigation facilities and resources, through changes in
farmers' and ANIF's behavior by irrigation intensities, cropping patterns,
concentration of irrigation in areas with lower pumping heads, and O&M cost per
volume of water delivered.
1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (KI), and reasons/justification
9.      The PDO were not changed. However, reductions on the targets and KI were
approved in July 2010, due to the original underestimation of costs, the depreciation
of the loan currency against the Romanian Lei (RON), and also cost escalation: labor
and construction input prices rose considerably with Romania’s EU accession. The
available loan funds made impossible the implementation of the complete original
investment so the reduction of the targeted infrastructure to be rehabilitated was a
necessity.
10.     Modifications also introduced baseline values to the results framework as
these were not available at appraisal. Main targets had to be re-defined as additional
funds for covering the increased cost of the original plan could not be obtained.
Targets became: (i) Eight major pump stations (PSs) rehabilitated servicing 90,000
ha instead of 20 PSs servicing 400,000 ha; (ii) Water metering equipment for 320
WUOs commanding an area of 250,000 ha instead of 400 WUOs and 500,000 ha.
This was due to the higher costs involved, but also to the average area assumed at
5,000 ha per WUOs, which was twice the actual area; (iii) Rehabilitation of tertiary
infrastructure for 65 WUOs and about 150,000 ha instead of 160 WUOs and 800,000


1
  At appraisal time, the annual allocation for irrigation subsidies ranged from US$20 - 40 million with only around
300,000-500,000 ha being actually irrigated - about 10 - 16 percent of the total area covered by irrigation facilities
due to the serious engineering, economic, and social constraints for reestablishing a sustainable irrigation sector.
2
  In the Loan Agreement the objectives were phrased slightly different: “The objectives of the project are to
increase agriculture productivity in the project area, promote community coherence and initiative in irrigation
management and enhance institutional sustainability in the irrigation sector.?


                                                          2
ha; (iv) Field irrigation equipment for 145 WUOs with about 350,000 ha instead of
160 WUOs with 800,000 ha; and (v) Office and communication equipment for about
150 WUOs covering about 340,000 ha instead of 160 WUOs with 800,000 ha.
1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.     The rehabilitation works were expected to directly benefit approximately
40,000 farming families and workers from the agricultural associations 3. The WUO
support program would benefit more than 100 organizations, including some located
outside the area identified for the rehabilitation of main schemes. While the project
would not explicitly target a particular group, the majority of project beneficiaries
were expected to be from low-income groups. It would also benefit large association
farms, which were carrying out large-scale cultivation of high-value crops (HVCs)
such as tomatoes and beans, or industrial crops such as sunflowers 4. Moreover, the
sector reform envisaged under the project would indirectly benefit an estimated
200,000 families nationwide (including workers at agricultural associations),
approximately 10 percent of the rural population, through empowerment and more
economic use of available resources. Farmers would benefit from more cost-effective,
reliable and efficient delivery of irrigation water.
1.5 Original Components
12.     As detailed in Annex 1, total project costs were estimated at US$103 million
out of which the Bank loan would cover US$80 million.
13.     Component 1: Rehabilitation of Irrigation Schemes (US$94.1 million, 90.7
percent). It aimed to restore the capacity of irrigation infrastructure, including: (a)
Sadova-Corabia (SC) and Nicoresti-Tecuci (NT) Schemes in a first phase, and
additional schemes to be selected for the second phase; (b) about 20 of the most
deteriorated Major Pumping Stations (PSs) serving viable schemes with less than 70
meter pumping head elevation and evidence of demand; (c) Water Metering
Equipment to introduce volumetric charges for water supplied to WUAs signing a
service contract with the ANIF; (d) Monitoring and Control Equipment to reduce
operational losses in rehabilitated schemes; (e) On-Farm Irrigation Facilities,
including PPSs, buried distribution systems, office renovations and equipment for
WUOs, irrigation equipment, vehicles, radio sets, etc. (contributing with 5 to 10
percent of goods to be purchased); and (f) Feasibility Studies for the Second Phase.
14.    Component 2: Support for Institutional Reform in Land Reclamation Sector
(US$3.06 million, 2.9 percent). It aimed to the development of ANIF and WUOs,
including: (a) SNIF Restructuring and ANIF Initial Functioning, privatization of non-

a MIS system; (b) assisting the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
(MARD) for its Land Reclamation Directorate (LRD) to develop procedures for

  A detailed survey at appraisal for the first two subprojects (Nicoresti-Tecuci & Sadova Corabia) revealed that
more than half of the area was owned by about 8,000 individual farmers, each owning 2 to 4 ha of land. Typically,
they were mostly rain-fed subsistence farmers doing US$50 per ha, while full-time commercial farmers did
US$170 per ha, depending on the cropping patterns. Their annual farming incomes did not exceed US$680.
4
  There were two main types of association farms: (a) formal association farms that are run by professionals
through formal rental agreements with land owners (typically 500-2,000 ha, employing one staff per 10 ha); and
(b) informal agricultural associations, which manage agriculture land jointly with neighboring families, similarly
to cooperative farms (typically 40-300 ha). In the first two subproject areas (SC and NT), commercial enterprise
farms account for 12 percent of the land and agricultural associations account for 32 percent.

for developing a database and monitoring procedures; (c) Economic Analysis Study of
the Irrigation Sector, and Changes in Response to the New Price and Subsidy Policy
to prepare the strategic plan for the development of the sector; (d) Strengthen
Agriculture Extension Services and the Use of Agro-Chemicals for raising awareness
of environmental impacts and training for farmers in good practices; and (e) Support
for WUOs through technical assistance and training in accounting and financial
management, budgeting, and irrigation and water management. Technical assistance
for the WUOs Regulatory Unit would provide training on facilitating development of
WUOs, supervising their activities, and develop a WUOs database. This was being
parallel-financed by USAID; and the project would finance a Phase II-WUA Support
starting in 2005, as USAID program was ended.
15.    Component 3: Exploring Technologies for Reducing Irrigation Energy
Consumption (US$1.14 million, 1.1 percent) for enhancing the long-term future of
Romanian irrigated agriculture. Though the price and subsidy reform the project
would lead to the reduction of irrigation at the higher elevations, further reduction of
energy consumption would benefit the remaining irrigation systems by the
component’s supporting studies and pilots showing low head sprinkler equipment and
corresponding modification of pressure PSs.
16.    Component 4: Project Administration (US$4.68 million, 4.5 percent) would
finance the Project Management Unit (PMU) national staff, international and national
consultants, vehicles, office equipment and operating costs to support implementation.
1.6 Revised Components
17.    Components were not revised.
1.7 Other significant changes
18.     When the results framework and some of the output targets were changed in
July 2010, a first extension of the closing date (from March 31, 2011 until March 31,
2012) was done. An additional three months extension until June 30, 2012, was
agreed in February 8, 2012. The first extension was needed for completing the works
for: (i) the primary and secondary irrigation canals in two schemes of the second
phase: Terasa Brailei (TB) and Terasa Viziru (TV); (ii) the tertiary infrastructure
owned by 18 WUOs; and (iii) provision of field irrigation equipment under the first
component. The second extension was granted to mitigate the risk that a severe winter
could delay on-going works on the TV scheme beyond the closing date; and for
completing the delivery and installation of goods procured under the WUOs support
program.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.     The first identification mission took place in 1995 and preparation started in
1996. Bank involvement was natural after having financed about a third of the
existing irrigation structures. Lack of required government commitment to sector
reforms led to the suspension of project preparation in 1997, but policy dialogue
continued. In 2000, after the first legislation for establishing WUAs (with Dutch
support) was prepared and the first four WUAs formed, a program for WUA
development was supported by USAID. In fall 2000, the Project Concept Document
(PCD) was approved, and in July 2003 the loan was approved. Loan effectiveness was


                                           4
delayed until April 29, 2004 mainly because of the delay in passing the Land
Reclamation Law in a form acceptable to the Bank and matching the commitments for
sector reforms stated in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP). This very long
process signaled the weak GOR commitment to the reform program, which continued
during implementation.
20.      Project design reflected some lessons drawn from other irrigation projects in
the region, including: (a) developing an enabling legal framework prior to the start of
the project, (b) up-front commitment of the GOR on restructuring the inefficient
public institution, and (c) relatively simple project design with concrete objectives
(e.g., rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and development of WUOs). Also, the
emphasis on supporting only minimal pumping levels (below the 70 m head) suggests
that the team had incorporated lessons learned from experience in previous Bank
projects and from OED’s assessment thereof. Despite the inclusion of these lessons in
documentation, the project was presented for approval before these critical steps were
taken in institutional reform: legal changes, critical for sector reform, were not passed;
the GOR did not follow the agreed policy framework nor did it develop the secure
institutional foundation as defined in the Letter of Development Policy signed by the
Prime Minister. Also, the development of WUOs was given minimal attention.
21.     Some necessary elements for smooth implementation of the project were
missing, which contributed to implementation issues including: (i) implementation
readiness (mainly detailed design and bidding documents for the first phase works;
and details on the institutional restructuring of the SNIF and the creation of the
ANIF); and (ii) sufficient technical support for addressing the needs of small farmers
and their WUOs in the complex process of “behavioral change? to become
economically viable and enable the switch of the farming systems from traditional
field crops towards the production and marketing of HVC (mainly fruits and
vegetables). These also required developing stable and well managed WUOs, for the
efficient O&M of the transferred systems.
22.     By July 2005 a Quality at Entry Assessment (QAE) rated the project as
Moderately Satisfactory (MS) 5. At project approval the detailed designs and bidding
documents for phase I rehabilitation works were not ready and GOR commitment to
the agreed reforms was less than adequate because of persistent push back by the old
guard. Given the resistance to reform by key actors and implementation delays at the
time of the assessment, the Quality Assessment Group (QAG) team recommended a
highly attentive and high level supervision to avoid further problems. It also warned
about the behavioral assumptions of the farmers as identified at appraisal, since these
would most likely become critical as the project moved forward. In addition, the
results framework was unrealistic in assuming clear causal links between inputs-
activities and outputs-outcome: the interventions planned for the expected behavioral
change and increase in productivity of small farmers and their WUOs were clearly
inadequate. Increasing agricultural productivity in schemes where subsistence farmers
predominated would require much more extension and marketing support for the
adoption of new production technologies and cropping patterns with HVC. Stronger
efforts were required to develop WUOs capable of managing this complex transition,


5
  Six dimensions were considered as Satisfactory (S) including: (i) strategic relevance and approach; (ii) technical,
financial and economic aspects; (iii) environmental aspects; (iv) fiduciary aspects; (v) policy and institutional
aspects; and (vi) risk assessment. The gender and social development dimension were rated MS while the
implementation arrangements; and the Bank inputs and processes were rated as Marginally Unsatisfactory (MU).


                                                         5
particularly in light of farmers’ education levels and their low capacity to resist elite
capturing of the WUO decision making process.
23.     In addition, the economic impacts of alternative rehabilitation measures and
support activities were not properly assessed before implementation. Proper
evaluation of the impacts of alternative works to rehabilitate and designs at appraisal
would probably have led to a different result and much better returns to the overall
project, and to more sound trade-offs to consider as cost escalation determined that
insufficient funds for covering the original plan were available.
24.    The assessment of risks at appraisal highlighted most of the problems that
could affect implementation and outcomes, including lack of markets for increased
production; inadequate farmers’ interest and commitment; inadequate capacity of
WUOs and ANIF to manage irrigation facilities; GOR commitment to restructure
ANIF; and inadequate capacity for project management. However, the mitigation
measures recommended were either too weak and/or ignored during implementation.
2.2 Implementation
25.     Project implementation started at a very slow pace. It took nine months to
comply with the effectiveness conditions, mainly the passage of the new Law on Land
Reclamation required to enforce the institutional reforms. The Law’s passage was
strongly resisted by officials and politicians requiring extensive effort to overcome.
As readiness for implementation was not adequate (as mentioned earlier), the
occurrence of subsequent delays was inevitable. MARD’s LRD and WUAMU were
not supported and staffed as agreed and could not assume their role in project
management. The very low budget allocations for irrigation, and ANIF’s continued
counter-reform efforts led in 2005 and until June 2006, to unsatisfactory (U)
implementation performance (IP) ratings. The under costing of the rehabilitation
works led to the need to adjust targets and key indicators through a project
restructuring. By this time, three years had been lost to initial delays.
26.     By the second half of 2006, implementation had been revived as MARD: (i)
reassumed some of its lost commitment and management role; (ii) improved the
budget allocations; and (iii) awarded major works and study contracts. At MTR in
November 2007, the PDO and IP ratings were upgraded to moderately satisfactory
(MS). As disbursements picked up and budget allocations for the project improved, IP
was further upgraded to S. However, two major issues emerged: the depreciation of
the loan currency, 6 and increased prices for labor, fuel, and construction materials,
after the EU accession. The compounded impact of these two factors created a
financing gap, which resulted in there being insufficient funds to complete the
originally investment plan. This forced a 35 percent reduction of the area that could
have been rehabilitated. As it became clear in 2009, that the government would not
provide for the additional resources to address the financing gap, the project targets
and outcome KI had to be amended, as detailed above.
27.   The budget available for project implementation turned again problematic in
2008 after the financing arrangements for all projects financed from foreign loans
changed; the project activities were funded from the state budget and reimbursement


6
  Since Board approval depreciation of funds was about 37 percent (from 3.35 to 2.45 US$/RON in 2007, creating
a financial gap that was then estimated at US$22-25 million). However, the appreciation of the US$ against the
RON started in the second half of 2008 and continued, reaching the PAD exchange rate in April 2012.


                                                      6
from the loan requested afterwards. With the world economic and financial, the
budget availability became scarce and the funds initially allocated to the project each
fiscal year were totally insufficient to finance the ongoing activities and contract new
ones. The financing arrangements were, usually, partially regulated through budget
rectifications conducted during the second half of the year. This mechanism slowed
down project implementation and contributed to delays in finalizing the activities.
28.     After Romania joined the European Union in 2007, instead of gradually
phasing out the operational subsidies for irrigation (during the scheduled grace period
of three years), MARD steadily increased them through 2009, when the peak values
were recorded (US$83 million of which US$70 million for O&M) in clear conflict
with the agreed reforms, and also with the cost sharing principle stipulated by the EU
Water Framework Directive. It distorted the WUOs’ incentives for long-term
sustainable management of the systems and missed an important opportunity for
orderly transition to full-cost recovery. The policy messages provided to farmers by
MARD made them believe that the reforms would not be enforced and subsidies
would continue. In January 2010 the expected subsidy cut-off following the
agreements with the EU, resulted in a shock to farmers who responded by reducing
drastically irrigated areas in Romania from 294,000 ha to 75,000 ha in just one year,
and from 43,000 ha to 10,000 ha in the project area (PA).
29.     Although the Bank team forthrightly identified these issues and management
duly noted their concern in ISRs and aide memoires, the project continued to be rated
satisfactory or moderately satisfactory. In January 2009, the country management
expressed its concern about the realism of these ratings and the backtracking of
reforms, but no further action was taken to send a clearer message to the Romanian
authorities about the urgency of adhering to subsidy reduction. The management
concerns regarding the backtracking reforms and insufficient budget allocated to
project implementation have been consistently raised to MPF and MARD during the
regular joint portfolio reviews conducted annually until 2010 and quarterly since
March 2010. Only in June 2011, after several years of insufficient budgetary
allocation and the ill-conceived transition to eliminate subsidies, were project ratings
downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
30.     While some M&E indicators were appropriate, there were also major gaps.
M&E arrangements and activities for data collection and its use by the PMU were not
adequately specified in the PAD. Consequently, M&E got off to a slow start. The
baseline survey was not completed until more than two years after effectiveness,
when the activity on the ground started. The quality of M&E was mixed during
implementation. Preparation of project quarterly reports only began in August 2005.
Project data existed at the level of thematic teams, though these were largely focused
on project outputs such as ‘infrastructure rehabilitated’ and ‘equipment delivered’,
leaving large areas of project performance opaque or not covered, particularly with
regard to internal WUO functioning, and the economics of irrigation performance in
the project area (PA) 7. The data collected on outcomes and impacts was not good for
detecting even the severe performance problems as those being evident in SC and NT
schemes, where more than half of funds were invested without “increasing


7
 WUOs have been steadily reluctant to supply information on their internal activity or farmer-members’
performance. Most of irrigation performance information depended upon ANIF data which was not reliable.


                                                      7
agricultural productivity in the PA? or doing a “more economic use of irrigation
resources through change of farmers’ and ANIF’s behavior?.
31.     An early effort at WUO organizational development monitoring has not been
properly maintained. This was unfortunate, as the WUO database, while adequately
updated, provided very little detail on how they really functioned. The WUO
questionnaire used in the Project Impact Assessment (PIA) at project closing devoted
due attention to such questions as the problems faced by farmers, reasons for reducing
irrigated areas, problems with ANIF, participation of users in their WUOs affairs, use
of dispute resolution events, or frequency of meetings between WUO managers and
water users. This type of survey should have taken place earlier for better PMU
management and to take remedial actions during implementation. As a result of these
M&E flaws the severe performance problems remained under detected.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
32.     Supervision of project’s financial management (FM) performance was carried
out regularly covering all relevant FM issues. Overall, FM performance of the PMU
has been moderately satisfactory throughout the project life. The PMU had initially a
higher FM capacity until about two years before the final closing date, but after that it
has been affected by the financial staff departures and lack of sufficient FM staff and
thus had a lower FM capacity. This has been caused to a large extent by the July 2010
reduction of salaries that affected the entire public sector. The quarterly unaudited
financial monitoring reports were received in general on time, although there were
some small delays. With certain follow up to clarify any discrepancies, all the interim
financial reports have been accepted by the Bank. All the project audit reports have
been also received and accepted by the Bank by the due dates. The opinions were
clean and no significant internal control issue was mentioned. The counterpart
financing received from the GOR has been moderately satisfactory throughout the
project life. Project pace has been affected to a certain extent by delays in the
provision of timely and adequate counterpart funding, especially in the last four years
when the Government pre-financed all project expenses.
33.      In spite of poor initial procurement preparation, the procurement oversight
was permanent and effective maintaining things on track. But by the end of the
implementation period the procurement rating had to be downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory due to several procedural deficiencies found in the implementation of
the last International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure under the project. The
most consequential of them being: (i) the PMU’s introduction of substantive changes
to the first amendment of the bidding documents, after its review and clearance by the
Bank without consulting the Bank; and (ii) the provisions of the bidding documents
were not strictly followed by the evaluation committee during the evaluation stage
which resulted in substantial modification of a bid after the bid submission deadline.
The PMU was requested to submit clarifications, and finally the bid was cancelled as
closing date was imminent.
34.    Attention to environmental issues was limited up to the MTR, with only one
review conducted in 2006. After the MTR, and once the construction activities started,
good environmental oversight was provided by a specialist and the overall
implementation of environmental safeguards became satisfactory. It is worth
mentioning the preparation by the PMU of a detailed environmental monitoring plan
(EMP) including specific collection points and frequency of water and soil samples at
the main rehabilitated irrigation infrastructure sites. Annual comprehensive

                                           8
environmental monitoring reports (developed in line with EMP) provided detailed
analysis of water and soil quality in the project area, including analyses of project
impact versus baseline information collected at the beginning of project (before works
commenced).
35.      The original social assessment, the early 2005 QAE and the 2008 Quality
Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) identified a number of social and
institutional issues from inequality and elite capture to irrigation costs that warranted
close supervision, but these issues were given insufficient attention despite their being
flagged repeatedly in mission aide memoires. Issues regarding the safety of dams,
although not formally triggered, were properly handled when a potential construction
of a new dam in the proximity of the N-T scheme occurred.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
36.     At project completion there are two very different situations in the project area
that will determine the sustainability of the rehabilitated structures. In the SC and NT
schemes where small farmers predominate, the project failed to introduce the needed
behavioral change in farmers and their WUOs for effective and sustainable operations.
In contrast, the other three schemes with medium-to large-size farm holdings, results
are clearly sustainable. As transition arrangements towards enhanced operation, the
current tendency to consolidate WUOs into stronger federations (FWUOs) promoted
by these users is encouraging, and the transfer of the irrigation and drainage (I&D)
infrastructure from ANIF to the FWUOs will continue enhancing the use of structures.
37.     Since most of the 2011 irrigated area was concentrated in the lower terraces
contributing to more economical use of the irrigation infrastructure with energy
consumed for pumping water estimated at 40 percent lower than before the project, it
is expected that a slow recovery of the irrigated area will occur. WUOs continue to
operate in spite of the operational subsidy termination in 2009, but a few more years
will be required before farmers and production systems adapt to the new full cost
recovery of irrigation expenditures. The area contracted for irrigation after subsidy
termination shrunk less in the project area than in the rest of the country. This
indicator suggests that, with the exception of SC and NT, the project improved the
prospects for irrigation use versus a no-project scenario.
38.     The recently appointed MARD management team has been giving clear
messages that rehabilitation of viable irrigation systems will continue. The
Government stated its commitment to develop an US$800 million investment
program for rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure based on the studies developed
under the project (Investment Strategy for Rehabilitation and Modernization of
Irrigation Schemes, and Technical, Economic and Social Analysis of the Irrigation
Sector), which would scale-up the project physical achievements.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
39.     Project objectives are still highly relevant: the Romanian irrigation systems
continue to be in urgent need of rehabilitation and production patterns need to be
transformed toward a more economic use of the extensive infrastructure built up in
the country in the previous decades. The reforms supported by the project were also
needed for facilitating the adaptation to the country’s accession to the EU in 2007,
which continues as a country priority. The project addressed the main sector issues
with a selective and balanced emphasis on key policy and regulatory aspects, key

                                           9
institutional issues, and an investment program designed for rehabilitation of those
economic viable segments of the sector. However, it lacked sufficient support for
small farmers to cope with the new rules of the game.
40.     The design was also in line with the primary development objectives defined
in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of revitalizing the economy in rural areas
and strengthening community based development; and addressing the issue of dealing
with the legacy of over-investment in the irrigation infrastructure by providing an exit
strategy for unviable schemes. In spite of the continued drawbacks in the reform
process, the project contributed to identifying and drafting a new institutional and
legal framework for irrigation, and supported the transition from a subsidy- to a cost-
recovery based irrigation financing system.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives (details on outputs in Annex 2)
41.      Some of the output and outcome indicators have been met while others still
fall shorter than expected. Indicators being met include: (i) productivity increases
were exceeded by 8 percent for corn and by 18 percent for vegetables; (ii) the share of
the area with HVCs in the total area irrigated has increased from 59.6 percent in 2005
to 88 percent in 2011, exceeding the target of 70 percent 8; (iii) over 90 percent of the
area irrigated in 2009-2011 was located on terraces below 70 m of elevation,
exceeding the 80 percent target, and reducing energy consumed by 40 percent from
about 922 kWh/1000 m3 (1997-2004) to 553 kWh/1000 m3 (2005-2011) which led to
saving about US$ 3 million/year; (iv) water charging changed from highly subsidized
to a full cost recovery system; (v) tariff setting is based on cost at every delivery point
(the PPSs), invoicing the full costs of services, flat distribution of operational
subsidies before its termination, tariffs negotiation take place between WUOs and
ANIF, and users’ representatives participate in some supervision of ANIF’s activities;
and (vi) about 458 WUOs and 12 FWUOs are managing PPSs and distribution
structures for about 1.1 million ha of irrigable area without subsidies.
42.     The project supported reorganization of WUAs into WUOs, and the
establishment of new WUOs was at the center of the strategy for the irrigation reform,
including participatory management and production development. However, WUOs
involving small farmers were not supported as envisaged. The USAID-funded WUAs
Development Project, which closed in 2005, should have been followed up by the
project and MARD specialized units in a second phase, providing training on
technical and financial management, and extension services, but was not done as
required. Hence, the expected behavioral change of farmers and their WUOs was not
achieved and the small farmers’ irrigation sector is far from the efficiency levels
anticipated at appraisal.
43.    The innovative reform in subsidies and tariffs was implemented, being
instrumental in orienting incentives to viable schemes. However, its effectiveness was
compromised as the level of subsidies did not gradually diminish as agreed to allow
farmers to adjust to a full cost recovery regime. MARD changed the approach not
only in conflict with the cost-sharing principle stated in the EC Water Directive, but
more importantly, sent mixed signals to WUOs and distorted incentives for behavior
change. The binomial formula – annual, to cover fixed costs, and volumetric, for


8
  High value crops (HVCs) for this indicator included areas planted with corn and soybeans that are usually
considered as low-value. The PAD indicator for HVCs referred mainly to fruit orchards, vineyards, and vegetables.


                                                      10
variable costs – and the long-term service irrigation water supply contracts were
introduced and preserved in spite of other inconsistent policies.
44.     Other key indicators have clearly not been met. The 70 percent target for
actually irrigated PA was not met as only 10 and 13 percent of PA was irrigated in
2010 and 2011, respectively. This poor result is also connected with: (i) the
supplementary character of irrigation in Romania and the high rainfall in those two
seasons; (ii) the conflicting policy messages previous to subsidy termination in
January 2010, leading farmers to believe that subsidies would continue; (iii) farmers’
perceptions that tariff charged by ANIF and the WUOs was too high, triggering very
limited use of irrigation; (iv) the failed project support for farmers and WUAs in
providing adequate technical assistance and training. MARD’s WUA Regulatory Unit
never assumed its agreed role of supervising their activities and facilitating the
development of WUAs 9; and (v) the third component was delayed until the project
end, and not implemented properly.
3.3 Efficiency
45.      The rehabilitation of the schemes had among other objectives: (i) increasing
irrigation intensity; (ii) conversion to HVCs; (iii) increasing yields; and (iv) allowing
for a more profitable and economic use of agricultural land. Using rather conservative
assumptions, the PAD economic rates of return (ERRs) for SC and NT were estimated
at 17.6 and 13.0 percent, and at 15.3 percent for the overall project. A new assessment
was done for this ICR considering the project’s five main schemes: SC, TN, TB, TV
and Câmpia Covurlui, as well as for the overall project. The analysis presented in
Annex 3 estimated an overall ERR of 14.7 percent, but showing significant
differences among schemes. The project first phase schemes (SC and NT), where
small farmers predominate, showed very low ERR (2.8 and 9.6 respectively) with
negative NPVs confirming that their performance is far below expectations. The other
three schemes where large farms dominate show ERRs between 20 and 32 percent.
46.      These results confirm that the project failed to attain its PDO in the schemes
where small farmers prevail. Productivity of resources was not improved as expected
and farmers have not increased their incomes, and irrigation structures are not been
used more efficiently. On the project schemes where medium and large farms
predominate, the assessment confirms what can be also observed in the field:
irrigation structures are being used more efficiently and WUOs are managing
adequately the systems. The positive result in these cases relates to the irrigation
intensity and the degree of use of the irrigation systems and to the economies of scale
and existing capacity of farmers.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
47.      In spite of the high relevance and pertinence of PDO and adequate design,
during implementation there was an unbalanced focus on infrastructure delivery with
little and/or ineffective attention on changing farmers’ and ANIF behavior. Small
farmers’ difficulties for adapting to the new framework were not properly handled by
the PMU. The project failed to provide WUOs with the required comprehensive
training (component 2) and at the same time, to explore and identify technologies for


9
  This MARD Unit was never adequately staffed at central level and lacked representation at local/county level
closer to the beneficiaries.


                                                       11
reducing energy consumption (component 3). Together with the persistent lack of
MARD commitment to the reform agenda, these flaws ended up compromising the
attainment of the PDOs. The actual outcome and economic indicators show that the
small farmers’ rehabilitated schemes are not showing an efficient use of their systems.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
48.     The project design included an insightful social assessment and an
experienced team that appropriately emphasized the role, structure and capacity of
WUAs as the key social institution in the project and their importance for project
success. However, in retrospect, attention to social development issues should have
been much stronger both during project design, and more specially, during
implementation. These social issues ended up undermining the attainment of the PDO.
The main flaws were: (i) the assumption that given water, farmers would switch
automatically to HVCs by their own initiative; (ii) the willingness and capacity to pay
as water tariff increased to full recovery levels; (iii) the effect of organization of
WUOs by commune rather than by command area; (iv) the WUOs capacity and
commitment to maintenance of the systems; and (v) the risk of elite capture of
benefits and the problem of social distance between the WUOs and the farmers.
49.     The project did not specifically target poverty groups but addressed one key
resource constraint to long-term rural poverty alleviation. Design was not supported
by an accurate beneficiary assessment even though the two main schemes (SC and
NT) included mainly small poor farmers with only 2 – 4 ha each, occupying half of
the schemes’ area. Although the PAD recognized that special attention should be
given to small farmers, whom at the time felt that their WUAs were not responding
properly to their needs and requests, and in spite of the fact that more than 50 percent
of the project rehabilitation funds were spent in these two schemes, the PMU did not
monitor properly the WUOs performance. The establishment of the WUOs was too
often the initiative of a single person in the respective area, who supported the activity,
but the low participation and lack of training and support perpetuated an autocratic
way of leadership. This has ended up reducing or completely halting the WUOs
activity once these leaders were out. In some cases they even ended up being used
politically by local leaders and/or charging very high water tariffs to the point that
farmers stopped irrigating. The PMU should have reacted proactively by reinforcing
training, and technical and managerial support for correcting organizational problems
and improve the performance of these schemes where small farms prevailed.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
50.     The project fundamental Law on Land Reclamation attempted to address the
main policy constraints to efficient irrigation. The institutional reform was well
thought-out in general terms but not with the required details. Its implementation was
problematic given the continuous attempts to undermine it. Restructuring of the
former irrigation agency included the divestiture of many activities that were
irrelevant or peripheral to its main task. WUOs were organized in most of the
functional systems and twelve FWUOs have already being formed and are assuming
management of their systems 10. The transfer of ownership over the tertiary irrigation

   At project closing, 12 federations of WUOs (FWUOs) have been established, covering over more than 100,000
ha, with 80 percent of this area having concluded protocols with ANIF for transfer of infrastructure management.


                                                      12
infrastructure to WUOs was a central point of the sector reform as compared to other
countries where only management was transferred. Reforms were accomplished in
spite of the weak MARD commitment. The project also facilitated a solid analysis of
the future of the land reclamation sub-sector (including irrigation, drainage, and soil
erosion control) through a number of strategic studies conducted by international and
local consultants, which should be instrumental for developing further solutions to the
sector issues.
51.     However, the frequent changes in management at MARD and ANIF, triggered
chaotic changes in sector legislation and regulations, continuously introducing
uncertainties in the sector reform eroding the project impact and its sustainability.
ANIF was dominated by engineers with very limited appreciation for the social and
economic aspects, and for the software side of the business. On top of it, the low
priority assigned in practice to irrigation by MARD resulted in exercising little
oversight. The last ANIF reform enacted in 2011 introduced renewed disarray in
performance of its mandate with inadequate staffing, financing arrangements (through
the land reclamation tax), and higher centralization of decision making in Bucharest.
In spite of the recurrent drawbacks the core sector reforms were not reversed.
52.      The institutional development goals of the project on WUO support were only
partially attained through support on legislative reform around establishment of
WUOs, and the efforts to form WUOs (and federations) across the project area.
However, WUO sustainability, particularly in smallholder-dominated areas, is
uncertain due to low levels of capacity and huge water tariff levels discouraging
irrigation in the SC and NT rehabilitated schemes. MARD oversight over tariffs set by
ANIF and even over the WUOs tariffs was absent. Without subsidies and changes in
the production systems, smallholders found tariffs beyond their capacity to pay. There
was insufficient project support to institutional development and good governance
within WUOs in the two schemes rehabilitated in phase I. In the other schemes, with a
small number of large commercial farms, they have been able to take advantage of the
rehabilitated infrastructure better than the smallholders have. WUOs in these areas
were better able to levy accurate tariffs to users than in WUOs with large numbers of
small farms and potentially greater constraints to internal oversight and accountability.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
53.     The poor results may have negative effects over future public investments
aiming to develop irrigation in Romania, in spite of offering a good potential in some
of the systems if they are well managed.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
54.     A stakeholders’ workshop has been held during the last supervision mission as
part of the ICR preparation process, to discuss the project achievements, shortfalls,
and lessons to be learnt for further development of irrigation activities in Romania.
The workshop benefited from large participation by WUOs leaders, representatives of
MARD, ANIF, and professional organizations and academia involved in the sector
and enabled lively discussions on both project results and future MARD program
paths to support the irrigated agriculture in Romania. Annex 6 summarizes main
findings and the workshop list of participants. Overall, participants highly appreciate
the infrastructure rehabilitation investments, but recognize that several factors within
the control of the GOR affected results, including flaws in selection of schemes, the
lack of MARD and ANIF leadership, commitment and continuity towards the project
objectives and the required software support activities.

                                          13
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
55.     Although the WUOs, FWUOs, and the system of tariff setting and charging
for services established under the project are maintained beyond the project closing,
the long-term sustainability of the expensive rehabilitated structures is considered at
this early stage as uncertain and the risk to DO as substantial. The maintenance
expenditures being paid by water users are substantially below the requirements for
long-term functionality of the rehabilitated infrastructure. The project weakness in: (i)
assuming that with the physical improvements for water delivery farmers would
increase agricultural production and adopt proper cropping patterns, (ii) assuming that
the farmers would have the capacity to pay for the higher water tariffs as subsidies
were eliminated; and (iii) the support to small farmers’ WUOs to manage, operate and
maintain properly the irrigation systems; rise realistic and strong doubts about the
sustainability of the project physical improvements. The failure in achieving the
aimed DO is already clear in the SC and NT schemes, while in the other schemes the
low maintenance tariff show that their sustainability might be compromised.
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
56.     The Bank team was proactive, persevering but not sufficiently effective in the
long process of project design, and in pushing the reform agenda in midst of strong
resistance from a conservative bureaucracy with vested interests resisting changes.
The dedicated preparation team contributed to the drafting of the new irrigation law,
ensuring that it was not watered down in the approval process; and to the designing of
the new subsidy policy moving incentives from the supply side (with uneconomic use
of subsidies) to the demand side (flat subsidy through WUOs). However, readiness at
entry was not assured, and failed to define the required capacity building and
extension activities for small subsistence farmers and their WUOs for managing and
transforming their traditional farming systems into commercial and more efficient
small farms as was required for being able to pay for water tariffs without subsidies.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
57.    Once the new legislation was approved, the Bank successfully backed the
government in resisting the old guard’s attempts to roll back reforms, and worked
very hard to improve project performance following the project’s initial unsatisfactory
performance.
58.      The Bank team paid close attention to implementation of the construction
activities and the quality of the works through frequent site visits. During formal
supervision missions, the team inspected the works and identified some construction
deficiencies which were notified to the contractors, site supervisors and PMU
technical team. Further, the team followed up with the PMU to ensure that the
respective deficiencies were addressed by the contractor. Some of the mission
findings have been also discussed during the joint portfolio reviews.
59.    However, while engineering aspects of implementation were well handled, the
supervision team should have paid more attention and reacted more proactively to the
slow progress in the institutional development activities. If properly monitored the

                                           14
poor performance on the two first phase schemes where small farmers needed further
support should have been handled through stronger interventions with technical
assistance, strengthening extension services, M&E, training, etc.). As these aspects
ended up not functioning properly, the project impact was poor compromising results
and sustainability of the rehabilitated infrastructure. Irrigation development requires
strong and well-functioning management entities, and dynamic production systems
with HVCs capable of generating sufficient financial margins to afford, operate,
maintain, and justify investments, paying the full costs of irrigation water.
60.    When the Romanian authorities backtracked on its commitment to policy
reforms and acted at odds with project objectives, the Bank could have acted to take a
stronger stance on project performance: first, by rating the project realistically, and
second, by taking remedial action especially with regard to the activities under
components 2 and 3. Project suspension should have been considered in response to
the actions by the Romanian authorities that clearly jeopardized the potential
achievement and sustainability of project objectives.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
61.     Overall, the Bank fell short during preparation and implementation and missed
opportunities to turn the project around. Both QAE and supervision performance
revealed aspects where the Bank could have done a better job in improving readiness
for implementation and/or by introducing corrective measures for improving
implementation and performance of components 2 and 3. And while the Bank team
and management understood the threats to the project by lack of Government
commitment to the project, notably its mismanagement of subsidy reduction and
stalled implementation due to inadequate allocations of project financing during crisis
years, stronger actions could have been taken. It also missed the opportunity to join
forces with the EU to increase its leverage over the Romanian authorities.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
62.     The Government commitment and ownership to PDO was almost inexistent
throughout the preparation and implementation phases allowing a recalcitrant
behavior by many officers with interest in holding power and aborting the reform
process. The presence of reform-resistant management in ANIF generally drawn from
its predecessor SNIF, supported by the MARD and MPF, slowed down
implementation of reforms almost constantly. The counterproductive management of
subsidies during the three years grace period before their elimination (to comply with
various EC directives) constitutes the clear proof of this behavior that the project
failed to change. However, despite ups and downs, the difficult institutional reforms
have been passed and implemented, and backsliding has been prevented, which means
that the few reformers in government were able to overcome the “old guard?.
63.    While the project promoted campaigns for the reorganization of WUAs into
WUOs and the training sessions targeted only farmers located on the schemes whose
pumping height is below 70 m, the program was in competition with the MARD
subsidies which supported investment in rehabilitation of tertiary infrastructure
(managed by WUOs) within schemes with over 70 m pumping head as well. ANIF



                                          15
continuously operated inefficiently and with little attention to farmer’s needs mainly
due to the unfinished reforms agreed at appraisal.
64.    The recurrent contradicting amendments to the sector’s legal and regulatory
set up introduced chaos destabilizing the aimed reforms. The ill-informed decision-
making process and notably the persistent project funding gap made implementation a
problematic process. The inadequate funds allocated initially to the project through
annual budget made project implementation difficult (with payments to contractors
deferred for many months) and contracting of new activities impossible in the first six
months of the year; additional funding was provided, usually, in the second half of the
year through budget rectifications. In some cases, the contractors even threatened
with suspension of works.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
65.    The PMU, staffed in majority with technical people, paid more attention to
engineering activities of the project and less to the institutional and agronomic
aspects. More efforts have been paid to monitoring the implementation of civil works
and procurement and installation of equipment for the WUOs than to the use of such
equipment and impact on farming performances. The engineering issues that
appeared during project implementation, mainly with respect to rehabilitation of the
primary irrigation infrastructure, have been resolved timely and to a satisfactory level.
66.      One of the main factors affecting implementation was the low priority given to
irrigation development by the government specialized agencies. The MARD’s lack of
PDO ownership was reflected in an inadequate composition in the PMU staffing, the
LRD and in the WUOMU, as well as weak oversight of project implementation. The
salary cuts by 25% enforced by the Government during the financial crisis also
undermined the morale of the PMU staff and compromised its dedication to project
implementation. The frequent changes in management at MARD and ANIF triggered
continuously signals of instability to all sector stakeholders. MARD did not exercise
much oversight over ANIF or the project, and was not an effective counterpart partner
to the PMU and Bank’s efforts.
67.    The PMU had worked almost as an external agency from MARD with very
loose contact with MARD’s top management or its line services. Additionally, project
management showed persistent inefficiencies in monitoring the quality of civil works
contracts, site supervision, and engineering activities.
68.     The financial management of the project was, in general satisfactory as was
the attention paid to monitoring the compliance with the environmental safeguards.
In contracts, procurement activity was slow and inconsistent, with many deficiencies
in preparation of bidding documents and implementation of Bank procedures, which
led to cancellation of the last ICB package of equipment for WUOs, just before the
project closure.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory
69.     The constant increase in subsidies for irrigation during the grace period after
EU accession until their 2010 termination, and its opening to all farmers enrolled in
WUOs ignoring the long term viability of irrigation, was one of several events
demonstrating the implementing agency’s lack of interest in following the reform
strategy, leading farmers to believe that the reforms would not continue. While tens of

                                           16
millions dollars were spent in subsidies counterpart funds were below the agreed
needs. Internal conflicts in WUOs were not handled properly and monitoring of
financial and social aspects within the WUOs has faltered affecting the project’s
overall outcome and its sustainability. The PMU should have reacted proactively by
reinforcing M&E, WUOs’ training activities, including technical and managerial
support for correcting the organizational problems and improving the overall
performance of the phase I schemes where small farms predominated.
6. Lessons Learned
•   Where difficult reforms and entrenched interests are involved, the Bank should
    require more concrete evidence of commitment to the project’s objectives before
    approval. As such, the Law on Land Reclamation should have been made a
    condition of negotiations rather than a condition of effectiveness. During
    implementation, when it became clear that Government commitment to the project
    was no longer there, the Bank should have acted more proactively to suspend or
    drastically restructure the project.
•   Although irrigation subsidies have been removed, and thus one of the project’s
    objectives met, its removal has significantly affected already-vulnerable
    beneficiary group - the poor small-scale farmers. Weak M&E contributed to this
    problem, as well as insufficient attention paid to guidance provided by the QEA,
    which warned of the weakness of assumptions upon which the project’s WUO
    reform was based.
•   The economic analysis of projects under preparation should be used as an iterative
    planning and design tool, rather than as a simple requisite to justify pre-defined
    investments. Project impact could be significantly enhanced and failures reduced,
    as the best investment alternatives are better checked and identified at appraisal.
•   The absence of implementation readiness aggravated an already difficult project.
    The Bank should carefully plan its interventions get a project implementation
    ready by approval.
•   The Bank actions cannot substitute for the lack of Government commitment.
    Where insufficient commitment is evident, the Bank should be ready to walk
    away from the project.
•   The viability of irrigation when subsidies are phased out and high pumping head
    and costs prevail depends on the capacity of users to pay the higher water tariffs
    required for full recovery of irrigation cost. Usually, this process requires
    changing cropping patterns tending towards HVCs which involves strong project
    technical support for capacity building and extension for the irrigated production,
    and for development of marketing linkages for the incremental products.
•   A balanced attention to both the construction and institutional capacity building is
    critical. The irrigation development projects require good managers to succeed.
    Too often these projects are managed just as a construction scheme, with good
    civil and/or hydraulic engineers, but usually with little or no understanding of the
    development of irrigated agriculture which require professional management, and
    a good multidisciplinary team including also social and agronomic expertise for
    guiding a complex socio-productive process.
•   The Government should reshape its institutions to ensure a comprehensive
    approach and improved performance in the water sector, for monitoring

                                          17
    participatory water management, WUOs efficient functioning, and for developing
    extension services for enhancing associations of small farmers to produce and
    market HVCs. Indeed, without sufficient attention to coordinated service delivery
    efforts by MARD/local agricultural directorates, and ANIF staff, it is possible that
    the planned larger investments in irrigation rehabilitation in the country may
    similarly fail to induce economic behavior change on the part of smallholders
    towards HVC production.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component
1.       Analyzing project outputs and expected impact require understanding that
irrigation performance in Romania is strongly affected by two main factors. First,
since irrigation is supplemental to precipitation, irrigation intensity varies mainly as a
function of the annual rainfall. Second, during project implementation, irrigation
intensity was also strongly influenced by the changing policy of subsidies provided.
2.      The peak of the irrigated area during the project life was between 2007 and
2009, which had been very dry years. The lowest irrigation intensity was in 2005, an
above normal wet year and also when subsidies were introduced; and in 2010, when
subsidies were phased out. The irrigated area in the country remained very low during
these years, ranging between 27 percent in 2007 to 5 percent in 2010, and 7 percent in
2011. The trend is slightly better in the project area where the irrigated area dropped
from 41 percent in 2007 to 13 percent in 2011. This downward trend in irrigated area
should be slowly reversed as farmers adapt to the new irrigation full cost recovery
situation and accession to the EU. The following graphs show the correlation between
precipitation and irrigated areas in the country and in the project area respectively.

Component 1 - Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure (US$86.2 million spent,
90 percent of actual project costs)
3.     The rehabilitation works for main irrigation infrastructure, covering an area of
about 100,000 ha in the four schemes selected as main project areas, were adequately
completed at closing: Sadova-Corabia (SC), Nicoresti-Tecuci (NT), Terasa Viziru

                                                                   20
(TV), and Terasa Brailei (TB). The quality of works was satisfactory, except for
minor parts, like a 3 km secondary canal in TB where the lower quality was
remediated during the defects liability period. Rehabilitation works are functional and
operational efficiency has been substantially improved. However, the two first
schemes mentioned above, representing 50 percent of the project area, where most of
the smaller farmers/project beneficiaries are located, and where the component
invested more than 50 percent of the available funds, are only irrigating 6 to 8 percent
of their command area due to the failure of the WUOs’ management, and of the
farmers’ adaptation to the new rules of the game. In these areas, the project failed in
changing farmers’ and the leading government agencies’ behavior. However in the
other 50 percent of the area, dominated by larger farmers (Terasa Viziru and Terasa
Brailei), the area irrigated varied between 21 percent and 37 percent of the command
area, with higher area under WUOs (up to 47 percent in Terasa Brailei).
4.      The rehabilitation works for 9 major pumping stations (PSs) were completed
and the works were of good quality. These 9 PSs serviced 100,000 ha. The original
target was 20 PSs servicing 400,000 ha, but the target was reduced to 8 PS due to cost
escalations. Some savings in other contracts allowed for rehabilitation of an
additional PS.
5.      Under this component, a support program for strengthening the WUOs activity
which included rehabilitation of tertiary facilities (PPS owned by WUOs) through full
rehabilitation or replacement of critical spare parts, supply irrigation equipment office
and communication equipment, as well as motorcycles for field management. At
project closing, water meters have been installed in 309 PPS, 140 WUOs were
provided with irrigation equipment, 136 WUOs were provided with office and
communication equipment, and 127 WUOs were provided with motorcycles. In
summary, the planned support and achievements at project closing are shown in the
table below.

6.      During supervision missions, the Bank team inspected the completed works in
most schemes and confirmed that rehabilitated infrastructure is performing as
expected. However, although the required arrangements for quality assurance in the
PMU were in place during the project, the due diligence was not always adequately
applied during execution, resulting in production of inspection reports and action
plans were not always implemented on the ground. As noted above, Bank supervision
missions found some deficiencies in the works, which had to be remediated by the
contractors. In addition, after-care of executed works, in particular related to
maintenance of rehabilitated canals, has not been adequately undertaken mainly
because of lack of funding. The lack of maintenance will reduce gradually the
efficiency of works, with clear risks of unsustainability of improvements. Bank


                                                        21
missions recommended that the users and ANIF address urgently this problem to
ensure adequate regular maintenance of infrastructure to avoid serious deterioration of
rehabilitated infrastructure within the next three to five years.
7.      This component’s outcome is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. The
rehabilitation activities were completed as per the revised targets in the project areas
and the WUO support activities (rehabilitation of major PSs, water metering devices,
monitoring and control equipment, rehabilitation of tertiary infrastructure, etc.) were
mostly achieved as per the revised targets. However, currently there is limited use of
the rehabilitated systems in the SC and NT schemes mentioned above.
8.     Component 2 – Support for Institutional Development (US$3.2 million spent,
3.3 percent of actual project costs)
9.       The main institutional development activities for the irrigation sector showed
mixed results. The setting up of the new legal and regulatory framework was
successfully enforced in spite of a strong and persistent opposition of the old guard
entrenched in MARD and other government strata. But the new institutional set up is
not performing well. The restructuring and privatization of SNIF, and the creation and
initial functioning of the ANIF followed a very slow process and showed continuous
ups and downs. It is still far from functioning as envisaged. The SNIF privatization
plan was prepared and approved by the government, but finally not implemented. It is
still operating, but undertaking reduced construction activities.
10.     In spite of the recurrent drawbacks, the core sector reforms were not reversed.
The frequent changes in management at MARD and ANIF, which triggered changes
in sector legislation and regulations, continue to introduce uncertainties in the sector.
ANIF is still dominated by staff that has limited appreciation for the institutional
development aspects of the irrigation business, and display limited appreciation of the
user farmers’ role in the irrigation management. The low priority accorded to this
sector by MARD resulted in not exercising much oversight over the irrigation
structures and performance. The last ANIF reform enacted by MARD in 2011
introduced new disarray in ANIF capacity to comply with its mandate, with
inadequate staffing, unclear financing arrangements, and even enforcing higher
centralization of decision making in Bucharest. The Bank recommendation to close
down all economically unviable irrigation schemes and write them off ANIF books
was not implemented even though it should be a priority for ANIF rationalization. It
remains to be clarified what will happen with these schemes under ANIF evolving
structure and responsibilities, and how the costs incurred for preserving the integrity
of these schemes will be borne, since no irrigation services have been requested for
over 10 years. The Bank also recommended that Ministry of Public Finance (MPF) to
take a closer view of these expenditures, which unnecessarily drain significant
financial budgetary resources.
11.      The component also supported the preparation of several studies including
technical, economic and social analysis for of the irrigation sector, farmers’ capacity
to pay for water tariffs, for developing a strategy for the rehabilitation of viable
irrigation infrastructure, and for the development and strengthening the WUOs
through training programs and direct guidance in their evolving activities. Other
consultant studies have been commissioned under the project to further support sector
adjustment to changing conditions (e.g. Review of Irrigation Tariffs Setting,
Development of WUOs, Support for ANIF Restructuring, SNIF Privatization Plan).
However, the recommendations provided by these valuable technical reports were

                                           22
mostly not adopted by the pertinent authorities. The frequent changes in MARD and
ANIF senior management further undermined in several occasions the reform path,
and in general, did not provide adequate enabling conditions for the project to succeed
in the efforts for develop irrigation and agricultural production.
12.     The project support to establish and strengthen within the MARD: (i) the Land
Reclamation Directorate, for performance monitoring and reviewing service charges;
and (ii) the WUO Regulatory Office, for developing a database and procedures for
monitoring WUOs; was never taken seriously by MARD and has completely failed.
Also, the support activities aiming to strengthen extension services and appropriate
use of agrochemicals and for developing the WUOs capacities have been almost
inexistent. Since their creation, the WUAs and later the WUOs have been perceived
by most officials within MARD, SNIF and ANIF as a threat to their existence as they
were seen as taking over their responsibilities of managing water structures.
13.     One of the main project objectives was to support the development and
strengthening of WUOs. As the MADR’s WUAs Regulatory Office did not assume its
intended role, the project team partially acted as the technical arm of MARD during
project implementation. The area covered with WUOs had increased steadily since
2005 up to 1.4 million ha and continue even after the subsidy was terminated in 2010
(constituting a good sign of the perceived benefits from a joint operation of irrigation
infrastructure). However, the PMU activities over time diluted gradually and less
substantive support was provided to the already functioning WUOs that were showing
clear signs of discomposing. The PMU focused more on tangible targets, like number
of sprinkler lines, spare parts, or office equipment delivered, but lost the general
perspective of WUOs activity and the overall project performance. More attention
should have been given to supporting the WUOs consisting mainly of small farmers,
mostly poor, on the options available to diversify their cropping patterns for higher
household benefit and irrigation systems’ efficiency, or to resist the high tariffs set by
some of the WUO management (where local elites captured WUOs’ leadership).
14.     WUO sustainability seems uncertain in areas where small farms are
predominant. The project was more successful in inducing more efficient irrigation
with WUOs having larger, market-oriented farmers, compared with those where the
majority of members are smaller and subsistence farms. In SC and NT schemes
dominated by these farms, most WUOs failed to function properly and orient
production to HVCs, resulting in poor incentives to irrigate. Hence, most farmers
cannot pay the cost of the irrigation water delivered through the WUO-owned PPSs
and either abstract water directly from the main canals with individual diesel pumps
(and pay only the ANIF tariff), or pump from their own wells. Others continue with
rain fed agriculture. As a result, as the percentage of small farms member of WUOs
increases, the lower the percentage of the command area is irrigated. The WUOs of
small farmers should have received more attention from the project PMU through
specialized extension and services (socio-economic guidance, training, etc.) to support
their adaptation to the new rules, increasing the share of HVCs, enhancing their
access to markets; and consolidating farms into more commercially oriented
structures, like the producers’ groups. Such structures could have operated in parallel
with the WUOs and benefited from EU financing under the National Rural
Development Program (NRDP).
15.     In contrasts, the WUOs established by larger, commercial farmers, which have
stable contracts for their output with market operators or large retailers (including


                                           23
hypermarkets and supermarkets), had less trouble to adjust their irrigation activity
following the termination of subsidies. Indeed, they focused irrigation on the crops
with high yield response to sufficient water supply and for maintaining the quality of
products. Irrigation of seeds production as well as high value crops – vegetables –
predominated, but other crops have also been irrigated provided that the yields could
pay for water. As mentioned above, most WUOs in Terasa Brailei, Terasa Viziru, and
Campia Covurlui schemes have, in principal, large farms members blended with some
small farms but also market-oriented. In these areas, the area contracted for irrigation
dropped by only 6 percent while the actual demand for water (area actually irrigated)
dropped less substantially after 2010 compared to Sadova-Corabia and Nicoresti-
Tecuci schemes; the area irrigated varied between 28 percent and 48 percent of the
contracted area and between 21 percent and 37 percent of the command area.
16.      As tariffs are set considering real costs, and costs are directly related to water
demand, tariffs vary every year. If demand is low, they can exceed the tariffs charged
before rehabilitation and become too expensive even for commercial farms. Closer
involvement of water users in WUOs activities would help increasing ownership and
the water demand. As farmers perceive the water tariffs charged by both ANIF and
WUOs as too high, especially with the elimination of the subsidies 11, demand for
irrigation declined. Management of some WUOs, mainly in the SC scheme where 54
percent of the farms are semi-subsistence, set very high water tariffs for on-farm
distribution driving (mostly small) farmers towards rain fed farming or to abstracting
water directly from ANIF canals or private wells through their own, small diesel
pumps. Farmers pumping from canals bypass the WUO tariff and pay only the ANIF
delivery tariff. This situation should have been better handled by the PMU and
MARD by reacting and paying special attention to resolve these issues and provide
more support to small member-users in getting their voice heard in their WUOs
internal decision-making process, and improve the organization’s management.
17.    Based on the mentioned considerations the component is rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
Component 3 – Exploring Technologies for Reducing Irrigation Energy
Consumption ($0.3 million spent, 2.7 percent of the budget)
18.     The implementation of this critical component was continuously delayed by
the PMU for unclear reasons. Finally, the equipment for the pilot demonstration field
was supplied in late December 2011. However, it appeared that for some technical
reasons the equipment could not be installed before closing and the demonstration
events could not be organized during project implementation. The project ended up
financing endowment of a research station with new irrigation equipment, which was
not the purpose of the component. MARD needs to make arrangements for financing
further WUOs training after the project closure. The component is rated as Highly
Unsatisfactory.
19.     Overall, at closing the project shows that some of the output and outcome
indicators have been met and in some cases exceeded, while others fall shorter than
expected, as described below:



11
   In some cases, the delivery tariffs calculated by ANIF after rehabilitation were higher than before (discrediting
the expected benefits of rehabilitation), but were revised after the Bank questioned their calculation.


                                                         24
     •    The increase in the agricultural productivity measured by tons/ha in the project
          area was exceeded by 8 percent for corn, and by 18 percent for vegetables 12;
     •    Higher value crops (HVCs) irrigated have increased from 59.6 percent in 2005
          to 88 percent in 2011, exceeding the target of 70 percent, but this indicator
          includes corn and sunflower as higher-value crops while the PAD referred to
          fruit and vegetables 13.
     •    Over 90 percent of the area irrigated in 2009-2011 was located on terraces
          lower than 70 m exceeding the target of 80 percent, contributing to a more
          economic use of irrigation, reducing energy consumed by 40 percent from
          about 922 kWh/1000 m3 (1997-2004) to 553 kWh/1000 m3 (2005-2011). This
          lead to saving, on average, about US$ 3 million annually.
     •    The project changed water charging from a highly subsidized system to full
          cost recovery; and following methods based on energy consumption to actual
          metering the water abstracted through PSs within and outside the project area
          on 284,400 ha (below the original 500,000 ha target but exceeding the 250,000
          ha revised target).
     •    Other institutional changes are/were successfully used: tariff setting based on
          cost at every delivery point (SPP), invoicing the full costs of services, flat
          distribution of operational subsidies before its termination, tariffs negotiation
          between WUOs and ANIF, and participation of users’ representatives in
          supervising ANIF activity, and transfer of ownership over the tertiary
          irrigation infrastructure (SPPs, pipe network, other appurtenant structures)
          from ANIF to WUOs.
     •    458 WUOs and 10 FWUOs are managing SPPs and distribution structures for
          about 1.1 million ha of irrigable area without subsidies. From 2007 to 2009
          (last 3 years before subsidies termination, an annual average of US$70 million
          was spent in irrigation subsidies).
20.      Indicators targets not been met are also several. The 70 percent target for
actually irrigated area was not met as only about 10 and 13 percent was irrigated in
2010 and 2011, respectively. Recent information shows that 135,600 ha have been
irrigated in 2012 (11.3%) in the entire country. Data from the project area appear to
be around 20% but could not be confirmed. These poor result is connected with: (i)
the supplementary character of irrigation in Romania and the high rainfall in the last
two seasons; (ii) conflicting subsidy policy messages prior to its termination in
January 2010, leading farmers to believe that subsidies would continue; (iii) farmers
perceptions that tariff charged by ANIF and the WUOs is too high, triggering very
limited use of irrigation; and (iv) the failed project support for WUOs in providing
technical assistance and training (accounting and financial management, budgeting,
irrigation and water management).


12
    The average yield for corn increased from 5.0 t/ha in 2005 to 7.04 t/ha in 2011, while the target was 6.5 t/ha.
Similarly, the target for vegetables was 20 t/ha and the average reached 23 t/ha, while the baseline was 14.2 t/ha.
13
    The 6 percent average increases of gross margin (GM) in $/ha for farms in the project area, estimated by the
project’s Impact Assessment using 2011 prices are inconclusive. Favorable climate conditions led to the highest
agricultural production of crops in the last 20 years. These economic results cannot be associated with the project
as the high production from rain-fed conditions reduced irrigation needs equalizing conditions between project and
control areas. Also, being the 2nd year after the termination of subsidies, farmers are still adjusting to the changing
conditions and a longer period would be needed before a realistic impact in increase of the GM can be assessed.

21.      MARD’s WUA Regulatory Unit had not assumed its expected role of
regulatory authority facilitating the development of WUAs and supervising their
activities; and the project failed to finance “Phase II WUA support? as USAID
program was ended in 2005 as planned. This resulted on farmers’ slow or lack of
adaption to the new market conditions by changing cropping patterns from low-value
cereal and oilseed crops to higher-value fruits and vegetables.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Summary
1.      The Project Impact Assessment (PIA) Study prepared at project closing by
Egis Romania Consultant (the PIE Consultant) included a detailed cost benefit
analysis (CBA) based on the performance of irrigated agriculture in the Project Area
(PA) 14 and in the Extended Project Area (EPA) 15 as compared with the performance
in a similar Control Area (CA) 16. The CBA aimed showing if the IRRP investment is
producing the expected financial and economic results by using the usual indicators:
financial and economic rates of return (FRR and ERR), and net present values (FNPV
and ENPV).
2.       The IRRP Project Appraisal Document (PAD) indicates that the rehabilitation
of the schemes had the following objectives: (i) prevention of further deterioration;
(ii) increase in irrigation intensity; (iii) conversion to higher value crops; (iv) increase
in yields; and (v) making a more profitable and economic use of agricultural land (i.e.
conversion from subsistence to commercial agriculture). Prevention of further
deterioration of structures has been achieved, but in the future, the responsible
authorities would need to conserve and maintain the schemes to assure that irrigation
will remain functional.
3.     The PIA was done for the five main schemes of the project area: Sadova-
Corabia (SC), Terasa Nicoreşti-Tecuci (NT), Terasa Brăilei km 166 (TB), Terasa
Viziru (TV) Câmpia Covurlui (CC) with sub-schemes Lieşti, Prut, Vameş and
Șendreni. The results showed significant differences among the five irrigation
schemes. The indicators for the rehabilitated schemes in the first phase of the Project
(SC and NT), where small farmers predominate, and show very low rates of return
confirming that their performance is being below expectations with negative NPVs if
a discount rate of 10 percent would be used. The other three schemes, where medium
and large farms predominate, would be having a good performance, confirmed by the
estimated indicators.
Assumptions of the analysis
4.      The projection of irrigated area for PIA was done with some difficulties,
especially because of the extensive decrease of irrigated areas that happened in 2010
and 2011. The before and after project situation method to measure the project
performance was seen not to be appropriate in this case, as the two major influencing
factors affecting the irrigated areas distorted what can reasonably be expected to
prevail in the future as farmers get better adapted to the new rules of the game. These
factors are: (i) the elimination of the irrigations subsidies in 2010; and (ii) the above
normal precipitations in 2010 and 2011, which reduced the need for irrigation. The
“with and without? method provides a more realistic approach for estimating the
irrigated areas on the long run.



14
   The PA was defined as the project area where infrastructure rehabilitation from water source up to
farm was done. It includes the following schemes: Sadova Corabia (SC), Terasa Nicoresti Tecuci (NT),
Campia Covurlui (CC), Terasa Brăila (TB), and Terasa Viziru (TV).
15
   In addition to the Project Area, it includes the WUOs which received funds for the on-farm
infrastructure rehabilitation or for irrigation equipment, but not included in the Project Area.
16
   The CA was defined with the following schemes: Terasa Brăilei Sud (TBS), Câmpia Covurlui except
for the four sub-schemes in the Project Area (CC), and Terasa Ialomita Călmățui (IC).

                                                 27
5.       The main assumptions for the analysis were defined considering the following
factors:
   •   In 2009, the WUOs received very large subsidies for the annual tariff, delivery
       tariff, maintenance and energy. Such subsidies created a huge distortion that
       did not help to show the real farmers’ capacity to pay and what the irrigated
       area could be under normal conditions. Once the suspension of subsidies took
       place in 2010, Romania could grant only subsidies as payments per hectare
       (SAPS).
   •   A study was performed in 2010 to assess the capacity to pay of farmers and
       WUO under the new no-subsidies conditions. The study revealed, among other
       things, that farmers did not believe that subsidies would be dropped and that
       they would receive other grants in a way or another. As the no-irrigation
       subsidies situation became evident, farmers were very confused and
       disappointed by the new policy.
   •   The completion of some rehabilitation works and acquisition of some
       irrigation equipment was done in 2012, i.e. the year of this impact assessment,
       so the effects of these investments are still to be seen.
6.      The “with project? scenario estimation started considering the total net area
per scheme and the maximum area irrigated since 2005. Estimations were made
taking into account the tendencies in each scheme separately, based on information
collected from the field, and from the PMU. The total net project area is 101,245 ha. It
was assumed that from the technological point of view, a maximum of 80% of total
net area could be irrigated given the existing cropping patterns and practices. The
actual maximum irrigated area in the last years in each scheme was also considered.
7.       Other elements were taken into account were for instance, that in SC only five
out of the eight WUOs will continue to irrigate. Each WUO was analyzed separately
in order to see the possible tendencies. The same applies for NT where only three out
of six WUOs will continue to irrigate. Based on these considerations the maximum
area estimated to be irrigated is 5,997 ha in SC and 5,710 ha in NT. The estimated
areas were assumed to be reached in 2017 after a gradual increase. Beyond this year,
the irrigated areas would remain constant. Based on those considerations, the analysis
and information prepared by the Consultant determined that the maximum irrigated
area would reach about 51,630 ha (Table 1).

       Terasa Brailei km 166         7,092          5,739               7,092

       TOTAL                        80,996         50,654              51.630

8.     For the “without project? scenario it was assumed that the performances of the
schemes would continue to deteriorate, generating higher O&M costs. As a result,
there would be an increase of the annual tariff and water delivery costs, and a gradual
reduction of irrigated areas leading inevitably to an increase of ANIF tariffs to keep
the scheme functioning. On the long run, without rehabilitation, the schemes would

                                             28
provide diminishing water volumes and it was assumed that in year 2028 the scheme
would stop functioning. The reduction of irrigated areas under this scenario was
estimated conservatively with an annual decrease of 1% on the medium and long run,
and after 16 years the irrigated areas would become zero as the schemes would stop
operations.
Gross margins and crops structure
9.      Crop and farm budgets under both scenarios “with and without? allowed to
estimating gross margins. Data sources included the National Statistics Institute,
interviews with farmers, and other studies. Margins were estimated for four categories
of farms based on their size: smaller than 10 ha, 11 – 100 ha, 101 – 500 ha and larger
than 500 ha. Under the without project scenario, (i) yields were assumed to be 5%
smaller since production would face some limitations due to deteriorating systems;
and (ii) irrigation costs would be 20% higher as proved in the technical studies. The
crops used are those present in the PA according to data provided by the Agency for
Payments and Interventions in Agriculture (APIA). The irrigated crops yields and
gross margins obtained for the four farms categories are presented in Tables 2 and 3
below.

10.     The analysis used APIA data for 2007–2011 to define the cropping patterns
and crop structure. Year 2007 pattern was considered representative of the without
project situation, and 2011 pattern as representative of the with project scenario. Data
shows for all areas within the PA a reduction of those crops with lower gross margins
and an increase of those with higher gross margins. Although not as expected, this
shows farmers’ tendency to use irrigation water more efficiently. As cost becomes



                                            29
higher, farmers move towards crops offering higher margins to cover costs. Crop
patterns for each scheme and for the PA are presented in the Tables 4, 5 and 6.

11.    From Tables 4 to 6 it appears that a slight decrease of wheat area occurred,
while maize holds the same share. Sunflower’s increases its area for the whole PA,
while soybean decreases. The increase of percentage of not cultivated land is totally
explained by the significant increase of idle land within the SC scheme. It should be
noted that global grain prices (wheat, corn, and soybean) jumped in 2010/2011 as a

result of global production shortfalls, which in turn could influence to some extent
farmer production decisions.
Economic and Financial Results
12.     The FRR and ERR, as well as FNPV and ENPV using 8 percent as annual
discount rate are presented bellow (Table 7). For the economic analysis the financial
flows were adjusted as follows: (i) the VAT was excluded; (ii) the subsidies (SAPS
payments) were eliminated; (iii) a conversion factor (CF) of 0.85 was applied for civil
works; (iv) unskilled labor costs was corrected with a 0.75 CF; and (v) a 0.98 CF was
applied to agricultural product prices as they are almost in line with international
values.

13.     These results confirm that in the SC and NT schemes, where small farmers
prevail, the project has failed to attain its DO as crops productivity have not increased,
farmers have not improved incomes, and irrigation structures are not been used more
efficiently. In the other three schemes, where medium and large farms prevail, the
ERR vary between 20 and 31.6 percent. These results confirm what can be observed
in the field: small farmers were not able to make a good use of the improved
structures because their lower capacity, while big farmers are making a more efficient
use of their resources. The expected behavioral change was achieved with big farms
but not with small farmers, and the reason is because they were not adequately
supported with extension and capacity building.
Sensitivity Analysis
14.      The sensitivity analysis tests what would happen if some assumptions show a
different behavior than the one that was assumed. For instance, what could be the
project return if the irrigated area decreases below the assumed levels, or if the
agricultural products’ prices decreases in the future. Other tested variable included an
increase of agricultural production costs. The following Table 9 shows how the
mentioned risk factors would affect the project economic and financial results. The
highest sensitivity corresponds to the actual irrigation intensity, or the degree of
utilization of the rehabilitated irrigation systems. If its use drops by 10% below the
assumed levels, then the ERR would also drop from 14.6% to 11.0%.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

A sociologic research was conducted through a field study and a phone/email study;
the latter regarded only the WUOs which had applied for financing the rehabilitation
of their infrastructure as part of Measure 1.2.5 of the National Program for Rural
Development (NRDP), funded jointly by the European Commission and the
Government of Romania. This measure can finance projects prepared by WUOs
estimated to cost up to € 1 million, to rehabilitate the pump stations (SPPs) and pipe
networks owned or managed by the WUOs.
     1. Field Study
1.      Objectives: The field study was the main instrument for collecting the data and
information required for the evaluation of the project's impact, such as: (i) the
irrigated cropping pattern, (ii) the crop yields, (iii) the crop budgets, (iv) the selling
prices of the agricultural products, (v) the revenues and expenditures of the WUO,
(vi) reasons for the decrease in the irrigated areas, (vii) the water tariffs applied by the
WUO, (viii) the nature of decision making and implementation processes, and (ix) the
WUO-ANIF relations. The data collecting period was 5 - 26 of April 2012.
2.      The field survey aimed at getting answers to a standardized questionnaire
applied "face-to-face" to the respondent. The targeted population was the WUO's
representatives and users of irrigations within these organizations. The WUO
representatives were mainly directors or presidents of the WUOs’ Board, together
with accountants in case they were not familiar with the financial data. Respondents
were first approached by phone, and meetings arranged in their offices. Ten interview
operators participated in collecting data.
3.      The sample: In January 2012 there were 458 WUO’s in Romania, with a net
area of 1,107,475 ha, including some WUOs that were formed but had never irrigated
for organizational, technical or financial reasons. From the total, 138 WUOs (30%)
have never irrigated commanding a net area of 242,194 ha (23% of the total area held
by the WUO’s). In the sample, 39 WUO’s were selected, of which 22 WUOs within
the Project Area (PA) and 17 outside the PA. The sample WUOs are presented in
Table 1.

4.      The representativeness of the sample in the PA is high considering the regions
and the irrigated area in 2009-2011. The number of WUOs represents 45% of the total
PA. The WUO’s in the sample have 71% of the total PA, and 68% of the irrigated
area. The WUOs in the sample represent 12% of the number of active WUOs, 14% of
the area under active WUOs and 20% of the irrigated area (table 2). A number of 239
farmers were irrigating within the sampled WUOs, with an area of about 46,000 ha,
(39% of the area of the PA).

5.       Data collection tools. The data collection was made through four
questionnaires, two of which included a set of questions covering aspects addressed to
the WUOs leaders and referred to the WUO farmers. The second one included
questions to get case studies and to estimate crop budgets. In big WUOs discussions
were conducted with at least 15 farmers and, in smaller WUOs, with at least 3
representatives if available. Questions referred to the irrigation activity, the economic
results, farming practices, and the reasons for the reduction in the irrigated areas.

   2. Phone / email study
6.      Objectives. The phone study allowed for collecting certain data and
information referring to Measure 125 of the PNDR. The period for the data collection
was 5 – 26 of April 2012. This research was based on a standardized questionnaire
sent by fax or email to WUOs representatives that have submitted applications to
access the Measure 125 available funds for the rehabilitation of on-farm infrastructure
within the WUOs or for the rehabilitation of the FWUO’s infrastructure. The sample
was drawn from the list of the WUOs which had submitted this type of applications.
Questionnaires were sent to 38 WUOs out of the 46 whose requests had been accepted
for financing. Only 15 WUO’s have sent back the questionnaires duly answered.
Some of the study results are presented below.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      A four hour stakeholders’ workshop was organized by the PMU to discuss the
project implementation experience, results and lessons learned. The workshop took
place on May 15, 2012 in Bucharest, and was attended by several stakeholders
including MARD representatives from headquarters, regional and local offices;
representatives of WUOs, authorities of LUAIR, ANIF representatives, both from
central and local offices, AIFCR, CNRID, PMU staff and members of the World
Bank mission (see list of participants below).
2.      The workshop agenda included a short presentation of the project objectives
and the project results, and discussions about the factors affecting irrigated
agriculture, IRRP implementation, and the expected impact of the project. PMU and
the WB representatives presented the components of the Project, its objectives,
outputs and outcome of IRRP. Overall, there was a general feeling that the IRRP
support was highly needed and positive, mainly in rehabilitation of the public main
and the on-farm (transferred to WUOs) irrigation infrastructure.
3.       Main factors pointed as affecting the project achievements were:
     •   Continuous changes of the MARD and ANIF leadership;
     •   Continuous amendments of the Law 138 affecting the land reclamation sector;
     •   Lack of control in the field, both from ANIF and from (and to) WUOs;
     •   Persistent inconsistencies regarding the regime of subsidies adopted by
         MARD:
            o Although there was an agreed reform path for the irrigation subsidies
              and the target beneficiaries (through the WUOs), the MARD changed
              the criteria every year, defining their amounts on an increasing trend
              until its abrupt end in 2010. Besides WUOs, other beneficiaries where
              also considered eligible to receive such subsidies contradicting the
              agreed policy to strengthen WUOs.
            o Although the WUOs and beneficiaries were informed about            the
              suspension in 2010 of irrigation subsidies (in accordance with     the
              agreements concluded with EU), WUOs were still expecting that      the
              government would continue to grant irrigation subsidies due to     the
              confusing policy signals contradicting the reform path.
            o Not stimulating subsidy allocation. Although a cap was provided (per
              ha) but without contribution of WUOs or a thorough analysis for
              granting the subsidies, through the Emergency Ordinance 123/2006
              approved by the Law 125/2007 subsidies for repair and guard of the on
              farm infrastructure belonging to WUOs have been granted.
              Consequently, substantial of funds were directed to non performing
              WUOs (i.e. 950 euro/irrigated ha in 2009 for one eligible WUO –
              accordingly to the mentioned law).
4.     All these factors led to undermine the reform process and the GOR agreed
IRRP principles. Some recommendations for the development of the irrigation sector
were agreed:



                                           40
   •   Continue to rehabilitate the viable irrigation schemes which is the only
       feasible option in support of those farmers willing to continue working with
       irrigated agriculture;
   •   Adequate consideration to the O&M issues of the rehabilitated infrastructure
       should be maintained: beneficiaries and their WUOs have to be convinced that
       if they do not accept and pay for the necessary amounts to cover adequate
       O&M works, the availability and delivery of the irrigation water could not be
       sustainable;
   •   Systematic and disciplined O&M works as well as adequate management of
       the irrigation water taking into account the specificity of the cropping
       activities is absolutely necessary.
5.     The implementation of the project was thoroughly discussed by the
stakeholders, especially regarding the selection of the schemes for rehabilitation.
Attention was addressed to SC and NT schemes which used half of the project funds
but are irrigating below its capacity. On the other side, participants appreciated the
works performed in Terasa Brailei, Terasa Viziru and Campia Covurlui schemes
where the reduction of irrigation costs are visible and irrigation is performing better.
6.      Concerning the support given for on-farm irrigation infrastructure, many
participants expressed their conformity and others their expectations on continued
support. There are WUOs that were prepared for procuring their needed spare parts
but that could not be done due to problems in the procurement process.
Representatives from Galati WUOs expressed strong interest in developing vegetables
crops and their needs of adequate water supply difficult to be obtained without a
similar project support. Other WUO representatives from Calarasi district expressed
that due to the rehabilitation performed through project support, the energy bill was
reduced by 20-30 percent. WUO representatives from Galati expressed their need of
new modern and more efficient irrigation equipment as the existing is a constraint for
the development of their productive activity.
7.      Other interventions referred to the need of introducing flexibility and allowing
for updating rehabilitation designs to the needs of the users demand. Studies for
project preparation completed several years before the time of implementation should
incorporate modifications following the demand occurring especially in periods of
new changing realities. The type of farmers when the project was designed in the
nineties were mostly small, but in few years associative agricultural farms took over
as the predominant water users interested in developing irrigated agriculture.
8.      WUO representatives also expressed that the irrigation sector was affected
very hardly and need continuing support for their activity through a similar IRRP
project. It was pointed out also the need of stronger institutional support for
organizing WUOs in future projects as an important ingredient in improving
organization and performance of the agricultural production in the irrigation domain.
Participants asked the Bank representatives to continue such support. The Bank
representatives expressed that if the GOR requests such a new project the Bank would
probably support it.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1. Background
Romania has a total of 15 million hectares of agricultural land, two thirds of which are arable. Major
agricultural produces come from cereals (particularly maize), vegetables, potatoes and fruits. The
grain cereals cover more than 60% of the cropped area. The main natural constraint in performing a
sustainable agriculture in the Southern and South-Eastern Romania is the semi-mid character of the
climate with frequent droughts, irrigation b eing necessary. Due to the climatic conditions and for
decreasing the drought risk, between the years of 1965 and 1989 some 3.0 million ha of irrigation
systems were constructed.
Broadly speaking, Romanian irrigation is characterized by three terraces and the Danube River is
the main water source for irrigation. The water is distributed to the crops through the on farm
infrastructure composed by pressure pumping stations and underground pipes provided with
hydrants where the irrigation equipment is connected. The overall static lift to the highest terraces
can reach over 200 m, and including the SPPs, the total dynamic pumping head for these terraces
can exceed 270m.
The main issues in the irrigation sector are, after 1989, the legacy of over-investment in irrigation
infrastructure, an inefficient institutional framework, and poor on-farm water management. To
address these issues, a policy of the irrigation development was set out, based on the following
pillars: (i) increase the responsibility of irrigation water users through participatory irrigation
management; (ii) reform of pricing and subsidies; (iii) restructuring of the Government's agency in
charge with the irrigation sector, and (iv) rehabilitation of deteriorated, economically viable,
irrigation infrastructure. Based on this policy committed by the Government, the World Bank
Board approved the Project on July 31, 2003 and the Loan Agreement, for financing the Project,
was signed on August 26, 2003. The implementation agency was the Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development (MARD) which e a Project Management Unit (PMU).
1.1.    Support of IRRP in implementation of the development policy- Project objectives
Through its objectives, IRRP provides an important instrument for implementation the
Government strategy regarding the structural reforms in the agriculture sector with emphasis on the
land reclamation sub-sector and increase the viability and cost effectiveness of irrigation. The
investment projects were selected in a participatory manner, all stakeholders, state through the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the National Land Reclamation
Administration (ANIF), and the final beneficiaries, the irrigation users - Water Users
Organizations (WUOs), being involved in selecting the irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated and
of the on farm irrigation infrastructure, analyzing the proposed technical solutions for
rehabilitation and in financing the works. The costs contribution of WUOs refers only to
rehabilitation of their on-farm irrigation infrastructure as well as to the endowment with
equipment necessary to manage irrigation on their territories.
The Project was structured as follows:
          • Rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes - component 1
          • Support to institutional development - component 2
          • Irrigation technologies for energy consumption saving - component 3
          • Project management - component 4
1.2.    Financing sources
The total cost of IRRP is US$102.947 million and will be covered as follows:
        • IBRD                                                 US$ 80.000 mill.
        • Government of Romania                                US$ 20.622 mill.
        • Water Users Organizations                             US$ 2.325 mill.

2. Project Description
2.1. Description of project components
Component 1: Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes. The Project supported rehabilitation of the
irrigation main infrastructure serving about 100,000 ha and also, the rehabilitation of the on-farm
irrigation infrastructure of WUOs, including endowment with equipment necessary to improve the
irrigation management at the level of on-farm infrastructure (water meters installed in the pressure
pumping stations, irrigation equipment, motorcycles for interventions in field and IT equipment).
The rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation infrastructure and improvement of the irrigation
management in the field are based on the demand driven principle, the beneficiaries (WUOs) being
involved in elaborating the design (through a specialty company), supervising the rehabilitation
works and setting out the necessary equipment for irrigation management as well as in covering a
part of the related costs.
Component 2: Support for institutional reform in land reclamation sector. This component mainly
aimed to support the implementation of the institutional reform and initial operation of ANIF and
WUOs. In particular, the Project grants support for privatization of the National Company "Land
Reclamation" (SNIF) by elaborating a privatization plan, technical assistance for ANIF to improve
its management, technical assistance for the MARD WUO Regulatory Office concerning the WUOs
monitoring and supervision and for the Land Reclamation Directorate within MARD for
strengthening its role as supervisor of ANIF as well as training for WUOs regarding administration,
financial management and on farm irrigation infrastructure operation and maintenance.
Also, under this component, a detailed economic analysis of the irrigation sector and a strategy for
future investment in the irrigation domain was prepared, as basis, for Government strategy and
further investment prioritization.
Component 3: Irrigation technologies for energy consumption saving. Under this component, two
demonstrative plots equipped with low energy consumer techniques were established.
Component 4: Project Administration. Under this component, national staff, international and
national consultants, vehicles and office equipment was financed, to support implementation of the
project.
2.2. Effectiveness and duration of the Project
The Loan Agreement was signed on August 26, 2003. The Project was designed to be implemented
over a period of seven years, until March 31, 2011. During Project implementation, at the request
of the Borrower, two extensions of the Project closing date were agreed: the first one until March,
31 2012 and the second one until June 30, 2012. The reason was to implement all activities
included in the IRRP.
3. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs
3.1. Component 1: Rehabilitation of irrigation schemes
The following activities were proposed under this component:
1.     Rehabilitation of the main irrigation infrastructure (total or most critically deteriorated
structures: main pumping stations, irrigation canals and structures).
2. Rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation infrastructure belonging to WUOs (pressure pumping
stations - PPSs, including water meters and underground pipes network).



                                                   44
3. Endowment of WUOs with irrigation equipment and motorcycles for watering supervision
and intervention (with 10% contribution of WUOs).
4. Assessment of the rehabilitation on the environment. The cost estimate for this component was
US$94.1 Million.
Component 1 was completed in June 2012, and the hydrological-environmental investigations were
completed in March, 2011. This investigation was required under EMP, and it was a sub
component of the component 4, Project administration. The investigations conducted by a consultant,
hired by PMU, proved that rehabilitation did not affect negatively the hydro-ecological state of the
environment but it contributes in decreasing the impact of irrigation on the environment through
reducing the water losses from the irrigation canals and protection of the soil against salting and/or
swamping.
3.1.1. Rehabilitation of the main irrigation infrastructure- main pumping stations, irrigation canals
and afferent structures (total or most critically deteriorated structures)
The main irrigation infrastructure serving an area of 100,000 ha was proposed to be rehabilitated in
two phases. The schemes proposed for rehabilitation were selected from those to have
economically viable future: static pumping head less than 70 m, advanced state of WUAs/WUOs
development and system transfer, strong water demand as evidenced by the number of long-term
irrigation service contracts concluded and by the irrigated area.
The schemes of the first phase were proposed for full rehabilitation. During development of the
first phase and preparation of the second one (feasibility studies performing), it had been ascertained
that a better use of funds with better positive impact is to focus on the critical deteriorated
components which rehabilitation has as consequence the most energy saved (principle 80/20).
So, eight irrigation schemes were subject t o rehabilitation, out of which in only in four schemes
the main pumping stations where rehabilitated:
•        Phase I (51,340 ha) - Sadova Corabia (40,310 ha) and Terasa Nicoresti Tecuci (11,030 ha)
irrigation schemes have been fully rehabilitated (including the drainage network and forestry belts).
They have been selected during project preparation (2001-2003). The feasibility studies were
drafted and they foresee, together with rehabilitation of the main and on farm irrigation
infrastructure, also rehabilitation of the main drainage canals network placed within the low
plain of Danube and on the first terrace in the depression area (Sadova Corabia) and within the
Barlad river low plain (Terasa Nicoresti Tecuci), where, because of the high phreatic level, the
land was affected by groundwater logging. The feasibility studies have been endorsed by the
Technical and Economic Committee of MARD and by the Inter-ministerial Council and they
were approved by the Government (Government decisions 938 and 939/2003).
In 2004, the PMU launched the tender to select the consultant to elaborate the detailed designs in
accordance with the approved feasibility studies and in 2006, based on a competitive selection, the
works contracts were awarded. The works were finalized in 2008 (Terasa Nicoresti Tecuci) and 2010
(Sadova Corabia).
•        Phase II (41,535 ha) located in two schemes: Terasa Brailei (sub-scheme SPA Km 166, 8,865
ha) and Terasa Viziru (32,670 ha). In both schemes, the most deteriorated parts of the main
infrastructure have been rehabilitated. In addition, in this phase, four main pumping stations of the
Campia Covurlui scheme - SPA Liesti (5,184 ha), SPA Vames (6,910 ha), SPA Prut (5,575 ha)
and SPA Barbosi (3,166 ha) have been selected for rehabilitation.
In 2006, based on the same criteria used at the phase I, the irrigation schemes Sag Fantanele, Semlac
Pereg, Terasa Viziru, Terasa Brailei (sub schemes SPA km 166 and SPA km 196) with pumping head
below 70 m and four sub-schemes of Campia Covurlui irrigation scheme (SPA Liesti, SPA Vames
and SPA Barbosi - low plain of Siret river and SPA Prut -low plain of Prut river) with pumping head
of 5-10 m were selected. An international consultant was selected to elaborate the feasibility studies,
through international competition. The feasibility studies were finalized in the first semester of 2008.
These studies have been endorsed by the technical and economical committees of ANIF, MARD and
by the inter-ministerial council and they were approved by the Government.

                                                  45
Based on the feasibility studies, it was ascertained that to rehabilitate the whole main irrigation
infrastructure of the mentioned irrigation schemes, the estimate of the funds were beyond the
available funds of IRRP. Consequently, for a better using of the available funds and to cover more
zones with rehabilitation works, in consultation with the World Bank, it was decided that the better
option is to rehabilitate the most deteriorated critical components of the infrastructure so that the
indicator investment/energy save through rehabilitation to be the best.
In accordance with the performed analysis, the rehabilitation objectives have been established, as
follows:
•   Terasa Viziru - all five main pump stations, the supply canals CAL and CAT, and secondary
    canals CD5 and CD10.
•   Terasa Brailei (sub-scheme SPA km 166)- main pumping stations SPA km 166 and SRP II Pisc
    and some interventions, in the most critical zones, on the canals CA II, CD20 and CD20A.
•   Sub-schemes SPA Liesti, SPA Vames, SPA Barbosi and SPA Prut (only the four main pumping
    stations)
The detailed designs were elaborated only for the above objectives.
The works contracts were awarded, through tender, to several construction companies, during
2009 -2012 period, and the works were terminated as follows:
•        Terasa Brailei, subscheme SPA km 166- October 2011
•        Main pumping stations SPA Liesti, SPA Vames and SPAPrut- June 2011
•        Terasa Viziru- June 2012
•        Main pumping station SPA Barbosi - June 2012
The area covered by these 8 irrigation schemes is considered as Project zone.

*) The project target, in accordance with PAD was 20 main pumping stations with a command area of 400,000 ha and for
this component was allocated US$5,500,000. The feasibility studies and the designs elaborated for 14 pumping
stations (3 in Sadova Corabia irrigation scheme, 5 in Terasa Viziru, 2 in Fantanele Sag and 4 in Campia Covurlui)
found these pump stations more deteriorated than anticipated, requiring an average investment of US$1.6 million per
pump station. Consequently, the initial target was revised through decreasing the number to 8 and the area to 90,000 ha.

3.1.2. Rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation infrastructure belonging to WUOs                            including
endowment with water meters
To benefit from the IRRP support, WUOs had to fulfill several criteria as: legally established, own
on farm irrigation infrastructure, fully operational, multi-annual in force contract, to have the
territory within viable irrigation schemes (pumping head below 70 m).
The material support to WUOs was provided on a demand-driven contributory basis. The WUOs
contribution represented 10% for goods and 5% for rehabilitation works.
3.1.2.1. Rehabilitation of the on farm irrigation infrastructure
Initially, in the IRRP there was foreseen only rehabilitation works based on feasibility studies and
detailed designs, WUOs contribution being represented by performing the feasibility studies and
detailed designs and in paying of 5% of the rehabilitation costs. Afterwards, following the
discussions with WUOs, PMU agreed to procure spare parts/equipment/components to replace the
worn out ones. The World Bank agreed to this proposal, too. Consequently, the proposal was
included in the support Program for WUOs. However, to benefit of this kind of support, WUOs

                                                          46
had to support a technical expertise and to mount the respective goods as well as to pay a
contribution of 10% of the goods cost.
So, to benefit of rehabilitation, WUOs could choose for rehabilitation works or for procurement of
equipment/components/spare parts to rehabilitate by themselves the infrastructure. 13 WUOs opted
for the first variant of rehabilitation and 35 WUOs for the second variant. In the Project area, 27
WUOs benefited of this kind of support. The command area of the rehabilitated on farm
irrigation infrastructure represents 98,392 ha, out of which 57,433 ha within the Project zone.
3.1.2.2. Procurement and installation of water meters in SPPs (without WUOs contribution).
The water meters are ANIF ownership. The procurement of the water meters was made following a
selection of the pressure pumping stations belonging to WUOs and this selection was based on the
technical information and functionality provided by ANIF and WUOs. Also, the criteria regarding
the location of WUO at less than 70 m pumping head and WUOs irrigation activity (contract
concluded with ANIF, irrigated area) have been taken into consideration too. 309 water meters have
been installed in the pressure pumping stations belonging to 102 WUOs. The command area of these
SPPs is 285,000 ha.
3.1.3. Endowment of WUOs with irrigation equipment and motorcycles for watering supervision and
interventions
3.1.3.1. Irrigation equipment
A number of 140 WUOs (Area=308,367 ha) benefitted of 1,292 equipment (1,059 hand move and
233 hose and reel, out of which 65 WUOs within the project area (134,134 ha).
3.1.3.2. Motorcycles
A number of 127 WUOs benefitted of 199 motorcycles (Area=286,134 ha), of which 59 motorcycles
for 39 WUOs within the project area (83,601 ha).
Inputs for support program for WUOs (rehabilitation of the on farm infrastructure, water meters,
irrigation equipment and motorcycles). The total amount spent from IRRP has been US$19,397,621
out of which US$1,489,700 was WUOs contribution.

3.2. Component 2. Support for institutional reform in land reclamation sector
3.2.1. Overview of the legal frame work governing the irrigation sector
The first step in implementing the reform was the Government Emergency Ordinance no.147 on
Water Users Associations (WUAs) issued in 1999 and approved in 2001 as Law no. 573 which
enabled the establishment of the water users associations entitled to take over ownership of the on-
farm infrastructure and to manage it (including maintenance and operation) for the benefit of their
members and other farmers within their territory.




                                                47
As the reform of the irrigation sector had to make regulations both for the water provider and water
users as well as for a better use of funds and irrigation schemes, the legal frame need to be completed
and in May 2004 the Land Reclamation Law no.184 entered into force.
The new land reclamation law was a useful tool in implementing the reform of the institutional
environment based on the following principles:
l. Establishing of the National Land Reclamation Administration (ANIF) by taking over from the
National Company "Land Reclamation" (SNIF) the main activities in the land reclamation domain;
2. Pass over the responsibility for operation, maintenance and repairs of the on farm infrastructure
to the landowners;
3. Recovery of irrigation services cost to ensure the increase of economic viability and irrigation
efficiency;
4. Taking over the responsibility for the co-ordination of land reclamation activities lies by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, which assumes the main planning and policy-
making role for the land reclamation sector.
The effect of the law was visible. Thus:
1. ANIF was established being focused only on the land reclamation activities and outsourcing of
the maintenance and repair activities.
2. The new legal framework regulated the relations between the institutions of the irrigation sector.
3. Implementation of the cost recovery principle and of the new mechanism of the irrigation
subsidy. ANIF charges users the actual cost to provide irrigation services. The subsidies were
provided only to users organized into WUOs who concluded with ANIF long term service contracts
and the subsidies were limited to an amount per hectare, uniform at national level.
In fall 2011, the Emergency Ordinance no.82/September 2011 provided significant changes to the
initial Land reclamation Law no 138/2004, as follows:
• Establishment of the National Land Reclamation Agency (the Agency) through reorganization of
the National Land Reclamation Administration (the Administration). The acronym remained.
• The Agency is a public institution, budgetary one, under the authority of MARD.
• Responsibilities in regulating and drafting the policies of the land reclamation domain and
administrator of the land reclamation schemes.
• The structure of the Agency includes a Head Office, based in Bucharest and 41county-based
subsidiaries.
• The Agency takes over the patrimony of the Administration and it will hand over to the
Administration "Apele Romane" all works for flood protection (dykes, dams, etc.), so that the
responsibilities of the Agency refer only to irrigation, soil protection and drainage.
• The maximum number of the Agency staff was established up to 1,500.
• Financing – from own revenues and state budgetary allocation
         o Own income (provisions of the Government Decision regarding the Organization and
            Functioning Regulation of the Agency):
• Land reclamation tax collected from all land owners located within land reclamation schemes.
• Tariffs for land reclamation services (irrigation - annual and delivery tariffs; drainage tariff; soil
protection tariff)
• Other: penalties, interest, water supply tariff or localities, fish farming works, renting goods of
its patrimony and other income as provided by the Law 138/2004.
         o State allocation (provisions of the Government Decision regarding the Regulation for
            Organization and Functioning of the Agency):
• Salaries of the permanent staff, up to 1,500 persons.
• Functioning expenditures of head office, branches and administrative units


                                                  48
• Investment and other expenditures assimilated as capital ones. Consequences:
          The principle of unitary operation of a hydro-technical scheme is eliminated.
          Correlation with the water basins is eliminated.
3.2.2. IRRP support for institutional reform in land reclamation sector
3.2.2.1. Support for MADR and ANIF
a) Physical support (endowment with IT equipment) and b) Technical assistance.
Apart of the current technical assistance granted by PMU to MARD (Land reclamation
directorate and Regulation Office of WUOs) in drafting several legal norms, the IRRP financed
several studies to support MARD and ANIF to improve the irrigation sector activity, as shown in
the table below:

The technical assistance provided to MARD materialized through the collaboration of PMU and the
land reclamation compartment of MARD in drafting Government decisions and Ministerial orders, as
follows: norms for the law implementation (GD 1872/2005), norms regarding irrigation subsidies
(MO 1230/2005), norms regarding the irrigation tariffs (MO 1231/2005), organizing and functioning
regulations for ANIF (GD 1874/2005), norms regulating establishment of WUOS and Federations of
WUOs territories (MO 118/2005), norms regulating the establishment of the representative zones
within WUOs territories and criteria in selecting the zones representatives (MO 146/2005), norms
regarding the arbitration commission of WUOs and FWUOs (MO185/2005), establishment of the

                                                          49
subsidy cap (MO 689/2007), establishment of the level of WUOs contribution to the irrigation tariffs
(MO 690/2007). During the IRRP implementation, PMU collaborated with ANIF on:
    •   all feasibility studies and the detailed designs were endorsed by the technical and economic
        committee of ANIF;
    •   preparation of the terms of reference (the technical part of the bidding documents) regarding
        the feasibility studies and those regarding ANIF were drafted with ANIF;
    •   selection of the pressure pumping stations belonging to WUOs to be equipped with water
        meters (as mentioned earlier, the water meters are ANIF propriety).
3.2.2.2. Support for WUOs
The IRRP support for WUOs focused on two directions: (i) physical support and (ii) institutional
support - technical assistance. The collaboration between the PMU and WUOs materialized in
meetings where several problems were discussed as: procurement of irrigation equipment (although,
initially, through PAD there was established to procure only hand move equipment, afterwards it was
accepted, based on the request of WUOs, to procure hose and reel equipment too) and procurement of
spare parts for the on farm infrastructure (components for the pressure pumping stations, pipes
sections, hydrants, etc.) based on a technical expertise, as a complementary measure for the on farm
infrastructure rehabilitation.
(i)     Physical support
Under this component, there were procured IT and communication equipment. Each WUO could
receive financial support to procure only 1 set of IT and communication equipment (comprising 1
computer + 1 printer + 1 copy machine and 1 telephone/fax). There were procured 136 sets for 136
WUOs covering an area of 304,309 ha out of which 39 WUOs (88,813 ha) located within the Project
area. The total amount was US$492,985 out of which the WUO contributed US$49,299.
(ii)     Institutional support- technical assistance
The technical assistance materialized in the early stages of the IRRP (2005 - 2006) in assisting the
irrigation users to establish WUOs and they were advised on procedures to access funds from IRRP
for rehabilitation of their on farm irrigation infrastructure and various endowments. During 2007, the
IRRP was promoted in media, PMU having a permanent (monthly) presence in a specialty publication,
“Profitul Agricol?.
In 2009, a training program for WUOs was organized with project financing. The specialty
representatives of WUOs were trained in the following domains: (i) WUOs management, (ii)
Operation and Maintenance of the on farm irrigation infrastructure, (iii) Irrigated agriculture including
the use of agrichemicals in accordance with the good practices in agriculture, and (iv) contracts
management and financial management. The manuals referring to the above items were printed and
they were disseminated to the participants and to other WUOs which did not send participants. 192
representatives of 120 WUOs attended the courses.
3.2.3. WUOs development
Once the new legal framework was issued in 2004/2005, the process of WUOs establishment started.
At December 31, 2011 there is an area of 1,107,475 ha held by 458 WUOs out of which 119 represent
former WUAs which committed to re-register as organizations of public utility, according to the law
provisions, and 103 are newly set up WUOs. Most WUOs were established in zones considered
viable from the point of view of irrigation costs, with pumping head lower than 70m (352 WUOs,
covering 793,358 ha – 77% of total). The most density of WUOs registered in the Eastern part of
Romania, with great tradition in irrigation, where the risk of drought is significant, the irrigable area is
mostly under 70 m pumping head and the irrigation costs are lower, which represented an important
incentive for farmers to organize WUOs. Thus, 180 WUOs (39%) covering an area of 551,805 ha
(49.8%) are located within irrigation schemes of Calarasi, Ialomita, Braila and Galati counties.
The structure of the WUOs members changed: the members are mainly formed of commercial
companies ("commercial" type) compared to previous situation when WUAs had mainly individual
farmers ("classic" type). The classic WUOs are those that have majority of its members farming small
land- holdings. The commercial WUOs are those that have the majority of its users as agricultural

                                                    50
companies and most of lands are managed by up to 10 people who compose the staff and members of
the organization. Instead of small landowners as members, they have agricultural companies as
members.
At December 31, 2011, in the project zone, 49 WUOs are established and they were covering an area
of 91,925 ha, i.e. 91% of the total project zone and 8% of the national area of WUOs and 11.6% of the
area covered by WUOs below 70 m pumping head.

3.2.4. Development of Federations of WUOs (FWUOs)
The process of FWUOs establishment started in 2008 when the first three federations were organized.
At January 31, 2012, 10 federations were established covering an area of 95,586 ha with 27 WUO-
members. The federations are located in eight irrigation schemes. Nine federations have been
established within irrigation schemes with the pumping head below 70 m and one federation
(Tamoani Fantanele- 6,662 ha) was established on the superior terrace of Campia Covurlui irrigation
scheme with a pumping head of 176m (!). Within the project zone only one federation has been
established- Livesti in Campia Covurlui- sub scheme Liesti (5,184 ha), covering the whole area of the
sub scheme.
3.2.5. Irrigation activity
a) Impact of subsidy reform
The implementation of the cost recovery principle and of the new mechanism of the irrigation subsidy
has had the most important impact. Following this reform the irrigation concentrated in the areas
where the level of irrigation tariffs was affordable to farmers. The dry year 2007 is considered
illustrative for irrigation: the total irrigated area was 324,000 ha out of which 210,000 ha were
irrigated in the South Eastern Romania (Ialomita, Calarasi, Braila and Galati counties) and 46,000 ha
in Central Southern part (Dolj county) where the volumetric tariffs were below 300 RON/1000 m3).
These principles led to a better use of the financial resources, including the support of the state,
toward the irrigable areas with irrigation water demand, as it shows from the figure above.
Following a statistical analysis, it resulted that, after the implementation of the new subsidy
mechanism (starting with 2005 year), the amount of the subsidies are very strong correlated with
the amount of the irrigated area, water volume delivered as well with the other two indicators.
b) Irrigation intensity
During the period 2000-2011, two critical moments occurred: start of the reform implementation,
mainly the new mechanisms of subsidy and tariffs in 2005 and the subsidy cease in 2010. These
critical moments, correlated with the wet years 2005, 2006 - the rainfall during the growing period
was greater than the multiannual average with 10-84 percent (just after the implementation of the
reform) and 2010- the rainfall was with 25 percent greater than the multiannual average (the year of
the subsidy cease), had as consequence a significant decrease of the irrigated area and, implicitly
of the irrigation intensity (as percent of the contracted area). So, to assess the weight of each factor
(reform, subsidy cease and climatic conditions) is very difficult.
However, the data collected during project implementation could be summarized as follows:
• Although the impact of the subsidy cease was important, however the commitment of users to
irrigate (based on the contracted area) is significant (decrease only of 9 percent at the national and

                                                          51
the project zone level). Consequently, we can appreciate that those users committed to irrigate
exceeded the impact of the subsidy cease.
• In the project zone, the users, however, maintained a higher value of the contracted area in
comparison with the average at the national level, probably because through the rehabilitation of the
main and on farm infrastructure the irrigation costs could be covered.
• Regarding the irrigated area, the weather conditions impact is clear: the irrigated area fit with
the rainfall: less irrigated area in 2010 (wet year and very good distribution of the rainfall during
the growing period) and more irrigated area in 2011 (normal year).
• Regarding the concentration of the irrigated area in zones below 70 m pumping heads, the
data demonstrated that the impact of the subsidy cease (2010) had as consequence a reduction of the
contracted and irrigated areas of 11 percent and 60 percent, respectively, and within the zones
above 70 m pumping head, the reduction were 60 percent of the contracted area and 92 percent of
the irrigated area before 2010.
3.3. Component 3. Irrigation technologies for energy consumption saving
Within this component a study was elaborated regarding the irrigation technologies for energy
consumption saving. The study presented measures to reduce the water and energy consumption in
the pressure pumping stations and by using new and modem irrigation equipment. The study was
followed by arranging of a demonstration fields within the territory of a WUO.
WUO was selected based on the following criteria: location under 70 m pumping head, functionality
of the on farm infrastructure, the irrigation activity during the period year of establishment- 2010,
existence of the irrigation network characteristic (necessary in selecting the irrigation equipment
and mainly for their location within the irrigation plot), possibility to keep the equipment in safe and
the possibility to store the equipment in the season without irrigation.
Based on these criteria, WUO Valu lui Traian was selected. Two demonstrative fields were
designed, one on the territory of the Agricultural Research Station Valu lui Traian (field crops) and
one on the territory of the Research Station for Orchard Valu lui Traian which are members of
WUO Valu lui Traian. Both research stations are the state propriety (Academy for Agricultural
Sciences and Forestry), the risk for alienation of the equipment in case of WUO breaking up. Also,
these research stations have competent personnel in operating with such equipment and to present
the work technologies and their advantages in case visits/workshops/seminars should be organized as
well as the space to organize such meetings.
The equipment was delivered in December 2011 and installed in the first semester of 2012.
However, the meeting planned could not take place before IRRP closing. In the demonstration fields
there were installed one module for drip irrigation and a hose reel equipment for low pressure,
equipped with fertigation (fertilizer applied together with irrigation water) equipment (for the research
station for fruit growing) and one pivot, two linear and four hose and reel irrigation equipment,
equipped with fertigation devices (for the research station for irrigated crops).

Following the economic and financial analysis elaborated within the study "Project impact
evaluation" drafted by a consultant hired for this purpose in 2012, it resulted that, per total, the IRRP
was efficient.
The used indicators to evaluate the economical profitability were Internal Rate of Return (%) and the
Net Present Value (lei). These indicators have superior values than the limit of 8% in the case of
IRR (13%) and positive value in case of NPV (110 million lei). However, analyzing each
irrigation scheme, in case of Sadova Corabia irrigation scheme, negative financial results are
recorded (1.9% - IRR and 43 million lei- NPV). The main reasons are: the forecasted irrigated area
is beyond the actual one, the land is very crumbled (a constraint in applying irrigation) and the
transition to high value crops is very slow acting.
4. Bank and Borrower Performance
In accordance with the financial statements of the Project, from the loan, an amount of $74,732,875
(93.4 percent of the loan) was committed and paid as follows:

The funds have been not used as a whole for the following reasons:
1. The contracts were awarded following the tenders organized, in a competitive manner, and the
   values of the works, goods and consultancy services were below those estimated when IRRP was
   designed;
2. Except one works contract, the other ones were signed in Lei and because of the depreciation of
   the national currency vs. US$, the value of the paid works in equivalent US$ during the execution
   of the contracts was less than the value of the contracts at the moment of their signing.
3. In case of the goods, the difference of about US$4 million resulted, mainly, because the last
   tender to procure spare parts for WUOs was canceled.
Related to this last tender:
On November 22, 2011, the international tender for procurement of spare parts for WUO-owned
pump stations was launched, with the deadline for bids submission set out for January 6, 2012.
During the period of bids preparation, three bidders requested clarifications on the bidding
documents - section Technical specifications. The request of clarifications and the clarifications
were sent to the Bank on December 9, 2011 and the Bank, following their analysis, recommended
(on December 14, 2011) drafting an amendment to the bidding documents to reflect the
clarifications.
The World Bank granted the "No objection" on the amendment on December 21, 2011 and
recommended to introduce into the amendment an extension by two weeks to the bids submission
deadline (until January 20, 2012).
Afterwards, the PMU modified, at its initiative, the deadline for goods delivery and reduced it
from 12 weeks to 8 weeks, without requesting the World Bank acceptance, because following the
extension of the deadline for bids submission by two weeks (as described above), the deadline for
goods delivery would be beyond the closing date (June 30, 2012) and the payment of the delivered
goods would be not made from the Loan. This conclusion was based taking into account the time

                                                   55
for bids evaluation (about four weeks), World Bank approval (two weeks), submission of the
performance guarantee (two weeks) and contract signing in MARD (about two weeks). Therefore,
the contract would have been effective in April. Adding three months for goods delivery, the
deadline of IRRP could be overrun. Taking into account that the supplier, through the contract,
had to grant technical assistance to WUOs for installation of the goods, and due to the number and
large distribution of the locations, another two-three weeks were needed. Also, the terms estimate
was done on the assumption that it will not be necessary to obtain clarifications from the bidders
during the evaluation or the Bank will request some clarifications.
Because of the time pressure (end of December 2011) and taking into account that the potential
bidders (the companies that bought the bidding documents) knew that the bids deadline submission
was January 6, 2012, PMU hastened to inform them about the modifications on the bidding
documents, omitting to inform and request the World Bank approval for the modification of the
delivery period (two months instead of three months). The amendment, including the modification
of the delivery period and the cla1ifications were sent to the potential bidders on December 12,
2011.
During April 17-19, 2012, during the last World Bank mission on the procurement activity, two
major deviations at the procedure have been found:
i. Modification of the delivery period from three to two months;
ii. Request sent to bidder to confirm the price for certain goods (polyethylene pipe)
These conclusions were transmitted to the WB mission for Project implementation survey which
took place during May 7-15, 2012 period. Following the discussions with the WB experts, members
of the mission, to solve this problem, the recommendation was that MARD should decide upon the
future actions regarding the future course of action on the respective procedure. Further, MARD
requested, through the Ministry of Public Finance, cancellation of the tendering and a new project
extension until December 31, 2012 to allow for re-tendering and implementation of the contract. The
World Bank approved the cancellation on June 25, 2012 and on June 26 the bidders were informed
about this.
