SUBJECTs    Project Completion Report on Djibouti
Urban Development Project
(Credlt 1S18-DIZ)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Djibouti - Urban Development
Project (Credit 1518-DJI)" prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department, Africa Regional Office with
cmments from the Borrower but no part It.
The project achieved its objectives concerning the improvement of the
living conditions of the urban population in the areas covered by the project.
It also had a beneficial impact on the urban sector as a result of institutional
and financial arrangements emphasizing cost recovery in urban development.
Although the project met its objectives, it had to be delayed due to additional
works required as a result of technical problems in flood-prone areas and the
additional resettlement of population such conditions required.  This issue
underlines the importance of considering prevention and mitigation measures
upfront in project preparation, particularly in areas that are vulnerable to
natural disturbances.  This is an important lesson because of thw growing
occupation of such areas by population. The project also shows the need in
project design to realistically sJsess potential relocation needs that may arise
during project implementation due to physical/technical conditions.
On balance, the project is rated as satisfactory, its institutional
development impact Is partial (due to its limited impact on broader sectoral
objectives), and the sustainability of its benefits as likely.
The quality of the PCR is satisfactory. An audit may be considered in the
future in conjunction with the follow-up operation under implomentation.

URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Credit 1518-DJI)
PZMI
1.   This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Urban Development
Project, for which Credit 1518-DJI in the amount of SDR 4.9 million was approved
on September 11, 1984. The Credit was closed on June 30, 1992, after a one year
extension. The lst disbursement was on March 10, 1992, and the outstanding
balance of SDR 65,842.26 was canceled.
2.    The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the South-Central and Indian Ocean Department, Africa Regional Office (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
3.    Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision
mission of the project in April 1992, and finalized during a completion mission,
carried out jointly with USAID in September/October 1992. It is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit Agreement; progress reports;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

Objectives
1.    The project's major objectives were to:   (i) increase the absorptive
capacity of key institutions responsible for urban management; (il) improve the
living conditions of the urban poor in Djibouti; and (iii) introduce more rigor
in cost recovery practices (para. 3.01).
Lupleu.ntatioa
2.    The Ministry of Pub'.lc Works and Urban Development (MTPDU) was responsible,
through its Department of Urbanism and Rousing (DUL) for construction and
maintenance of infrastructure works; the District of Djibouti (OD) for
resettlement and refuse collection; the Socift6 Immobili6re de Djibouti (8ID) was
responsible for the Salines Ouest site and services development; and the Land
Office (L0) for the sale of land in the Old Wards and Balbala, the issuance of
titles and cost recovery (para.4.02). Management of the whole project and
coordination between these institutions was the responsibility of the Project
Management Unit (PMU).  This Unit reported to an Interministerial Committee
(para.4.03). It was reinforced by foreign technical assistance.
3.    Thanks to the skills of its local and expatriate staff, the Project
Management Unit worked efficiently and obtained good results. Except for the
rehabilitation of Ward 6 (para.4.0l), all the works were completed by March 17,
1991, three months behind schedule (para.5.02), and with a cost overrun of about
19% (para.5.05). As regards the Old Ward 6, the additional works required led
to a two-year delay and a cost overrun of 39% for this component. Although the
works were not completed, the Credit was closed on June 30, 1992, after a one-
year extension (para.11.01).  The bidding documents were prepared correctly and
on schedule, and no serious problem arose during the bidding process (para.
5.04). Supervision of the works progressed satisfactorily, with the help of a
consulting firm.   Contractor performance was very poor for some contracts
(para.5.04).
4.   Results were also significant on the institutional and financial sides.
According to section 3.01.e of Credit Agreement, the Government established an
Urban Development Fund (FDU), for the deposit of recovered funds (para.7.02).
Nevertheless, cost recovery started slowly and has never reached the level
forecast at appraisal, mainly because the Government was reluctant to enforce the
obligation for homeowners to purchase their land (para.6.07), and to enforce the
collection of annual fees.

Results
S.    Overall, the project successfully met its primary objective to improve the
living conditions of the urban population in areas covered by the project. In
addition, it had an important impact on the urban sector as a result of the
proposed institutional and financial arrangements, which helped the Government
adopt a viable policy for cost recovery and urban development (para.6.01). This
represents an encouraging first step, and the ongoing Second Urban Development
Project, approvred on January 15, 1991, should further improve the situation. The
project also f.nanced some studies for preparation of the ongoing Second Urban
Development Pro'ect (Credit 2203-DJI).
SustainabilUty
6.   The  project  helped  the  Government  strengthen  its  management  and
organization in the urban sector, and implement a cost recovery system
(para.7.01).  In addition, the Urban Development Fund has already been used to
finance the additional works needed in Ward 6, and other works throughout the
city. Finally, the project paved the way for the Second Urban Development
Project (Credit 2203-DJI), which covers almost the whole city of Djibouti and is
financed jointly by IDA, European Development Fund, OPEC Fund and the French
Z4inistare de la Coop6rdtion et du D6veloppement (MCD), Fonds d'Aide et de
Coop6ration (FAC) and Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique (CCCE).
Findings and lessons learned
7.    The technical aspects of the project were performed relatively well, with
the help of foreign consultants.   However, the financial and institutional
arrangements took longer than expected to be implemented owing to Government
reluctance to enforce the collection of annual fees and other cost recovery
measures (para.9.O1). The implementation schedule estimated at appraisal was too
optimistic.   In particular, the project start-up was slower than estimated.
Furthermore, in Salines ouest, the smaller plots, with an area of 72 i2, were
difficult to sell. Hence, a minimum plot size of 105 mn was adopted under the
Second Urban Development Project.
Overall project assessment
8.    The project clearly achieved both its social and institutional goals.
Preparation of the Second Urban Development Project, now under implementation,
has also been satisfactory. This follow-up project should help consolidate the
first project's achievements over the long term, in particular through improved
cost recovery. Overall, the project is considered satisfactory.

2.   Background
2.01  Following independence, in 1977, Urban Development was the responsibility
of the Ministry of Public Works. In 1978, a socio-economic diagnostic study of
Djibouti was carried out by a French consulting firm. In May 1980, an Urban
Development Unit was established within the Presidency, with the responsibility
of prepazing an Urban Master Plan, financed by the European Development Fund.
The study, completed in February 1981, recomended improved drainage in the Old
Wards, development of new residential areas and improvement of general conditions
in Balbala. The Government initially approached the Bank for assistance on June
16, 1980. On July 9, 1981, Government requested from IDA an advance under the
Project Preparation Facility (PPF), which was approved on August 7, 1981, for an
amount of US$ 500,000 (SDR 470,000).
2.02 After the Appraisal Mission, in D)ecember 1983, the Ministry of Public Works
became the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development (MTPDU). A Department
of Urban Planning and Housing (DUL) was established within this ministry, and the
personnel of the existing Urban Development Unit was transferred to this new
department. DUL was responsible for all urban matters, including operation and
maintenance of drainage and sewerage systems in Djibouti (this latter
responsibility had been transferred by presidential Decree, dated September 20,
1982, from the District of Djibouti to the Ministry of Public Works).
2.03 The original allocation for this project in the lending program was USS 8
million, and all the preparation was carried out on this basis. The allocation
was cut back to US$ 5 million, because of the constraints on the 7th IDA
replenishment, but well after project appraisal.   Additional cofinancing was
sought from the "Caisse Centrale de Coop6ration Economique" (CCCE), the Saudi Fund
and the Arab Fund. The project as appraised, but with a deficit in its financing,
and was subsequently approved by the Loan Committee. During negotiations, which
started on June 4, 1984, the Djiboutian Delegation was informed of this important
reduction of the IDA Credit. To avoid a major scaling down, USAID agreed to
increase its contribution to US$ 5.5 million, CCCE to US$ 1 million and "Soci6t6



-2-
Immobili6re de Djibouti" (SID) to US$ 1 million.   Nevertheless, total project
costs were reduced from US$ 16.5 million to uS$ 15.2 million by recalculatirg the
price contingencies in line with new Bank guidelines, excluding from the cost
tables land contribution by BID, and reducing the houaLng credit component by US$
0.5 million. Now negotiatLons were required, whlch took place in DjLbouti from
July 10 to  13, 1984.  In addition, the Government agreed to increase its
contrLbutLon from U8$ 2.2 million to US$ 2.7 million.
3.   Project objectives and description
3.01 Project objectivest The project's major objectlves were tot (i) increase
the absorptive capacity of key agencies involved in urban managements (ii) improve
the living conditions of the urban poor in Djibouti, particularly the residents
of the Old Wards and Balbala; and (iLi) introduce more rigorous cost recovery
practices, with special emphasis on improvlng the revenue base of the local
agencies and recycling of recovered project funds.
3.02 Project descriptions The projact consisted of: (a) the rehabilitation of
Old Wards 3, 5 and 6 (45 ha and 45,000 inhabitants), to provide protection from
flooding and improve roads, water supply and refuse collection; (b) the upgrading
of a part of Balbala, containing the poorest segment of the population (160 ha and
45,000 inhabitants), with proviLsion of roads, public lighting, refuse collection
and a market; (c) a site and serviess development in Salines Ouest, including 176
plots and 106 housing units; (d) institutional support, includLng technlcal
assistance, training and equipment, to the Land office (LO), the District of
DjlboutL (DD), the "SocLi6t Immobiliare de Djibouti" (SID), the "CaLese de
D6veloppement de DjLbouti" (CDD), and the Project Management Unit (PMU); and (e)
housing credits for construction of new houses and improvement of existing houses.
4.    Project design and organization
4.01 The project concept was developed by the participating institutions and
mlinstries over a three-year period (10/80 to 10/83), with input from Bank staff,
and the help of a consulting firm. Overall, the project was well prepared.
However, in the Old Wards, the ground is often below sea level and drainage is
lmpossible without raising the level of the land by filling. It was done in Wards
3 and 5 to a maximum of 0.5 m, but in Ward 6, the final design revealed that the
ground level had to be raised by 1.5 to 2.0 a, which proved impossible without
demolishing existing houses and relocating the families concerned. Finally, 717
households had to be relocated, instead of 34 as foreseen in the feasibility
study.   This led to a two-year delay and a cost overrun of 39.2% for this
component, and to a one-year extension of the Credit closing date.
4.02 MTPDU was responsible through DUL for lnfrastructure works; DD for
information of the population concerned, senaLtization, resettlements and refuse
collection; SID for the Salines Ouest sLte and servLces development and house
construction; "Office des Eaux de Djibouti" (ONED) for the water supply works;
"Electricit6 de Djibouti" (EDD) for electrical works; LO for the sale of land in
the Old Wards and Balbala, the issuance of titles and cost recovery; and CDD for
the management of housLng credlts.



-3-
4.03 Management of the whole project and coordination between these institutions
was the responsibility of PMV.   The Project Unit, assisted by a technical
assistance team, reported to an Interiinisterial Committee made up of the Prime
Minister, the Cabinet Director of the Presidency, the Minister of Finance, the
Minister of MSTPDU, and the Minister of Interior. PMU and the Interministerial
Committee wera established by presidential decision No.84-0975, dated July 7,
1984.  This decision also stipulated that PMU be assisted by a coordination
committee of nine members, which never functioned satisfactorily. Instead, a
smaller coordination committee, with OD as chairman, met rogularly anct was
efficient in resolving the day to day problems faced by the project.
s.   L-oieet L=mlMMatign
5.01  Credit effectiveness and project start-up#   The credit was approved on
September 11, 1984 and signed on March 21, 1985, after a long delay due to
administrative  problems  unrelated  to  the  project.    The    conditions  of
effectiveness were the decree establishing P3W and the recruitment of the PMU
chief (met on July 7, 1984), the establishment of the Urban Development Fund (FDU)
(met on April 15, 1985), and signature of agreements between the Government and
BID and CDD. The Credit was declared effective on July 11, 1985.
5.02. Implementation  Schedules    Table  4.A,  Part  UII,  gives  the  actual
implsmentation schedule, compared with that estimated at appraisal.  Project
implementation was originally scheduled to be completed by December 31, 1990.
Although the Credit was effective six months later than forecast at appraisal,
most of the works were completed by March 17, 1991, except the Old Ward 6, for the
reasons given in para.4.01 above. Two thirds of Ward 6 were completed on time,
but the western part was only started in 1991.  It should be completed by
September 1993, with FDU financing.
5.03 The housing credit component started with some delay due to long discussions
concerning the conditions of eligibility, and the amount of individual credits and
difficulties faced by CDD in organizing management of these credits.   In
particular, the succession of three financial experts provided by the technical
assistance component did not help CDD speed up the granting of loans. The first
credits for home improvement and for construction of new houses were granted in
1989 and 1991, respectively.
5.04  Procuremet:  The procurement process started out slowly, due to late
effectiveness, but proceeded satisfactorily. The works were divided into ton
packages. Bidding documents were well prepared, and the bidding process followed
the original schedule, with a six month slippage. Tho National Tender Commission
was responsible for bid opening and, for each tender, established a technical
committee in charge of evaluating the bids. These technical committees did a good
job, but the National Tender Commission appeared to have a policy of awarding the
contracts to local contractors as often as possible. In some cases, the lack of
qualified and financially sound local contractors inhibited the project progress.
This happened for two contracts:



-4-
(i)   Filling,  roads and drainage  in Salinas Ouest.   After lengthy
discussions, the Bank accepted the award to a local contractor who
proposed to complete the works in ten months. after 16.5 months, the
contract was canceled and a now contract awarded to a foreign firm.
The works were finally completed in 24 months instead of 101
(ii) Public lighting in Salinas ouest. Although the lowest bidder was a
foreign firm (DP 14.4 milllon), the National Commission proposed to
award the contract to a local contractor for DP 18.3 million,
alleging that the national electricity company, EDD, wanted to have
steel poles as proposed by the local contractor, rather than concrete
poles. The Bank rejected this proposal but the Government decided to
award the contract to the local firm anyway, and to finance it from
FDU. The work. were completed in 10 months !.notead of 5 months, with
a 27% cost increaiel
5.05 Project Costss A comparison between appraisal estimates and actual costs
for the project is given in Part III, section 5 A. The appraisal cost estimate
was uS$ 15.23 million (about SDR 14.9 million), and the final cost was US$ 18.1
million, i.e. a cost overrun of 19.1%. During project implementation, the US
dollar/SDR exchange rate went from US$ 1.02 to US$ 1.40 to SDR 1, increasing the
amount of the Credit f-om US$ 5 million (originally SDR 4.9 million) to US$
6.09 million. This made it possible to finance a part of the cost overrun, the
rest being covered by the Government, partly through the PDU.
5.06 Disbursemets: In Part I$$, Table 3, actual quarterly disbursements of the
Credit are compared with the appraisal estimates and the profile of urban project
disburoements in Africa.  Disbursemento were spread over 7 years, following
exactly the profile of urban projects in Africa, with a nine-month advance. This
compares with a six-and-a-half-year disbursement period estimated at appraisal,
for a total Credit amount of US$ S million. Actually, US$ 6.09 million was
disbursed. The original closing date of June 30, 1991, was extended to June 30,
1992.   Disbursements on commitments took place through March 10, 1992, and the
outstanding balance of SDR 65,842.26 was canceled.
5.07 Credit Allocation: The original and revised allocations by category and
the actual disbursements under Credit 1518-DJI are shown in table 5.B, Part III.
By letter, dated January 24, 1986, the denomination of Category 2 was changed,
adding "training" to Consultants' services. A new category 7 was also added for
operating costs of PMU, excluding salaries, in the amount of SDR 390,000,
financed at a rate of 95%. A formal reallocation of funds was made on May 2,
1988. Category 1 A (civil works Salines ouest) was reduced from SDR 480,000 to
SDR 120,00, partly because IDA did not finance the public lighting contract
(Para.5.04.ii). Category 1 B was increased from SDR 1,730,000 to SDR 2,040,000
to cover part of Ward 6 cost overrun. Category 2, consultants, services and
training, was also increased from sDR 380,000 to SDR 870,000 to finance some
studies needed for the preparation of the Second Urban Development Project, and
a one-year extension of the technical aesistance to Lo and PMU.
5.08 Project Financings The comparison between the original financing plan of
the Appraisal Report and the actual financing of the project is shown in Table



- s -
S.C, Part Ill. The cost overrun was covered partly by the IDA Credit in US$
terms, as the appreciation of the 8DR increased the amount of the IDA Credlt from
5 million to 6.09 million, i.e. 23.5S. CCCE greed to increase its contribution
from DF 179 milllon to DF 274.5 million, or 83.3%. The Government and SID also
increased their contributions by 5.3% and 19.S%, respectkvely. In addltion, FDU
was able to provide DP 153.2 million. On the other hand, the USAZD flnanced
component of US$ 5.S mlllion was not exceeded because the USAID grant was
expressed ln U8$ and the exchange rate wlth the DjLbouti franc dld not change
durlng the project life.
6.   Project Results
6.01 Project Objectivest Overall, the project was successful in meeting its key
objectives of improving the living conditions in low income areas of tne city of
DjiboutL.   The project also assisted in strengthening the management and
organlzation of executing agencies lnvolved in the urban sector, and their
capacity to implement subsequent projects. In particular, the project helped the
Government implement a new cost recovery policy, in a country which had a
tradition of non-payment for services in low-lneome areas. An Urban Development
Fund (FDU) was establLshed under the project, into which funds recovered under
the project were deposited. However, the level of cost recovery has been lower
than forecast at appralsal (para.6.07).
6.02 Physical Results: The physical targets of the project were substantially
achieved.  The three Old Wards 3, 5 and 6, were rehabilitated as planned,
coverLng 63 ha and benefltting 4529 households. During the exceptlonal April
1989 floods, Wards 3 and 5 (Ward 6 was not yet completed) were the only parts of
the old clty which were not severely flooded. They were used as an emergency
base to help the other wards. The works in Balbala covered 137 ha and benefitted
4500 households. In Salines Ouest, the development provided sites and servLces
for 176 plots and construction of 106 houses.  It should be noted that, in
October 1992, 37 plots of 72 m2 with houses had not yet been sold, as these plots
are considered too small. There were only two significant deviations from the
original design: (i) the elimlnation of the Canal West (1600 m length), designed
to discharge storm water to the West of the Old Wards, because the final design
led to a drainage system collectlng storm water from west to east; and (ii) the
last section of Ambouli Dike was also eliminated, due to the construction of a
bridge on the Ambouli River, with Italian financing, which made this last section
of the dike unnecessary.
6.03  institutional Performances   On the institutional side,  a number of
Government agencies, DD, L0 and PMU, and some parastatals such as SID and CDD
received directly needed equipment and training. They are now better organized
to carry out their functions, because the Project has been successful in training
Djiboutians. In particular, L0 has computerized real estate records, transfers
of titles and collection of annual fees. Its staff increased from 10 to 60 under
the project, 60% received training and no trainee has left the department. The
number of transfers of titles increased from 200 to 600 a year. DD got a new
garage and equipment for street cleaning and garbage collection. However, the
six garbage collection trucks purchased by DD under the project are out of
service due to the lack of spare parts. During the procurement process, some



-6-
bidders with agencies in Djibouti and a maintenance capacity, were not selected
as this criterion was not given sufficient weight. Another negacive aspect is
the lack of infrastructure maintenance, particularly from DUL, which is
responsible for the maintenance of drainage and sewerage facilities. The reverse
flow check valves at the sea out-falls in avenues 13, 26 and Nasser, for example,
are not operational due to lack of maintenance, although they were constructed
only a few years ago.
6.04 During the appraisal mission, the Bank proposed to finance a water tariff
study under the project, in order to lay the groundwork for the introduction of
new potable water rates, the structure and level of which are to reflect the real
cost of servicet while also taking into account the financial capacity of the
various income groups. With the existing tariff structure, the lowest income
groups had no access to potable water, because the minimum billing was 30 m for
2 months.  On the other hand, existing rates did not encourage long-term
conservation of water.   The Government was reluctant to change the tariff
structure, but the adjustment was a condition of effectiveness for the follow-up
urban project and was effectively implemented in 1991. The adjustment was as
followst (i) first ranges DF 62 per es for 0-20 ms for 2 months, instead of 0-120
X ; (ii) second ranges DV 102 per m3 for 20-80 m' for 2 months, instead of DF 88
for 120-140 i; and (iii) t  rd ranges DF 162 per m3 above 80 e for 2 months,
instead of DF 124 above L40 in. In addition, the minimum billing was set at 20
in for 2 months, instead of 30 ms.
6.05  Financial Performances  The project accounts of PMU, SID and CDD were
regularly audited by an external auditor, and the reports were received (with
some delays) by the Bank.
6.06 The cost recovery system implemented under the project had several
components: (i) sale of plots in the Old Wards through amicable transfers; (ii)
an annual fee (redevance domaniale) for plots whose holders do not apply for a
transfer, set at 10 times the transfer price per m2; (iii) direct sale of newly
developed plots in Salines ouest; and (iv) repayment of housing loans to CDD.
6.07 It was expected at appraisal that 87% of the Project costs would be
recovered from beneficiaries as follows: plot sales and annual fees (60%), loan
repayments (13%), property tax (7%) and refuse tax (7%). The balance of 13%
covered the institutional support to LO, DD, SID, CDD and the PMU. These costs
were not considered recoverable and the Government had to absorb them. As a
matter of fact, amicable transfers took place more slowly, and in smaller
numbers, than expected. At the end of 1990, DP 216,047,565 had been deposited
into FDU, compared to DF 679 millions as forecast at appraisal, i.e. only 32%.
There are several reasons for the dwellers' reluctance to purchase their plots:
(i) the lack of available money, because the average price for amicable transfers
was DF 150,000, which is not negligible for most of the owners, and the lack of
loans from CDDO (ii) the obligation to improve the houses, without enough housing
loans (this obligation has been waived under the Second Urban Project); (iii) in
Wards 3, 5 and 6, the owners were awaiting the end of the works, fearing
relocation particularly in Old Ward 6; and (iv) in Balbala, provisional occupancy
permits are still issued by DD, without any payment, or registration by LO.



-7-
6.08 Meaures have been taken under the Second Urban Development Project to give
potential candidates for amicable transfers greater motivation for requesting
transferos payment in three installments and confirmation that the transferee
would not have to commit himself to any development or construction. It should
be noted that, in the long term, the collection of annual, fees (redevance
domaniale) is of greater interest to the Government since, ae -us annual fee is,
on average, equivalent to 1/10 of the selling price, in ten years the dweller has
paid the amicable transfer price, and after that annual fees are an incremental
revenue for the Government.
6.09 The proceeds of transfers were budgeted in 1985, and deposited into the FDU
as of January 1986 only. The collection of annual fees (redevance domaniale)
should also be reinforced, and extended to the whole city. It is collected in
Old Wards 1 to 7, but the surveys were halted in wards 7 bis, Ambouli and Djebel,
on Government's request. Until the end of 1989, the proceeds of annual fees were
budgeted for and not paid over to FDU.
6.10 EconomeC Rate of Return. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the project
as executed over the 1986-92 period is estimated at 23.15%.  This compares
reasonably with a return on the project of 26% estimated at appraisal, given the
cost overrun and delays in implementation. Section 6, Part III, gives the detail
of costs and benefits taken into account for the calculation of ERR.
7.    Proiect sustainability
7.01 The project has had a significant positive impact through the
implementation of new institutional and financial arrangements in the urban
sector, ensuring cost recovery and hence sustainability of the installed
facilities. However, the Government needs to continue its efforts in the areas
of institutional development and cost recovery. The benefits of the project are
likely to be sustained only if very serious attention is given to the
infrastructure maintenance. This can be achieved through taxation and user
charges to generate revenue regularly. The ongoing Second Urban Development
Project is expected to provide immediate assistance on this aspect, but efforts
will need to continue.
7.02 The FDU, established under the project, can help the Government finance
rehabilitation of infrastructure, even though it was primarily designed for
preparation and development of future urban projects. It already works as a
mechanism for replicating actions previously undertaken and recycling the funds
recovered directly from this and other urban projects.
8.    Bank Derformance
8.01 IDA supervision was almost continuous: a total of 13 supervision missions
visited Djibouti, at the rate of two a year, representing a total of 143 staff-
days in the field. Some 180.6 staff-weeks were spent on this project over the
entire project cycle. The details of staff input and missions are given in Part
III, section 8, tables A and B. Three task managers were responsible for this
project. IDA's performance was satisfactory. The project was well prepared,
appraised and supervised.

9.    am =e2  yrformange
9.01 On the technical side, the PKW, thanks to its competent staff, and the help
of the technical assistance team, performed well. The bidding process progressed
on schedule, with the bid evaluation reports prepared on time and the contracts
concluded without any major problems and within the appraisal cost estimates.
Xn some cases, however, the National Tender Commission insisted on awarding
contracts to local contractors without the required exprience, which led to long
delays (para.5.04).  On the financial oide, the results were leas positives
while there were no problems with the project accounts kept by the PMU, the costs
were not recovered as forecast at appraisal, because the Government was reluctant
to force dwellers to buy their plots (para.6.07), and to enforce the collection
of annual fees (para.6.09). Furthermore, the proceeds from the annual fees were
not deposited into FDU until the end of 1989, but transferred into the general
budget. The Government also decided to halt the surveys needed in Wards 7 bis,
Ambouli and Djebel for billing the annual fees to owners who do not purchase
their land. On the institutional side, the creation of FDU had a positive impact
on the urban sector, but the capacity of the institutions involved, particularly
DUL, to maintain the facilities needs to be strengthened.
9.02 Quarterly reports were submitted by PMU to IDA in a timely manner up to
March 31, 1991. There have been no progress reports since then. P1M retained
independent auditors to prepare its own, and SID and CDD accounts. Audited
accounts were prepared regularly up to 1991. There were some delays at the
beginning, but generally the audit reports were received within one year after
the end of the fiscal year concerned, instead of the eight months stipulated in
the Credit Agreement (Section 4.01.c.ii).
10.   Project relationshin
10.01 The relationship between the different parties involved in the project
implementation was very good. There was adequate coordination, cooperation and
understanding among the donorss IDA, USAID and CCCE. IDA's relationship with PMU
on the project has been very good. Relations with MTPDU were rather strained in
1987/89, as a result of problems connected with clearer division of
responsibilities between PD, DUL and P1U. Borrower-contractor relationships were
relatively good, as were relationships with the consultants.
11.   Consultant services
11.01 The most important difficulty faced by the project was due to an
engineering mistake during project preparation. The consequences were a cost
overrun of 39.2% for the Old Wards component, a two-year delay for old Ward 6 and
a one-year extension of the Credit closing date.
12. Proiect documentation and data
12.01 The original documentation for the project was adequate and appropriate.
The appraisal report provided a useful framework for both IDA and PMU in their
review of project implementation.
