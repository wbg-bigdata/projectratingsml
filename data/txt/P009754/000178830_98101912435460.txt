STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THE MAHARASHTRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
National Sector Organization and Development
1.01      1hile the Central Government exercises considerable influence in
the sector, State Governments in India have primary responsibility for devel-
opment of water supply and sewerage facilities. They execute their respon-
sibilities through various departments of government and agencies which, in
turn, may delegate part or all of their duties to local authorities. In
certain cases, legislation has been enacted to permit municipal authorities,
or other agencies, to assume the entire responsibility for planning, design,
construction, operation and maintenance of water supply and sewerage services
within their jurisdictions.
1.02      Since the early 1950s, State Governments have endeavored to meet
the increasing sector demands caused by rapidly expanding populations and
unprecedented rates of urban growth. However, competing demands for re-
sources by other sectors, lack of management and planning skills, shortages
of key materials and equipment, as well as foreign exchange constraints, have
resulted in only 1 to 2% of public expenditures being invested in the sector.
This had led to inadequate levels of water supply and sewerage services. In
1975, it was estimated 1/ that in India only 193 million people, or 31% of the
total population of 620 million, had access to reasonably safe drinking water
and that only 125 million (20%) had acceptable means of disposing of sewage.
These levels are lower than average levels for all developing countries, in
which water and waste disposal services reach 38% and 33% of the population
respectively. In these countries, it now appears that, in the period 1971
to 1976, global progress in the sector kept pace with population growth and
during the same period, access to water and sewerage services slightly
improved. In India, while some improvement in the water supply service was
achieved, the percentage of the population receiving waste disposal services
actually declined.
1.03      It is estimated 2/ that investments in developing countries on the
order of four times the 1971 to 1975 levels (in 1977 US$) will be necessary
if the target, for developing countries, to serve 100% of the population by
1/   World Health Organization, Community Supply and Wastewater Disposal,

1990 is to be achieved.  For urban water supply and sewerage in India, the
investment target in the period 1974/75 through 1978/79 was some Rs 1,100
million (US$128 million) per year, about 1.5% of the total Plan investment;
investment in the rural water sector in the same period was Rs 750 million
(US$87 million) which was 1.0% of the total Plan investment. Much higher
investment levels will be necessary if significant progress towards 1990 UN
targets is to be seriously attempted. Rapid urbanization in India's four
largest metropolitan areas -- Bombay, Calcutta, Delhi and Madras -- has
created a particularly urgent need to strengthen the water supply and sewer-
age systems serving these areas. Existing organizational and technical
resources would permit much higher levels of investment to hasten the pro-
vision of services to larger populations. However, efficient operation and
effective maintenance of urban water and sewerage systems presents a more
serious challenge to Central, State and local government institutions.
The State of Maharashtra
1.04      The project, described in this report, serves part of the Bombay
Metropolitan Region (BMR) in the State of MIaharashtra.  Maharashtra is the
third largest State in India, having an area of about 308,000 square kilo-
meters and an estimated (1977) population of some 59.3 million, which is
almost 10% of India's total population. Bombay is the state capital and
the nation's largest industrial center. The 1977 urban population of the
State, excluding Bombay's 7.6 million, was 11.3 million located in some 226
urban communities; the rural population was 40.4 million.
1.05      Historically, except for the larger municipal corporations, the
development of community water supply and sewerage services has been the
responsibility of the State Government. Maharashtra established an Environ-
mental Engineering Organization (ENE) in 1975 with the declared objective
of providing safe drinking water and waste disposal services to achieve
and maintain a cleaner environment.  It undertook planning and implementa-
tion of most rural water supply projects as well as planning and implemen-
tation of municipal water supply and sewerage projects, which are partly
financed by municipalities and partly by Government. Such projects are
normally operated and maintained by the local authorities concerned, although
the State Government sometimes performs these tasks at the request of local
authorities. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay (BIIC) and several
other large municipal corporations are responsible for planning, implementa-
tion, operation and maintenance of water and sewerage services within their
jurisdictions.
1.06      Iii January 1977, the Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board
(MWSSB) was formed by the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) as a further step
to "provide rapid development and proper regulation of water supply and
sewerage services in the State of lMaharashtra." Initially, MWSSB's role was
primarily that of a financing channel, raising funds by borrowing from local
financing institutions and on the open market. Recently, its functions have
been expanded to include project preparation, execution, operation and
maintenance. The staff of the ENE will be transferred to MWSSB during 1979.

1.07      GOM estimates that (excluding Bombay) 10.5 million people in about
190 urban communities have access to piped water, although many of the sup-
plies are inadequate and of questionable quality.  The present population
with access to sewerage services in urban communities is less than the pop-
ulation wich piped water. Only 11 communities (excluding Bombay) have water-
borne sanitation serving about 4 million people; however, under current
GOM proposals 0.5 million more urban people should have access to acceptable
forms of sanitation by the year 1980. The remainder of the population
depends on wells for water supply and conservancy systems for waste collection
and disposal.
1.08      Some 27 million people or 67% of the rural population in the State
have access to wholesome water. By 1980, GOM proposes to provide piped
water to some 1,000 additional villages having a total population of about
four million. Most of these will be from ground water sources. This is an
ambitious target which would result in increasing the rural population provided
with piped water to some 77% of the total. As yet, there are no specific
proposals for a sanitation program in these villages.
1.09       Investment in the State water supply and sewerage program (exclud-
ing invest,nent in the BMC systems), amounted to about Rs 75 million (US$8.8
million) in each of the financial years 1976/77 and 1977/78, which was less
than 2% of the State's total budget. Some Rs 39 million and 1.7 million
(US$4.5 and US$0.2 million) were allocated to urban and rural areas, respec-
tively, and about Rs 35 million (US$4.1 million) to continuing construction
of the Bhatsai dam which will be used for supplying water to Bombay and for
irrigat ion.
Bombay Metropolitan Region
1.10      The Bombay Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA)
was established by the Government of Maharashtra in 1975 to coordinate the
activities of local authorities within BMR and to promote regional investment
planning in such sectors as urban renewal, transportation, communications
and water resources management. BMR comprises an area of 4,350 square kilo-
meters (1,700 square miles, about one-sixth of the area of the State of
Maryland) and includes the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay, 13
Municipal Councils and some 1,500 villages. The 1971 census population of
BMR was 7.8 million, of which 6.7 million was designated as urban.
1.11      BMRDA has completed a comprehensive water resources study for the
Region and has also been the principal agency in preparing this project.
The water resources study shows that water availability is not as critical
as it originally appeared to be, and that there may be a moderate water sur-
plus in the area, at least to the year 2000. As well as investigating the
water supply and demand relationship, the study indicates economical methods
and sequences for development of the resources. The project is consistent
with recommendations resulting from the study.

The Project Area
1.12      The project area is located to the north and northeast of Bombay
(Map IBRD 14109) and is divided into two parts (referred to as the northern
and southern areas) by the Ulhas River. The northern area includes the towns
of Thane and Bhiwandi and 55 villages; the southern area includes four towns
Kalyan, Domnbivli, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath -- and 49 villages. There are
nine villages in the project area which have been excluded from the project
because they are small (total 1971 population 4,737) and remote from the pro-
posed water transmission network. These villages will continue to obtain
water from wells and local surface water sources.
1.13      The area is well linked by roads and a suburban railway system to
Bombay, the second largest city in India (population 7.6 million) and the
largest port and industrial center, accounting for some 30% of India's in-
dustrial production. Parts of the project area are clearly influenced by the
close proximity of this huge metropolis and provide space for the spillover
of industry and commerce, as well as dormitory areas for daily commuters to
the city and suburbs. The selection of the project area was influenced by
the priority given by BMRDA to providing essential services to these rapidly
developing urban and rural communities.
Levels of Service
1.14      The project forms part of a sector development plan for BMR which
was prepared by the Water Resources Management Board of BMRDA. For planning
purposes, BMR is divided into six zones (Map IBRD 14109). There are 13 towns
and 1,300 villages in these six zones. Of these, water supply to communities
in Zones I, III and most of IV are included in the project. In the other
zones, projects are under implementation and include BMC's two IDA assisted
water supply and sewerage projects in Zone VI. 1/
1.15      T'he BMRDA plan also includes water-borne sewerage systems for eight
of the thirteen towns in Zones I through V; six of these systems are part of
the project. Sewerage systems for the towns of Panvel (Zone IV) and Khopoli
(Zone V) are to be included in India's Sixth Plan, at an estimated cost of
Rs 22 million (US$2.6 million). As yet, there are no firm proposals to pro-
vide sewerage systems for the remaining five towns.
1.16      although GOI is now placing considerable emphasis on the need for
improved water supplies in rural areas, specific projects have yet to be
developed t-or most of the rural areas in BMR. BMRDA in conjunction with
MWSSB, has determined that almost 700 of the 1,300 villages in BMR urgently
require new piped water systems to replace existing inadequate wells.  Piped
water supplies for 82 of these villages will be provided under the project,
and a further 115 villages will receive piped water under a Rs 60 million
(US$7 million) program proposed by the Water Resources Management Board
1/   The First and Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects, Credits
390 and 842-IN.

later in the Sixth Plan period.  There are no specific plans at present to
provide piped water to the remaining 500 or so villages.
1.17      Within the project area, all of the six towns and 22 of the 113
villages have piped water, although the supply is inadequate and distribution
systems have not been extended to more recently developed areas. It is
estimated that within the project area, the quantity of piped water avail-
able to the total 1978 population of 1.3 million is about 105 million liters
per day (mid), of which a net quantity of 65 mld is available for domestic
consumption (paragraph 2.20).  Based on the normally accepted standards in
India of 120 and 50 liters per capita per day (lcd) for urban consumers
supplied through connections and standpipes respectively, and of 70 and 40
lcd for similar categories in rural communities, the estimated domestic water
demand in the project area is 160 mld or about 1.6 times the present supply
level. By 1984, if the project is not implemented, this excess demand will
increase to about 2.2 times the available supply, based on an average popula-
tion growth rate of about 5% in the project area (paragraphs 2.18 and 2.20).
1.18      Sewerage systems for the towns of Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi are
partially constructed, and will be completed under the project; sewerage
systems for the towns of Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath will be provided
under the project. As yet, none of the urban population outside of the BMC
area has access to water-borne sewerage systems. GOM recently allocated
Rs 20 million (US$2.4 million) for rural sanitation in the project area.
MWSSB will prepare a sanitation project for this area which will be imple-
mented in parallel with the IDA assisted project.
II. POPULATION, WATER CONSUMPTION AND SEWERAGE SERVICE DEMAND
Agencies Supplying Water
2.01      At present, three authorities supply water to the project area:
(i) BMC, which supplies water from its transmission mains en route from BMC
sources of supply to Bombay City; (ii) the Maharashtra Industrial Development
Corporation (MIDC), a Statewide organization established by GOM in 1962 to
provide infrastructure for industrial estates; and (iii) MWSSB, which during
1979 will assume responsibilities for facilities formerly operated by the
Environmental Engineering Organization (paragraph 4.01).
2.02      In the northern part of the project area, north of the Ulhas river
(Map IBRD 14110), the towns of Thane and Bhiwandi and 12 villages receive
water from the BMC system. Bhiwandi also obtains a very small supply (about
2 mld) from Varala lake. Water for industrial estates in these areas is
supplied by MIDC.
2.03      In the southern part of the project area (south of the Ulhas river,
Map IBERD 14110), three water treatment plants draw water from the Ulhas river
and supply the four towns of Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath, and
10 villages in the southeast extremity of the project area. Two of the plants,



-6-
Shahad and Jambul, 1/ are owned and operated by MIDC primarily to supply
industrial estates in the area (Map IBRD 14110). The third plant at
Badlapur is operated by MWSSB.
Existing Water Treatment Plants
2.04      MIDC's Shahad water treatment plant was designed to be developed
in two stages of 48 mld each; the first stage was completed in 1966 to supply
treated water to industries in the Ulhasnagar and Dombivli areas. The trans-
mission system was extended to supply industries in Thane in 1968. Parts of
the system (the intake, pumping station and associated mains) were constructed
to accommodate the ultimate plant flows of 96 mld, but expansion of the
remaining plant components (the filtration system and clear water storage
tank) beyond the present 48 mld was deferred when the nearby Jambul plant
was constructed in 1973.
2.05      The Jambul water treatment plant, capacity 295 mid, was completed
by MIDC in 1973. Water for the plant is drawn from the Ulhas river, at a
weir located below the confluence of the Barvi and Ulhas rivers, and is
supplemented by releases of water from a reservoir formed by the Barvi dam.
Fully treated water from the Jambul treatment plant is pumped to a trans-
mission system primarily serving industries in Ambernath, Dombivli, Thane
(Map IBRD 14110) and areas outside the project area. Both the Shahad and
Jambul works are well designed, soundly constructed and are efficiently
operated and adequately maintained.
2.06      The third,water treatment plant in the project area is the Badlapur
plant which is owned and operated by MWSSB. This is the oldest of the three
plants having been constructed in 1926 and subsequently enlarged to its
present capacity of 34 mld. The plant serves Ambernath and villages located
between Ambernath and the plant. Although the plant is old it is in sound
condition, with the exception of several minor items which are receiving
attention. It is efficiently operated and adequately maintained.
The Six Towns in the Project Area
2.07      The Thane Municipality (population 247,000) receives water in bulk
from BMC and MIDC for its domestic water demands, and operates its own dis-
tribution system which covers about 65% of the municipal area (Map IBRD 14111).
The distribution system was adequate in 1955, but has not been augmented to
keep pace with population growth. The supply is intermittent and limited to
between two and four hours a day. Many of the industrial water demands are
met by direct connections to BMC and MIDC mains and, although supplies are
restricted, most reasonable industrial water demands are satisfied. More
than 95% of the property connections in Thane are metered.
1/   Jambul is sometimes referred to as the Barvi plant since it draws part
of its water from the Barvi reservoir.



-7-
2.08      The Bhiwandi Municipality (population 116,000) receives most of
its water from BMC and a very small quantity (about 2.0 mld) from its own
surface water source. Although the distribution system is owned by the
Municipality it is operated and maintained by MWSSB. The supply is inter-
mittent and limited to between two and four hours per day, and there are
no large industrial water demands. Most property connections and standpipe
supplies are not metered.
2.09      Kalyan (population 123,000) has a continuous supply of water which
is purchased in bulk by MWSSB from the MIDC (Shahad) system. The Municipality
operates its own distribution system which covers about 80% of the municipal
area; most of the distribution system is more than 30 years old and is of
limited capacity. All property connections are metered.
2.10      Dombivli (population 89,000) is also supplied with water purchased
in bulk by MWSSB from MIDC. Although additional water is available from the
Jambul plant, which supplies Dombivli, the supply to the town is limited to
between two and four hours a day because of inadequacies in the distribution
system. The distribution system is operated by the Municipality and all
property connections are metered.
2.11      lJlhasnagar (population 224,000) is also supplied with water from
MIDC's Jambul plant, purchased in bulk by MWSSB. The distribution system,
which is operated by MWSSB, is inadequate and only 70 to 75% of the municipal
area at lower elevations and 25% of the higher areas receive water. All con-
nected properties are metered.
2.12      Ambernath (population 82,000) receives a continuous supply of water
from MWSSB's Badlapur plant. The distribution system, operated by MWSSB,
requires extension and improvement. All connected properties are metered.
Existing Sewerage Systems
2.13      There are no water-borne sewerage systems in operation in the six
towns although systems to serve Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi are under construc-
tion (Map IBRD 14112). At present, the urban area is served by a variety of
sewage disposal systems including septic tanks, pit latrines, bucket latrines
and soakage pits. In many areas sewage is diszharged to open drains and
sullage ponds.
2.14      The sewerage system under construction in Thane will serve 60 to
70% of the municipal area; sewage will be treated in a conventional primary
treatment plant (comprising grit and screenings removal, sedimentation,
sludge digestion, sludge drying beds) and the effluent will be discharged to
Thane Creek. As yet, less than one hundred properties in Thane are connected
to the syscem.
2.15      Sewerage systems which are nearing completion in Kalyan and Bhiwandi
will each serve about 70 to 75% of their respective municipal areas. Sewage
treatment at Kalyan is similar to that of Thane; in Bhiwandi, oxidation ponds
have been constructed and the use of effluent for irrigation is being con-
sidered.  By November 1978, some 50 properties had been connected to the
Kalyan system but there were no connections in Bhiwandi.

Population Forecasts
2.16      Population projections for BMR have influenced GOM's resolution to
impose constraints on commercial and industrial development in the Greater
Bombay Municipal area in an effort to restructure the regional development
pattern. Experience with similar measures in other countries suggests that
to limit immLigration by controlling industrial development may only be effec-
tive in the longer term, and the effect of GOM's policy on the growth of
population in BMR is, therefore, speculative.
2.17      The growth of urban population in BMR (excluding Greater Bombay)
between the 1961 and 1971 census was 0.41 million (about 6.7% per annum).
During the past seven years, the urban population of BMR has increased at a
rate of about 8% per annum to an estimated 1978 urban population of 1.6
million. The estimated rural growth rate over this seven year period was
3.7% per annum and the estimated BMR rural population in 1978 was 1.0 million.
As in the case of Greater Bombay, there is little scope for reduction in the
natural increase of population in the next 10 to 15 years since a small de-
cline in biith rate resulting from population control measures would probably
be offset by lower death rates from improved health measures. 1/ Since mi-
gration to Greater Bombay is intended to be controlled by constraints on
industrial and commercial development, migration rates to peripheral towns
in the project area where industrial development is to be encouraged, may
increase. Based on these assumptions, the growth rate of population in BMR
(excluding Greater Bombay) is likely to increase from about 5% per annum in
the period 1971 to 1981 to about 5.8% per annum in 1981-91. GOM expects
growth rates in the project area to decline from the present 5.4% to about
4.7% in the period 1981 to 1991, in the same way that growth rates in Bombay
City have declined, and conforming with the Government's projected trend for
Greater Bombay (Table 2.1). The distribution of the present and future
population in the project area is detailed in Annex 3, Table 1.

Water Demand and Consumption
2.18      About 36% of the population of the six towns in the project area
live in slumns. It is probable that a major part of the population increase
of 1.1 million in the period 1978 to 1991 will occupy hutments or single
room tenements and, although not all of these people will have low incomes,
most of them will draw water from communal taps or standpipes rather than
using individual piped connections. Thus, less water will be used than
would normally be required by such a large population increase. Despite
this, the projected increase in consumers' demand for water in the project
area, as a whole, will rise to about 300 mld by 1981, almost three times the
quantity presently available. Water demands will be satisfied for a few
years after the project is completed, but it is estimated that by 1991
demand will again reach the level at which additional works will be needed
(Table 2.2).
2.19      The projected water demand figures for the project area have been
calculated by applying per capita water supply targets to projected popula-
tion figures previously discussed (paragraph 2.17 and Annex 3, Table 1).
Projected net domestic water requirements are:
Urban dwellers,
supplied through property connections             120 lcd
supplied through standpipes                        50 lcd
Rural diwellers,
supplied through property connections              70 lcd
supplied through standpipes                        40 lcd
2.20      In addition to net domestic water requirements, allowances have
been made for industrial and commercial water needs, unavoidable losses from
transmission and distribution systems and water used in operating the various
water treatment plants. The present and projected patterns of water consump-
tion and demand are summarized in Table 2.2; more detailed domestic water con-
sumption and demand data by areas are given in Annex 3, Table 2.

at Temghar (1984).

/f   Presently estimated at 30%, reducing to 20-25% in the period 1980 to
1984 with improved control and maintenance of the systems.
Ig   Watev consumption figures in the period when demand exceeds supply are
shown in parentheses.
2.21       Project area water demands (Table 2.2) also reflects some of the
present constraints in the water supply system. The northern part of the
project area is supplied from the trunk mains en route to BMC and is limited
in quantity. Conversely, a part of the southern area is supplied from the
MIDC system which has surplus capacity at present, although there are no
means of conveying some of this water to some parts of the project area.



- 11 -
The table shows the water demand by the whole of the project area including
communities which have no piped water at present but which will be supplied
with water on completion of the project in 1984. Distribution system losses,
which are IIow estimated to be about 30%, would be reduced to acceptable
levels of 20 to 25% by 1984, with the introduction of distribution system
surveys to locate defective mains, coupled with mains improvements and
repair programs (paragraph 3.17).
2.22      The small number of water connections to properties in urban areas
(43,000 in 1978, averaging 14 people per connection) arises from the practice
of installing one connection to serve a large number of single-room tenements
in a building, although the comparatively large number of standpipe users is
also a contributing factor. In rural areas, there is a tendency for connected
consumers to share water with unconnected neighbors resulting in an usually
high number of persons served per connection.
2.23      The number of standpipes in use in each of the six towns in rela-
tion to the population presently served, and the estimated numbers of persons
served by each standpipe (Tables 2.3 and 2.4) indicate that there is not an
immediate need to increase the total number of standpipes in urban areas
although MWSSB and local authorities recognize the need to relocate stand-
pipes to provide a more equitable service, particularly to the poorer areas,
and to substantially increase the number of standpipes serving rural areas
(paragraphs 6.05 and 6.06). During negotiations, GOM informed the Association
that it will require local authorities to provide sufficient public standpipes
in both urban and rural areas (based on not more than 300 consumers per stand-
pipe and a maximum distance of 100 meters from dwelling to standpipe) to en-
sure an equitable distribution of water.

Demand for Access to Sewerage Services Within the Project Area
2.24      Although more than 80% of the urban areas and almost all of the
urban population have some degree of access to piped water, none of the
urban population has access to water-borne sewerage and very few, if any,
of the rural population have acceptable means of safely disposing of wastes.
The entire urban area will have access to acceptable waste disposal systems
on completion of both the project, and GOM's Rs 20 million (US$2.4 million)
sanitation program (paragraph 3.17) which is designed to provide sanitation
for all of the villages in the project area.
III. THE PROJECT
Background
3.01       In May 1977, at the request of BMRDA, the Association reviewed a
proposed project designed to improve the water supply and sewerage services in
the BMC area and of its satellite towns and villages. At that time, engineer-
ing proposals for the satellite towns and villages had reached little more
than a conceptual stage whereas the proposals for the BMC area, which formed
part of a well conceived long-range development program, were well advanced
and, in most cases, ready for detailed engineering design. Because of this
disparity, and since there were no physical links between the water systems
serving the two areas, the two segments of the project originally proposed
by BMRDA were developed independently.



- 13 -
3.02      The project serving the BMC area was appraised in January 1978;
after furLher preparation, a project to serve the satellite towns was for-
mulated as the Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Project, and is now the
subject of this appraisal report. Thus, this is the third project in the
water supply and sewerage sector in Maharashtra, the two previous projects
were the first and second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Projects, Credits
390 and 842-IN respectively.
Objectives of the Sector and the Project
3.03      India's present urban population of about 120 million is expected
to increase to about 300 million over the next 25 years. Annual urban popula-
tion growth is about 4% and exceeds the rate at which water supply and sewer-
age services are being provided. Urbanization is most pronounced in the States
of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.
3.04      About half of the urban population of India, some 50 million people,
are very poor having income levels below that required to provide an adequate
diet. While the extent of rural poverty is greater than urban poverty --
since only about one-fifth of the population is urban -- the number of urban
poor is still very large, probably more than in the whole of Latin America.
While the root of the urban poverty problem (and its ultimate solution),
almost certainly lies in unemployment and underemployment, the potential pro-
ductivity of the poor would be improved and their suffering reduced by ensuring
that basic needs -- food, wholesome water, sanitation, shelter -- are within
their reach. In addition, provision of water and disposal of wastes also
influence the investment which entrepreneurs are willing to make and the
resulting creation of employment.
3.05      Urban water supply and sewerage projects in India are invariably
designed on a complete system approach; however, the poor receive a propor-
tionately greater benefit than the higher income groups because they depend
solely on the public water system without the advantage of privately installed
appurtenai.ces designed to reduce the effects of inadequacies of the system
by securing a greater share of the supply. Tariff structures normally provide
for a degree of subsidy to the poor by higher-income consumers, particularly
by industry and commerce.
3.06      Objectives of the project are to a large extent synonymous with
those of the sector and are summarized as follows:
-    Provide satisfactory water and sewerage services to 2.4
million people (estimated 1991 population) in the commun-
ities concerned including essential services for the poor.
-.   Improve public health in urban and rural areas by making
available adequate quantities of wholesome water, at
tariffs within the public's ability to pay, and by the
collection and safe disposal of sewage.



- 14 -
Improve the ability of authorities tr implement, operate
and maintain water and sewerage works and to achieve
financial and economic viability.
-    Provide an environment conducive to the development of
industry, and the creation of jobs and better conditions
for the employed.
3.07      The project would relieve hardship caused by the inadequacy of
water supplies and sewerage facilities and would improve the health of people
in the project area; it would also optimize the use of some of the existing
water resources and associated works. Benefits of the project include the
development of the newly formed Maharashtra Water ';upply and Sewerage Board
and a fulrillment of one of BMRDA's functions to -cordinate and monitor a
regional (levelopment program in a major sector.
Consideration of Technological Alternatives
3.08      A water resources study of watershel areas contributing to BMR was
completed by BMRDA, with the help of consultants, 1/ as part of project pre-
paration. Under the study, all water needs for irrigation, as well as water
demands f,r industry and domestic consumers within BMR, were estimated to the
year 1991 and approximate projections were made to 2005. An inventory and
evaluation of all existing water supply facilities in BMR was made and yields
of all watler sources available to BMR were assessed. These data provided a
basis for a systems analysis study to identify regioral resource development
alternatives to meet projected water demands.
3.09      Having established a regional plan for both water allocation and
conveyance, the individual systems and components were selected and sequenced
to meet the desired standards of service at least cost. Also identified were
ways to optimize the use of some of the existing wliter sources and associated
works.  In general, by 1984, the whole of the population in the project area,
with the exception of nine villages (paragraph 1.12) will receive piped water
in adequate quantities and of satisfactory quality.
3.10      The range of alternative means of collecting, conveying and treat-
ing sewage in the urban areas was limited. Plrovision of water-borne sewage
collectioTn systems for the towns is long over:due since the major parts of
the municipal areas have developed beyond the point at which alternative means
of sanitat:ion (septic tanks, soakage pits or pit latrines) are desirable or
even practicable.  Local authorities have long been aware of the need for
improved sanitation, and construction of parL:s of the systems in Thane, Kalyan
and Bhiwanidi began as early as 1971.

required under the Maharashtra Pollution Control Act, 1970. Treatment of
sewage in oxidation ponds has been identified as the least cost treatment
method and extension of the existing ponds at Bhiwandi is proposed under the
project. Primary treatment of sewage in conventional plants (comprising
screening, grit removal, sedimentation, sludge digestion, sludge drying and
effluent chlorination) is proposed for the remaining five towns because the
comparatively large areas of land required for oxidation ponds 1/ are not
available within reasonable distances of the towns.
Project Description
3.12      The principal project elements are illustrated in Maps IBRD 14110,
14111 and 14112, described in Annex 1 and summarized as follows:
Water Supply - Northern Area
(a)  A river water intake and pumping station (capacity 260 mld)
on the Ulhas river, near Shahad weir, and a transmission
main (including the necessary bridges) to the proposed
Temghar water treatment plant.
(b)  A water treatment plant (initial capacity 200 mld) and
pumping station at Temghar.
(c)  Three transmission mains having diameters ranging from
800 millimeters (mm) to 1,500 mm, each about three kilo-
meters (km) long, to serve Thane, Bhiwandi, and the

including two booster pumping stations, 13 distribution
reservoirs (total capacity 36 ml), networks of mains and
standpipes.
Seweratge - Northern Area
(1) Extension of the sewage collection and conveyance systems
in Thane and Bhiwandi, including about 48 km of sewers having
diameters ranging from 150 to 1,100 mm, five sewage pumping
stations, and associated force mains, some 9,000 property
connections, expansion of a primary sewage treatment plant
from a capacity of 18 to 62 mld, and expansion of oxidation
ponds from a capacity of 5.5 mld to 19.5 mld.
Sewerage - Southern Area
(m)  Provision of sewage collection and conveyance systems in
1)ombivli, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath, including about 168 km
of sewers ranging in diameter from 150 mm to 1,000 mm, ten
sewage pumping stations and associated force mains, some
15,000 property connections, as well as a primary sewage
treatment plant for each town. Minor surface water drain-
age works in Dombivli, which are essential for the proper
functioning of Dombivli's sewerage system are also included.
(n) Connections for about 2,000 properties to the existing public
sewerage system in Kalyan.
Other Items
(o) WIorkshops for water meter testing and repair; stores and
depots; vehicles and tools for meter servicing and mains
testing and repair; bulk water meters.

- 17 -
plants and pumping stations, control of water losses, meter
testing and repair.
(q) Engineering and administration of the project.
Property Connections to Water and Sewerage Systems
3.13      GOM has provided guidelines 1/ to local authorities on the proce-
dures to be used for connecting privately owned properties to water supply
and sewerage services. Consumers' applications for water connections are
usually granted subject to compliance with certain conditions including
adequate facilities for the drainage of waste water. Connections are made
by local authorities upon receipt of an advance payment for the estimated
cost. The average cost of a water connection is quite modest, within property
owners' abiLity to pay and is not a barrier in obtaining access to the service.
3.14      In contrast, connections to sewers are more expensive and often
require quite costly modifications of facilities within properties so that
they may be connected to a water-borne sewerage system. These factors have
contributed to the unsatisfactory situation in Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi
where new sewerage systems are grossly underutilized because of property
owners' reluctance to meet the costs of connection and/or conversion.
3.15      The mission's discussions with GOM and MWSSB officials led to a
possible resolution of the difficulties experienced in requiring property
owners to connect to sewerage systems, by adopting a program similar to that
used successfully by BMC in which all owners of property in sewered areas
(i) are required by law to connect to the system and (ii) are eligible for
financial assistance in the form of a grant from the local authority to meet
part of the cost of either the connection and/or conversion of existing house-
hold faciliLies. In this context, the "connection" is from the property to
an interception chamber which may serve several properties; connections from
interception chambers to the sewer are included as part of the cost of the
sewerage system. 2/ This agreed solution was formalized during negotiations
when assurances were obtained from GOM that appropriate bylaws will be
gazetted, under existing legislation requiring: (i) owners to connect their
properties to sewerage systems where a sewer is provided within a specified
distance of the property; and (ii) local authorities to provide grants or soft
loans (under terms acceptable to the Association) to property owners to meet
a stipulated part of the expense in converting existing household sanitary
facilities to systems suitable for connection to the public sewer system,
and towards the cost of such connections.
1/   The Maharashtra Mlunicipalities Act, 1965; sections 215 to 223 and 200
to 214 for water and sewerage, respectively.
2/   Connections from interception chambers to sewers are termed "property
connections" in the project description.

Metering
3.16      About 92% (about 41,000) of the present water supply connections
in the project area are metered. As GOM's policy is to meter water consump-
tion, metering will be extended under the project to the whole of the project
area. Metering is justifiable economically (Annex 19). Based on MWSSB's
estimates, about 25,000 meters will be tested and repaired each year. Facil-
ities for this work at present comprise two meter workshops (Badlapur and
Ulhasnagar) operated by MWSSB and one at Thane which is operated by the Thane
Municipality. Under the project, an additional meter workshop, suitably
staffed and equipped, will be provided at Bhiwandi.
Complementary Works
3.17      Other items not included in the project but which are essential
for the accomplishment of project objectives are summarized as follows:
(i) A sanitation project for 104 villages in the project area,
will be implemented by MWSSB in the period 1980 to 1984.
GOM has confirmed that sufficient funds will be made
available to implement this project.
(ii)  Provision of additional public latrines in the six towns.
This program will be executed by local authorities during
the same period as the proposed project. During negotia-
tions, GOM informed the Association that local authorities
Till be required to provide and maintain additional public
latrines to serve the poorer areas (MIap IBRD 14111).
(iii)  The capacity of the MIDC system, comprising the Barvi dam,
the Jambul and Shahad treatment plants and associated works,
will be increased as required to enable MIDC to meet its
commitments to industrial consumers and to make available
sufficient additional water to MWSSB for the project area,
estimated at 100 mld in 1984 and 150 mld in 1991. At
negotiations, GOM agreed to cause MIDC to make available
the required quantities of potable water to MWSSB at reason-
able rates to be set after consultation with the Association.
(iv)  Industries having toxic and harmful liquid wastes should
take corrective action to ensure that wastes will not
adversely affect the sewers and sewage treatment systems.
The Maharashtra Prevention of Water Pollution Board and
other concerned agencies, have a satisfactory program for
t.he enforcement of corrective actions by industries as
well as a monitoring/control program of waste discharges.
I)uring negotiations, GOM agreed to reduce industrial waste
discharges to acceptable levels in accordance with this
program.



- 19 -
(v)  MWSSB proposes to establish teams to detect distribution
system losses and to repair mains throughout the project
area, and has identified manpower and equipment require-
ments for a leakage detection and mains repair program
beginning in 1979/80; during negotiations MWSSB agreed
that such a program will be implemented.
Cost Estimates
3.18      The estimated cost of the project is Rs 860 million (US$100.0 mil-
lion) including contingencies, customs duties and taxes. The estimated cost
of the principal features of the project is shown in Annex 2 and summarized
in Table 3.2.
3.19      Civil works costs are based on MWSSB's and consultants' estimates
of work for which preliminary designs have been completed. Materials and
equipment cost estimates are based on bids for items in current projects,
suitably updated, or on recent quotations by manufacturers and suppliers.
Physical contingencies of 10 to 30% (depending on the type of work) have been
calculated on estimated basic costs as at January 1979. Price contingencies
for both local and foreign costs have been included in accordance with current
guidelines on the basis of the following annual rates for the project imple-
mentation period 1979 through 1983: local and foreign equipment, 6.5% for
the period 1979/80 and 6% thereafter; civil works, 7.5% for 1979/80 and 7%
thereafter.
Financing
3.20      Al IDA Credit of US$48.0 million is proposed; this is about 50%
of the project cost of US$95.8 million excluding customs duties and taxes.
In order that MWSSB may appoint engineering consultants to begin design of
project components it is recommended that retroactive financing, not exceeding
US$0.5 million, be authorized from the Credit for expenditures incurred after
April 1, 1979. The following table summarizes the project financing plan:

Project Design, Construction and Supervision
3.21      HWSSB will have overall responsibility for project design and
construction and will appoint consultants to complete most of the final
engineering designs. MWSSB engineering staff will plan and control project
development, as well as supervise construction. Although MWSSB has staff
capable of carrying out work of this type, the additional work load will
require a considerable manpower input during the first half of the project
period. The appointment of consultants to undertake the engineering design
of both water supply and sewerage components is a critical item in the
project schedule and the appointment of suitable consulting engineers, who
are acceptable to the Association is, therefore, a condition of effective-
ness of the credit.
3.22      The project provides for an estimated 1,100 man-months of consul-
tant services during the whole of the project implementation period. The
largest item is final engineering design of the works although a small com-
ponent for advice to MWSSB on financial planning and accounting is also
included. It is estimated that the total cost of consultants' services will
be about Rs 18 million (US$2.1 million) representing some 70 man-months by
foreign consultants (at US$8,500 per man-month) and 1,050 man-months by
local consultants (at US$1,400 per man-month). Foreign consultants would
only be needed to provide specific design expertise for particular components,
primarily sewage treatment. Even where foreign firms are involved they would
associate with a local firm which would provide the major portion of the
manpower requirement.
Implementation Schedule
3.23      HWSSB plans to implement the project in a four-year period, begin-
ning with engineering design in 1979 and terminating the work on the project
completion date of September 30, 1983, by which time all of the works would be
in operation. Few civil works contracts would begin during the first year,
since the major part of MWSSB's efforts would be directed toward preparing
detailed engineering designs and contract documents. However, by the first
quarter of 1981, most of the larger civil works contracts would have been
awarded and would be completed in construction periods of about 24 months
(Annex 4). The schedule is a realistic one, although completion of the works
within this time frame will require careful planning and good management.
Procurement
3.24      All contracts for equipment, materials and meters would be awarded
under international competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the
Association's guidelines, with the exception of contracts for items such as
sewer pipes, fabrication of steel pipes (from steel plate purchased under
international bidding procedures), and items costing less than US$50,000 but
with an aggregate value of not more than US$1.0 million. Contracts for sewer
pipes and fabrication of steel pipes would be awarded under local competitive
bidding procedures and items costing less than US$50,000 would be procured
under local procurement procedures, both of which are acceptable to the
Association. The estimated cost of sewer pipes and fabrication of steel



- 22 -
pipes is about US$2.2 million. Sewer pipes cannot be economically trans-
ported over long distances because of their bulk and fragile nature; fab-
rication of steel pipes has a high labor content and foreign contractors
are not competitive with Indian contractors. Items costing less than
US$50,000 would not attract foreign bidders, are unsuitable for packaging
into larger contracts and would not justify international bidding.
3.25      All civil works in this project -- with the possible exception
of the Temghar treatment plant -- comprise a large number of relatively
small contracts, which are widely dispersed throughout the project area,
do not require special plant, equipment or techniques, are labor intensive
and are traditionally carried out by registered contractors established in
Bombay or other major Indian cities. These works would not attract foreign
bidders since it is clear that overseas firms could not successfully com-
pete with local bidders for works of this type and size. The Temghar water
treatment plant, for which international competitive bidding is proposed,
is the only large item of civil works component which might attract foreign
bidders.
3.26      In evaluating bids for equipment and materials, domestic manufac-
turers would be given a preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs
of the competing imports or the existing rate of customs duty, whichever is
lower. A preferential margin of 7.5% would be allowed for local contractors
in evaluating civil works bids. Most of the contracts for equipment and
materials supply and all contracts for civil works, other than possibly the
Temghar water treatment plant, are likely to be won by local contractors.
Land Acquisition
3.27      Some 200 hectares of land will be required for the project, 134
hectares of which is presently privately owned and will be acquired under
existing legislation. About 114 hectares of the land to be acquired is
used for agricultural purposes. This is a small area, some of which is
used for paddy cultivation, and its loss to agriculture would have no impact
on the State's agricultural program. The period required to complete normal
land acquistion procedures is about two years; however, in cases of urgency
GOM may make land available for construction within a year after the initial
application and prior to completion of the whole of the formal acquisition
procedures. In the case of GOM-owned land, permission to occupy the land
prior to completion of land transfer formalities may be granted.
3.28      During appraisal, the necessary steps for acquisition of land for
the project were identified by MWSSB and a land acquisition program was
prepared. During negotiations, GOM and MWSSB agreed that all necessary
action to acquire land needed for the project will be taken in accordance
with this program which is acceptable to the Association.
Disbursements
3.29      The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed over a four-year
period. An estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 5. Disburse-
ments would be made as follows:



- 23 -
(a)  Equipment (US$30.6 million).  For equipment procured under
international or local competitive bidding, 100% of foreign
expenditures for directly imported goods, or 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory costs) for locally manufactured
goods. For goods procured under local procurement proce-
dures, 50% of local expenditures.
(b) Civil Works (US$12.0 million). About 75% of expenditures
for civil works contracts procured under international or
local competitive bidding procedures for water supply works
excluding distribution systems.
(c) Consultants' Services and Training (US$2.8 million). 100%
of expenditures for training and consultants' services
(excluding any reimbursement of taxes).
(d) Unallocated (US$2.6 million). About 5% of the total
credit.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.30      The water supply component will ensure that a continuous supply
of wholesome water is available to the whole of the population in the project
area, with the exception of some five thousand people living in remote vil-
lages. The project, and an allied sanitation program, will ensure that this
population also has access to acceptable forms of waste disposal.
3.31      Thus, the proposed water supply, sewerage and sanitation improve-
ments, by ensuring an equitable distribution of wholesome water, as well as
the collection and disposal of human waste, will reduce potential sources of
disease that presently pervade the community, particularly the slum areas
(paragraphs 6.07 to 6.10).
IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
4.01      Under the Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board Act the
assets and liabilities of ENE may be vested in MWSSB with effect from any
date specified by GOM. Under a resolution (dated March 26, 1979) GOM
determined the terms and conditions for transferring ENE's assets and lia-
bilities to MWSSB; GOM also determined that the date of transfer shall
be the same as the date of transfer of the staff of ENE to MWSSB. The
transfer of staff from ENE to MWSSB was to have been effected by a G014
resolution dated January 10, 1979. However when this resolution was issued
a number of representations were received from ENE staff seeking clarifica-
tion regarding terms and conditions of deputation to MWSSB. GOM therefore
passed a further resolution, deferring the transfer of staff to permit
these issues to be resolved. Despite this delay, GOM is confident that MWSSB



- 24 -
will be fully staffed during 1979 (paragraph 5.09). In the meantime, the
staff continues to carry out is duties as part of MWSSB's organization but is
employed by ENE.
4.02      There are three different levels of institution involved with this
project. First, there is GOM which until recently has acted in the water
supply and sewerage sector through ENE, a department of government rather than
a separate financial entity. ENE is to be superseded by MWSSB, a separate
financial entity. Secondly, there are the six municipalities and thirdly the
villages, each of which is a separate financial entity. When the project is
completed oa September 30, 1983 MfWSSB will establish bulk tariffs and supply
water to the whole project area. As part of the sector reorganization, GOM
intends to transfer the water distribution systems in Ulhasnagar, Ambernath
and surrounding villages from MWSSB to these local authorities during the
project period. On completion of these arrangements MWSSB will supply water
in bulk to the towns and villages which will operate and maintain their own
water distribution system; the six towns will also operate and maintain the
sewerage systems to be constructed under the project. The six municipalities
have expressed their support for the project and have prepared relevant reso-
lutions which will be placed before the municipal councils. The approval of
these resolutions by municipal councils will be a condition of effectiveness
of the credit.
4.03      Uader the Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board Act 1976,
MWSSB is required to operate, as far as practicable, without incurring a
loss. MWSSB is required to establish separate funds for its loan (Loan
Fund) and other (Board Fund) transactions, a depreciation reserve, and
prepare an annual budget for submission to GOM. MWSSB is also required to
prepare annual accounts and a balance sheet in a prescribed form for audit
and publication.
4.04      Prcesent accounting and financing arrangements at all levels of
the sector are based on government rather than commercial practice. Water
supply accounts are kept on a cash basis in accordance with GOM and local
authorities accounting procedures; water supply cash transactions are con-
solidated with those of other services to form the GOM state accounts or
individual local authority accounts, as the case may be, and any shortfall
or surplus in water supply revenues is funded from or contributes to the
respective consolidated state or local authorities' revenues. Separate
income statements and balance sheets for water supply are not prepared
although records of water supply assets exist. Although recent, reliable
information on collection and recovery of revenues is incomplete, available
data suggests that current procedures are not entirely satisfactory. Annual
budgets are prepared but there is a lack of financial management.
Past Financial Performance and Present Position
4.05      As part of the feasibility study for the proposed project, BMRDA
engaged Kirloskar Consultants, Ltd., Pune, to prepare income statements, cash
flow statements and balance sheets for ENE and the local authorities, in the
project area, from 1974/75 in accordance with commercial practice, and to



- 25 -
revalue existing water supply assets in operation on the basis of replacement
cost in mid-1977. Income statements based on data prepared by the Consultants
for 1974/7' through 1978/79 are summarized in Annex 6 and salient features
are given below.
ENE (nlow MWSSB)
4.06       Summary income statements for water supply systems operated and
maintained by ENE throughout the entire state, and estimated fixed assets in
operation, are as follows:

four municipalities (Thane, Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Dombivli), which at present
operate water supply distribution systems are summarized in Annex 6. The
financial performance has varied; Thane has had a surplus, Kalyan and Dombivli
have had small deficits and Bhiwandi has had a substantial deficit. Under
municipal practice, operating deficits have been funded from municipal taxa-
tion while surpluses have been applied to the consolidated municipal fund for
the benefit of other services. A common feature in all the municipalities is
the high proportion of accounts receivable.

V illages
4.11      Little information is available on the financial activities of
individual village water supply operations but tariffs generally appear to
provide sufficient revenues to cover operating costs.
Transfer Ai-rangements
4.12     is part of GOM's program to establish MWSSB, the transfer of ENE's
fixed assets (as Government equity) to MWSSB was scheduled for March 1, 1979.
Any liabilities for previous operating deficits would not be transferred.
This transfer has been deferred to permit resolution of issues raised by the
staff which are to be transferred from ENE (paragraphs 4.01 and 5.09). GOM
is confident that the transfer of asset and liabilities will be completed in
1979 and that thereafter the water distribution systems will be transferred
to local authorities.
Future Accounting Arrangements
4.13      During negotiations GOM and MWSSB, as appropriate, agreed that the
following actions will be taken in accordance with a program acceptable to
the Association:



- 28 -
(i) GOM will require each of the six municipalities in the
project area to prepare and thereafter maintain separate
accounts, on a commercial basis, for its water and
sewerage services;
(ii)  MWSSB will prepare and thereafter maintain accounts on a
commercial basis for all of its operations and will main-
tain separate accounts, on this basis, for the project
area. MWSSB also informed the Association that it would
continue ENE's practice of maintaining separate records
of costs associated with each of its water supply systems
throughout the State;
(iii)  GOM will require each village in the project area to
prepare and thereafter maintain a separate receipts and
payment account for its water supply services.
4.14      It was also agreed that:
(i) GOM will require each local authority to improve billing
and collection procedures for its water and sewerage
services to enable consumer receivables to be reduced
to an acceptable level, to be agreed with the Association,
by March 31, 1981;
(ii)  GOM will cause each local authority in the project area
to pay its bills for bulk supplies promptly to MWSSB; if
any bills remain unpaid for more than 90 days, GOM will
ensure full payment by the local authority concerned
either by deduction from grants due to the local authority
or other means;
(iii)  MWSSB will submit to IDA by September 30, 1979, a satis-
factory program leading to the introduction and operation
of financial management and information systems.
Financing Plan
4.15      MWSSB has yet to formulate a financing plan, for its operations
throughout the State, which will include projects to be executed for local
authorities in the Sixth Five-Year Plan period ending in 1982/83. This plan
will be reflected in MWSSB's annual investment programs which will be sub-
mitted to the Association as part of the project reporting procedures. To
protect its future viability, MWSSB will be required not to incur any long-
term debt without IDA's. prior agreement unless its overall operating surplus
before depreciation, for its most recent financial year, is at least 1.3 times
the maximum debt service in any future year. During negotiations MWSSB
agreed to this long-term debt limitation.
4.16      MWSSB's estimated financial requirements in the project area in the
period 1979/80 through 1983/84, and the sources from which they will be met
(which also reflects the State's funding pattern in Table 4.5) are summarized

4.17      The proceeds of the proposed IDA Credit of US$48 million will be
included in GOI's allocation to GOM. At negotiations, it was agreed that:
(i)  GOM will relend the proceeds of the credit to MWSSB for
25 years, including a four-year grace period, at the
current GOM lending rate of 6-3/4%.
Ihe proposed terms are similar to those of the Second Bombay
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 842-IN) approved
by the Board on July 25, 1978. Although the onlending rate
is below the current 8-1/2% interest rate on 25-year loans
available from the Life Insurance Corporation of India for
water supply and sewerage projects, it is above GOM's cur-
rent open market borrowing rate of 6-1/4% for 10- to 12-year
maturity loans. The annual rate of inflation in India was
-1.1%, 2.1%, and 5.1% in 1976 through 1978 and is forecast
at 5% for each of the next three years.
(ii)  GOM will provide MWSSB with working capital and sufficient
funds, including loans on the same terms as above, to complete
the project.



- 30 -
GOM will make funds available in accordance with a long
established pattern of funding for local authority water
s;upply and sewerage projects, set out below (paragraph 4.18).
GOM's grant, which will comprise about 35% of the project
,ost, is justified having regard to the number of low-
income consumers using standpipes and the limited capacity
i:or cross-subsidization in the areas to be served. Much
(of the industry is located in industrial estates which are
,;upplied with water by MIDC thus reducing the opportunity
for cross-subsidy from industry to domestic consumers.
4.18      GOM has established the following arrangements for financing local
authority water supply and sewerage schemes.

4.19       in line with these arrangements, an understanding was reached with
GOM during negotiations that if the resources of any local authority, par-
ticularly the villages which at present have no piped water supply, prove to
be insufficient to provide for a contrioution of 10% of the project cost, as
well as fii,ancing interest on loans during project construction, then GOM
will make the contribution and recover the amount from the local authority.
4.20      To safeguard project financing, GOM agreed during negotiations that
during the period of project construction (i) MWSSB will not utilize any sur-
plus arisii,g from its operations in the project area for operational and
development purposes outside that area and (ii) local authorities will not
utilize surplus funds from water and sewerage operations for other purposes.
Tariffs
Generc.
4.21      ihe present bulk and retail water tariff arrangements in the
project area are set out in Annex 7. Most connected properties are metered
and a charg,e is fixed according to consumption. Unnmetered supplies are
charged according to the rateable value of the property or a fixed annual
payment fov each property. On completion of the project all connected
properties will be metered. At present there are no sewerage charges and
the cost of waste removal is charged against general municipal revenues.



- 31 -
4.22      A socio economic study has been commissioned by BM1RDA for the
project area which will provide a basis for the consideration of alter-
native tariff structures. At negotiations, it was agreed that before
April 1, 1980, GOM will review the bulk and retail tariff structures in the
project area in consultation with MWSSB, the local authorities and IDA having
regard, among other things, to consumer's ability to pay and the economic
cost of future expansion of services.
MWSSB
4.23     MNSSB has adequate powers under the MWSSB Act of 1976 to charge for
and recover the cost of water supply. Projected bulk supply tariffs in the
project area from 1979/80 are shown in Annex 8. The following agreements
were reached during negotiations:
(i)  MJSSB will review and set its bulk tariffs in the project
area before the commencement of each financial year to
ensure that:
(a) from April 1, 1980 revenues are sufficient to cover
operating expenses and depreciation of fixed assets
in operation;
(Di) from April, 1983, revenues are sufficient, in addition
to covering the costs included above, to provide a rate
of return on average currently valued net fixed assets
in operation of not less than 4% in 1983/84 and 1984/85,
5% in 1985/86 and 6% thereafter. 1/
(ii)  With effect from April 1, 1980 MWSSB will review its
tariffs outside the project area before the commencement
of each financial year to ensure that revenues are suffi-
cient to cover operating expenses and the greater of
depreciation or debt service.
Local Authorities
4.24      Alequate powers to levy charges have been granted to local author-
ities in the Maharashtra Municipalities Act 1965 and the Bombay Village
Panchayats kct 1958 (as modified). Model bylaws issued by GOM under the
1965 Act, in respect of sewerage charges in the project area need to be ex-
tended to include the power to recover sewerage charges in accordance with
the volume of water consumed. From 1983/84 onwards, a rate of return covenant
is proposed for the six towns, based on net fixed assets in operation, as
revalued from time to time. The rate of return will be increased gradually,
1/   For the purpose of the rate of return MWSSB will annually review the
value )f its fixed assets and, if price levels have increased by more
than 1)% since the previous revaluation, MWSSB will revalue its fixed
assets in operation in accordance with a method agreed with IDA.



- 32 -
however, a; the impact on domestic consumers will vary considerably from town
to town, depending on the level of water demand by industry and commerce
(Table 4.6). In the three towns, Kalyan, Dombivli and Ulhasnagar, industrial
water demand forms a small proportion of the total, thereby reducing consider-
ably the opportunity for cross-subsidization. Furthermore water charges to
industry anid commerce must be comparable to MIDC water charges to adjoining
industry. A uniform combined water and sewerage charge of Rs 3/1,000 liters
in 1983/84 to industry and commerce in the project area has been assumed in
the financ-al projections. This rate is reasonable when compared to MIDC's
1978/79 water rate of Rs 1.50/1,000 liters and BMC's 1978/79 water and sewer-
age rate of Rs 3/1,000 liters for water and sewerage (BMC also imposes addi-
tional water and sewerage taxes, based on the rateable value of property).
4.25      "he combined water and sewerage charges in 1983/84 to an average
family (ex(luding standpipes users) would range from Rs 11 to 28 per month
(at 1979 piices) as shown below and discussed in paragraph 6.17. The monthly
water charge to urban standpipe users, if fully recovered (paragraph 4.26(iv))
would range from Rs 3 to 7 (at 1979 prices). The monthly water charge to
rural families would range from Rs 4 to 7 as indicated in Annex 14.

4.26      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOM that:
(i) for the years 1980/81 through 1982/83 each of the six municipali-
ties in the project area will set water and sewerage tariffs
tefore the commencement of each financial year to ensure that
revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses,debt service
and the required annual contribution towards the project cost.
(The contribution to the project cost may be transferred from
the municipality's general funds);
(ii) from April 1, 1983 municipal tariffs in the project area will
Le set to ensure sufficient revenues to cover the greater of
either operating expenses and depreciation and to produce a

-ate of return on average currently valued net fixed

,osts and debt service; 1/
(iii)  irom April 1, 1983 village tariffs in the project area will
be set at levels to ensure that revenues are sufficient to
cover bulk water charges, operating costs and debt service;
(iv)  .any operating subsidy for the water supply and sewerage
;ervices will be limited to the cost of supplying water by
public standpipe calculated at the domestic tariff, unless
otherwise agreed by the Association.
Future FinaLnces
4.27      During negotiations GOM agreed to cause local authorities in the
project area to pay to MWSSB the amount required to service outstanding
loans, rais;ed to finance the construction of water distribution and sewerage
systems on behalf of local authorities, when such systems are transferred to
local auth(rities.
4.28      Financial projections have been prepared for MWSSB and the six
towns for the period 1979/80 through 1986/87 and are set out in Annexes 8
to 13. The financial position of a typical village is set out in Annex 14.
Notes on as;sumptions used in the preparation of financial projections are
given in Atnex 15. Salient features for 1985/86 (i.e., the third year after
completion of the project) are set out below. During the project period,
MWSSB will require funds to finance construction materials kept in store for
the projecl.; the local authorities will require sound cash management to
ensure the prompt payment of their contributions to MWSSB. From 1983/84
onwards, major financial indicators for MWSSB and the municipalities are
satisfactory. Current ratios rise, reflecting increasing cash balances which
will be available for further investment in water supply and sewerage services
in the late 1980s.
1/   For purpose of the rate of return calculation, the same procedures
will be applied to local authorities as for MWSSB, (paragraph 4.23).

V. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Lending Arrangements
5.01      The recipient of the credit, GOI, will make available the proceeds
of the credit to GOM, which will onlend it to MWSSB, the beneficiary and the
implementing agency.
Organizatioa
5.02      Prior to 1977/78 water supply and sewerage development in the State
of Maharashtra was the responsibility of ENE, which was part of a department
of the Stata Government. Initially ENE was part of the Public Works Depart-
ment, then a section of the Irrigation Department and finally part of the
Urban Develapment Department.
5.03      Ia January 1977 MWSSB was formed under an act 1/ to "provide for
establishmeat of a water supply and sewerage board for rapid development
and proper regulation of water supply and sewerage services in the State
of Maharashcra." Initially MWSSB's primary function was to raise funds to
finance capital works in the sector but in 1978 GOlA began to broaden the scope
of MWSSB's activities, with the aim of phasing out ENE and transferring its
duties and responsibilities to MWSSB. The transfer of staff, assets, duties
and respons[bilities from ENE to MWSSB is to be completed during 1979 under
GOM resolut[ons which have already been passed.
1/   Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board Act 1976.



- 35 -
5.04      iluch of the former organization pattern will be retained under the
new organization (Annex 17). Although the headquarters of MWSSB is located
in Government offices in Bombay, it will soon occupy new offices; there are
subsidiary offices in several regions of the State (termed circles) and in
districts within the circles. This project is located in the Thane district
of the Bombay circle.
Management and Staffing
5.05      The chairman of the board, the member-secretary and nine board
members are appointed by the State Government. The member-secretary is the
chief executive of the Board and is required to be a qualified engineer with
experience in water supply and sewerage works and also experience in admin-
istration.  There are four ex-officio members of the Board and five non-
official members. The ex-officio members are from the Departments of Urban
Development: and Public Health, Rural Development, Finance and Planning.
Three of the non-official members are appointed from elected heads of local
authorities and two are experts in water supply and sewerage.
5.06      llnder the new organization MWSSB will have capable and experienced
engineering staff (transferred from ENE) who are competent to design and con-
struct works to a satisfactory standard. The staff comprise approximately
1,600 professionals, 4,500 technical (semi-professional) personnel and 3,000
non-technical personnel. Experience of ENE indicates that this level of
manpower meets average needs of the sector, provided that assistance, in the
form of the services of consulting engineers, is obtained to meet above
average woik loads;-this is an acceptable and economical arrangement.
5.07      Because the project forms a large part of MWSSB's program , it
will be implemented by a separate unit (Annex 17) which has been established
specifically for this purpose and is headed by a Chief Engineer.
5.08      Although the transfer of personnel from ENE will provide MWSSB
with adequaite staff to carry out its engineering and technical functions,
difficultiEs have been encountered in providing suitable financial and
accounting staff for MWSSB. This is primarily because a separate Government
Department formerly satisfied the accounting needs of the Environmental
Engineerin% Organization, whereas, MWSSB will adopt a commercial form of
accounting which is not traditionally used by Government departments.
5.09      In discussion with GOM and 1MWSSB officials during project appraisal,
considerable emphasis was placed on the need to obtain suitable staff for
financial management and accounting. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from GOM that any vacant key positions in MWSSB will be filled by
September 30, 1979 and that thereafter, any significant changes in the orga-
nization structure will be made only afrer consultation with the Association.
Training
5.10      A large number of training courses are available in Indian insti-
tutions for technical personnel ranging from artisans through senior engineer



- 36 -
grades and for non-technical personnel, from clerks and typists through senior
administrative, accounting and management grades. Public health training
programs and refresher courses are also conducted by GOI's Ministry of Works
and Housing. These courses range from Dne week to three months and cover
diverse technical subjects including engineering design, water and sewerage
treatment plant operation, distribution system maintenance and other allied
subjects. GOM has recently established a training program on operation and
management of water systems and is considering extending its program to other
related subjects.
5.11      a tentative, satisfactory training program under the project has
been proposed in outline by MWSSB and BMRDA and will be developed in more
detail as the project proceeds. At present the program includes training for
some 200 to 300 engineers, accountants, administrators and artisans in Indian
institutions and overseas training in specialized engineering subjects for
six to ten engineers.
5.12      INE from which 1MWSSB will be substantially formed, is a well
organized and efficient department of GOM. It is reasonable to assume that
initially NWSSB will be an equally competent organization and that in due
course its efficiency will be enhanced by the relative increase in flexibility
of operaticn of the Board and its more commercially oriented management, bud-
geting and accounting systems. Its degree of success will rely to a large
extent UPOIL its key personnel, in engineering, management and finance, most
of whom have yet to be identified.  The success with which GOM has estab-
lished other semi-autonomous corporations, -- MIDC, the State Electricity
Board and others -- promotes considerable confidence in MWSSB's future.
However, much has yet to be accomplished, particularly in establishing new
financial and accounting systems.
Audit and Insurance
5.13      The Act under which MWSSB was established requires that MWSSB's
accounts are audited annually by an auditor appointed by the State Govern-
ment. The audited accounts together withi an audit report are then submitted
to the State Government. Local authorities' accounts are audited by GOM
under the Maharashtra Municipalities Act 1965.  These audit arrangements
are satisfactory. At negotiations assurances were obtained that MWSSB
and GOM will submit MWSSB's and municipalities' audited accounts of water and
sewerage operations in the project area to the Association by December 31 each
year.
5.14      kn assurance was obtained at negotiations that materials and equip-
ment for the project will be adequately insured and that all other public
utility risks will be adequately insureul by MWSSB and the local authorities.
Operation and Maintenance Responsibilities
5.15      As well as its major role as a State agency for the planning design
and construction of water supply, sewerage and sanitation facilities, MWSSB
will also operate and maintains water supply facilities in some areas.



- 37 -
5.16      linder the present arrangement in the project area, MWSSB will
operate an([ maintain the Badlapur water treatment plant as well as the water
distribution systems serving Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath and 10 of the
22 villages presently supplied. MWSSB will purchase water from MIDC to
supply to Kalyan and Ulhasnagar.
5.17      HWSSB will continue to operate and maintain the Badlapur water
treatment plant and will operate and maintain the Temghar plant upon its
completion, as well as the associated transmission system. As the project
progresses, MWSSB will assume the role of bulk water supplier for the entire
project arE-a, continuing to purchase wacer from MIDC as required and assist-
ing the municipalities of Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath to take over
responsibilities for operating and maintaining their water distribution
systems. The Thane, Kalyan and Dombivli municipalities will continue to
operate and maintain their own distribution systems; each of the munici-
palities will operate its own sewerage system. Distribution systems in
villages will be operated and maintained by village councils.
5.18      lhese institutional arrangements, and the financial implications
of the project (paragraphs 4.23 and 4.25) have been discussed with concerned
local authcrities and with GOM and BMRDA officials. Resolutions by local
authorities in support of the project have been prepared and placed before
the concerned municipal councils as a step towards establishment of the new
institutional arrangements.
5.19      Although the six municipalities are capable of operating and main-
taining their respective distribution systems, MWSSB will assist the smaller
authorities, particularly the villages and other authorities which are new
to these tasks, by providing technical personnel and expertise in the early
stages. MWSSB will also examine the distribution systems periodically to
ensure that they are being well maintained and will carry out surveys to
detect any undue water losses from the systems (paragraph 3.17). Several
villages in the project area are operating distribution systems satisfactorily.
Village systems have the advantage of being extremely simple to operate and
maintain in this project since treatment, transmission and storage are the
responsibility of the bulk supplier, usually leaving only a single small
distribution main and several standpipes to be tended by the village. MWSSB
would in any event be available to carry out any major repairs or extensions.
VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL JUSTIFICATION
General
6.01      This project, the third water supply and sewerage project in the
State of Maharashtra, is part of GOM's program to provide sanitation facili-
ties and adequate quantities of safe, dependable water throughout the State.
Provision of these services in the project area is of high priority, not only



- 38 -
because thE area is experiencing rapid growth due to its proximity and com-
munication linkages with Greater Bombay but also because of Government efforts
to relieve population pressures in Bombay City by providing and improving
amenities in surrounding areas.
6.02      "he six towns which comprise the urban component of the project
presently all have piped water systems. These systems, however, provide
unreliable and intermittent services and some of the water is of questionable
quality; tlie systems serve only a part of the population. Sanitation facili-
ties are ir,adequate to serve the urban population and associated healthl risks
are apparert. Of the 104 villages included in the project, 82 lack piped
water. Thc rural population typically obtains water from wells or from rivers
which are cften inaccessible and of poor quality. Supply problems increase
during the dry season when groundwater sources dry up, and villages with piped
systems suffer from water deficiencies.
6.03      The project would help to alleviate the hardship and public health
problems cciused by the inadequacy of water and sanitation services through a
combinatior, of infrastructure and institutional improvements. In the urban
areas, water supply systems would be augmented and extended, thereby improving
service leNels and water distribution to all sections of the urban community,
including the poor. The project would also provide for water-borne sewage
collection, sewage treatment, and safe disposal facilities which would improve
the visibly poor sanitary conditions. All villages would be provided with
wholesome, protected and assured supplies of piped water. In general, insti-
tutional eificiency would be improved both for the planning and execution of
programs with the development of MWSSB and for the operation and maintenance
of systems by local authorities on a self-supporting basis.
Population Served
6.04      It is estimated that, by 1991, an additional 1.4 million people in
the projeci area will benefit from the extension and augmentation of water
supply systems and that the approximately one million present consumers will
benefit fro.m improved water services. The per capita water supply will be
increased throughout the project area, in order to meet accepted Indian
standards (f "adequate" supplies (paragraph 2.19). Local authorities will
provide additional public latrines in tne urban areas, and MWSSB will imple-
ment a rural sanitation program during the project period. By 1984, when
the project. is completed, the entire urban population will have access to
acceptable forms of sanitation and collactively benefit from a cleaner
environment.
Impact on Ploverty Groups
6.05      (f the total incremental population of 1.4 million to be served by
1991 when t.he project is fully utilized, approximately 0.9 million represent
the urban pioor (Map IBRD 14111) and predominantly low income rural population.
In urban areas, additional standpipes will be provided to improve service to
an estimated 36% of the urban population who live in slum areas. The design



- 39 -
targets ar, 250 dwellers per standpipe -- only two towns presently meet these
standards -- and a distance of no more than 100 meters between dwellings and
standpipes. As a consequence, the long daily waiting times for water collec-
tion will be reduced and walking distances shortened, in addition to service
level improvements. An estimated 33% of the urban population will be served
by standpipes and the remainder by metered connections.
6.06      in rural areas, 82 villages will be provided with piped water and
supplies will be augmented in the remaining 22 villages. Standpipes will be
provided to achieve a service standard of not more than 300 people per stand-
pipe throughout the area; this standard has not yet been achieved where piped
water supplies are currently available. The present hours of supply are
typically 2-4 hours daily due to lack of water; these hours will be increased
as demand requires upon project completion. The target is for 60% of the
rural population to be served by standpipes and 40% by metered connections.
Impact on Ilealth
6.07      Preliminary health statistics 1/ indicate the prevalence of water-
and sanitat:ion-related diseases throughout the project area. Vital and health
statistics for the six municipal towns as registered in municipal records
for the period 1975-77 show that an average of 8% of all deaths are directly
attributable to water-borne diseases. These figures vary among the towns
but, in general diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and dysentery predominate together
with typhoid which appears to be sharply increasing. These mortality figures
underestimaLte the incidence of diseases. Although data on the incidence
of disease are difficult to obtain and interpret, the municipal records for
Kalyan for 1975 and 1976 indicate 65 cases of diarrhea, gastroenteritis and
dysentery for each recorded death. Incidence statistics also underestimate
the true magnitude of health problems due to the indeterminate numbers of
people who seek treatment from unrecognized, private, or distant medical
sources, or who fail to obtain a proper diagnosis. The incidence of jaundice
has increased suddenly in 1978, particuLarly in the urban areas, reflecting a
current epidemic of the disease in the region.
6.08     lresently available recorded data on the status of health in rural
areas are also difficult to evaluate. The magnitude of water- and sanitation-
related diseases varies among the villages; and there are records of the
incidence of gastroenteritis, malaria, jaundice, and some cholera. In a
sample of 28 villages, seven villages reported cases of guineaworm between
1976 and 1977 with as much as 15% of the population of any one village suffer-
ing from the disease. For the sample as a whole, there are more recorded
cases of guineaworm than for any other water-borne disease indicating poor
water supply condition.
6.09      During the monsoon months, the incidence of water-borne diseases
increases dramatically. To illustrate, approximately 70% of the water-
1/   These are now being compiled by Tata Insitute of Social Sciences, which
has boen engaged by BMRDA to carry out a socio-economic study of the
project area.

and sanitaiion-related cases recorded in the Kalyan municipal hospital in
1975 and 1976 and 45% of recorded municipal cases in Dombivli from 1976-1978
occur between June and September. During these months of heavy rains, open
drainage guitters overflow and spread stormwater contaminated by sewage; there
is a deterioration in water quality, particularly in local village sources;
and stagnating rainwater pools become convenient although polluted water
sources besides becoming insect breeding sites.
6.10      In the absence of the project, gastroenteritis, guineaworm, and
other watei- and sanitation-related diseases would be expected to continue
and to inclease, affecting the health and productive capacity of the popula-
tion. The introduction of piped water supply will dramatically reduce the
number of guineaworm infestations in the affected villages. The health
consequences of inadequate water supply and sanitation also fall most heavily
on the poor, living in high density areas, sharing communal facilities, and
susceptible to infection due to poor nucrition. Although associated health
benefits are difficult to quantify, local officials in villages in the project
area with recently introduced piped water supplies have been able to perceive
health improvements.
Return on Investment
6.11      Incremental revenues, based oii present water charges, are assumed to
represent the consumers' minimum willingness to pay for services and are thus
a proxy foi the minimum level of benefics derived from the project. Using
the cost ar,d revenue data streams shown in Annex 18, the minimum measure of
internal economic rate of return (IER) for the entire project is 3.5%, with
labor valued at 100% of its market price (LlO0), or 4.5%, with labor valued
at 70% of its market price (L70). The relatively low rate of return on invest-
ment reflects both the degree to which present charges are below marginal
production costs and the omission of any sewerage charges (paragraph 6.12).
6.12      The calculated economic rate of return, using revenues as a proxy
for benefits, underestimates the real economic return of the project since it
excludes benefits which cannot be meaningfully quantified. For example, the
amount by which consumers value additional consumption above the price paid
for additional water, is not included. This consumer's surplus will be sig-
nificant in areas where the project is providing the first increments in
wholesome, reliable water for consumption. Secondly, no proxy for sewerage
benefits has been included in the revenie stream based on present charges,
as there aie no indicators of consumers' willingness to pay for water-borne
systems in the project area. In addition, there will also be external sewer-
age benefits accruing to the population as a whole from improvements in public
health and environmental conditions. Finally, other nonquantifiable benefits
that are onmitted from the IER calculation include increases in labor product-
ivity and employment opportunities, increased property values, the promotion
of economic development, improved institutional capabilities, and the reduction
in the drudgery and anxieties associated with current services.



- 41 -
6.13      With revenue streams based on increased tariffs proposed upon com-
pletion of the project (Annex 18, Table 9) the IER rises to 8.3% (LIOO) or
9.4% (L70).. This assumes that consumers are willing to pay the increased
tariffs for improved services (pragraph 6.17).
Marginal Cost and Tariffs
6.14      Average incremental costs (AIC), used to estimate the long-run
marginal costs of water supply and sewerage, are calculated based on data
presented in Annex 18. A comparison between the AIC of water supply (Annex
18 Table 1i) and present average retail water tariffs (Annex 7) indicates
that metered, domestic consumers are paying between 17-50% of AIC in the
northern sector of the project area and between 26-47% of AIC in the southern
sector. 1/ Commercial and industrial establishments are being charged between
29-127% of AIC in the north and 52-94% of AIC in the south. 1/ With the addi-
tion of water-borne sewerage systems, the differentials between current tariffs
and water/ewerage AIC's would become further skewed. The present average
tariff will be revised to satisfy both financial and economic goals (para-
graphs 4.22, 4.23 and 4.26). The on-going socio-economic study is analyzing
tariff structures and levels with consideration to ability to pay and pos-
sibilities for cross-subsidization.
Ability to Pay
6.15      Economic and social considerations require that low income families
are not denLied minimum water and sanitation services to sustain a healthy and
productive life because of an inability to pay. Determining affordability is
necessarily judgemental, and preliminary estimates of the income distribution
of the population in the project area are shown in Table 6.1. These figures
are being refined in the socio-economic study and are now based on available
statistics regarding expenditure patterns in the project area.

Section (EWS) with a negligible capacity to pay for services. 1/ This
applies to approximately 20% and 10% of the population in, respectively,
the rural and urban areas. The percentages of those with limited capacity
to pay (Rs 200-450) is 40% rural and 30% urban. The remainder of the house-
holds has :sufficient capacity to pay for services.
6.17      The projected tariff increases (paragraph 4.25) imply that metered
urban households with water and sewerage connections would pay between Rs 11
and 28 for services (based on 120 lcd consumption), or a maximum of 6% of
monthly in(:ome assuming that these households earn at least Rs 450/month.
Urban standpipe users would pay at most Rs 7/month (based on 50 lcd consump-
tion) perhaps together with a fixed household charge for the maintenance of
public latvines; excluding the EWS category, the monthly water charge would at
most repret;ent about 3-1/2% of monthly household income. Although 80% of the
urban slum households have a monthly income greater than Rs 200, i.e. standpipe
charges would be afforable by most families, there will be a need to subsidize
standpipe charges in order to benefit the extremely deprived. In the villages,
the monthly water charges will be on the order of Rs 5 per month (based on
40 lcd consumption) or no more than 2-1/2% of monthly household income,
excluding 1-he EWS category. Preliminary socio-economic surveys have observed
the eagerness of consumers for improved services and their willingness to pay
for improvements.
6.18      Opportunities for cross-subsidization are possible between the low
and high income domestic consumers. In devising tariff structures and levels,
the socio-economic study will consider such factors as ability to pay, income
and expenditure patterns, service levels, current tariffs, long-run marginal
costs, and financial goals. There are limited opportunities for cross-
subsidization from industry in the project area since MWSSB will provide only
a portion of the total industrial consumnption, the remainder being supplied by
MIDC. The project area will, however, benefit indirectly from industries
supplied by MIDC in that these industries will influence the regulation of
MIDC bulk rates to MWSSB (paragraph 3.17(iii)).

plete the project (paragraph 4.17(i) and (ii));
(xvii)  (OM will ensure that during the project MWSSB will not
utilize any surplus arising from its operations in the
project area for operational and development purposes
outside that area and the local authorities will not
utilize surplus funds from water and sewerage operations
ior other purposes (paragraph 4.20);
(xviii) ]sefore April 1, 1980, GOM will review the bulk and retail
lariff structures in the project area in consultation
with MWSSB, the local authorities and IDA having regard,
among other things, to consumers' ability to pay and
the economic cost of future expansion of services
(paragraph 4.22);
(xix)  HWSSB will review and set its bulk tariffs in the project
area before the commencement of each financial year to
ensure that:
(a) from April 1, 1980 revenues are sufficient to
cover operating expenses and depreciation of fixed
assets in operation (paragraph 4.23(i)(a));

outside the project area before the commencement of each
financial year to ensure that revenues are sufficient to
cover operating expenses and the greater of depreciation
or debt service (paragraph 4.23(ii));
(xxi) (,OM will ensure that:
(a)  for the years 1980/81 through 1982/83 each of the six
municipalities in the project area will review and
set water and sewerage tariffs before the commence-
ment of each financial year to ensure that revenues
are sufficient to cover operating expenses, debt
service and the required annual contribution to MWSSB
towards the project cost (paragraph 4.26(i));
;b)  from April 1, 1983 municipal tariffs will be set
at such levels as will ensure revenues sufficient
to cover the greater of either operating expenses
and depreciation and to produce a rate of return on
average currently valued net fixed assets in opera-
tion of not less than 3% in 1983/84, 4% in 1984/85,
5% in 1985/86 and 6% thereafter, or operating costs
and debt service (paragraph 4.26(ii));
iC)  from April 1, 1983 village tariffs in the project
area will be set at such levels as will ensure
revenues sufficient to cover bulk water charges
operating costs and any debt service (paragraph
4.26(iii));
(d)  any operating subsidy for the water supply and
sewerage services will be limited to the cost of
supplying water by public standpipe calculated at
the domestic tariff', unless otherwise agreed by the
Association (paragraph 4.26(iv)).
(xxii)  GOM will cause local authorities in the project area to pay
LZo MWSSB the amount required to service outstanding loans,
riaised to finance the construction of water distribution and
3ewerage systems on behalf of local authorities, when such
systems are transferred to local authorities (paragraph 4.27);
(xxiii)  Key staff positions in MWSSB will be filled by suitable
candidates by September 30, 1979 and thereafter any signifi-
cant changes in the organizational structure will only be
made after consultation with the Association (paragraph 5.09);

submit their own audited accounts, to the Association
by December 31 each year (paragraph 5.13);
(xxv)  kll materials and equipment for the project will be
adequately insured and all other public utility
insurance risks will be adequately insured by MWSSB and
the local authorities (paragraph 5.14).
7.02      Che execution of a contract between MWSSB and engineering consul-
tants to complete detailed engineering design (paragraph 3.21) and the com-
pletion of resolutions by the six municipalities in the project area in
support of the project (paragraph 4.02), are conditions of effectiveness of
the proposed credit.

Impact on Dom.stic Consumer:
The montthly charge for water supply to most families (assumed
size - six persons) will be an affordable amount of household income.
However, 20% of families have a monthly income below 200 rupees and may
be unable to <afford five rupees. This problem will be overcome by cross-
- subsidization from other consumer groups.
(a) Family with connected supply - Rs 9 per month

MAHARASHTRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Notes on Financial Projections
1.        Yinancial projections have been prepared covering the period 1979/80
through 1986/87 for MWSSB's activities in the project area - as project executing
agency and bulk supplier of water - and for the water distribution and sewerage
activities of the 6 towns.
(A) MWSSB:
2.        'T'he following assumptions have been made:
(a) H1WSSB will supply bulk water to the towns of Kalyan, Ulhasnagar
and Ambernath and a few villages from April 1, 1979. BMC and
MIDC will continue to supply bulk water to the other towns and
villages; these arrangements will continue until September 30, 1983;
(b)  From October 1, 1983, on completion of the project, MWSSB will
supply bulk water to the whole of the project area from its
own sources and from MIDC purchases;
(c)  Vhe 6 towns and the villages will operate and maintain the
water distribution systems and collect revenues from the
consumers in their areas from April 1, 1979;
(d)  MWSSB will supply water to, and collect revenues from
industry located in rural parts of the project area from
October 1, 1983. Prior to that date MIDC will continue
to supply such industry with water; and
(e) ItWSSB will keep separate accounts for the project area.
Income Statement (Annex 8)
3.        Revenues are based on the charges for bulk water supply stated in
Annex 8.
4.   Operating Costs
Projections have been made using data from the existing water works
facilities in the project area, and reasonable estimates of staffing, power
and chemical costs for facilities to be provided under the project. Materials
for operation and maintenance are estimated at 1/2% of gross assets in service.
Provision has been made for water purchased from MIDC to supplement MWSSB's
own supply. All costs include 5% a year for inflation.

5.   Depre iation
Jwo and one-half percent of gross fixed assets in service.
Funds Flow Statement (Annex 9)
6.   Sources:
Internally generated funds, including contributions from local
authorities, will amount to about 15% of total project investment. GOM
will supply the balance to complete the project by a combination of loans
and grants to MWSSB.
7.   Applications:
MWSSB will execute the project between 1979/80 and 1983/84 and on
completion, transfer the water distribution and sewerage systems to the local
authorities. No other works are contemplated in the project area before the
late 1980's.
8.   Debt Service
MWSSB will repay GOM loans over 21 years, after an initial 4 years'
grace pericd with interest at 6-3/4%. The six towns will reimburse MWSSB the
debt service on loans raised for the water distribution and sewerage systems.
MWSSB will recover debt service on loans raised to construct bulk assets
through the bulk supply tariff.
9.   Working Capital
Requirements under the project are limited to purchases of steel for
pipe fabrication. A cash deficit until 1981/82 will be met from MWSSB's
overall wo1king balances and a cash surplus in later years will be invested
by MWSSB after taking into account its overall requirements.
Balance ShEets (Annex 10)
10. Fixed Assets
Existing assets were revalued in 1977 at current replacement cost
and have been included in MWSSB's balance sheet at April 1, 1979 on this
basis. A further revaluation of existing assets has been assumed based on
inflation at 5% a year from 1977 through 1982, and these revised values
included in MWSSB's balance sheet at March 31, 1984. Assets commissioned
under the project are included at cost.
11. Deferred Charges (i.e. loan obligations of municipalities)
Represent obligations of the six towns to repay to MWSSB the loans
outstanding in respect of the water distribution and sewerage systems.

rate accou.its for its water supply and sewerage activities with effect from
April 1, 1)79.
Incom! Statement (Annex 11)
18. Revenues
dave been calculated for each municipality as follows:
(a) Jater Supply -
J)  From 1979/80 to recover operating costs, debt service
and the required cash ccntribution towards the cost of
the water supply component of the project.
(Li) From 1983/84 to recover operating costs and depre-
ciation and to produce the rate of return on net fixed
assets as specified in Chapter IV, paragraph 4.26(ii).

(b)  ;ewerage -
,ystems in Thane, Bhiwandi and Kalyan will be partly
:ommissioned from 1980/81. Prior to April 1, 1983
Tharges will be made to recover operating costs; depre-
:iation will not be charged until the systems are fully
:ommissioned. From 1983/84 revenues have been calculated to
:ecover operating costs and depreciation and to produce a
rate of return on net fixed assets as specified in paragraph
L8(a). The cash contribution towards the sewerage component
)f the project is assumed to be met from municipal taxation,

MAHARASHTRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Aver-age Incremental Costs and Internal Economic Rates of Return
In order to efficiently allocate available resources, the price
paid for water by consumers should reflect the incremental economic cost
of making additional consumption possible. The average incremental cost
(AIC) represents a through-time average of the incremental economic cost
of additional consumption, and it is calculated by (1) discounting all
future capital costs and incremental operating and maintenance costs and
(2) dividing the results by the discounted value of incremental consump-
tion over the time period, using the opportunity cost of capital. The data
required for the AIC calculations can also be used to determine the internal
economic rate of return (IER) - the incremental return on investment -
assuming that the benefits of the project can be approximated, as a mini-
mum, by t:he revenue generated. The IER is the discount rate at which the
net present value of the project is zero.  If pricing policy follows the
AIC, then the IER of the project will equal the opportunity cost of capital.
The following assumptions were made in the calculations of the
AIC and )ER for the project:
(1)   The opportunity cost of capital is 10%, with sensitivity
testing at 8% and 12%.
(2)   All costs are in constant 1978 domestic prices, net of
taxes and duties.
(3)   There is a 4-year construction period and an average useful
project lifetime of 40 years.
(4)   Incremental consumption and costing figures are taken from
the financial annexes, adjusted for inflation.
(5)   The shadow price of foreign exchange is Rs 10/US$l.
(6)   Labor is valued at both the full market wage rate (LlOO)
and 70% of the market wage rate (L70).
(7)   The project time horizon (until 1990-91) coincides with
full project utilization.
(8)   Sewage flows are taken at 80% of incremental water consumpticn.

MAHARASHTRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Justification for Metering
1.        rhe Government of Maharashtra pursues the policy that all water
supply should be metered in order both to account for water usage and to
provide the basis for cost recovery. As of 1977, over 90% of all domestic
connections were metered in the projecL area, and remaining domestic con-
nections and standpipes will be metered during the project period.
2.        rhe decision to meter should be based on an economic evaluation
of the expected benefits and costs of such metering. The value of benefits
arises fro.n the water conservation induced by metering. Such a reduction
can enable an allocation of water savings to other consumers, can induce dis-
cipline in water use, and can permit an equitable allocation of water costs
to users based on consumption. In quantifiable terms, the reduction in
aggregate demands due to metering can permit savings in the capital and
operating costs of the system and/or postpone future investment.
3.        The benefits of metering arising from decreased water consumption
will be offset by two types of costs. First there are the costs to the con-
sumer of foregone consumption. These are difficult to quantify but include
both direct expenditures incurred to reduce household wastage and the value
of foregone consumption. Secondly, there are quantifiable costs to the
utility of initial meter purchase, installation, maintenance, and reading,
billing and collection.
4.        An evaluation of the quantifiable elements for benefit-cost analysis
compares the discounted cash flows of the savings derived from reduced water
consumption to the costs to the utility of metering. Because data rarely
exist which indicate the reduction in consumption which would follow the
introductian of metering, the analysis can be reformed to determine the
reduction in water consumption that would be necessary to make metering
economical.
Costs of Metering
5.         Almost all connections in the project area have one-half inch
meters. The utility costs associated with these meters are estimated as
follows:

Cost (Rs)
Purchase of 1/2" meter                     150
Installation                                50
rotal Initial Cost                         200
Equivalent Annual Cost /a                   26
Annual Maintenance Cost                     15
Annual Reading, Billing, Collection         30
rotal Annual Cost Per Meter                 71
The m)nthly cost per meter is Rs 5.9.
/a   Xssumes an average meter lifetime of 15 years and
a discount rate of 10%.
Metering Sivings
6.         [n order to determine the reduction in consumption that would
be requirei to justify metering, the average utility metering costs are
divided by the marginal water supply and sewerage costs:
ieduced consumption   >   Metering Costs
AIC
In general, at least a 12% reduction in water consumption would be required
to justify metering connections based on economic costs. 1/ This is judged
to be a mitiimum figure for the actual influence metering is likely to have
on consumpt:ion.
1/   This calculation assumes a discount rate of 10%, that labor is valued
at 70% of its market value, and that the average household consumption
is 120 lcd for a family size of 6.
