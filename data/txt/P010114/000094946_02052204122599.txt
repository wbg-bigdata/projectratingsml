HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Introduction
1.        The Governments of Pakistan (GOP) and Azad Kashmir
(GOAK) are requesting a credit for a technical assistance project
for the development of the agricultural sector in Azad Kashmir.
This project would be the first stage of a program for the systematic
development of the various sub-sectors.
2.        Largely because of its physical characteristics, Azad
Kashmir has lagged behind in the research and development efforts
which have gone into developing higher productivity technical
packages for farmers in Pakistan. The extremely difficult terrain
of the State requires special adaptation of improved techniques to
meet the uniquely severe local conditions. Establishment of
technically sound and economically viable techniques is a necessary
first step before undertaking substantial investments to achieve
increased production and higher farmer income.
3.        Nothwithstanding the extreme difficulty of the terrain, it
is confidently expected that within a relatively short period, the
transfer of new technologies being developed in the North West
Frontier Province (NWFP) under controlled field testing conditions,
can result in substantial production increases in the main cereal
crop which is maims. Similar production increases can also be
expected in other major crops, including fodder, following intro-
ductory trials and field testing. In addition, the climate is
suitable for specialization in fruit and vegetable production for
which a small nucleus base exists. However, these potentials for
increasing production must be fitted into a land use pattern which
safeguards the catchments and conserves the soil since the severity
of the topography constitutes the first and over-riding constraint
in introducing improved technologies.
4.        In the livestock sub-sector, development of techniques
for fodder production and improved utilization is a first priority,
to be followed by the introduction of a suitable dual-purpose cattle
breed which would provide the farmer with both his milk and draft
requirements. The important activity of poultry improvement is
currently being undertaken by a UNDP assisted project.
5.        An urgent problem throughout the State is the shortage of
woodfuel. This has led to the devastation of large parts of the
former forest lands and will require a systematic program of
reforestation to be undertaken, in which local people are fully
associated.



Project Activities
6.        The project would be for a three-year period and include
the following activities:
(i) Technical Development
(a)  Establishment of 4 permanent Experimental/
Demonstration Farms, each of about 6 acres and
representative of different geographical/
ecological zones, which would initially be
used for maize, fodder crops and pulse crops
improvement. The farms would be established
in the Kotli, Danna, Mang Bajri and Abbaspur
areas; (see Technical Annex 2).
(b)  Extension of the ongoing ARC/CIMMYT co-operative
maize program in the 4 areas described in (a);
(c) Upgrading of 3 Apple Nurseries at Chamyati,
Bagh and Chattar Kalas; (see Technical Annex 3).
(d) Upgrading of the Vegetable Seeds Farm at Chattar
Kalas; (see Technical Annex 4).
(e)  Establishing trials for fast growing tree species,
particularly addressed to the fuelwood problem,
to cover nursery work, establishment method and
genetic improvement; (see Technical Annex 8)
(f)  Development of improved techniques of fodder
harvesting, storage and utilization; and
(g) Assessment of crossbred cattle types to identify
a suitable dual-purpose animal combining milk
production with draft capabilities; (see Technical Annex 10),
(ii) Pilot Programs
(a) Pilot Apple Scheme, directed to the smaller farmer,
which would include the setting up of a headquar-
ters organization; developing a field extension
service with effective disease control in the
areas of Dhirkot, North Rawalakot and Danna;
instituting a credit scheme for farmers' inputs;
and a market survey on which to base an expanded
apple program,with supporting work in storage,
packaging and marketing arrangements; (see Technical
Annex 3).



- 3 -
(b) Pilot Vegetable Seeds scheme, including the
construction of a Seeds Processing Plant at the
Chattar Kalas farm and a nucleus extension service
in the Bagh, Hajira and Hattian areas for the
promotion of farmer out-growers of vegetable
seeds and development of vegetable production for
local use and sale; (See Technical Annex 4).
(c) Pilot Fuelwood Plantations amounting to 3000
acres in Batika, Kotli, Hajira and Bagh areas.
In the first year these would be established
in the Declared Forests and expanded in
subsequent years in Shamlat and private lands.
The production of additional tree seedlings for
sle to private farmexs would also be included;
(SeeTechnical Annex d).
(iii) Training (See Technical Annex 6)
(a)  In-service short courses with the ongoing ARC/
CIMMYT program;
(b) 2-year certificate courses in general agriculture
at Lyallpur and Peshawar;
(c) 3-year (condensed) graduate courses in agriculture,
under special arrangements with Lyallpur and
Peshawar;
(d) 5-year graduate courses in agriculture at Lyallpur,
Peshawar and Tandojam;
(e) 4-year graduate courses in animal husbandry at
Lyallpur;
tf) 6-month short courses in livestock at LyalIpur;
(g) 6-month courses for apple technicians at
Muzzaffarabad; and
(h) 6-month special courses in machine maintenance
(seeds plant) and seeds processing.
(iv) Land Use Planning (See Technical Annex 11)
(a) Aerial photography of the State and the
production of base maps; and
(b) setting up a Land Use and Development Planning
Unit under the project manager.



(v) Follow-Up Project Preparation (See Technical Annex 12)
(a) Preparation of a follow-up project based on the
techniques developed, farmer responses achieved
under the pilot schemes and land capability assesed
by the land use and development unit; and
(b) Assembly of data and execution of studies needed
for developing follow-up project(s).
7.        The locations selected for the main activities are summarized
in Table 1. Technical annexes 1 to 12 contain sector background
information, detailed descriptions of the various activities, terms
of reference for the various studies and job descriptions for the
senior staff posts. The main activities are summarized in Table 2.
Management
8.        The project would be under the management of a project director
of secretary rank, who would be responsible to the Chief Secretary GOAK,
through a project development committee composed of the Chief Secretary
as Chairman, the Development Commissioner, Secretary for Finance and
Project Manager. A new post for the project manager would be created
of Secretary for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Special Project,
which would fit into the present organization of government. The project
manager would be assisted by a land use specialist, who would co-ordinate
with line departments in the production of sub-watershed development
plans which would form the basis for preparing follow-up project(s).
Provision is also included for an agricultural specialist, who would
be seconded to the department of Agriculture with special responsibility
for technical development activities.
Costs
9.        Project costs are derived in the detailed cost tables
in Table 3 and are summarized below. Total costs are expected to
be PRs. h4  million (US$4.5 million), including physical and p.rice
contingencies.

Financing
10.          Financing of the project would be by 34% GOP contribution and
66% IDA credit. ProJect funds would be channelled from GOP to GoAK who would
make a budgetary a]]ocation to the project manager who would maintain separate
accounts for the project. GOP and GOAK would undertake to provide 2-months
estimated future project expenditures in a fund for project use.
Benefits of the Project
11.          The project would provide a sound basis for proceeding with the
rational development of the agricultural sector within the overriding constraint
of sustainable land use practices. The experimental trials in food and fodder
crops would result in the development of techniques to enable substantial
increases in crop production to be achieved which could be applied to a significant
part of the 500,000 acres of tilled area of the State.
12.          The pilot program in apples and vegetables will lay the base for an
expansion of these crops which have a relatively high farmer-income generation
potential. By addressing the cattle feed and breed improvement problems, a sound
basis will be established for follow-up projects to improve the livestock sector.
Development of both an improved technology in forestry and a system of user
participation in establishing sustained fuelwood supplies, will provide the basis
for the future large-scale reforestation program which must be undertaken to
prevent further degradation of the State's forests, soils and water resources.

A.   Sector Background
Topogrephy, Climate and Soils
1.        Azad Kashmir is a mountainous state of 2.9 million acres, with
a population of 1.7 million, 90% of which rely on rural occupations.
Altitudes range from approximately 1,000 ft in a relatively small and
flatter portion of the southern district to mountain peaks at well over
10,000 ft. The state is characterized by a series of narrow valleys in
the 2,000-3,000 ft range which feed into the swift flowing Neelum and
Jelum Rivers, which converge in the northern area at the capital of
Muzaffarabad and which feed the Mangla Dam in the south. From the narrow
valley bottoms the terrain slopes variably but generally sharply upwards
to the 5,000 ft level from where altitude increases in a broken manner vary-
ing from small upward rolling plateaus to sharp rises in the form of mountain
peaks. The great majority of agricultural activity takes place in the
2,000-5,000 ft altitude range, above which the land is devoted to forestry
and summer grazing - see the chapters on Forestry and Livestock.
2.        Within a broad typology, climatic conditions particulnrly temperature
are sensitive to altitudes; the valley bottoms enjoy mild sub-tropical winter
temperatures rising to 100°F (plus) during the summer monsoons; at the 5,000 ft
level short duration winter snows and frosts are common with sub-tropical
summer conditions; above 5,000 ft heavier and lasting winter snows may be
expected with alpine summer conditions. The mountainous nature of the country
inevitably gives rise to highly localized rainfall patterns and density and
localized temperature ranges. The only firm data available is from the four
meteorological stations at Muzaffarabad, Gari Dopatti, Kotli and Pulandari,
all of which have been established for data collection for the Mangla Dam and
are located in valley bottoms. The stations record daily data on barometric
pressure, temperature, wind direction and velocity, cloud cover and visibility,
and take three hourly precipitation readings between 8 am and 5 pm each day.
However, data passed to the Azad Kashmir Department of Agriculture merely
record monthly rainfall figures and monthly min/max temperatures. The available
information is attached at Appendix I, but other than for broad indicative
purposes, the data is of little value to agriculture (note the wide disparities
between the records from Muzaffarabad and Gari Dopatti which are only 14 miles
apart). Despite lack of data, a subjective assessment indicates that there
is sufficien t rainfall with a reasonable spread in most areas to make improved
1/ A comprehensive assessment of the sector is contained in the Mangla Wtershed
Management Study, Hunting Technical Services, 1961. Whilst dated, this
report provides valuable background data.

farming systems possible following relatively short periods of experimentation
and meteorological data collection in micro-zones.
3.        There are a wide variety of geological formations but apart from
the flatter areas of the Mirpur district in the south which is characterized
by rather heavy sandy loams and small pockets of alluvial soils in valley
bottoms, almost all cultivation is carried out on bench terraces cut into
the hillside which have accumulated deposits of heavy clays. No systematic
soil sampling has been attempted for soil types or properties.
Farm Size and Farm Land Use
4.        Of the total 2.9 million acres, a major portion falls under the
tehsil-l administrative recording system; the balance (and minor parts of the
tehsil areas) falls under the authority of the forestry department. An
analysis of the 1972 records (Appendix 2, Table 1) shows a gross area under
tehsil administration of 1.9 million acres of which 706,000 acres are in
registered farm lands involving 206,000 farms (the individual farm holding
is often non-contiguous), giving an average farm holding size of 3.4 acres.
Uncultivated land accounted for 1.4 million acres including communal hillside
pasture and woodlots, townships and residential areas, and a large amount of
vasteland, riverbeds, etc., plus 208,000 acres registered but not cultivated
registered farm land. Hence of the total area only about 17% is cultivated
and the cultivated area per farmer is only 2.4 acres on average. About 90%
of the farmers are registered as having an area below 5 acres under cultivation;
about 50% have less than 1 acre and only 2.6% more than 10 acres. However,
the available data probably understates the area under cultivation in the
smpller holdings and overstates it on the larger holdings. In respect of
total farm land (including uncultivated farm lands), the largest holdings -
10 acres and more - accounted for roughly 6% of the farms and 30% of the
registered farm land.
5.        The use of both arable and grazing lands is subject to very primitive
technology. Cultivation is by hand hoe or primitive wooden ploughs drawn by
undernourished work oxen; current planting methods in the rather heavy soils
result in hard surface pans which limits moisture retention. These practices,
together with the lack of proven quality seeds and limited fertilizer recom-
mendations (almost exclusively urea) result in extremely low yields - see
para 14. The current low grain production base has the adverse effect of
causing farmers to rely heavily on livestock numbers to increase farm income
by fully exploiting the free grazing of alpine summer pastures. This has led
to overstocking which has largely destroyed much of these natural pastures causing
soil erosion and a further deterioration in the fodder base and in livestock
quAlity.
1/ A tehsil is a revenue collection area which also maintains cadastral maps
and land ownership and usage records. These records are brought up-to-date
every four years, the last occasion being in 1972 when there were ten tehsils.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1

6.        The terrain and soil types limit the potential for even small-
scale supplementary irrigation operations. However, agricultural staff
displays a heavy bias towards irrigation resulting fram their academic
training received in the environment of the irrigatable areas of Pakistan.
This predisposition towards small-scale irrigation needs to be taken into
account in assessing the technical and economic merits of possible small-scale
schemes.
Terracing and Soil Conservation (Cultivation areas)
7.        Almost all cultivation is carried out in conjunction with some
type of bench terracing.  The terraces have been constructed with the purpose
of collecting arable soils, producing a reasonable degree of level land for
cultivation and in a few cases for mini-supplementary irrigation purposes.
The terraces are not designed or constructed as a part of soil conservation
practices. Even on very steep slopes (greatly exceeding 100%) where farmers
have constructed walls up to 8 ft high to obtain bench terraces of as little
as 2-4 ft wide, the motivation is oriented towards maintaining the crop root
structure during heavy rains rather than to preserve the soil itself. Such
terraces continually collect new soils generated by soft rock weathering
higher up the slope. A typical bench terrace will be 4-20 yards wide and
from 18-70 yards long; the surface of the terrace will have a fall from
back to front of between 1-5% and lesser slopes along its length which,
however, might be in several directions (in many cases the high points are
at both ends). The construction method results in rapid rainfall run-off
channeled to one or two central points of the terrace wall (or earth bank)
causing concentrated volume flows onto the lower terrace. This causes a
cambinztion of erosion runnels, (corrected annually), and temporary flash
flodding which compacts the rather heavy soil types.
8.        From the individual farmer perspective, the runnel soil erosion
itself appears relatively unimportant (although the runnels cause minor crop
damage), because of the relatively fast generation of new soils which reach
his cultivated area. Few farmers appreciate the detrimental effect on their
crops of soil packing; this arises from a general preoccupation with getting
water onto land (irrigation) and holding surface water. Techniques for preventing
flooding of heavy soils, but retaining soil moisture, have not been conceptu-
alized or demonstrated. Whilst the method in current use helps to collect
soils and would prevent sheet erosion (i.e., whole portions of land being
transported by water which is prevalent in some parts of Pakistan but not in
Azad Kashmir), it does little, if anything, to prevent the prevalent and
considerable insidious type of silt erosion, i.e. in the mission's view, will
have little effect in reducing siltation to the Mangla Dam.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 4
9.        Whilst erosion in the cultivated areas is considerable, even
more erosion is occurring on the grossly overstocked pasture lAnds. Heavy
grazing reduces plant size and weakens root structure and soil is subsequently
carried off during heavy rains   Where these grazing areas lie above the
cultivated areas, silt-bearing run-off enters the bench terraces (see above),
some of the silt rempining as new deposits but most flushing into the rivers
below. In other areas, flush water from bare pasture lands concentrates
according to the terrain,in turn creating high volume run-off strips resulting
in gully erosion. Present anti-erosion techniques for this type of erosion
concentrate on the construction of check dams in the gullies. These are
sound as palliative measures, but do not prevent the basic cause.
10.       In addition to check dams some emphasis is being given to tree
planting for erosion control measures. However, most of the planting is
concentrated along gully banks and, in the absence of overall control, the
trees tend to be progressively undermined. Tree-covered belts across the
hillside to arrest excessive surface water flows are extremely rare and even
where woodlots are being attempted there is little attempt to maintain a
strong undergrowth. Thus at present they serve a function, in soil conservation
terms, only insofar as the canopy holds rainwater and checks the force of
impact on the ground surface, but prevents little surface soil movement.
11.       In summary, the soil structure under natural conditions is not
highly erodible and the rainfall density though occasionally fairly heavy,
is not excessive in relation to the soil. Nevertheless, considerable erosicn
occurs. The problem is largely man-made through a combination of unsuitable
land cultivation practices, unsuitable grazing practices and minimal knowledge
of suitable physical soil conservation techniques and coefficients. Improve-
ment in soil conservation practices is essential both for maintaining farm
production in the long-term and for the broader objective of minimizing the
siltation rate of the Mangla reservoir. Three main measures will need to be
tackled simultaneously:
- first, and foremost, the need for rational grazing
management (see Technical Annex 9 - Livestock Sector)
and fuelwood supplies (Technical Annex 7 - Forestry Sector);
-   secondly, simple improved cultivation and crop planting
techniques (see Technical Annex 2 - agricultural experi-
mental/demonstration farms); and
-   thirdly, improved physical measures which involve traverse
run-off channels into constructed vertical (but stepped)
waterways and to a lesser extent, improved bench terrace
design (all of which require adequate data to arrive at
the most econamic technical coefficients).



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 5
12.       These activities can only be meaningfully structured in the
context of sub-watershed development plans prepared by Azad Kashmir staff
in collaboration with local fprmers - see Technical Annex 11. The federal
agency, Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has been operating a
Watershed Man'gement Project in parts of Azad Kashmir for five years, with
the primary objective of reducing siltation of the Mangla reservoir. Results
so far have indicated only limited success - see Appen ix 3
13.       The constraints in parts of Azad Kashmir to implementation fall into
two parts; firstly, the lack of technical expertise and experience within
Azad Kashmir for this sort of planning; secondly, there are important social
constraints which have to be overcome because the combined activities involve
considerable changes in present land use patterns. The technical problems
can be overcome by the injection of expertise (meteorological data collection
is however a prerequisite) and local minor experimentation.  The social problem
is far more difficult and its resolution would involve a strong political
commitment to the generation of local (village/sub-watershed area) planning
and consultative groups who will require considerable indoctrination in the
concept of overall land use planning for the benefit of all, and supporting
technical and social motivation advice to act cooperatively.
Production
14.       The estimated state-wide cropping index is 1.18, giving a total
cropped acreage of 585,000 frcm the 500,000 acres under cultivation. Production
and yield estimates for the years 1970/71 to 1974/75 are contained in Appendix 2
Table 2 and are summarized below for the year 1973/74.

15.       Although the foregoing represents a reasonable estimate of acreages
and yields, the overall farming system is complicated by the number of livestock
relying on crop residues and "inadvertent" fodder crops. Although full irrigation
is negligible and only single crop farming is assured, many farmers attempt to
double crop. For example, many maize growers (season May-October) attempt to



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 6
grow a winter wheat crop which in a favorable season they will harvest as
grain but in most years will be used as a green fodder crop. When this type
of ?rcatch-as-catch-can" activity is taken into account, the cropping intensity
rises from 118% to nearer 150O.
Vegetables and Fruit
16.       The promotion of vegetables and fruit production is in its infancy
and with a few notable exceptions these items do not make a significant
contribution to the locally produced food base. A subjective assessment of
v-egetables and fruit stalls in local markets indicates that over 80% of the
produce being sold is being imported from out of State. There are no statis-
tics on vegetable production and those for fruit are highly suspect. Fruit
productimn is stated to be in the region of 50,000 mauds (1,870 metric tons),
the principal fruits being apricots, loquats, lesser amounts of peach, plum,
guava, walnut and almonds, and recently introduced apples.
17.       According to the 1972 census, 17,800 farmers reported growing 194,832
apple trees (an average olf eleven trees per reporting farmer). The same census
has 21,200 farmers reporting the growing of 58,500 apricot trees. The data
indicates 65,805 apple trees and 16,741 apricot trees in the 3agh tebsil, i.e.,
a ratio of approxim&tely 4 apple to 1 apricot tree. The statistics probably
overstate the number of apple trees; the area under apples is likely to be
less than 600 acres. A wide range of varieties are grown including many of
the older varieties introduced frci the United Kingdcmn, such as Jonathan,
Granny S3nith, Worcester PermRin, Williams, etc., as well as Kashmir Amri,
Kashmiri Red, Red Astrachan and others. In more recent years there has been
a shift to Golden Delicious and various Delicious sports - Starking Delicious,
Red Delicious, etc. Sane of the more enterprising growers bave lopped the
older low yielding varieties and successfully grafted (albeit in a rough and
ready fashion) the newer varieties onto old trunks. Most apple varieties need
cross pollination for the heavy setting crops; however, little attention is
paid to this aspect and where good pollination occurs it is likely to be a
matter of luck rather then design. No data exists which accurately reflect
average yields. The Department of Agriculture guess the average to be 40 lbs
per tree (on a ccmposite full orchard basis this would be equivalent to a little
under 2 tons per acre). For the majority of apple trees this guess is probably
on the high side; however, very high yields can be and are attained (see
Technical Annex 3).
Food Supplies
18.       The Government uses a grain requirement for planning food supplies
of 145 kg per caput. With current population at 1.75 million, the grain require-
ment for food is about 250,000 metric tons. Thus, after deducting production
there is a current deficit approaching 100,000 tons in Azad Kashmir grain
production.  This deficit is made up by federally supplied subsidized grains



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 7
of 65,ooo tons (1975) and World Food Programme grains of approx. 6,000 tons,
leaving further supplies from private trade flows to provide 26,000 tons
(i.e., about 10% of the theoretical requirement). In practice, subjective
assessments suggest that the  in-situ  population is overstated by some
7-10%, and that actual per caput consumption of grains by the resident
population is some 10-15% less than the theoretical requirement figure used.
On the other hand, some grain is fed to animals. On balance, the production
deficit is probably about 50,000 tons, leaving a positive balance after inclusion
of subsidized food supplies that is either stocked or fed to animals of about
20,000 tons.
Pricing and Marketing
19.       Because of the heavy reliance on imported basic food grains, the
federally established subsidized selling price is reflected in the price of
the small amount of local production subject to internal transfer. The retail
price of federally supplied grains, through a chain of registered retailers,
is currently set at a little under PRs 1,070 per ton (the current CIF Karachi
price is approx. PRs 2,400/ton for wheat and PRs 1,650/ton for maize); thus,
transactions in local grains are approximately PRs 40 per maund 1/ equal to
PRs 1,088/ton. Such transactions are extremely limited and tend-to occur
only when the logistics of imported supplies are faulty.
20.       The price of vegetable products is to a large extent dependent on
the seasonal supply of imported items from out of State sold in the local
markets/townships. In general terms, prices appear to be very high, the local
trader placing up to 100% mark-up on an ex-farm value; for example, PRs 20 per
maund for radish, spinach, cucurbits; PRs 40 per maund for tomatoes and
PRs 100 per maund for peas.
21.       Seasonal soft fruits such as plums and apricots are subject to glut
and scarcity situations and as these fruits do not travel well, reliable price
indicators could not be established.
22.       The currently limited apple production (guesstimated at below
1,000 tons) is largely locally consumed at an internal transfer price of between
PRs 80-150 per maund. The price received by the farmer is largely governed by
his geographical location And his early cash needs. Out of state apple sales
to the cities of Pakistan are through a series of intermediaries    There are
two principle methods of sale by the farmer; firstly, and most common, are
sales via farmer delivery to a prearranged site on a good "bus route" road,
at which point the farmer receives PRs 80 per maund for October/November
deliveries with 50% premium for late deliveries in February/March and even
higher prices for premium quality varieties; the second sales method (mainly
in Athmuqam) is for the farmer to sell the standing crop on the tree some two
months prior to harvest. This practice involves some complex traditional
features and the exact price received by farmers is difficult to compute, but
it appears to be approximately PRs 40 per maund of the estimated crop yield
with the purchaser carrying the risk of subsequent crop losses. The gross mark-
up between farm-gate prices and final retail prices in the cities appears sub-
1/ 1 maund = 82.3 lbs.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 8
stantial (and unnecessary) to the farmers. However, at approximately 100%
this mark-up is not out of line with the producer-to-consumer differentials
in other parts of the world. Thus, at current production levels it seems
doubtful if intervention in the marketing system would or could have any
significant impact either to benefit the farmer or in lowering retail prices.
However, any increased apple production program would necessitate altered
and programmed marketing arrangements as new production came on-stream. The
absorption capacity of Pakistan for apples needs to be studied in-depth. A
very preliminary assessment based on extrapolation of the situation in India
indicates that the additional absorption capAcity may be in the order of
80,000 tons (see Technical Annex 3).
Potentials for Increased Productivity on Arable Lands
23.       Grains.  It is confidently expected that average per acre yields of
grains, particuIarly maize, can be improved by 100% and possibly by a lot
more. This assessment is based on:
(a) a sample count of maize stalks at each area visited
allied to examination of cobs in store, indicates that
in every area production by some farmers is between
four and eight times that of the average quoted for
the area. A visual assesment of land quality and
charactertistics of the sample count, related to the
surrounding areas, strongly indicates that these
better yields were obtained on land very little, if
any, above average quality;
(b)  initial simple, but systematized, soil testing will
indicate those soil deficiencies which require
attention. To date, no soil testing has been done -
not even for Ph values. At present very few farmers
use fertilizer, nor can they be expected to do so
in the absence of a rational recommendation system
of type and application required;
(c) the primitive husbandry practices which lead to soil
particle packina and loss of moisture could be improved
by simple innovations such as ridge cultivation and
planting on the ridge. These innovations would be
rapidly adopted by farmers provided they were first
proved and demonstrated in the local area;
(d) simple hybridization of local strains of maize would
rapidly lead to locally suited higher yielding seed
(some farmers report using this technique with success,
in an ad hoc manner, but such successes have never been
followed up, systemized or consolidated). Although



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 9
some "improved" seed hns been imported frcm the rest
of Pakistan and distributed it has been done without
any rationale or any "proving" and without any fol ow-
up to evaluate the temporary success of a particular
variety in a particular area; and
(e)  Pakistan has a history of m-ize production research
dsting back to the mid-1950s   The Ford Foundation
and C=ffT 1/ have actively supported the research
program, whTch has generated sufficient technical
knowledge to form the basis of a National Maize
Production Program. The program is being implemented
by the provincial governments under the coordination
of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council. The
1976 plan envisages a 60% increase in production
through the use of management responsive varieties
on 90% of the acreage to be grown, and through the
adoption of the reccmmended package of cultural
practices on 50% of the area to be planted under
maize. The plan does not, however, include any
provision for research and extension efforts in
Azad Kashmir.
24.       Fruits.  Whilst the area could probably grow soft fruits successfully,
it is doubtful if any major production from such difficult terrain could be
marketed without serious quality deterioration. However, as identified by
earlier missions, the production of high quality apples which store well and
travel well has already been proven. The limitations to potential apple
production are largely organizational. However, any program for apple develop-
ment will need to be based on realistic market assessment (see Technical
Annex 3).
25.       Vegetables (other than potatoes).  Throughout Azad Kashmir there are
a large number of small pockets well-suited for many types of vegetable production
and most farm lands are suitable for growing certain vegetable types. A major
limitation to vegetable production is the availability of seeds, even though
certain areas are suitable for seed production. Thus a combined seed and
vegetable promotion program has a large potential - initially for internal
consumption in Azad Kashmir, but gradually expanding exports to other centers
in Pakistan. This is discussed in Technical Annex 4.
26.       Potatoes:
(a)  Production as a vegetable - The rather heavy soil types
suggest that potatoes will not yield competitively with
other vegetable types for the local or other markets.

(b) Production as seed for export fram Azad Kashmir -
Theoretically, the altitudes and climatic conditions
of Azad Kashmir should make it a suitable area for
production of virus-free seed; however, it is doubtful
if social and institutional features would allow the
necessary tight ccntrol and inspection measures
necessary for a viable virus-free seed industry.
27.       Fodder Crops.  Within the farming system there is considerable
scope for rationalizing the present ad hoc wheat-cum-fodder production into
more productive fodder systems. In addition there is also scope for the
utilization of fallow lands (usually about 20% of cultivable area in one
cropping season) for fodder production in a rotational cropping system.
Thirdly, grasses on the cultivable "waste" lands could be substantially
improved.
B.   Department of Agriculture
Introduction
28.       The Department has a small headquarters staff, a general extension
service and a pest investigation laboratory. Recurrent costs of these services
are met from normal Government budget. In addition, the headquarters staff
controls and directs seven schemes financed from the development budget with
a five year (1974-79) budgeted cost of PRs 11.7 million mainly directed towards
improved horticulture and vegetables.
Headquarters Staff
2O.       The principal officers and their job functions of the regular (non-
development) headcugrter staff include:
(a) the Director (M.Sc.Agri);
(b) Deputy Director (B.Sc.Agri) - whose main function
is the control, distribution and accounting for
subsidized fertilizer;
(c) Plrnning Officer (B.Sc.Agri) - currently absent
on overseas studies;
(d) Assistant Publicity Officer (B.Sc.Agri);
(e) Fruit Development Officer (B.Sc.Agri); and
(f) a limited number of support clerks.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1

The hepdqunrters has limited office accommodation and is short of office
eouipment.  There are five vehicles all of which are old - and for which
there is an extremely limited operating budget; this confines staff mainly
to desk work. The extension service is divided into four geographical
divisions and pest investigation, and all the development schemes tend to
work independently of each other with the result that the Director of
Agriculture has sixteen separate line officers reporting directly to him.
With the present organization, the headquarters unit, intended primarily
to head an extension service, has become seriously overburdened and conse-
quently lacks effectiveness.
Extension Service
30.       Each of the State's four districts - Muzaffarabad, Poonch, Kotli and
Mirpur - are extension areas with an Agricultural Officer (DAO) in charge of
each (one B.Sc.Agri and M.Sc.Extension Education; two B.Sc.Agri; and one
matriculant). Each DAO has four or five assistants (AAs), one of whom may
be assigned to plant protection duties. Their qualifications range from
B.Sc.Agri (9), B.A. (2), matriculants (7). The AAs supervise 76 field
assistants (FAs) (24 in Muzaffarabad, 25 in Poonch, 12 in Kotli and 13 in
Mirpur). The extension service has one vehicle for each district and a
very limited vehicle operating budget. AAs travel to supervise FAs on foot,
or when available, by public transport (one operates his own motorcycle).
Typically, AAs visit half their FAs eight to twelve times a year, and the
balance at two to three months intervals; their offices contain a limited
amount of text books (often outdated), a few record books and little else.
They usuolly control the only store for the sale of pesticides to the whole
of their areas.
31.       Most FAs have some secondary school education and have undergone a
few weeks classroom training. They are often required to find their own accom-
modation, though some use the small fertilizer store for which they are respon-
sible, as living quarters. Because they are responsible for the security and
sales of fertilizer, most of their time is devoted to store-keeping even though
sales are limited and the quantities sold very smell. There are virtually no
proven technical packages suitable to the areas within which they operate.
Each FA covers an average of 2,700 farms (many with split holdings), which
are widely dispersed over difficult terrain. Consequently, they have little
contact with farmers other than those within a very short distance of their
base store.
32.       In summary, the extension service is reasonably well-qualified
academically at the supervisory levels, but carries out very little field
supervision. Field work is largely confined to promoting fertilizer sales
(currently very small). There are isolated cases of assisting with the use of
pesticides associated with the development schemes - see para 36.

Pest Investigation Laboratory
U. -     The laboratory is in a converted senior staff house.   It is
-easonably well-equipped and has a small library. It is staffed by an
-Lssistant Entomologist, a research assistant (both B.Sc.Agri - General)
and a few uncualified lTboratory workers. However, partly because of lack
of field samples (see para 30) and a qualified entomologist, the laboratory
fncilities are only little used.
Soil Testing Laboratcry
34.       This facility is funded under a development scheme (1974-77 costs
of PRs3.7 million), which allows for the construction of a new building and
a limited amount of equipment and the staffing by an Assistant Soil Chemist
and two research assistants. At present, the building is in the process of
construction and the equipment is in store. Same additional equipment will
be needed to complete the laboratory facilities. The staff positions have
been filled by well-qualified men (2 M.Sc. and 1 B.Sc.). However, their work
is presently limited to supervising building construction and no soil analysis
has yet been carried out.
Promotion of Potato Cultivation
35.       The activities in this development scheme could not be examined by
the mission because of the off-growing season. The staff administering this
scheme includes three agricultural officers (all B.Sc. General Agri), one of
whom is designated Potato Botanist. The botanist, however, is more specialized
in maize, having had six months training in maize breeding. One vehicle only
is available to the supervisory staff. A large proportion of the total costs
of the scheme of PRs 2.93 million is for providing subsidized seed and fertilizer
to farmers.
Development of Horticulture
36.       The objective of this devrelopment scheme (1974-79 costs of PRs 4.05
million) is for fruit growing only. Other products are dealt with under
vegetables - see p'ra 37. The scheme is headed by a horticulturist (B.Sc.
Agri - General) bssed in Muzaffarabad, who has seven assistants (1 M.Sc.
Horticulture; 3 B.Sc. Agri; and 3 matriculants), divided among the four
districts and based on fruit tree nurseries 1/. One vehicle only, used by the
horticulturist, is available to the supervisory staff. The intention is to
Drovide subsidized young trees, technical advice and subsidized plant protection.
Currently, the emphasis is on expanding the nurseries which produce loquat,
guava, apricot, peach, plum, walnut, almonds and apple trees. Farmers collect
trees from the nursery at PRs 0.5 per tree which is about 15% of production
cost 'or less). Although some rationing is attempted, indications are that
the better-off farmers obtain the trees. Only in isolated cases is technical
follow-up and plant protection provided. This is because of lack of transport
and lack of technical knowledge in the general extension service (see paras
30 and 31). Conceptually, the scheme has a sound base, but many aspects of
implementation require much more thorough detailed planning and the staff's
technical knowledge in this specialized field requires to be substantially
expanded (see Technical Annex 3).

Promotion of Vegetables
37.       This development scheme (1974-79 costs of PRs 1.80 million) is
designed to produce vegetable seed and promote the growing of vegetables.
It is fundamentally sound in approach.  The scheme is headed by an agronomist
(B.Sc. Agri with overseas training in vegetable production -USA), who has
five aericultural assistants (3 B.Sc.Agri Hons; and   matriculants). Efforts
have been msde to establish a small seed farm; field staff are given specific
acreage targets within close vicinity of the specific Township/center to
which they are assigned, based on the theoretical demand of the center.
Whilst a usefu.l start has been made, the scheme has been embarked upon
without adequate financial or logistical resources and without adequate
technical backstopping in certain components.
Agricultural Training Institute
38.       The development funds (PRs 1.83 million) for the scheme envisage
the erection of the necessary buildings, the provision of staff and other
facilities, to carry out university-type academic training plus short in-
service staff courses and courses for farmers. Construction hes started on
the building of two classrooms, offices, dormitory for 20 and a mess hall,
which together with four staff houses (not yet under construction) would
constitute the whole complex. One vehicle and a limited amount of teaching
equipment is provided for in the costs, plus the salary costs of four instructors
and a few minor employees. It is doubtful if the funds allocated will in fact
be sufficient for these limited facilities. Cursory examination of simple
timetable/staff availability/classroom space ratios make it clear that the
ambitious sets of syllabi and curricula for advanced academic training cannot
be met. As with other schemes, staff have been posted to the new positions
before any facilities are available; although some minor blackbooard-type
classes are being held in an old guest house. The staff have impressive
academic cualifications. However, they lack experience in teaching and in
practical aspects of the subject mptter proposed, especially as they relate
to the special conditions of Azad Kashmir. The staff in-situ include the
Principal (M.Sc. Horticulture, USA; D.Sc. Horticulture, France), a Senior
Instructor (B.Sc.Agri Hons, and M.Sc. Horticulture) and two junior instructors
both B.Sc. Hons Agri.
Summary
39.       The organization of the Department has evolved in an ad hoc manner
which is not conducive to effective planning, control or coordination.
Activities have been undertaken with good intentions, but without the imple-
mentation implications being fully thought through. The majority of super-
visory level staff have good academic qualifications (but not necessarily
relevant to local conditions); junior field staff are less well-qualified,
have little valuable knowledge to extend to farmers and generally act as
storekeepers. It is considered that the major contributing factor to this
state of affairs is the uncertain manner in which the department is allocated
resources. There is considerable uncertainty as the amount of the annuel



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 14
financial allocations and these are often released only after the start
of the finnncial year. This is not conducive to any type of long-term
planning and results in decisions being made in the context of short-term
emergency situations which does not permit the systematic development of
longer-term programs properly conceived and supported by staff, mpterials
and services.
C.   Suggested Agicultural Strategy
and Proposed Action Programs
Strategy
40.       A revised strategy for the agricultural sector (coordinated with the
livestock and forestry sector) has been discussed and agreed with the Govern-
ment of Azad Kashmir. The strategy would ultimately make Azad Kashmir self-
sufficient in basic food requirements and, in addition, provide surpluses
of horticultural products for supplying markets outside Azad Kashmir. It
involves (a) focussing currently available manpower on those activities where
a reasonable baseline of locally proven technology exists, and on simple
experimentation/proving of technologies (known in general terms but locally
unproven) for other activities; (b) implementing a comprehensive soil testing,
entomological and meteorological data collection base; and (c) implementing
a manpower training program to promote these measures.
41.       The implementation of the strategy requires a recognition that;
firstly, current expenditure in the general extension service is negated by
the lack of suitable technical packages for the general farmer and the the
service is extremely weak, both technically and organizationally at the lower
levels. Thus the general extension service should be retrained at the present
time and then redeployed as both suitable technical packages and adequately
trained personnel become available. Secondly, it requires a recognition that
all aspects of manpower training cannot be carried out economically within
Azad Kashmir. Thirdly, it should be recognized that, at headouarters level,
the organizationql structure of the Department of Agriculture is overburdened
at the top with insufficient delegation of nuthority to officers responsible
for the coordination and control of suitable groupings of subsector functional
activities. In addition, technical competence within certain headquarters
support services is weak, notably so in the entomological services. Finally
and most important, strategy implementation requires a twenty-year planning
perspective broken down into between three and four implementation phases
according to the subsector; only within such a framework can the present annual
preparation of PCI documents have any effective relevance.
Proposed Action Programs
42.       Action programs to implement the strategy are summarized below:
(a) the establishment of mini-zone simple experimental/
demonstration farms on a phased basis starting with
two in the first year and expanding by two each year
over two five-year phases. Initially, these farms
would concentrate on the development and proving of



TECHNICAL ANNEX 1
Page 15
simple improved grain pulses and fodder production
techniques. Subsequently, they would be the bAse
for agriculture extension staff. In the second
five-year phase of each farm, additional facilities
would be added to convert them to agricultural
service centers (see Technical Annex 2);
(b) an apple production progrpm involving 7,200 farmers
reaching full mpturity over 20 years (see
Technical Annex 3);
(c) a vegetable production program (including seed
production) initially limited in scope and area,
with gradual expansion over two five-year phases
reaching maturity in a third phase of five to
six years (see Technical Annex 4);
(d) strengthening of facilities and technical competence
of the headquarters agricultural support services
in entomology, meteorology and soil testing (see
Technical Annex 5);
(e) a manpower training program phased to meet the
requirement of the foregoing by a combination of
academic training (in Lyallpur and Peshawar) and
in-service training; supplemented by consultant
specialists and travel by key implementation officers
to similar operational programs within and outside
Pakistan (see Technical Annex 6); and
(f) at headquarters, strengthening the number of personnel
and their planning competence, reorganizing job
function and providing additional office and logistical
facilities (see Technical Annexes 11 and 12).
Planning for Implementation
43.       For the strategy and action programs to be successfully implemented,
it is essential that local officers be heavily involved at all planning stages.
Plnnning capacity is currently very weak, although individual staff members
have ability to develop the necessary capacity provided they are given a defined
framework within which to operate. Early detailed project preparation carried
out by outsiders could be counter-productive and a fairly lengthy project
preparation cycle should be anticipated. With the foregoing in mind, a three-
year Technical Development Project is proposed which would initiate the actions
discussed with the objective of preparing a follow-up project(s) which would
finance the various programs discussed. Preparation of future projects within
the strstegy would be carried out internally with some guideline assistance
from consultants.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A riculture Sector
WAPDA atershed Management Project
3.        WAPDA, the federal Water and Power Development Authority, has been
operating a Watershed Management Project for five years. The primary objective
of the project is to check siltation of the Mangla reservoir by encouraging
private farmers to undertake soil erosion works, inclading tree planting, the
construction of check-dams, retaining walls and diversion channels, terracing
and pasture improvement, including rotational grazing. The project area
extends to 2 million acres, of which 1.5 million acres is in four divisions
(Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Rawalakot and Mirpur) in Azad Kashmir and 0.5 million
acres in three divisions along the west bank of the Jheluxn river in Punjab.
The project is managed by a Project Director, three professional foresters,
one engineer and one soil conservationist with a watershed management officer
and supporting staff in charge of each division.
2.        Divisions are subdivided into sub-watersheds of some 500 to 3,000
acres and initially a soil survey and land capability assessment is carried
out and a sub-watershed plan produced. Cooperation of local farmers for
implementing the various works is then sought using audio/visual publicity
approaches, group meetings and individual contact. In order to induce farmer
cooperation the labor costs of the operations such as tree planting, and
terracing are paid for in cash by WAPDA, even though these are in private
farmland.
3-        The project is facing difficulties in translating plans into
action. These are concisely sumarized in the WAPDA evaluation report
1974/75, which also indicates possible solutions, and is quoted below:
a. Problems Faced in Execution of Watershed Management Works
The main problems generally faced are the same as reported in the
past which are:
(i)    Lack of Public CooReration.   The project is working
against very heavy odds. The afforestation and other water-
shed management works are carried out in privately owned
land with the voluntary consent of the land owners. There
is no legislative cover under which works could be taken up
or even maintained or protected. The project staff have to
contact the local people, convince them of the watershed
management program and seek their permission to carry out
work in their areas. This is by no means an easy job. The
problem is that the socio-economic conditions of the people
are hardly conducive to easy implementation of watershed
management program. People are illiterate and poor. Land
holdings are small and human and cattle population very
heavy. Agricultural methods followed are outdated. Range
land management even in an elementary form is non-existent
and grazing by cattle is heavy, unrestricted and without
any control whatsoever.



TECHNICAL ANNEX ]
_Apendix 3
(ii)   For these reaaons the project staff do not always
get full cooperation and active participation from the
people. Compact areas are not made available for carrying
out comprehensive watershed management treatment and some
times areas have to be left untreated.
(iii) Protection/Maintenance Difficulties. The projection
and maintenance of grazing completed works is another problem.
This especially applied to afforestation because the plants
cannot grow unless these are adequately protected for some
years against grazing, browsing, and cutting which at times
becomes extremely difficult to control in spite of best
efforts.
(iv)   Pasture Improvement Difficulties.  There is so much
pressure of animals that grazing areas (pastures) are
seldom spared for improvement although those may be producing
only a fraction of their production capacity. Due to non-
cooperation of the public very little work of range improve-
ment could be done so far.
b. Efforts to Solve the Problems. Measures so far adopted and
those vnder consideration for overcoming the above problems
are indicated below:
(i)    More &Mahasis on  xtonsion Work. The best solution
lies in public education so that people are more receptive
to new ideas. For this purpose great emphasis is given to
publicize the objects and working of the project. People
are contacted and local leaders are persuaded to come for-
ward and give a lead to the general masses by participating
in the Watershed Management Program. These measures are
proving useful and public cooperation has improved.
(ii)   Compensation for Grazing Rights. The pastures cannot
be improved unless grazing is regulated according to their
production capacity. Since grazing pressure is heavy on
pastures it is difficult to impose restrictions unless some
compensation is paid to the affected people. Possibilities
of providing compensation are being considered.
(iii) Watershed Management Act. A draft Watershed Manage-
ment Act prepared by this Project in 1973 is under consider-
ation of the government. Approval of this Act is essential
and efforts are being made for its early approval. The pro-
posed Act will be used in exceptional cases where the land
owners are opposed to Watershed Yianagement Program. ...
4.        Expenditure under the project amounted to PRs 4.3 million in
1974/75, of which PRs 1.1 million was expended on staff salaries and
traveling, PRs 0.1 million tools and stores and PRs 3.1 on works execution.
Funding of the project had earlier been shared b;r the Federal, Punjab and
Azad Kashmir Governments, but is now wholly provided by Federal Goverrment.
The mission did not have the opportunity of visiting any of the field works
and made no assessment of the efficacy of the project. However, the mission
considers it is significant that the State and Federal Governments have set
up an institution to address the watershed management problem, are perusing
an integrated land use approach and have allocated relatively large financial
resources to these activities.

PAKI STAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
AGRICULTURE - TECHNICAL PACKAGE DEVELOPMENT
Experimental/Demonstration Farms, Cooperative Mlaize Program
and Associated Extension
Background and Introduction
1.        As indicated in the review of the agricultural sector (Technical
Annex 1) most cultivation takes place at elevations between 2,000 and 5,000
feet above sea level in mountainous terrain; (the exceptions are the rela-
tively small areas in Bimber tehsil and parts of Mirpur which are flatter
and at lower altitudes). Valley bottoms are extremely narrow and hillsides
very steep, and it is not uncommon to find cultivation taking place at 2,000
to 3,000 feet differences in elevation within the radius of a single mile.
Apart from altitude effect on temperature ranges, the mountainous topography
creates local wind patterns, which combined with localized temperatures,
cause rain shadows leading to uneven precipitation and also variable frost
or hail probability. Besides the localized climatic variables, farming
conditions are further complicated by considerable variations in the slope of
land and the wide range of soil types, each with varying degrees of fertility
and permeability. It therefore follows that growing conditions for any
particular crop are so highly localized that generalized recommendations on
husbandry practices and/or seed variety are inappropriate.
2.        Presently there is no work being carried out within the state on any
type of agricultural research, proving trials or even studies of better farmer
practice. Results from research or trials carried out in other parts of
Pakistan and elsewhere (usually-under a totally different set of conditions)
can, at best, only be treated as indicative guides to what might be suitable
for parts of Azad Kashmir. In order to provide suitable technical packages
that may be extended with confidence to small farmers, it will be necessary
to institute systematic experimentation and proving trials for specific
areas. The definition and detailed assessment of areas for development
is discussed in Technical Annex 11. The approach would be to select packages
for which encouraging trials result have already been achieved elsewhere
(e.g. NWFP), which are judged to be replicable in Azad Kashmir, test each
component of these, and introduce modifications to suit localized conditions.
3.        To establish full and systematic coverage of the state it is en-
visaged that up to twenty small experimental stations would be needed within
the framework of a development program over the next 10 to 15 years. In
considering the program a number of factors need to be taken into account,
including: (i) initial experimentation can be of a relatively simple



TECHNICAL AiNEX 2
Page 2
nature and the degree of sophistication usually associated with research
stations is unnecessary; (ii) the gross area of land for experimentation
purposes can be quite small, but at the same time variations of altitude
even within mini-zones need to be incorporated; (iii) an initial period
of testing and developing of methodology is required before investment is
made in a large number of small experimental stations; (iv) manpower con-
straints limit the amount of experimentation that can be conducted in the
early years; (v) a particular experimentation area/farm should provide the
focal point for the dissemination of techniques in the future and possibly
the focal point for integrating farming systems including input supplies;
(vi) for maize, the work that has already taken place in Pakistan indicates
that certain improved varieties may well be tolerant of diverse conditions,
although related husbandry practices have not been proved; and (vii) for
rain-fed crops other than maize very little experimental work exists.
4.        Following discussions with state and federal authorities and
officials of ARC, the CIMMYT supported federal maize program and the USAID
sponsored Barani (rainfed) Crops Project, the project would finance estab-
lishment of the first four small experimental/demonstration farms and
simultaneously introduce the activities of the ARC/CIMMYT cooperative maize
program to areas adjacent to the experimental farms. ARC and the associated
agencies of CIMMYT and USAID have undertaken to provide technical support to
the program. The details of these two complementary sets of actions are
discussed below.
A.   EXPERIMENTAL/DEMONSTRATION FARMS
5.        Functions of Experimental/Demonstration Farms.    Each experimental/
demonstration farm would pass through a three stage evolution of function.
Stage one would involve the establishment of the land area and facilities,
(see para. 15), and the carrying out of experimentation and verification of
improved agricultural techniques. Stage two, which would begin as improved
locally proven techniques became available (anticipated after two or three
full seasons) would involve the use of the facilities to serve demonstration
and extension purposes, and as a base for the extension staff for that zone;
at this stage staff functions would change to emphasize extension work
and two additional field assistants per station would be appointed for
this purpose. The third stage is expected to follow about two years later
as initial extension work starts to have an impact, when the farm would
function as the agricultural service center for the area providing a focal
point for input supply, extension, farmer training and marketing (see para. 35),
in addition to continuing with verification trials.
6.        The pace of development of each farm through these three stages
would be dictated by the local progress in package development and farmer
acceptance. As new farms are established in different localities in the
future, each would begin at Stage one and evolve in its functions.



TECHNICAL ANiNEX 2
Page 3
7.        Project Activities.   The project would include the establishment
of the first four farms, two in year 1 and two in year 2. Farms would be
about six acres in area and concentrate initially on the most important
crops wlhich are maize, fodder and pulses. Farms would be located in areas
with the highest potential for developing improved technologies which have
relatively wide application in the different zones. They would establish a
pattern of development through experimental introductions, demonstration,
extension and production servicing as discussed in para. 5 and form the basis
for replication in other micro-zones from year 4 onwards.
8.        Selection of Zones.   The four zones selected for inclusion in the
proposed project include the areas of Danna, Kotli, Mang Bajri and Abbaspur/
Hajira (refer to map attached to main report). Areas were selected, using
a combination of the Land Capability maps prepared by Huntings Technical
Services in 1961 (see para. 2 of Technical Annex 11) and local knowledge of
AK technical departments. The criteria for selection were as follows:
(a) flirpur district was excluded from consideration because
of its ecological similarity to the Punjab province
of Pakistan for which agricultural technologies are
well developed;
(b) the northern-most areas of the Neelum River valley were
excluded because of low population and low agricultural
potential;
(c) constraints on trained manpower limited selection to
four areas;
(d) areas selected had to be identifiable as relatively
homogeneous zone with respect to topographical
features, and agricultural potential;
(e) areas selected had to include a minimum of about
10,000 acres of cultivable land (classes I to IV
in the Huntings Land Capability classification);
(f) areas selected had to be reasonably accessible to
facilitate proper management and supervision of
activities.
9.        The general characteristics of each of the four zones selected are
set out in Table 1. Estimates of total and cultivated area and of population
are tentative only, and were established by subjectively defining the
"boundaries" of a given zone (following watershed boundaries along ridges),
and enumerating the villages within these boundaries. Census statistics
for each village were then aggregated without reference to administrative
(tehsil) classifications.

10.       Selection of Farm Locations.   W4ithin the four zones selected, farm
locations will be determined by the Department of Agriculture, according to
the following criteria:
(i) a "farm" for each zone will consist of at least three
sites, selected to represent different land-types and
elevations. Typically a farm would consist of six
acres: a three acre central site on which the main
buildings would be built, and two outlying sites of
approximately 1.5 acres each, separated from the
central site and each other by elevations of at
least 500 feet;
(ii) the location will be as closely typical of the zone
in which it is located as possible, given the
constraint of land availability;
(iii) the land would be purchased on a freehold basis by the
Department of Agriculture;
(iv) the location would be accessible by all-weather road,
although not necessarily sited on the main road
(provision is made in the project for construction
of an access road to the central site, and of con-
necting tracks between outlying sites);
(v) the balance of different cultivatable land types on
the farm area would roughly reflect that of the
zone; non-arable land within the acquired area
would be used for pasture establishment work
(refer para. 14 (iv)).
11.       Initial Program of Trials.   The program of trials for each farm
will be determined by the Department of Agriculture, after consultation with
the agricultural specialist and Agriculture Research Council (ARC). The
treatments described below would be included in the experimental program;
these would be modified in the light of on-site experience gained. All
trials would be designed with replicated treatments to ensure that the
results are statistically sound, and would be conducted over a series of crop
seasons.
12.      Mlaize Trials.   Emphasis would be given to treatments not covered
by the ARC/CIMffT cooperative program.   However, for control purposes,
the maize variety and fertilizer trials which are established in the zone
under that program would also be established on each of the three farm sites
(see Section B, below). The trials would include investigations of the
following:



TECHNICAL ANNEX 2
Page 5
(i) tillage systems: the effect of plowing depth,
plowing frequency, zero tillage, methods of seed-
bed preparation (local practices vs. ridge cultivation)
and weeding techniques (local practices vs. maximum
and minimum treatments);
(ii)  soil conservation techniques:   comparison of local
terracing and levelling practices with improved
techniques of contour ridging with flood control;
(iii) row planting and plant population: comparison of
local practices and row cultivation, at different
levels of plant population;
(iv)  date of planting:   the effect of variations in date
of planting on performance of different (early and
late) varieties;
(v) fertilizer practices: the effects of different levels
of NPK, farmyard manure, and trace element application;
(vi)  pest control:   the effect of various treatments on the
incidence of insect and rodent damage.
13.       Pulse Trials.   Improved varieties of groundnuts, peas, beans,
lentils, mungbeans and gram would be introduced and evaluated, in collabora-
tion with the USAID-sponsored ARC Pakistan Barani Project. Particular
emphasis would be placed on identifying suitable species and varieties to
be grown as a winter (rabi) crop. A summer (kharif) crop suitable for
interplanting with maize would also be identified. Trials with each of the
introduced varieties would include the treatments described for maize.
14.       Fodder Trials.   Experimental work would include the following:
(i) varieties of winter oats and rye would be introduced and
evaluated for their potential as rabi fodder crops
following maize: fertilizer and cutting treatments
would be tested, and methods of curing and pre-
servation devised in collaboration with the Livestock
Officer (fodder) of the Animal Husbandry Department;
(ii)  other promising fodder crops would be introduced and
evaluated, e.g., turnips, kale, choumoellier, and
vetch;
(iii) each of the pulse crops grown would also be evaluated
in terms of its fodder production potential; and,



lItANl4UAL AJNP'J'
Page 6
(iv)  perennial pasture species would be introduced and
tested on areas under long-term fallow and non-
arable farm areas: in particular, perennial rye-
grass, cocksfoot, phalaris, white clover and vetch
varieties would be tested, as these have shown promise
in nursery trials conducted by the Forestry Department;
low-cost methods of establishing exotic pasture species
into non-arable grasslmnd would be tested.
P*ysical Facilities. Provision is made in the project for the
c,nsPruction of the following physical facilities:
(i) one mile of access road, and two miles of connecting
tracks between sites;
(ii)  a hostel for staff accommodation (1,500 square feet) 1/;
(iii)  ofn office block and store (800 square feet);
(iv)  water supply to the main buildings;
(xl) levelling and terracing as required for the whole
areas;
(vi,  fencing of each site to protect crops from un-
controlled animal grazing;
(vii)  vehicles, including a short wheelbase jeep with
trailer, and two motorcycles;
(viii)  equipment and tools, including soil testing equipment,
scales, sprayers, maize sheller, ox-plows, ridgers,
hand tools and sundry equipment;
(ix)  office furniture and equipment.
16.       Staff Requirements.    The overall experimental program will be
coordinated by an experienced specialist, to be recruited internationally
and assigned to the Department of Agriculture. (See Technical Annex 12).
Each station would be in charge of an Assistant Agronomist, of Grade 17
level, who would also undertake the experimental work in maize and pulse
production. The fodder research would be undertaken by an Agricultural
Assistant (fodder), of Grade 16 level. Three farm overseers (Grade 9)
would be posted to each farm, one assigned notionally to the maize, pulse
1/   Hostel accommodation is provided initially since families of staff
members are expected to continue to reside in the main towns for
schooling and amenities.

and fodder work respectively. Supporting staff would include one junior
clerk (Grade 5) one semi-skilled farm worker ("baildar"), and one watch-
man ("chowkidar"). Job qualifications and descriptions for the senior
staff are attached as Appendix 1.
17.       Technical Services.   Supporting services of soil testing,
entomology and publicity would be provided by the reLevant sections in
the Department of Agriculture. (See Technical Annex 5).
18.       Costs.  A detailed schedule of physical requirements and costs
by years is shown in Table 2. These include capital, staffing and operating
costs covering inputs tillage and travelling expenses.
B.   COOPERATIVE MAIZE PROGRAMI
19.       Background.   Early maize research in Pakistan in the 1960's concen-
trated on the introduction of hybrid maize varieties and the direct transfer
of technology developed in the mid-west of America. Little impact was
achieved with this approach, however, and in the late 1960's, a selection
program was initiated based on a large number of open-pollinated varieties
introduced from tropical and temperate sources. In each province, selection
has narrowed the range to four main populations, each with about four varie-
ties. All are flint varieties with early-maturity, with white maize being
preferred in NWFP, and yellow maize in the Punjab. AK has not so far been
included in this development.
20.       Two Maize and Millet Research Institutes were established by
Provincial Departments of Agriculture in 1971 (one in the Punjab, and one
at Pirsabak in NWFP) to continue the work of introduction and screening of
varieties, and spearhead development of maize, sorghum and millets. The
Agricultural Research Council of Pakistan (ARC) provides technical guidance
for this work and has the responsibility to coordinate commodity research and
production programs. ARC is receiving support for this from USAID and CIMMYT.
The system for development and delivery of production packages is most dev-
eloped in the case of maize and this mainly for irrigated crops. Attention is
now being directed to rainfed (Barani) areas and besides maize, millet and
wheat, other crops including oil seeds and pulses are being included for
development of improved packages under rainfed conditions.
21.       A two-part maize package, which requires no more facilities and
equipment than the average farmer has at his disposal, was developed in
1973. This included (a) High Yielding (HYV) and (b) Package of Agronomic
Practices (POP). The POP included only moderate levels of N and P
(60 and 30 lbs./acre respectively) and insecticides. These packages were
extensively tested in NWFP in 1974 through a series of 285 on-farm veri-
fication trials which were carefully monitored. The regular extension
service staff were used for instituting and following up on the trials
and were motivated through a program of training at the Pirsabak center.
Good responses were obtained from the use of either HYV or POP alone:



TECHNICAL ANNEX 2
Page 8
20% and 25% increases in yields respectively. When both HYV and POP were
used, a 63% yield increase was achieved. Similar trials have been repeated in
1975 and 1976, but an evaluation of these results has not yet been completed
because of difficulties in establishing a confidence level for the data col-
lected; field staff for these later trials were not as closely supervised
as they were for the 1974 trials. However, the ARC and CIMMYT staff re-
sponsible for the program are generally confident that these later trials had
similar results to the 1974 trials.
22.       On the basis of the 1974 results the program was extended to the
provinces of NWFP, Punjab and Sind. ARC formulated a comprehensive Maize
Production Plan for 1976 covering all four provinces, but excluding Azad
Kashmir. To meet the seed demand a program for seed multiplication, using
farmer outgrowers producing seed on one acre blocks, was instituted in
NWFP in the spring of 1975. 1/ The results of these activities are not yet
known.
23.       In summary, whilst the results of the 1974 trials are very encour-
aging, a good deal of verification remains to be done before it can confident-
ly be claimed that packages are available for general extension in the eco-
zones so far addressed by the Maize Program. Maize growing areas in AK are
not generally represented by the eco-zones so far covered by the program and
AK is therefore behind in this development. On the more positive side, what
has been firmly established is (a) a seed base, and, (b) a methodology for
on-farm verification trials. These together with the technical advice and
staff training facilities offered by ARC provide a basis for extending the
Maize Program into AK.
24.       Project Activities.   The project would include in-service training
of field staff, establishment of on-farm verification trials and farmer
out-grower seed multiplication.
25.       Training.   ARC have agreed with the Department of Agriculture to
institute an in-service training program at Pirsabak commencing with eight
technical staff 2/ in the 1977 Spring crop season. These eight staff would
establish trials, during the 1977 summer (kharif) season in the four zones to
be served by the experimental farms under the project. These would provide a
base for the trials program proposed under the project in the 1978 cropping
season.
26.       The project would finance the continuation of the training program
for a further three years, with eight staff undertaking the course each year.
Thereafter this specific training need would be reassessed. It is anticipated
that the eight staff sent for training in year 1 of the project would be
1/   The Pakistan Seed Project (No. 620 PAK) is designed to support sys-
tematic production of certified seed to overcome any bottlenecks
in supply.
21   Four Agricultural Assistants and four Field Assistants were nominated
to attend the 70-day training program.

corprised of four new trainees, and the four most promising of the 1977
trainees who would return for more intensive training. In subsequent year>,
the trainee group is likely to be a mix of new and follow-up trainees,
but the actual composition would be determined by the project management.
Details of the training program are included in Technical Annex 6.
27.       The Grade 16 Agricultural Assistants who have undertaken train-
ing at Pirsabak farm would form a cadre of maize research workers under the
supervisory control of the agricultural specialist. The number of such
staff for the cooperative maize program will be maintained at eight, i.e.,
two for each of the four zones serviced by the experimental/demonstration
farms. These staff would work closely with the staff of these farms, and
assist in the replication of all fertilizer and variety trials on each of
the farm sites (see para. 10 (i)). Additional staff trained at Pirsabak
would be available for redeployment for extension duties as the program
develops packages which can be extended to farmers.
28.       Maize Trials.   The cooperative maize research program would consist
of the following types of trial:
(a) Variety Trials: (conducted by maize research workers,
Grade 16). Each trial would consist of a one-eighth
acre plot on which ten different varieties of maize
would be tested in a randomized block design. Seed
material would be made available by ARC, and would
be chosen on the basis of the performance of the various
varieties under the nearest similar conditions in NWFP.
All varieties will be tested using a standard applica-
tion of fertilizer (60-30-0) and insecticide. 1/
(b) Fertilizer Trials (conducted by maize research workers,
Grade 16). Each trial would consist of a one-eighth
acre plot, using four levels of nitrogen application
and two levels of phosphate in a factorial design.
(c) "Diamond Trials" (conducted by field assistants, Grade 5).
These are simple, unreplicated trials conducted on one-
tenth acre plots, testing a local and a promising improved
variety, each with and without the "best guess" package
of inputs.
1/   Although each trial consists of a plot only 1/8th of an acre in size,
the design of the trial is complex, with many small treatment plots.
Careful plot layout, preparation, treatment, and subsequent controlled
husbandry is required together with intensive recording of observations
and yield.



TECINICAL ANNEX 2
Page 10
29.       Each maize resarch AA would be responsible for conducting five
fertilizer and five varieties trials in each summer season. 1/ In each of
the four zones there would therefore be ten fertilizer trials and ten variety
trials established each year (repeated on the same sites). This would give
a total of 40 fertilizer and 40 variety trials/year for each year of the
project. The sites would be chosen so as to represent as closely as possible
the range of agro-climatic conditions prevailing in the zone, and include
trials at each of the experimental/demonstration farms. These latter may be
part of the total nearly trials or additional, depending on the availability
of staff.
30.       The AAs would also be responsible for training field assistants,
(existing extension staff will be seconded part-time for this duty) in the
conduct of diamond trials. Two field assistants would be trained by each
maize research worker in the first year, and an additional one in each of
the second and third years. There will thus be 4, 6 and 8 field assistants
in each zone for diamond trial establishment in years 1, 2 and 3 of the
project respectively. Each trained field assistant would be provided with
packages of materials for two diamond trials, and instructed to establish
one at a high and one at a low altitude site in his home locality. He will
be provided with data recording sheets and closely supervised in the estab-
lishment of the trials and recording of the results. The total number of
diamond trials established in each zone will be 8, 12 and 16 in years 1, 2
and 3 of the project respectively.
31.       Seed Multiplication.   It is anticipated that arising from the trials
program, there may be a demand for improved seed. Provision has therefore been
made in the project for the establishment of farmer out-grower seed multipli-
cation plots of 50, 240 and 320 acres in years 1, 2 and 3 of the project
respectively. These would be one-acre plots established by interested farmers
under the supervision of the trained field assistants. Support for in-service
training of extension staff to meet these requirements would be provided by
ARC (para. 4). The project would provide all input requirements to the
participating farmer. It is expected the seed would be locally distributed
ex-farm.
32.       Vehicles and Equipment.   Each maize research AA would be provided
with a motorcycle, and a set of field equipment consisting of a spring
balance, simple survey equipment, sprayer, hand tools; and sundry equipment.
He would also have access to the equipment on the experimental/demonstration
farm.
33.       Support Services.   Provision is included for travel and subsistence
costs of ARC, CIMMYT and USAID specialist staff to visit the trials for
providing technical support.
1/   Experience from the maize program in NWFP suggests that this is the
maximum number of trials that can be adequately conducted in one
year by a trained agricultural graduate.

cooperative maize program is shown in Table 3.
C.   FOLLOW-UP EXTENSION
35.       Follow-Up Extension based on ExperimentallDemonstration Farms and
Cooperative Maize Program. The Experimental/Demonstration farms and Maize
Program will generate a need for expanding the extension service to promote
farmer adoption of the improved packages developed in the trials work. The
pace of this expansion will depend on a number of factors, including: the
purely technical aspects of developing improved packages; the social con-
siderations of land holding patterns, (owners, tenants, share croppers);
farmers' confidence in the technologies offered; availability of farm-family
labor and possible readaptation of roles of family members; the complementary
development of support services of credit, input supply and marketing; and,
the physical infrastructure of storage facilities and roads. These aspects
are discussed in Technical Annex 12, in relation to follow-up project prepa-
ration.
36.       In forecasting the need for expansion of the extension source,
the following staff requirements have been anticipated (Annex 6 Table 2):
(i) From year 4 onwards, a graduate would be appointed
at headquarters as Senior Extension Officer, with
responsibility for the overall coordination of the
State's extension sources;
(ii) for each Experimental/Demonstration Farm, two
additional Field Assistants would be required
from the fourth year of its development onwards;
(iii) the primary job functions of the two AAs and three
FAs initially assigned to each Experimental/
Demonstration Farm would change from package
development to extension work as each farm evolved
into an agro-service center. This change is assumed
to take place in year 6 for the purpose of the
analysis, although in practice the change of job
function could occur over a number of years;
(iv) after three years of trial work in each zone under
the Cooperative Maize Program, the maize research
AAs (two per zone) would transfer to other zones
to initiate new series of trials. These would
be replaced in the original zones by other AAs
(also two per zone), whose function would be to
coordinate the extension work of the eight FAs
per zone trained by the maize research AAs. Their
work would not be confined to maize extension alone,



TECHNICAL ANNEX 2
Page 12
but would embrace promotion of all improved
packages and farming systems developed for that
zone.
37.       At full development, therefore, it is envisaged that each zone
would be serviced by five AAs and 13 FAs operating from the Agro-Service
Center.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Pilot Apple Production
Introduction
1.        During project preparation a long-term apple production model over
a 20-year program was developed as a component of the overall lon-term
agricultural development strategy discussed and agreed with the Depprtment
of Agriculture (DOA) (see Annex 1); the model is reproduced at Appendix 1.
It is proposed that the project would finance the first three years of the
model, with some minor modifications which take account of the initial man-
power constraint and which defers some early capital expenditure pending
the findings of a study of the overall market absorptive capacity in relatiux
to the proposed Azad Kashmir apple program and other apple programs elsewhere
in Pakistan (see para 18 below and Appendix 2).
Background to Current Apple Production
2.        There are few data on apple growing regarding area planted to apples,
yields, cultural problems and m.,rketing. Available data is discussed in
Technical Annex 1, para 17. Tentative estimates of some of the main features
of apple production are discussed below.
3.        Area.  Total area presently under apple production is probably around
600 acres. This is mainly composed of small groups of trees with up to as
many as 17,000 farmers growing apples. The main concentration is in the Bagh
tehsil, with smaller areas in Danna, N. Rawalakot, Dhirkot, Banghuin and some
plpnting in Athmuqam and other more remote areas.
4.        Varieties.  There is a wide range, including many of the older
varieties, introduced from the United Kingdom such as Jonathan, Granny Smith,
Worcester Permain, Williams, etc., and local varieties of Kashmir Amri, Kasbmiri
Red, Red Astrachan, etc. In recent years, higher yielding varieties of Golden
Delicious and various Delicious sports, e.g. Starking Delicious, Red Delicious,
etc., have been introduced. Some of the more enterprising growers have lopped
the older low yielding varieties and successfully grafted (albeit in a rough
and ready fashion) the newer varieties onto the old trunks.
5.        Yields.  The DOA's best guess of average yield is 40 lbs/tree which
would be equivalent to a little under 2 tons/acre on a full stocking (110 to
120 trees/acre) basis. This estimate includes all age classes of trees and
probably overstates the present position. However, very high yields can be
and are attained. For example, the mission visited four adjoining apple sites
owned by separate growers at Chamyath (elevation 4,500 ft). These contained
350 trees, equivalent to about three acres and had received considerable
attention from the district horticultural assistant. Production of these
trees had been recorded over the post two years and the h'rvest from heavy
bearing indiridual trees recorded separately.   Recorded yields for 1975 were:



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Page 2
Golden Delicious -  30 trees  10 years from planting.(Maximum tree yield 576 lbs)
60         7 7  it   " 
110   I     5   "     it    if
200 trees  yielding 17,036 lbs
Kashmir Amri - 87 trees (from non-bearing to 10 years old) yielding 6,849 lbs.
maximum tree yield 820 lbs.
Starking Delicious - 63 trees (6 years old, second harvest year) yielding 4,279 lbs.
Total = 350 trees yielding    28,164 lbs.  Average  80 lbs/tree.
6.        All the trees appeared healthy but there was considerable disparity
of tree growth between varieties. Pruning methods vwere generally defective;
there appeared to be little realization that different varieties require
alternAtive pruning procedures for best results. Discussions with the farmers
elicited thpt their estimate of average yields, provided there is no damAging
hail, is:
1st hprvest (fifth year from planting) = 15 seers  X 31 lbs per tree
2nd  "                                 = 29  "    = 60    "   t "i
3rd   it                _               40        = 82       it it
4th    "                               = 62       - a127  t  i "  t
5th    "    onwards                    = 2 maunds = 164 tt II    n
At the expected stocking of 110-120 trees per acre, this would be equal to
1.5, 2.9, 4.0, 6.2 and 8 tons per acre from Year 5 through Year 9 for Golden
Delicious and about 18% less for other varieties. After Year 9, yields of 8 tons/
acre would be expected to continue to about Year 30, when the crop would be
replaced. These yields compare with United Kingdom production for Golden
Delicious using modern planting and cultivated practices of about 0.25 tons/
acre in first year after planting, rising to 15 tons (exceptionally, 20-25 tons)
in the sixth year from planting.
7.        Hail and Frost. The farmers at Chamyath indicated that there was some
hail and minor frost every year, but that only one year in five was damage to
blossom experienced fran hail which caused about a 20% reduction in yield; no
frost damage was reported.
8.        Harvesting and Marketing. At Chamyath harvesting usually commences
mid-September, the main pick (especially for Golden Delicious) being over a
fortnight, last week September/first week October. The majority of the crop
is sold early, the growers delivering to a middleman buying point on a good
"bus route" road; et this point the farmers received PRs 80 per maund (a fraction
under PRs 1 per lb) for Golden Delicious and up to 50% premium for Starking.
Apples stored and sold late, Janusry through March, fetch prices between 30%
and 60% higher (note: these latter prices are somewhat above those prevailing
in Europe ex-farm-gate stores which approximate PRs 125 per maund equivalent.)



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Page 3
Storage methods are similar to those prevalent in Europe in the 1920s but
with somewhat better results. Apples seen in March/April had suffered some
minor skin crinkle, spoiling appearance but flesh quality was remarkably good.
Marketing follows a different system in e.g. Athmuqam, where growers commonly
sell the standing crop on the tree at substantially lcer prices than those
obtained by the Chamyath growers, with the buyer arranging for harvesting.
This would indicate a tighter credit position for farrars in the Athmnuqam
area (see also Technical Annex 1, para 22).
Technical Factors
9.        Nurseries.  The tree nurseries are planted with crab apple root stock
in the autunwthgrafting taking place in the following spring starting in
March. The first grafting is by cleft budding; in May/June the ring buduing
method is used followed by tee budding in August. The seedlings are considered
satisfactory for transplanting one year after the grafting process at which
stage they are considerably smaller and weaker than would be considered suitable
by European fruit farmers. The reasons are poorer (slower growing) root stock
and inattentive nursery management; budget constraints often prevent adequate
weeding and nursery maintenance and limit availability of supervising transport.
10.       Planting.  The smaller than desirable seedlings require a more expensive
plonted-out technique than is caomon elsewhere. Farmers are advised to dig
holes of 0.75 m3 and refill with a mixture of soil and F.Y.M. around the root
structure during planting. Subsequently, they are advised to apply the equiv-
alent of 45-100 units of nitrogen (in the form of urea) annually. The validity
of this advice is doubtful; potash and phosphate applications are more likely
to be beneficial. However, in the absence of any soil testing, firm recom-
mendations are not possible.
11.       Pruning.  Pruning of trees is largely dependent on the farmer who
incorrectly tends to equate density of branches with yield. Technical advisers
are aware of this deficiency in theoretical terms but lack experience; some have
carried out some disastrous pruning demonstrations (based on book reading) and
now lack confidence. The technicians are well-versed in where to prune but
lack the ability to differentiate between varieties that y=iel  on 1st year,
2nd year or 3rd year wood, and hence when to prune; hence correct demonstration
pruning methods have been applied at the wrong time for the variety in question,
with consequent disappointing results and lack of confidence in both the
technician and grower.
12.       Cross Pollination.  Most apple varieties need cross pollination for
the heavy setting crops. However, little attention is paid to this aspect
and where good pollination occurs it is likely to be a matter of luck rather
than design. The Department of Agriculture is promoting beekeeping to improve
pollination and the need for this would be supported when a major planting
program goes ahead. At present, however, with only minor and scattered plantings,



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Page 4
it is doubtful if additional insects will have any marked effect. Of more
importance is the need to plant a few cross pollinators (another variety)
in each small orchard area.
13.       Pests.  There are no reports which indicate pests are a serious
problem at the moment; technicians report ad hoc spraying of small areas for
"apple borer, moths, scab and mildew" when the pests occur. As the terminology
indicates, specific pest species have not been identified. Whether or not
pests are a problem at the mcment, they are likely to prove so in the future
unless specific pest control measures are programmed. During mission travel,
the apple trees were dormant and examination for pests not possible. However,
examination of other fruit trees in foliage and in blossom would indicate that
most pests which attack apple trees are present, although the degree of infestation
is unknown; in any event, specivlist entomological work is necessary for true
identification.
1h.       Over the next two years an attempt should be made to clearly identify
the presence and degree of: Aphids - the four common ones are likely to be:
apple grass aphid (Rhopalosiphum insertum), green apple aphid (Aphis pomi),
rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis mali = D.Plantaginea) and red-leaf aphid (D.Deveota);
Apple Leaf Midge (Da   eura mali) damage is more likely to be importa_ntto
young trees; Apple Sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea); Apple Sucker (Psylla mali):
hatching period extends from bud burst to green cluster stage; Capsid Bugs
apple capis (Plesiocoris rugicollis) may be rare but common green capsid
(Lygooris pabulinus) msy be common; Clouded Drag Moth (Orthosia incerta);
Godling Math (Cydia pomonella), Earwig (Forficula auricular) particularly
prevalent and damaging to Golden Delicious apple trees and fruit; Fruit Tree
Red Spider Mite (Panonychus ulmi); Tortrix Moths, although many species occur
on apple only three are likely to cause damage: fruit tree tortrix (Archips
podana), summer fruit tortrix (Adoxophyes orana), fruitlet mining tortrix
TPammene rhediella); Winter Moth (Operophtera brumata); Woolly Aphid
(Eriosoma lanigerum).
15.       Work is also recommended to identify the possibility of the following
diseases: Blossom Wilt (Sclerotinia laxa); Brown Rot (Sclerotinia fructigena);
Canker (Nectria galli&ena; Collar Rot (Phytophthora cactorum and P.Syringae);
the latter species is also known as fruit rot and causes serious loss of stored
fruit; Fire Blight (Erwinia amylovora), this is highly infectious disease which
requires the generally eradication of diseased plants and stringent hygiene
measures in the vicinity; Gloeosporium Rot (Gloeosporium perennas and G.Album);
Mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha);  and Scab (Venturia inaequalis).   Specific
Apple Replant Disease (SARD) is unlikely, nevertheless soil tests should be
carried out where plantings are intended in areas previously carrying apples
or closely related crops, such as pears.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3

Scope of Proposed Apple Production Program
16.       Although the current inappropriate technical advice, weak organization
and lack of firm data on land areas suitable for apple production, prevent a
firm assessment of the full apple development potential, it is apparent that
apples grow and store well in the state and it should not be too diffficult
to overcome the technical and organizational deficiencies. It is also clear
that substantial areas of land lie within appropriate altitude ranges for apple
growing. The major constraints to the size of future production are likely
therefore to be those associated with marketing. At present data on marketing
prospects are extremely limited; estimates by Federal officials indicate a
large internal absorption capacity, but these estimates are heavily influenced
by present shortages and high city prices. There is also a tendency to stress
the importance of the potential export markets which is yet to be substantiated.
It is possible that additional internal demand may eventually be as high as
80,000 tons per annum. However, this would be dependent on relative price
structures. In considering production fram Azad Kashmir, the likely production
from other areas of Pakistan needs to be taken into account and related to
market outlets.   Notwithstanding these deficiencies in available data, it is
clear thet there is a ready mprket for a modest increase in production from
Azed Kashmir and that a modest planting program may be embarked upon with
confidence. From the pilot scheme, technical and organizational lessons can
be learned which would provide the bpsis for future expansion and during the
pilot scheme period mzrket studies would be completed on which to define the
extent of the program.
Project Activities
17.       The project would follow the bnsic approach outlined in the long-term
model progam (Appendix 1). This would include completing the first three years
of apple planting and laying the foundation for an expanded program, the size
and pace of wnich would be determined during the project period.  The specific
actions under the project would be:
(a) provision for a study of the apple market;
(b)  upgrading of three nurseries at Bagh, Chamyati and Chattar
Kalas to provide better quality stock;
(c) the provision of a nucleus apple promotion service for
assisting small farmers in establishing some 900 acres
of new orchprds in the areas of Bagh, N. Rawalakot,
Danns, Bhirkat and Banghuin, together with the necessary
equipment and minor buildings;
(d) provision of a nucleus headquarters support unit
together with small additional office and storage
facilities and minor hostel-type accommodation for
staff;



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Page 6
(e) the provision of short-term consultancies, both foreign
and from within Pakistan, to (i) provide speciali7ed
technical advice; (ii) provide advice in suitable work
programming techniques; (iii) assist with preparation
of a follow-up project; (iv) provide key material and
advice for in-service staff training; and
(f)  in-service training for Hort.Assts.(2) and Field Assts.
(60). Details of the training are given in Technical
Annex 6.
Detailed Features and Costs
18.       The apple marketing study would provide firm data on which to base
decisions on the most suitable size and phasing of the future apple production
program.  The study would cover all major marketing areas in Pakistan.   It is
envisaged that the study would be carried out in the second year of the project
by a combination of expatriate and local consultants and would involve two
periods of work (August to October and March). Detailed terms of reference
are included in Appendix 2. Estimated costs are PRs 46,000.
19.       The upgrading of nurseries would include the nurseries at Chattar
Kalas, Chamyat and Bagh which require minor supplementary irrigation facilities,
land levelling, minor storage and equipment. To provide better supervision,
an additional horticulturist would be posted to each of these three nurseries
and financed by the project; sufficient junior staff are already provided for
under normal budget for regular nursery operations, The project would also
provide for additional inputs, including improved root stock, for seedling
production on the basis of PRs 0.5/per seedling/per year. The number of
seedlings to be produced would be relpted to the estimated planting program
allowing production of three year old nursery stock at planting density of
120 plants/acre, plus 25% for nursery culling. (See Table I for details).
20.       The nucleus apple promotion service would include the fielding of
an additionsl 20 Field 4ssistants, designated apple promotion technicians
(APTs),each year to a total of 60 in Year 3 and two field posted Grade 16
horticultural assistants (HA) per year to supervise the APTs, giving a ratio
of one HA to each group of 10 APTs; (this ratio is slightly higher than shown
in the model program in Appendix 1, due to initial staff constraints). APTs
would be provided with a small office-cum-store of 300 sq ft and HAs with a
similar building of 500 sq ft. Supplementary building construction, including
housing, would be undertaken in the proposed follow-up project period. Minor
office and technical equipment would be provided together with jeep-type
transport for HAs and motorcycles for 50% of the APTs; the motorcycles are
intended for areas where individual farmer apple plantings are more widely
dispersed.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Pa;e  7
21        The nucleus neadaunrters support unit is designed to control both
nursery work and the field services. In additioi, it would provide an initial
accounting system for farm inputs, monitor and evaluate progress and coordinate
planning for expnnsion of the program in the post project period. Provision
is included for an apple production coordinntor at Deputy Director level
(Grade 18), a planning/monitoring officer (Grade 17), and accountant (Grade 17)
and eight junior support staff members. This staff would be provided with two
jeep-type vehicles and necessary office equipment. The unit would require
office accommodation (700 sq ft), minor storage facilities (600 sq ft) and
pending house construction, hostel type accommodation (3,000 sq ft). The
unit would report to the Project Director through the Director of Agriculture
and would have access to the agricultural support services, see Annex 5 and
support from specialist consultants, see para 22.
22.       Short-term expatriate and local consultancy services would be provided
in four specialized fields covering entomology, apple husbandry practices and
programming, apple tree nursery production, and grading, packing and storage.
Consultants would provide advice on technical issues, assist in implementation
by (i) guiding the work program and (ii) by assisting in specialized procure-
ment (e.g. what type of root stock should be used, where it is available and
how it may be procured); they: would assist in planning of the anticipated
follow-up project and would provide assistance in designing suitable in-service
training systems. Although these consultants are costed within the pilot apple
production component they will in addition assist other aspects of the overall
project, e.g. the entomologist adviser would also be valuable to the state's
overall entomological work. A total of 23 man-months would be provided includ-
ing nine man-months expatriate consultancy. There would be one man-month in
entomology (expatriate) in each of the first two years; four, five and three
man-months in apple husbandry in PY 1, PY 2 and PY 3 respectively, including
four man-months expatriate services; one man-month expatriate services in
nursery work in Years 1 and 2 of the project supplemented by two man-months
in each project year by local consultents    In the third year of the project
provision would be included for one man-month expatriste consultancy to pre-
pare initial plans for grading, packing and storage of apples which would
start to come on-stream during the post-project period. ExpAtriate consultancy
fees have been costed at between us$6,000 and US$7,500 per man-month and local
consultancy at PRs 5,250. Local travel costs and expenses for both types of
consultants are rounded to an average of PRs 7,000 a man-month and expatriate
airfares (nine round-trips) have been costed from Europe- Draft terms of
reference for the consultants are included in Appendix 3.
Summary of Costs
23.       The total cost (January 1977 base figures) of the pilot apple production
program is estimated to be PRs 6.6 million. Details of physical requirements
and costs are contained in Table 1 and summarized below:

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Base Model for a long-term Apple Productiorn Component
Introduction
1.       In the context of Azad Kashmir,a successful apple production program
needs to take into account the very small farmers,most of whcm could not plant
as much as an acre and who would be unable to handle a complete acre in a
single planting either financially or technically. Secondly, a time fr me
needs to be adopted which takes into account build-up of advisory staff,
technical competence, nursery development and planning of future marketing
facilities and phased growth towards market absorptive capacity. With these
factors in mind, it has been proposed that each farmer entering the program
should plant a sixth of his intended acreage during six successive years and
that six successive groups of farmers enter the planting cycle during a six-
year period (a 6 x 6 planting model). As the small farmers use a "'kanall"
(eight kanals = one acre) a single kanal containing 15 trees has been taken
as the basic unit and for model purposes each farmer's target acreage is
taken on 6 kanals (3/4 acre).
2.       On the assumption that market capacity is at least 28,000 tons and
possibly above 40,000 tons and that yields of between 4 and 8 tons per acre
can be expected, the proposed model envisages 5,400 acres with 7,200 growers
(1,200 growers entering the program each year) which infers a gross planting
period of 11 years - 150 acres in first year:rising through 300, 450, 600, 750
to 900 in sixth year, and falling to 750, 600, 450, 300 and 150 acres in the
seventh to eleventh year. In such a model,limited production (220 tons)
would accrue in the fifth/sixth year rising through 882 tons in sixth year,
2,116 tons in seventh year with continually progressively rising increases
through eleventh year and subsequent annual rises (but at a declining rate)
up to year twenty when all trees will be fully mature.
3.       Allowing for the continued production of other fruit trees the present
nurseries could produce the necessary 18,000 first year trees and over project
life gradual expansion could increase capacity (and technology) to 108,000 per
annum; as requirement then gradually falls off, supervisory staff can either
be diverted to marketing problems or full nurseries maintained with a gradual
changing emphasis from apples to other seedlings (e.g. walnuts or mulberry).
4.      Traditional merketing channels and methods (with minor improvements)
would satisfactorily handle production through Year 6 (possibly Year 7) and
no new storage methods would be needed in-situ to Year 8. There would there-
fore be ample time to plan for storage and market logistics during a first
phase which, if successfu, could be followed by the installation of facilities
in the early part of a second phase - such facilities could be planned for
gradual expansion during a third phase and in accordance with the planned
production model (see Table6 5 - which, of course, could be scaled up or
down according to findings during project implementation).

5.       The individual farmer's costs for a kanal are simply computed as
a one-eighth factor of the one acre model (see Table 1, together with note
on base assumptions used). However, as he will be operating a cycle of six
consecutive kanals his cash flow position alters considerably (see Table 2) -
his gross borrowed funds through Year 6 becoming PRs 1,650 and his gross
debts including compound interest, at notional 10%, becaming PRs 2,605 before
he can make full repayments in Years 8 through 10. Table 3 sets out the
investment requirement for a six farmer cycle and Table 4, the implication
of a 5,400 acre program involving 7,200 farmers (both exclude interest
factors).    Table 5 indicates the likely production stream starting in
Year 5 or 6(221 ton's) steadily rising to 42,870 tons by Year 19 or 20 -
full maturity.
Field Services
6.       Farmers entering the program will require technical, logistical and
organizational support on a phqsed basis. It is proposed that, at the local
level, groups of 10 to 30 farmers enter the program simultaneously and that
for model purposes the group is taken as 15 farmers. Apple promotion technicians
(APT) would be field-based at the ratio of one to sixty farmers (four groups)
with 20 such technicians entering the service each year for six years (assum-
ing foregoing production model). Each set of technicians would enter their
own cycle of work parallel with the growing cycle of the farms for which they
are responsible, thus there is the opportunity and time for technicians to
be largely on-job trained. In Year zero, 20 members of existing general
extension service would be given three months training at tree nurseries
(increasing labor availability of the nurseries) in budding, grafting and
planting techniques combined with some classroom training in elementary aspects
of entomology, soil properties and soil sampling, and be given a further three
months short orientation course in farmer approach problems and organizing farmer
groups 1/. In Year 1 their main task would be to identify/assist and select
the sixty farmers in their assigned area and directing them into suitable
groups (at this stage, the groups might be as small as 5 farmers - subse-
quently amalgamating two to four such groups) and establishing some 12 key
farmer contacts; in the latter half of the year they would assist with the
logistics of seedling distribution and physically assist farmers carry out
their plantings. Following which they would return, durina the winter months,
for a slightly more advanced course in entomology of three months, etc. In the
second and subsequent years, the technicians would physically assist farmers with
Dest control measures, g.eneral maintenance aspects and further improve coordi-
nation amongst farmers as groups, during part of the winter months spending
periods in training steadily improving their knowledge of entomology, pruning
pollinption and, later, in grading and organized locally programmed fruit
collection and grading.
7.       Each of the six production areas (potential eventual grading/packing/
storage/dispatch plant service areas) would be placed under the charge of an
area production manager (APM) who would supervise and coordinate all activities
in that area, who would be assisted by horticulturists at the ratio of one
for each six or seven technicians based in the area at any one time; as the
gross plantings in a particular area increases the production manager would
also have the support of an entcmologist and a logistical flow officer in
the third and fourth year respectively.
1/ See Technical Annex 6 which describes the training program for these staff.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Appendix 1

8.        It is proposed thtt six potential production areas (a,b,c,d,e,f)
enter the cycle on the bagis of two in Year 1 and rising to six in Year 5,
and that groups of farmers within an area enter the planting cycle in three
consecutive years; thus assuming, for the model purposes, that all six areas have
equal potential,the field staff build up will be as Table 6. In summary,
total field staff including clerks and drivers would be 30 in Year 1 rising
to 59, 95, 135, 166, 200, 211, 217, 220, 223, 226 and 228 in Years 2 through
12. At full staffing (seven years after initiation) a particular area will
have: 1 area production manager; 3 horticulturists; 20 junior technicians;
1 entomologist; 1 logistics officer; 6 clerks and 6 drivers.
9.        As is the case for junior technicians, the work load on, and technical
ability of senior and intermediate level field staff will be both seasonally
limited and technically increasing during the early stages of the program.
Thus, whilst the staff must have initial academic/experience qualifications
above those of junior staff,they can also receive progressive in-job training
which, it is suggested, be supplemented by short courses by consultant
specialists 1/. The scheduled financial implications of field staff is
set out in Table 7.
Seedling Nurseries
10.       It is not intended that these nurseries be exclusively for apples
(there is a continuing need for other fruit trees at present levels to be
expanded from Year 7 onwards),but apple seedling production from the nurseries
needs to steadily expand relative to other fruits during the first six years.
In a. sense, therefore, these nurseries are treated as an input supply point.
However, the program will support additional staffing of a specialist seedling
production horticulturist at each nursery and additional funds over the five
year period to support increased size of nurseries and their operation,based
on the per apple tree forecast requirements three years hence. After the fifth
year the nurseries would be operationally self-supporting, sales equating
with expenditure. The scheduled/financial implications are set out in
Table 8 and total PRs 936,000.
Grading/Packing/Storage and Dispatch
11.       Apart from minor improvements to be carried out by field staff during
the first six years, it is not anticipated that any substantial investment in
grading, packing and storage facilities will be required until Years 7 through
19. A substantial investment will eventually be necessary if a major plantine
program goes foreward. However, there is a lead time of between five and eight
years before any substantial production returns will come on-stream. Thus,
planning and design can be carried out during a first stage five-year project
and the necessary facilities provided during a second stage project and tentative
capital developinent costs of US$3,522,350 hvm  an included in the cost benefit
stream for these years - the operational co-    a assumed to equate with income.
Thus, first phAse project costs are limited x  i-anning aspects and market
investigation (see headquarters staff below). The internal market absorptive
capacity of Pakistan is largely conjecture at this stage. Present supplies are
clearly only a fraction of demand. Extrapolating fran the situation in India,
1 / See Technicol Annex 6 which describes the training program for these stnff.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page  4
it is possible that additional absorptive capacity exceeds 80,000 tons a
year. However, this guesstimate needs examination and in addition data is
necessary on recent plantings and future intentions in other parts of
Pakistan which, if substantial, could detract from viable production in
Azad Kashmir. The possibilities of long-term exports, e.g. to the Middle
East, have not been explored and could well warrant attention.
Headquarters Support
12.       Under the Director of Agriculture, a Deputy Director (apple production)
will control and coordinate the program. He will be supported by accountancy
staff and a small planning unit supplemented by a consultancy budget for
advisory, planning and in-service staff training purposes (see below and also
section on training). The full staffing and financial implications are set
out in Table 9.
Consultants
13.       Provisions have been mpde in the cost schedules (see Table 9) for
a total of 960 expatriate consultancy days, 630 in the first six years and
330 in the following three years. Consultants will be required to provide
advice, planning assistance 1/ and staff training in five specialized components
associated with fruit production, especially apples, viz:
Ehtanology and pest control          - 5 visits of 30 days each
Fruit husbandry and local logistics - 5 visits of 60, 60, 30, 30 and 30 days
Tree nursery specialization          - 2 visits of 30 days each
Apple mprketing specialist           - 4 visits of 90, 30, 60 and 30 days
Grading/packing/storage specialist   - 5 visits of 30, 90, 90, 90 and 30 days
The expatriate consultants will be supplemented bv cnsultants drawn from
within Pakistan, some of whose visits will partially overlap with those of
the expatriates. These consultants will provide follow through in general terms
and particularly so in the training aspects. Sixteen visits involving 993 days
are anticipated.
14.       Whilst these consultants have to be costed exclusively to the apple
program they will all, as individuals, have a wider knowledge involving other
horticultural products in their specialized fields and some of their time during
each visit will be given to the proposed vegetable production component of the
total project and their work will also have a spin-off effect on the growing
of other fruit trees in Azad Kashmir. Similarly, as their work will partially
overlap that of local consultants, there will be a spin-off benefit to other
areas of Pakistan. It is anticipated that expatriate consultants will be drawn,
in the main, from practical fruit growing firms and fruit processing firms in
Holland, Italy, France or the U.K. Air transport has therefore been calculated
on a R/T basis from Amsterdam.
1/ Planning assistance includes help with implementation schedules and second
phase project preparation.

Buildings and Sitings
Apple Production Technicians
15.       AB each technician enters service under the program he will require
a small complex involving a small house and adjacent pesticide store/office
(first year construction) and subsequently an additional store (3rd year
construction) adequate for pesticide and sprayer sparei sufficient for 45
acres apple trees amongst 60 growers. The siting of which will be centrally
situated amongst the growers.
Horticulturist (field based)
16.       Each horticulturist will require a medium quality house and small
office/store (first year construction) and a pesticide/spare parts store
(3rd year construction) to hold reserve stocks required by technicians. The
siting of which will be central to the six or seven technicians and the 360
to 420 growers for whom he is responsible.
Area Headquarters
17.       Each area headquarters, which should be sited as near as possible
to the anticipated site of an eventual grading/packing/storage station, will
contain houses for the area production manager, entomologist and logistical
officer, a small office complex, a small entomological laboratory (major
work at HQ laboratory) and storage/distribution facilities for the supplies
of pesticides, sprayers and spare parts applicable to the area. Construction
will be on a phased basis according to requirement schedule.
Departmental Headquarters
18.       Availability of suitable accommodation in Muzaffarabad is a serious
constraint to recruiting and retaining good staff. Houses will be constructed
for three of the senior officers. Additional office accommodation is also
necessary.
Clerical, Driver and other junior staff housing
19.       No provision is mtde under this head, a housing allowance included
in the staff salary and allowances structure is consistent with the normal
practice in Azad Kashmir.
Costs and Benefits
20.-      Detailed Tables 2 through 9 have already been referred to; Tables 10
through 12 cover construction costs; and Tables 13 and 14 show farm-rate Drices

INTRODUCTION TO TABLES 13 AND 14
Assumptions Used in Arriving at Farm-gate Apple Values
1.        The eventual ex Azad Kashmir value of apples average PRa 100 per
ma,md (in line with present prices) on assumption of:
22%  early sales                  @ PRs 50   - 11
25%    n   mid-season sales       @ PRs 80      20
25% late    "    "      "         @ PRs 120  -  30
28%    "   sales ex cold storage @ PRs 140   = 39
100
and on assumption that whilst increased volume will to same extent decrease
present prices, increased quality and late sales increases retail price.
Present prices average PRs 80 for early sales and between PRs 130 and PRs 150
for early mid-season sales - most sales are early.
2.        Improved grading, packing and improved non-cold storage system
will hDld apples at good quality through mid-season sales.
3.        Farmer cost ex tree to present pick-up sites average PRs 20 per
maund (labor PRs 4; packing material PRs 6; on-farm storage PRs 1; transport
PRs 11).
4.        When initial small collection stations come on-stream, in isolation,
there will only be marginal benefits, but when these and packing stations come
on-stream they absorb sane of farmers' present costs, at which time the
farmers' cost ex tree to collection station becomes PRs 7 per maund (labor
PRs 4; repeat packing materials PRs 1 and transport PRs 2); a saving to
the farmer of PRs 13 per maund.
5.        Operational costs.a$ small collecting stations is PRs 1.9 per maund
(Prs 51.7 per ton - large stations elsewhere operate at PRs 15 per ton).
6.        Operating costs of packing/storage stations including materials and
transport frao collection stations average PRs 13.1 per maund (Prs 356 per ton).
7.        When cold storage facilities become necessary (in conjunction with
packing stations) the cost of operations is PRs 36 per maund (PRs 980 per ton);
assuming 28% production is cold stored the average cost on gross production
becomes PRs 10.
8.        From the foregoing, Tabler  13 and  14 show the average price per
ton payable by years, i.e. farm-gate prices to be used against gross production
in a particular year.

PAKISTAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Pilot Apple Scheme
Draft Terms of Reference and Estimate Costs
of Market Study for Apples
Background
1.        Apple production is being encouraged in various areas of Pakistan,
e.g., Murree Hills, Punjab; Hazara, NWFP; mid-elevation areas in Azad Kashmir;
and, irrigated orchards in Baluchistan. The results of these programs
are encouraging. Production is being enthusiastically adopted by small
farmers and techniques of apple growing are becoming established with so
far few major problems of pests and diseases being recorded. Whilst prices
are relatively high in the market place (PRs. 7 to 1l/Kg.), apples are well
established as a consumer good and it is confidently expected the market
for fresh apples can be significantly expanded, particularly if the relative
market price decreases. Improved yields would allow for reduced farmgate
prices (presently PRs. 2 to 3 Kg.) and improved marketing systems and larger
volumes could reduce distribution and marketing costs.
2.        A pilot apple scheme is being implemented in Azad Kashmir which is
expected to be the beginning of an apple development program which would
establish some 5,400 acres of apple orchards (with eventual estimated annual
production of 43,000 tons/year) over the next 20 years. Other promotion
schemes of uncertain scale are in operation elsewhere in the country, (para.
1). Besides the income generation to small farmers accruing from apple
growing, a further incentive to encourage this development, which is heavily
subscribed to by government agencies, is the stabilized land use which is
expected to derive from the creation of profitable apple orchards. The estab-
lishment of orchards is being encouraged on steeper land which is unfit for
annual cropping and improved land use systems are expected to develop from
this activity.
3.        However, before finalizing the apple development program in terms
of the area to be developed and the rate of development for Azad Kashmir,
and for the other apple growing areas, a national study is needed to assess
the market demand for the product, indicate the size and location of the
major consuming centers, and relate this information to the apple programs
for the different production areas. The study would also indicate the
possibilities for developing apple processed products; exports of apples
and apple processed products; and, the timing and scope of further studies
which may be needed for these developments.

PAKISTAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Vegetable Seed Production and Pilot Vegetable Scheme
Introduction
1.        Conditions in Azad Kashmir are suitable for the production of many
types of vegetables for which there is a market both within the state and in
Pakistan generally, (see Technical Annex 1). This activity is well suited
to small-farmer participation and a base for expansion already exists.
Estimates of current production indicate there are some 600 acres under
summer vegetable production and 1,430 acres under winter vegetable production
with a total output of around 5,800 tons/year. The Department of Agriculture
operates a 25-acre farm at Chattar Kalas which is presently producing small
quantities of vegetable seed. Production is limited by lack of irrigation
for growing the crops and lack of seed processing equipment.
2.        There are three principal constraints to development; inadequate
availability of reliable seeds, lack of an adequate extension service and
absence of a defined marketing structure. Vegetable seed supply is a common
problem throughout Pakistan with present supplies mainly being obtained from
low quality degenerated seed locally collected and used and small quantities
of high cost imported seed. This deficiency is being partially addressed in
the Pakistan Seed Project (620-PAK) in which the Bank is participating through
the establishment of a small vegetable seeds plant in Baluchistan. However,
production from the Baluchistan plant is not expected to supply more than
about 10% of total demand.
Project Strategy
3.        During the 3-year project, emphasis would be given to developing
solutions to the major constraints with the objective of preparing a sub-
stantial expansion in vegetable production as a component of a follow-up
project. With respect to seed supply, the Chattar Kalas farm would be
upgraded and become the nucleus seed production source for the State and
undertake variety testing and multiplication for improved seed introductions.
A seeds processing plant would be installed to provide an adequate supply
of reliable seed at reasonable cost for farmers in the State, with any
surpluses being available for marketing elsewhere in Pakistan. This would
complement the proposed Baluchistan seeds plant and is well supported by
GOP. An intensive pilot vegetable extension scheme would be implemented
in the Bagh, Hattian and Majira areas to assist farmers in expanding
vegetable production and achieving higher productivity; and also to
develop the present rudimentary system of farmer-outgrowers producing



TECHNICAL ANNEX 4
Page 2
vegetables for seed, which would be processed at the seeds plant. A pre-
liminary study of suitable marketing arrangements for future production of
both vegetable seeds and vegetables would be undertaken. This would provide
a basis for planning production emphasis in the follow-up project with
regard to vegetable types and product mix of fresh vegetables and seeds.
Project Details
4.        Chattar Kalas Seed Farm.   (25 acres).   Because of inadequate water
supply, only about four acres is presently irrigated which is severely limit-
ing seed production. The farm is adjacent to the river Jhelum and a small
irrigation channel (2-1/2 miles) has been partially constructed (see Easement
Notice at Appendix 1), but is not functioning because of the lack of funds to
complete the work. Some small-scale seed processing is presently being under-
taken using primitive methods. There are presently no buildings facilities
nor any seeds processing equipment at the farm and farm equipment is rudi-
mentary.
5.        The project would include:
(a) the renovation of the irrigation channel, (GOAK is
obtaining a detailed survey and design for scrutiny
by the Association before construction), minor land
levelling and improvement and extension of terminal
distribution channels;
(b) the provision of farm equipment for intensive
cultivation and harvesting of the crops;
(c) construction of buildings for,
(i) seed processing plant and store;
(ii) tomato drying shed and an outside seed
drying plinth;
(iii) offices and implement shed.
(d) seeds processing machinery and equipment based on the
design and specifications for the proposed Baluchistan
plant; (it is proposed that this component is reviewed
and finalized by the consultants to the Pakistan Seeds
Project - see para. 7 below);
(e) a lorry, pick-up and office equipment;
(f) operating costs, including salaries, wages and materials
for the farm and seeds plant for the three years.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 4
Page 3
6.        Consultancy Services.   Consultancy services would include the costs
of specialists to assist with:
(i) final design of the seeds plant, preparing
equipment specifications and tender documents
and assisting with bid evaluation, (para 5(d));
(ii) supervision of equipment installation;
(iii) running-in seed plant and initial training;
(iv) market assessment of vegetable seed and fresh
vegetables; development of seed supply planning
and quality control; formulation of marketing
objectives for fresh vegetables; and,
(v) follow-up in-service training in seed procurement,
processing, and market presentation.
7.        Provision is included for one month of consultant's services for
each consultancy. GOP have confirmed that the consulting firm appointed for
the Pakistan Seed project would be suitable to undertake these services.
Draft Terms of Reference for the consultants are contained in Appendix 2. If
possible, the first consultancy ((i) above) should be completed before project
implementation. Consultancies (ii) and (iv) above would be timed for year-1 of
the project, consultancy (iii) in year-I or year-2 and consultancy (v) for
year-2. These arrangements would need to be confirmed with the consultancy
firm.
8.        Pilot Vegetable Production Extension.   Three extension units would
be established, each composed of a Grade 16 Agricultural Assistant (Vege-
tables) supported by three Grade 5 Field Assistants and three skilled farm
workers, with the dual objective of selecting and assisting vegetable seed
outgrowers to augment the supply of seed material for the Chatter Kalas plant
and promoting fresh vegetable production for local consumption and marketing.
9.        Each unit would be equipped with a motorcycle, simple survey
equipment, minor tools and a crop sprayer. Units would be established in
the Bagh, liattian and llajira areas. These areas have been selected for
initial vegetable development because: they already possess nucleus
vegetable growers; are within a reasonable distance of Chattar Kalas for
transport of seed material; are within reasonable distance and have access
roads to vegetable markets; and, are suitable for the production of two or
three crops a year. Mirpur and Bimber have been excluded because they are
too distant from Chattar Kalas for seed supply and supervision during the
initial development phase.
10.       Each unit would establish sub-areas for the three field assist-
ants (FA's), with each FA establishing a number of contact growers; ten in



TECHNICAL ANNEX 4
Page 4
the first year, increasing to 30 in the third year. Contact growers would
produce a minimum of half an acre of vegetables under the detailed super-
vision of the FA and with the physical assistance of the skilled farm worker
during the grower's first year of operations. Thereafter, the grower would
receive intensive follow-up guidance. Contact growers would be expected
to enter into an agreement to establish from 3 to 5 "outreach growers" each,
and transfer to them the technical knowledge and advice they receive from the
extension unit.
11.       The Agricultural Assistant (AA) in charge of an extension unit would
supervise work of the FA's and make periodic visits to "outreach growers", to
monitor progress. He will be responsible for logistical arrangements for
inputs, carrying out local market surveys and develop linkages between the
seed processing plant and farmer seed multipliers. In addition, on selected
farms he will carry out small trials of new vegetable types of varieties.
Management
12.       The operation of the Chattar Kalas farm and seed plant, and coor-
dination of the field extension units, would be under the direct management
of the Farm and Plant Manager (Grade 17), who would be responsible through
the Director of Agriculture to the project director. He would be assisted
by a farm superintendent, a seed processing superintendent and a maintenance
mechanic (all in Grade 16) at the farm, and the three extension AAs, to-
gether with clerical support staff.
Costs
13.       Detailed physical requirements and costs for the 3-year project
are contained in Table I and summarized below:

Preliminary Production Targets and Sales Values
14.       Chattar Kalas Farm.   Initially, 19 main vegetable types have been
identified. These are listed-in Table 4 together with applicable seeding
rates; 13 of these are scheduled for production and processing on the seed
farm at Chattar Kalas. A production schedule for the farm based on Department
of Agriculture data is developed on Table 2; this will require refinement
during implementation. It is based on the concept of advantageously using
winter and summer production seasons and the assumption that not all produc-
tion will be suitable for seed purposes and part of production would therefore
be in fresh vegetable form. The data reveals some anomalies in relative
prices of fresh vegetables and seeds which would require further scrutiny.
For estimating annual production, the predicted yields indicated by the
Department of Agriculture have been used but product prices have been reduced
by 30% to arrive at prudent estimates of sales revenue.
15.       On this basis, the analysis summarized in Table 2, indicates that
at full development, the farm would annually produce 84 tons of fresh vege-
tables and 5.5 tons of seed with a sales value of PRs. 390,000 (US$39,000).
This would be about equal to the operating costs of both the seeds farm and
the seeds plant, with the costs of the latter being mainly attributable to
processing seeds supplied by farmer outgrowers - see para. 17 below.
16.       Farmer Outgrowers.   Estimates indicate that there are currently 600
acres under summer vegetable production and 830 acres under winter production,
with a total annual production of 5,800 tons. Of these areas, it is estimated
that some 390 acres of summer and 600 acres of winter production, presently
producing about 4,100 tons of fresh vegetables, are within economic distance
of the Chattar Kalas farm; these have been selected for the pilot extension
scheme. The scheme would promote improved technology leading to increased
production and offers farmers the opportunity to market part of their crops
for seed, for which they would receive a premium price. An indicative pro-
duction schedule for the scheme is included in Table 3. This envisages an
eventual annual production pattern, of 2,200 tons fresh vegetables and
107 tons of seed equivalent which would more than double present farm incomes
(from all vegetable sales) and at the same time provide the processing plant
with some 94% of its seed material. These estimates are based on crude data
and would be subject to firming up during project development. They do
indicate however, that if farmer outgrower seed production was 50% of the
indicative estimate, results would still show a substantial income gain to
farmers and a sufficient supply to the seeds plant to maintain viability of
the plant.
17.       The combined estimated investment costs, value of sales and operat-
ing costs for the seeds farm and farmer outgrowers (at full production) are
presented in Table 5 which indicates a gross earnings, before interest and
depreciation of some 63% on the basis of the assumptions underlying the
production estimates in Tables 2 and 3. This would be reduced to around
21% if farmers' seed production was 50% of the estimated level. At 10%
reduction in the value of sales would give a result of 36%. These results are

essentially tentative and will require further scrutiny and updating during
the course of preparation of the follow-up project which would be based on
the results obtained during this 3-year developmental period.
Impact of Seed Supply
18.       On the basis of the seeds production scheduled in Tables 2 and 3,
a preliminary analysis has been made of the impact this would have on seed
supply and vegetable production in Pakistan, which is summarized in Table 6.
At full production, the seed plant would be producing annually about 113 tons
seed, which could be sufficient for planting up to 50,000 acres of (combined
summer and winter) vegetables, with an estimated production of fresh vege-
tables of 350,000 tons. Assuming the Baluchistan seeds plant produced seed
at a similar level, the combined production of the two plants could be
equivalent to some 700,000 tons vegetable, equal to about 22 lbs/per capita/
year. In practice, there would be some losses in the transfer of seed to
growers and in crop failures which would significantly reduce these estimates.
19.       The two seed plants would represent the only domestic sources of
selected and improved vegetable seed. If it is assumed that production
from these plants contributed 20% of total sowings (e.g., a quality seed
replacement every five years), this would equate with a total potential
national vegetable production of up to 110 lbs/per capita/year, which is still
a relatively modest consumption level. The analysis demonstrates the need for
promoting vegetable seed production at both the Baluchistan and proposed Azad
Kashmir plants.

A.D.C./Joint Secretary
Food and Agriculture Division
Pak Sectt Block "B", Room 237
Islamabad, Pakistan
Dear Mr. Mumtaz Ali:
I would like to thank you for meeting on January 26 with Messrs.
Zimmer-Vorhaus and Andrew Mercer concerning the vegetable seeds component
which it is proposed to include in the Hill Farming Technical Development
project now being appraised. The component would include:
(a) establishment of a 25-acre vegetable seed farm at
Chattar Kalas to form the base supply for the seeds
plant;
(b) setting up a seeds processing plant on the farm;
(c) a pilot vegetable extension program to:
(i) improve vegetable growing practices generally, and
(ii) enroll farmer out-growers to produce vegetable seed
to supplement the supply from the base farm at Chattar
Kalas. The seeds plant would be designed with capacity
to absorb out-growers' production of seed; and
(d) an examination of the market for seed sales from Azad Kashmir
and assessment of additional facilities which would be needed
for a subsequent expanded vegetable seeds program.
The activities (a), (b) and (d) are broadly parallel to those in the
recent Seed Project assisted by the Bank and would need similar consultancy
advice. Moreover, there is obvious merit in standardizing in machine design
and manufacture to minimize servicing and spare parts problems.
For these reasons it was suggested at the meeting, that the con-
sultants already appointed for the Seeds Project (described in items No. 12
and 13 of Appendix 1, Annex 7 in the Appraisal Report), be asked to review
and refine the proposals for the Azad Kashmir vegetable seeds component to
ensure this is given the benefit of a good basic initial design, and also for
the same consultants to have an input into the Azad Kashmir component, during
the 3-years of the project, which would be combined with their visits in
connection with the Seeds Project.
On the basis of the discussions with you and with the agreement of
the GOAK, the appraisal mission intends to make recommendations



TECHNICAL ANNEX 4
Appendix 2

along these lines to our Bank Management and seek retroactive financing of
the Hill Farming Project, which is expected to be presented in July next to
cover the cost of the initial'appraisal. We would need to formalize the
proposals in preparing the project documents and I would therefore be glad
of your confirmation of the arrangements herein outlined.
With best regards,
Sincerely yours,
Alexander F. Kirk
Resident Representative

PAKISTAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Vegetable Seed Production and Pilot Vegetable Scheme
Draft Terms of Reference for Consultants
1.        The Governments of Pakistan (GOP) would be engaged in a technical
development project in Azad Kashmir which would be partly financed by the
International Development Association (IDA). The project would involve
the development of activities in the agricultural sector in preparation for
a follow-up larger scale project, and would include a vegetable production
component for:
the upgrading of the existing Government of Azad Kashmir
(GOAK) vegetable seed farm at Chattar Kalas (25 acres);
establishment of a vegetable seed processing plant at
the farm (on a similar basis to the proposed Baluchistan
plant), to be operated on a commercial basis by the
Department of Agriculture;
a pilot extension service for developing vegetable
production by small farmers and securing a network of
farmer-outgrowers to augment the supply of seed material
for processing at the plant.
2.        The project is expected to become effective in mid 1977 and would
require the following consultancy services for the vegetable component:-
(a) A vegetable seed processing specialist to assist with

Director of Agriculture.   They would liaise closely with the seed production
and processing staff.
5.        GOP have agreed that the consultants who have been appointed for
the Pakistan Seeds project (620-PAK) would be requested to undertake the con-
sultancies herein described as an addition to their work program. Consultancy
fees have been calculated on a similar basis to the Seeds Project; air travel
fares have not been included as it is assumed these would be absorbed by the
Seeds Project. (See Table 1).



TECHNICAL ANNEX 5

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Support Services
A.   SOIL TESTING AND FOLIAGE ANALYSIS
1.        There is an almost complete lack of data covering soils.   Without
this information, it is not possible to develop economic production packages
to extend to farmers. The present staff of the soil laboratory includes a
soils chemist and two laboratory assistants who are competent to carry jut the
necessary work, but are handicapped by lack of equipment. Provision is
included for equipping the laboratory to undertake a program of sampling in
areas selected for early implementation of developed packages. The field
sampling will be coordinated by the land use planning section of the project
and results incorporated in the land use development plans.
2.        Areas to be sampled will include:-
(a) Experimental/Demonstration farms and adjacent areas
including cooperative maize program trials.
(b) Apple growing areas.
(c) Vegetable seeds farm and vegetable extension areas.
(d) Spot sampling at different altitudes in other zones
of the state.
(e) Other sampling as indicated by production programs
being developed by the project.
3.        The program would include 1,000 full analyses and 1,500 partial
analyses a year, giving some 7,500 samples during the 3-year program. On
this basis, detailed soils/nutrient maps would be produced for specific areas
selected for development; these samples would be additional to the indicative
samples to be taken by field kits. All sampling would be recorded on data
sheets indicating sample code number and date and include:
(i) Location (latitude, longitude, altitude, local name).
(ii) Topography and aspect.
(iii) Vegetation type, with details of cropping history
of soil for past three years.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 5
Page 2
(iv) Land use.
(v) Climatic data with indication of nearness of source.
(vi) Visual description of soil profile including depth
and color of main horizons, down to underlying strata
where possible.
(vii) Mechanical analysis by sedimentation to estimate
proportions of sand, silt and clay.
(viii)  Chemical analysis of soil to determine pH, organic
content, and content of N, OP, K, Mg and Ca.
Full samples, would, in addition, include chemical analysis of foliage and
analyses for trace element deficiencies.
4.        A schedule of additional equipment items and cost is contained in
Appendix 1. A short-wheel base 4WD vehicle, vehicle running costs and
laboratory operating costs are also included; these are detailed in Table 1.
B.   METEOROLOGY
1.        Basic climatic data is also lacking.    The Department of Agriculture
has undertaken to compile data through field staff. Provision is therefore
included for equipping all stations with rain gauges and thermometers and,
in addition, providing barometers for main stations. Some altimeters have
also been included to enable the survey section to accurately record eleva-
tions at the various weather stations.
2.        Regular monthly weather statistics will be reported to the Land Use
Planning Section (and be available for the national meteorological service).
3.        Details of equipment and costs are contained in Table 1.
C.   ENTOMOLOGY
1.        The existing laboratory facilities are available for conducting in-
vestigations to provide back-stopping of the project activities. However,
these are not fully utilized because there is presently no post of
Entomologist.
2.        Provision is included for an entomologist to be paid for by the
project.  GOAK have given verbal assurance the post will be created, but
will need to formalize this decision.
3.        Costs are summarized in Table 1, which include a contingency
provision of PRs. 20,000 for ancillary equipment.    The job description and
qualifications for the post included in Appendix 2.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 5
Page 3
D.   PUBLICITY
1.        There is a need to improve the flow of technical information to all
staff, which would become increasingly important as the results of the ex-
perimental activities become available. A publicity officer is already in
post but the department is lacking finance to properly use his services.
2.        Provision is included for the monthly printing of pamphlets pri-
marily to keep all staff posted with best practice techniques being developed
and to indicate priorities in the allocation of work emphasis.
3.        Costs are summarized in Table 1.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Training
A. INTRODUCTION
10        The shortage of trained imanpower in agriculture is a serious constraint
to agricultural development in the State. Trained personnel are confined to
government employment, as there are no large scale farm enterprises to employ
such staff, and the injection of improved technologies into the farming systems
will need to be undertaken by the Department of Agriculture (DOA). The DOA
presently employ 59 staff in the graduate grades (16 and above) and 123 technical
certificate-level staff-in Grades 5 and 9 (Table 1). However, a significant
proportion of graduate graded staff are non-graduates. On the basis of present
staff employed, there is a density of one graduate officer per 8,500 acres of
cultivated land. In the context of the diverse and scattered nature of the farm
land, this is inadequate for effective development activities even assuming all
staff were fully trained.
2.        The State has an Agricultural Training Institute located in Muzaffarabad.
This became functional in 1976 and has a graduate staff consisting of a principal,
a senior instructor and two junior instructors, and facilities for twenty students,
A first priority in training is to operate a series of refresher courses for
existing certificate-level staff. There will also be an urgent need under the
project (para. 18 below) for specialist three-month short courses for apple techni-
cians. These training requirements would fully use the capacity of the institute
during the three-year project period. Formal training for both certificate and
graduate new entrants would therefore continue to be obtained from other institutes
during this period. The future role of Muzaffarabad institute in contributing to
training needs would be assessed during the project (See Technical Annex 12).
3.        At present, Azad Kashmir has quotas for entry of graduate and certificate-
level trainees at Iyallpur and Peshawar Universities, as follows:
Iyallpur             Peshawar
2-year certificate course 1/               10 students/year     10 students/year
2-year FOS.C. (AgricultureT course
leading to 3-year B.Sc.(Ag.) course        5 students/year      5 students/year
The stream of 10 matriculants entering the F.S.Co (Agriculture) course and sub-
sequently taking the 3-year B,Sc.(Ag.) course results in a net intake of only
approximately 4 graduate appointments per year to the DOA, which serves only to
replace losses through natural attrition of existing staff. The present high
student "dropout" rate is a result of a number of factors, including:
(i) selection for filling of quotas is not solely based on residence
criteria; non-resident applicants who can give evidence of past
1/   Entry at matriculation level.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 6
Page 2
familial residence in Azad Kashmir are also eligible and
these seek employment outside Azad Kashmir;
(ii)  not all students filling the quotas are nominated by the DOA
and these also have no obligation to return to Azad Kashmir for
employment; and
(iii)  no undertaking to return to work in Azad Kashmir is required of
the students who are sponsored by DOA.
40        Direct recruitment of trained staff to fill posts cannot be relied
upon as a long-term solution because there is strong competition in other pro-
vinces for trained staff, and non-Azad Kashmiri people would prefer to work and
live in other provinces where conditions are more amenable, Moreover, the
farming conditions in Azad Kashmir are unlike those in most parts of Pakistan
so that experience gained there is of limited value elsewhere. What is needed
is a cadre of trained staff with this special background who have personal
reasons for living in the area and career prospects which will induce them to
apply their training and experience to the special problems of agricultural
development in the State.
B.   ANALYSIS OF MANFOWER REQUIREMENTS
5.        Table 2 summarizes the proposed development activities in agriculture
during the project period, and the anticipated project-related activities for a
further five-year period, DOA's manpower requirements and anticipated sources are
analysed in detail for the three years of the proposed project in Tables 3 and 4,
and indicative manpower analyses for an eight-year period are shown in Tables 5 and
60
6.        The project activities would create a demand for 41 graduate staff and
84 certificate-level staff by year 3 (Tables 3 and 4). In addition, certificate-
level staff from the general extension staff assigned part-time to the project
would total 32 by Year 3 (Table 4). This would place a severe strain on the
present staff complement and would require some reassignment of present staff and
also direct recruitment of personnel from other provinces to fill posts created
by the project. The analyses indicate the following levels of reassignment and
direct recruitment of staff:
Graduates                 Certificate-Level
Reassigned   Recruited        Reassigned    Recruited
Year 1                         16         16                 16            18
Year 2                          -           7                  7           23
Year 3                          -          2                  -           20
16         25                 23           61
7.        The longer-term analyses of manpower requirements (Tables 5 and 6)
anticipate the total departmental needs over an eight-year period. The peak
incremental demand for both graduate and certificate-level staff would occur in
Year 4, during which 28 new graduate and 5h new certificate-level appointments
would be required (before allowing for natural staff attrition). By the end of



TECHNICAL ANNEX 6
Page 3
the eight year period, the annual incremental requirement would have reduced
to four graduates and ten certificate-level staff.
8.        The analyses indicate that in the eighth year after project initiation
(FY 1984), the total DOA technical staff strength would be 149 graduate (G) and
336 certificate-level (C) staff, i.e. a ratio (G:C) of 1 : 2.6; broken down by
function, the G:C ratios would be as follows:
Administration and support services               1:0.31
Technical package development  1/                 1:1.07
Horticulture                                      1 3.1
Vegetables  2/                                    1:1.86
General extension                                 1:3.59
9,        The overall density of graduate staff in the State in FY 984 would
be one graduate officer per 3,400 acres of cultivated land (compared to one
per 8,500 acres at present, para. 1).  This would represent a considerable
improvement in graduate staff density, and should enable the complex agricultural
problems facing the State to be more adequately addressed.
C.   TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR STAFF EXPANSION
100       Anticipating the future staff needs outlined in paragraph 7, the pro-
posed project would finance scholarships for training at both certificate and
graduate-level as follows:
(i)  Certificate level. Agreement has been obtained with Lyallpur
university to increase the intake of students for the 2-year
certificate courses from 10 to 15 students per year. This
agreement is subject to overcoming constraints on hostel accomo-
dation (see para. 12). It is also expected that an additional
5 places can be secured in the Agricultural Institute at Peshawar.
Thus a total of 30 scholarships per year would be provided, which
would generate a stream of certificate trained staff from year 3
onwards;
(ii) F.S.C. (Agriculture) level. The existing intake quota of five
students per year per university cannot be readily increased, as
this course represents a bottleneck in the agricultural education
system, and the quotas are politically determined. The project
would, however, continue the existing stream of students entering
Lyallpur and Peshawar universities at this level, except that full
scholarships would be provided, and a bonding agreement would be
required from scholarship recipients. Trainees enter the 2-year
F.S.C. (Agriculture) course at matriculation level, and proceed
thereafter to enter the 3-year BoSc. (Ag.) course. Thus, five
years is required for students entering F.S.C. (Agriculture) to
graduate with B.Sc.(Ag.);
1/   Experimental/demonstration farms and cooperative maize program (both in
trials phase).
2/   The G:C ratio for vegetable extension is low because graduate staff would
deal extensively with "contact farmers" who are not certificate-level.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 6
Page h
(iii) B.Sc. (Agriculture) level. In view of the projected high
incremental demand for agricultural graduates in the early
years of a possible follow-up project (Table 2), a scheme to
enable the shortening of the lag-time inherent in the usual
5-year training period (see(ii) above) was suggested by the
Vice-Chancellor of Lyallpur University.  This involves the
recruitment of F.S.C. "pre-medical" students 1/ and subjecting
them to a 1-semester "remedial" course in maths, extra botany,
agrononrW, and introductory horticulture, prior to their entering
the 3-year B3.Sc. (Ago) course. Students thus trained would there-
fore require 3A years to obtain B.Sc. (Ag.).
11.       To match the number of B.Sc. (Agriculture) scholarships with the
anticipated staff requirements, the University of Lyallpur has indicated their
agreement to accommodating a "special batch" of 30 F.S.C. "pre-medical" students
to begin study in October 1977 (subject to overcoming hostel accommodation
constraints; see para. 12). They would thus be able to graduate in March 1981.
This "special batch" would be followed in subsequent years by a regular stream of
10 students entering each year on a similar basis. The Vice Chancellor has offered
the university's assistance to the Azad Kashmir government (GOAK) in the selection
(and pre-examination) of scholarship recipients. Detailed arrangements would be
made during follow up discussions between GOAK and university representatives.
12.       To overcome the constraint of limited on-campus hostel accommodation,
the Vice-Chancellor of Lyallpur University has suggested that a hostel could be
constructed utilizing a loan borrowed from a local bank. The loan could be
serviced from the project-financed scholarships, provided realistic hostel accom-
modation fees were included in the scholarships for direct payment to the
University. He estimated such a realistic fee at Rs 3,600 per year per student
for graduate course trainees, and Rs 2,400 per year per student for certificate
trainees. 2/
130       the Vice-Chanmellor of IXallpur University also provided estimates of
tuition and subsidtm*intasts for both degree and certificate oorases. On the
basis of these estimates, the following allocations per student per year are
proposed for project-financed scholarships:
Degree Course   Certificate Course
"Capitation fee" 3/                           Rs 4I,ooo         Rs 3,000
Registration and tuition fee 4/                    190                130
Hostel accommodation fee                         3,600              2,400
Subsistence allowance                            2,400              21400
Rs 1__19           Rs7,
1/ i.e. graduates of F.S.C. (Science); a 2-year course with zoology and some botany.
There is an abundant supply of such students, who have been unsuccessful in
gaining one of a very restricted number of seats in medical schools. F.S.CO
"pre-engineering" students would also be eligible, although would require more
remedial training prior to B.Sc. (Ag.) than FeSoCe "pre-medical".
2/ Assuming two and three students accommodated per hostel room respectively0
3/ University teaching expenses expressed on a per capita (student) basis.
IjI Nominal fees only.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 6
Page 5
These unit costs have been used in the estimation of the costs of the agricultural
training component of the project (Table 7).
14.       Tables 5 and 6 also analyze the anticipated impact of these special
training programs at graduate and certificate-level on the projected departmental
staff requirements. After taking account of likely "dropout" losses from students
already in training and those provided scholarships and also allowing for an
annual 5% rate of natural staff attrition, the analysis indicates the likely required
number of direct recruitments from outside the State. It indicates that after
the initial high requirement for direct recruitment of staff during the three years
of the project, the necessary number of direct recruitments at the graduate level
falls to only approximately two ,per year.
15.       The projected requirement for direct recruitment of certificate-level
staff, however, remains at approximately twenty per year during the five years
following the proposed project. The decision as to how best to meet this antici-
pated demand in the future would be made by the Project Manager in consultation
with the Director of Agriculture, after assessing in the first two years of the
project the experience of direct recruitment of certificate-level staff vs. the
provision of scholarships. A third alternative to be considered during project
preparation would be the use of the Agricultural Training Institute in Mhzaffarabad
to provide the requisite numbers of certificate-level staff for a follow-up
project.
D.   IN-SERVICE TRAINING PROGRAMS
16.       The project would also finance a number of in-service training activities
to upgrade the technical expertise of existing DOA staff. These would include
short courses in maize research, horticulture, vegetable seed processing, and
seed plant mechanics. The coats of the various types of in-service training
programs proposed are summarized in Table 7.
17.       Maize Research Training. Technical Annex 2, paras. 25 and 26 outline
the 70-day tai    g program for maize research workers which has already been
initiated for the 1977 crop season. The NWFP Maize and Millet Research Institute,
located at Pirsabak, has agreed to absorb eight trainees each year for training
in maize research techniques. The training, which would be focused on the spring
crop season at Pirsabak farm, would be divided into two phases: February/March
(coinciding with the spring planting) and May/June (coinciding with the harvest
of the spring crop)0 The intervening period would allow trainees to return to
Azad Kashmir for the maize planting period to establish the maize variety and
fertilizer trials and train field assistants in the establishment of diamond trials.
The trainees would return for the second training period in May/June, and still be
in post in Azad Kashmir for the major part of the growing period and the entire
harvest period of the Azad Kashmir crop, Costs per student for each 70-day train-
ing program (to cover a per diem plus travel) are estimated at Rs. 2,500 (Table 7).
18.       Apple Technician's Tnrining0  The present Agricultural Training Institute
in Muzaffarabad has been operative since 1976, and has a capacity for 20 students
(see Technical Annex 1, para 38), It is proposed that this institute concentrates
initially on providing refresher courses for general field staff, and later
providing in addition specialist short-term courses for technical graduates.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 6
Page 6
During the three years of the proposed project, emphasis would be placed on
providing 6-month courses for the apple technicians (Grade 5 level) engaged
in the pilot apple program. Twenty apple technicians each year would receive
an initial 6-month course, and would return each subsequent year for a 3-month
repeater course0 The Institute is adequately staffed at present, and staff are
suitably qualified, to provide these courses during the project period.
Training costs (including subsistence) are estimated at p 400 per man-month
(Table 7)0
190       Short Courses in Fruit Production0  Provision is made under the
proposed project for four horticultural assistants to undertake a special six-
month course in fruit production at an appropriate institution in one of the
four provinces. This would prepare these Grade 16 officers for their initial
roles as field-based horticultural assistants, from whom area production managers
would be selected in the later years of the proposed pilot apple scheme. (See
Technical Annex 3)0 Arrangements for these courses would be made by the project
manager and would be phased (2 courses per year in years 1 and 2) to meet the
requirement for trained horticultural assistants in the field0 The cost of each
six-month course is estimated at' Rp6,O000 (Table 7).
20.       Short Course in Seed Plant Operation.   To prepare the maintenance
mechanic (Grade 16) for the task of operating and maintaining the vegetable seed
processing equipment proposed for installation at Chattar Kalas farm, the project
manager would arrange for him six-months in-service training in Pakistan0 This
training would resemble a special apprenticeship, during which the mechanic would
work at an established seed processing plant, and would be involved in the
operation and maintenance of machinery similar to that proposed under the project0
The cost of the course is estimated at Rp0 6,000 (Table 7).
210       Overseas Course in Vegetable Seed Processing. The vegetable seed farm
and plant manager (Grade 17) would be sent to Europe or the United Kingdom for
six months, to enable him to gain practical experience in all aspects of the
management of a small vegetable seed industry, including methods of identifying
and supporting "outgrowers". The place of study would be carefully chosen to
represent as closely as possible the scale and 'operating conditions of the pro-
posed seed farm and processing plant in Azad Kashmir. Arrangements for the
course would be made by the Project Mnager0 The cost of the course, including
air travel and subsistence, is estimated at Rp. 60,000 (Table 7).

The Agriculture Department would recruit new personnel to fill critical staffing gaps in the regular program, consequent upon posLtng experienced staff to the project.
The number of such critical gaps thus caused may be fewer than the 9 staff shown to be reassigned and financed by the project, since some former positions could be filled
by lower-grade staff functioning with "special charges".    The 7 staff reassigned to participate in project activities but not financed by the project (training and soil
8/   New graduate appointments during the project years would be made by direct recruitment on a short-term or permanent basis.

1/   Derived from Table 1. "Certificste-level" staff defined as Grades 5 and 9 technical staff for which certificate training is required (e.g. "budders" were excluded
because certificate training is not n-eess*ry for this function); at present, not all staff requiring certificate training possess certificates.
2/   FY - Fiscal year (July I - June 30): FY1977, FY1978, PY1979 assumed to correspond to years 1, 2 and 3 of the project respectively.
3/   Staffing of "regular program" derived as a residual number, by extrapolating present staff numbers in each function less those reassigned to project activities.
4/   F = salary to be financed by project.   NF   salary not financed by project, but staff to participate in specific project activities.
5/   Staff for the experimental/demonstration farm trials are assumed to be drawn from the general extension staff (with the exception of the first year, see footnote 6
below), which is thus proportionately depleted in the regular program,and increased as extension packages become available from the Experimental Farms/Maize Program.
6/   Four certificate-level staff (shown in Table I under "General Extension") were reassigned to training for the Cooperative Maize Program Ln early 1977. These are
assumed to be utilized on the experimental/de=onstration farms under the project, and their places in the Cooperative Maize Program taken by graduate staff trained
for the purpose in early 1978.
7/ ( ) denotes part-time participation only: staff drawn from general extension staff, and enumerated within that function.
8/   Derived as follows: "NF" staff are reassignments, by definition; "F" staff reassigned - staff in regular/existing program in previous year, less staff in regular
program, less incremental "NF" staff.
The Agriculture Department would recruit/reassign personnel to fill critical staffing gaps in the regular progrm, consequent upon posting experienced staff to the
project.  The staff reassigned to participate in project activities (shown under "'Nfor apple nurseries) would not require replacoments.

4/   On the average only 4 graduating students per year return to Azad Kashmir at present, although the State is assigned 10 seats in the quota (i.e. a student "dropout rate" of 60'%.
It is assumed that an additional two per year will be attracted as a result of project activLties.                                                                                         a

7/ From year 4 onwards, the agricultural specialist's functions would be taken over by two senior graduates: one as Senior Agricultural Research Officer and one as Senior Agricul-
tural Extension Officer.
8/   In theory there would be a surplus of 7 graduates in 1984. In practice this is unlikely to occur because the 5-year course for matriculants is expected to bc phased out in the
next few years. ,

Forest Areas
1.         The classified forest areas are recorded as 1.4 million acres,
ecual to about 48% of the total land area. More than half of this area
is treeless and includes high altitude (over 7,000 ft) range land in the
Neelum Valley used for seasonal grazing, large areas of precipitous
mountains twith broken and rocky surfaces which are essentially unworkable
watershed protection areas, and extensive areas of rocky slopeland with
sparse grass/bush cover which have been dowmgraded over time by en.croach-
ment for agriculture, unauthorized fellings, widespread grazing and fuel
gathering which has inhibited natural regeneration of the former indigenous
forests.
2.         Productive (com.ercial) forests are recorded as extending to some
420,000 acres conposed of 150,000 acres Chir Pine (?inus rcxburghii) nainly
in the Nirrur and Kotli divisions in the center south; 110,000 acres of
Blue Pine (?. wallichiana), 100,C00 acres of Fir and Spruce (Abies pindrow
and Picea smithiana) and 53,000 Of Deodar (Cedrus deodara), mainly in the
Keran ard Sharda divisions in the Neelum Valley.    These recorded areas over-
state the net areas for cormercial timber production and conceal the high
variability in stocking densities of the forest. Complete canopy fully
stocked forests are rore and mainly occur in the higher altitude remrote
areas of the Neelum. Valley; the latest working plan for these forests
(1975-1984) indicates a net productive area (conmercial + local remuirements)
of' -06,000 acres of Blue line, Fir, Spruce and Deodar, from a gross coim'erciAl
area of 162,000 acres.   Similarly, cormercial exploitation cf the Chir Pin.e
forests in the Mirpur and Kotli divisions is limited to a lesser area than
the recorded 150,000 acres because of low stocking densities over much of
the area. Exploitation operations in the productive forests in the remaining
territorial divisions of Huzaffprabad, Jhelum. Valley, Bagh and Rawalkot are
presently almost wholly restricted to the supvly of local requirements for
house construction with no significant coTmmercial. operations taking place.
The recorded forest areas are su*mnarized in Table 1.
Forest Dvnership
3.        Apart from about 112 of the total forest area which is privately
owned, all forests are classified as "Designated Forests" and are burdened
wi't rights and concessions.   Forest boundaries are subject to a 40-year
review when the forest staff and lecal interest groups present their cases
in the 'ccal court for bcuandary revisicns vi the light of changing land use
over the preceding years.   In scme areas, e.g., Pccnch district, identifica-
ticn of forest boundaries on the ground is still a problem (althouah these
are recorded on the land revenue maps), and is a specific activity In the

and litigation.
4.        Rights over the forests include:
a. Construction Timber
(i)    Free issue of trees to victims of floods,
landslides, etc.
(ii)   Persons residing within three miles of forest
boundary, a concessionary issue of trees for
house construction and repair at 1/16th of a
standard stumpage rate set by goverrment for
sales to gorernment departments, army, con-
tractors undertaking government work and persons
living outside concession areas. In many dis-
tricts, the concession is further increased by
limiting payment to a nominal price per tree,
e.g., PRs 5/tree in Sharda Division and PRs 10/
tree in Keran Division, regardless of the standard
rate.
(iii)  Persons living within 3 to 5 miles of forest
boundary, concessionary issue for house con-
struction and repair at one-quarter of the
standard rate.
(iv)   All other residents, concessionary issue for
house construction at the standard rate, which
is currently about 50% of the full market rate.
(v)    Government departments and army also obtain their
timber requirements at the stand&rd rate. The
total quantity of recorded concessionary isFues
of construction wood trees over the past five
years is estimated to be one million ft3/year,
equal to 30% to 40% of total log production.   The
data indicates a substantial increase in conces-
sionary issues in 1973/74 to some two million ft3.
There is general concensus among senior forestry
staff that, in addition to recorded issues, a
significant but unqullantified volume is stolen.
b.  Fuelwood
Local neople are entitled to remove deadwood, branchwcod
and non-commercial spezies without payment, except in
areas declared under enabling legislation by the Forest
Department to be closed for rehabilitation purposes;



TECHNICAL ANNEX 
Page 3
closed areas cannot exceed more than 25% of a forest
block at any time and in practice are well below this
maximum. The widest interpretation is given to the
expression of this right and virtually all trees with-
in several miles radius of habitations are debranched.
In many places, debranching has reached the stage
where only the top 10% to 200 of the crown remains and
outright topping of trees also occurs with consequent
death of the tree. Another practice which occurs in the
Chir pine areas is the removal of thin verticle slices
of the bole of the tree at stump level which is used like
a candle for home lighting. These practices are
significantly depleting the value of the forest
resource, both in absolute terms in the volume lost by
slowsing down tree growth rate and eventually killing some
of the crop and also in the quality of lumber which is
subsequently produced from the surviving trees because of
the large proportion of loose dead knots occurring in the
timber as a result of leaving 6" to 12" stumps at the
bases of the branches removed for fuelwood. Ground vege-
tation, including shrubs and tree coppice growth is
regularly cut over and natural regeneration of the domi-
nant established species is not possible unless effective
closure of the area is secured. Roadside avenue trees
are similarly molested, and in the Mirpur district, for
example, the several miles of avenue trees observed were
uniformly being hacked to death with a large proportion
already completely removed.
c. Grazing
In general, the right of grazing is exercised without any
control and extends to nomadic people who enter from Punjab
and NWFP to herd their livestock in the alpine rangeland
during the summer season. The exceptions are the limited
number of closed areas; which in terms of area, have only a
token affect, and are subject to considerable disregard. A
recent attempt by the FD to introduce limited controlled
grazing coupled with pasture improvement in the alpine
rangeland was thwarted by local opposition and lack of
political support to press home the ultimate advantages to
be gained through systematic control. Wiidespread grazing in
the treed forest areas is a further severe constraint on
natural regeneration of the forests. In the non-treed areas,
uncontrolled grazing has resulted in an overall erosion
problem which varies between moderate to very severe.
d.  Fodder collection, brush for roof heat insulation, grasses
and sapplings for plaiting and basket wcrk, and other minor
products are also freely gathered as a right.



Page 4
5         The exercise of rights and the concessionary issues of timber
which have become institutionalized, effectively limit the role of the FD,
as the agency of government, in the exercise of management of the forest
and has resulted in a situation in which the department is in open conflict
with an alarmingly high proportion of the pcpulation. It is reported that
there are currently more than 50,000 cases of forest offenses pending in
the courts, which could amount to about one family in five being involved
in a reported forest offense. The FD have on the staff a fulltime super-
intendent of police and three fulltime magistrates especially for forest
offenses. This is in addition to the magisterial authority of the more
senior forest officers who are competent to impose sanctions for most forest
offenses and widely exercise this powier. It is difficult to establish the
extent to which FD staff devote their time to the administering of legiti-
mate rights and the pursuit of law breakers, but this is likely to be more
than half of their total work load, and severely limits their availability
for technical management and development of the forest resource.
6.         Two firm impressions arise from a consideration of the present
ownership pattern:
a. Under the present system, widespread degradation of the
forest resource is taking place in the loss of timber,
quality of the timber, and erosion of the treeless areas.
b. FD staff are not able to approach the full exercise of
their talents as a technical agency of government to
manage and develop the forest resource.
Forest Production
7.        The main products are timber for domestic requirements within Azad
Kashmir for house building and other construction and for supply to the
Pakistan market, firewood for local consumption, resin and a small quantity
of Kuth, a product from the root of the shrub Saussurea Lapna used in the
preparation of medicines and incense. A limited amount of walnut wood
(Juglans regia) is harvested from private farmland and used in the local
carving and furniture making industries; the volume involved is reportedly
a few thousand cubic feet/year and stocks are insufficient to support any
increase in the annual harvestable volume.
Timber Production
8.        Recorded timber production for both local consumption timber and
ccmmercial sales is summarized in Table 2. The data indicates that realized
commercial sales have averaged about 2 million ft3/year over the past four
years whereas concessionary sales for local consumption have increased frcm
850,000 ft3/year to around 2 million ft3/year during the same period (the
latter volume needs rechecking).



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 5
9.        The Azad Kashmir Logging and Sawmill Corporation (AKIAS) was
established by the government as a subsidiary of the Azad Kashmir Mineral
and Industrial Development Corporation in 1972 with the objective of phasing
out private contractors and AKLAS undertaking all commercial logging and
sawmilling operations with the concessionary issues for local consumption
continuing to be managed by the FLD. Since then, no further private sales
agreements have been entered into and private sector operations are now
limited to completing the remnants of the earlier concessions and sub-
contracting to AKLAS and the FD for logging operations only. This change
from private to public sector operations has resulted in a haitus in the
flow of logs and timber to the market. The intention was to process the
entire annual production of commercial logs of about 3 million ft3 in the
Mirpur sawmill operated by AKLAS (except for small dimension logs of 8"
diameter and below sold as roundwood and poles). Achieved performance of
AKLAS's logging and sawmilling operations has been between 600,000 and
800,000 ft3/year. The accumulated shortfall,which amounts to about 5 million
ft3, is represented by a growing inventory of standing timber which has been
marked for and awaits logging and marketing by AKLAS. This bottleneck in
the flow of timber has also significantly reduced the revenue from stumpage
income to government (see Table 3).
Resin
10.       In the Mirpur and Kotli Divisions, resin is produced by tapping
Chir pine (Pinus roxburghii). This is a seasonal operation from spring to
autumn employing around 1,000 local tappers, each with about 1,000 trees
to tap, 300 imported seasonal tappers with a production of some 2,000
trees/tapper and some 700 local people employed in transportation and
collection depots. There are about 1.6 million trees currently under tapping
with an average production of 1.85 kg/tree; total yearly production is between
2,200 tons to 3,000 tons/year. The current sales price ex-depot Mirpur is
PRs 170/maund (PRs 4,560/ton), cost of sales, including tapping, collection,
depot and supervision about PRs 30/maund, and current revenue about PRs 13.6
million/year (gross), ?Rs 11 million/year (net) equal to about 45% of total
forest revenue. Since 1972, resin collection and marketing by private con-
tractors has ceased and the FD have undertaken the management of the whole
operation; FD continue to employ minor contractors for organizing the tapping
operations and employ their own staff for the collection and storage opera-
tions through a series of field depots to the central depot near Mirpur.
11.       The entire production is marketed to a private company, the Kashmir
Resin and Turpentine Company, Mirpur, which produces rosen and turpentine.
Present recovery rates are about 65% rosen, 15% turpentine.  The company is
planning to refit the factory with new equipment which is expected to
increase the rosen yield to 75%. The proposed new plant will be operated
cn oil fuel instead of the present fuelwood, which is used at the rate of
120,000 ft3/year (2,400 tons).



TBCHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 6
Kuth, Walnut and Minor Produce
12.       Kuth is collected as a seasonal operation and occurs in the
forests of the Neelum Valley. Yearly production is in the range of 6 tons
to 19 tons/year. FD undertake the marketing and the current selling price
is PRs 500/maund (PRs 13,000/ton). Production is limited to a fewr areas
where growth of the shrub occurs naturally and expansion of production is
not considered feasible. Walnut trees mainly occur as isolated trees in
private farmland. Felling permits issued by FD, with the objective of
controlling the rate of exploitation, have recently been re-instituted,
following a period of relaxation over felling when the FD became alarmed
at the rapid depletion of the remaining stocks, and the likelihood of
exhausting supplies to sustain the small but important wood carving and
furniture industry in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur. An attempt is now being
made to encourage further planting of the species by making tree seedlings
available to farners. FD permits are also required for commercial felling
of other tree species on private land; these represent an insignificant
volume in total production.
Forest Industries
13.       The forest industries include about 40 small scale (1 to 8 persons)
wood carving and furniture workshops in Muzaffarabad and several in Mirpur
and Rawalakot; the AKLAS sawmill at Mirpur; the Mirpur Resin factory (see
para. 11);   single band saw sawmills in most of the smaller towns which
operate cn a part-time basis to custom saw timber to customers' recuirements;
and teams of local pitsawyers performing a similar service. In addition, a
match factory is under construction by AKMIDC in Muzaffarabad and another
private sector match factory planned for Mirpur; FD have not been consulted
regarding wood supply for these.
Small Scale Satqmilling
14.       The existing single band-saw mills supplying local needs are
performing a useful service and it is doubtful whether further substantial
investment in these is justified at the present time. The band saws used
are produced in Pakistan at relatively low cost and there appears to be
adequate capacity. TWhile the mills operate -with the minLmum of mechanical
eouipment, the operators produce a fair quality product with high conversion
rates from log to sawn dimension.
15.       Pitsawing is generally not of a high standard. A 4t x 2½1" saw
mounted in a wooden frame about 4' x 2'8" in size is commonly used with the
log to be sawvn precariously propped at an angle from the horizontal.
NTeither the type of saw nor the method of log support are suitable for
producing straight sawn boards and planks and the product is low grade. By
comparison for example, the heavier type 6' to 8' wedge pitsam in combination
with well secured logs on a substantial trestle or pit used in Sri Lanka
and East Africa, produces a far higher quality product.

AKIAS Sawmill, Mirpur
16.       The construction of the sawmill at Mireur stens from a feasibility
study carried out by Industrial Projects Consultants, Switzerland in 1962
(this firm also undertook the feasibility study for the Dir Panjkora Valley
sawmill complex now under construction in MiFP) and historical reasons. At
the time the study was undertaken, there was no road access to the Neelum
Valley, some 200 miles north of Mirpur, where most of the log supply for the
mill is located. Traditionally, logs from the Neelum Valley, and also the
Hazara district of NWFP on the west bank of the Jhelum river, had for many
decades been floated down the river to Jhelum town, 20 miles south of Mirpur,
which became one of the main timber centers in Pakistan. Thus, on the basis
of log transport by river, Mirpur was chosen as a suitable center, using
the Mangla reservoir as a catchment area for ponding the logs. The river
is difficult for log floating because of the rocky bed and fluctuations in
water level giving rise to many stranded logs, but was the only transport
method then available.
17.       Since the study, the Neelum Valley road has been constructed and
the incidence of theft of logs from the river is reported by AKLAS to have
increased to some 30% of the volume floated. This latter is confirmed by
one private contractor and is attributed to the extreme scarcity bf timber
among the riparian dwellers and the high prices obtainable for black-market
logs. Effective policing of the river is considered impracticable. Only
about 25% of logs are now floated, the rest being transported by road, and
the intention is to eliminate river transport. The main reason for siting
the mill at Mirpur is therefore no longer valid and there are strong argu-
ments, on the basis of high road transport costs, for limiting the volume
intake at Mirpur to the level required for local supply of dimension lumber
and to feed the Joinery plant which is being developed in the mill.
18.       The sawmill was'i*der construction from 1969 and cemmenced produc-
tion in 1973. Capital costs wiere around PRs 44 million and partly financed
through a Polish Government loan which also undertook engineering design,
equipment supply and installation. The stated rate capacity is 3 million/ft3
log intake, on the assumption that 66% of logs would be fed through a 24"
gang saw breakdown and 33% of logs of larger dimension through a band samw
breakdomn. The mill is designed for log intake via a 1,700 m cable from the
log pond to an elevated platform adjacent to the two breakdown sat-s.
Scantlings from the breakdown saws are conveyed by mechanical green chain
to resaws and crosscut saws for producing dimension stock and then delivered
by mechanical green chain to the timber yard. A battery of three drying
kilns, each of 1,800 ft3 capacity with a combined annual capacity (at 72
hours cycle) of 0.5 million ft3/year is part of the original installation.
The mill complex includes capacious workshops and stores, and a lavish office
block. Power is by electricity from the grid. Since original construction,
a small subsidiary sawmill has been installed alongside the main mill,
composed of twTo medium-size band saws to handle smaller dimension logs using
traditional sawging techniques and a joinery factory, producing mainly doors,



Page 8
door-frames and windows, have been added. The mill is the first attempt to
establish a large scale sophisticated sawmill in Pakistan. A similar mill,
also under a Polish loan agreement is now under construction at Dir, IWP.
19.       AKIAS management have encountered the following problems at the
sawmill:
a. They have no experienced staff either in logging, sawf-
mflling or marketing and are having to develop expertise
over time.
b. The log intake system is not designed for road delivery;
resiting of a stores block and preparation of a log yard
to include a satisfactory log infeed system is necessary
to adapt the mill to road delivery which will involve
additional capital expenditure. Meantime, some of the
logs brought by road are off-loaded into the reservoir
for delivery by the cable system!
c. The free market is said to be biased towards round logs
and scantlings (large baulks) in the demand pattern,
and about 75%O of sales is in large dimension sizes
(scants). As a consequence, the resawing facilities of
the mill to produce dimension stock are under-utilized
and the drying kilns operated at only about 10% of
capacity.
d. The log sizes presently being brought to the mill are
mainly in the diameter classes over 24" whereas the
breakdowns are designed for a larger volume under 24"
diameter.
e. Management is not free to discharge unsatisfactory labor.
AKLAS Logging Operations
20.       At the time of the sawmill construction, a large investment in
cable logging equipment was made, including over 30 drum winches with cables
and two sets of ropeways, and the Polish team installed a main 2,400 m cable
ropeway and one feeder skyline at Kundal Shahi in the Neelum Valley. Most
of this equipment is still in store at Muzaffarabad with the exception of
an additional two feeder lines to link with the main ropeway installed by
.A4LAS engineers, and some spare machines held at site. In theory, the main
line has a capacity of 1,600 ft3/day, ecuivalent to some 320,000 ft3/year
and the three feeder lines should be geared to supply a similar volume to
the head of the main line. Actual production over about three years from
1973 to early 1976 has been 250,000 ft3, an average of 90,000 ft3/year.
The remainder of the volume logged over the same period of 1.6 million ft3
(see Table 3) has been by private contractors worxing on sub-contract for
AKIAS.



T¶CHNICAL AMEIN 7
Page 9
21.       The AXIAS logging section, which is also managed by the project
director in charge of the Mirpur sawmill, has expanded to sizeable
proportions. An office/residential block has been constructed at Kundal
Shahi and over 60 permanent staff are employed in the Neelum Valley
operations, including three engineers, an administrative officer with
accounting staff and 53 forestry staff on deputation from FD. The forestry
staff is composed of two DFO's, three foresters and 48 forest guards. There
appears to be some overlap of the AXLAS forestry staff dith the territorial
staff employed by the FD, and their function is not clearly understood.
Labor employed on the physical logging operations is mainly casual, with
some 30 fulltime labor operating the ropeway and skylines.
22.       ARIAS logging operations are severely constrained, alike with the
sawmill, by lack of experienced management.  The logging areas are among
the most difficult to be encountered anywhere in the world, and evolving
an efficient system is a major technical challenge. It is not at all clear
that the semi-permanent/heavy equipment cable system which is under trial
is best suited to the terrain and a likely alternative which would need
pilot testing would be the development of a highly mobile light cable
system to augment the traditional all-manual method (which still produces
the majority of the annual volume), combined with 4 x 4-3/5 ton wich lorries.
23.       Current sales prices ex-mill Mirpur for ungraded timber are high
by compariso4 with comparable timber in other countries; deodar is selling
at PRs 75/ft', blue pine PRs 55/ftM, fir PRs 45/ftl and Chir pine 49/ft).
These prices compare with cif prices at European ports for Canadian and
Scandinavian graded softwood timber from around FRa 23/ft3 for the lower
grades to PRs 41/ft3 for the higher grades.  The Mirpur prices are in line
with other market prices in Pakistan, e.g., Rawalpindi ex-timber yard deodar
PRs 100/ft3 for scantlings; Muzaffarabad ex FD depot dqodar PRs 60/ft3 for
scantlings;  Lahore ex-timber yard deodar PRs 80-100/ft'.  On the basis of
these prices an analysis indicates that the Mirpur mill could operate with
a gross profit of around 40% before tax and depreciation, even allowing for
the high costs of stumpage, logging and log transport.   (See Table 4).
24.       Some major problems facing ArITS have been discussed with ArIAS
and FD staff and these, together with possible solutions, are summarized
below :
a. Log Marketing. It is highly unlikely that AKIAS direct
logging operations can be geared up to handle the qnormous
back-log of standing volume of around 5 million ftl in the
Neelum Valley, or that the sawmill will be able to expand
capacity to more than 1 million ft3 in the next few years,
(see para. 9). An easy solution would be to reopen, on a
larger scale, private contractor logging, on contract to
AKIAS, and release logs for sale to the free market
through the log depots at Muzaffarabad or, as the road
becomes widened to two-lane traffic, further up the Neelum
Valley. Taking 75% of the prescribed felling volume vide
the Working Plan, a realistic annual volume to be logged
would be 2 million ft3. The present valley road is
limited to 200 ft3/truck load which equates with about
50,000 ft3/truck year on the basis of one round trip



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 10
day/250 days/year. On this basis, 40 trucks would be needed
for log transport from Athmuqam to Muzaffarabad, which is
within the capacity of the private truck contractors, but
would be tight for the present road condition. However, the
road is under widening and improvement operations, and the
traffic carryIng capacity will be significantly improved in
1976. Assuming 800,000 ft' of this volume to AKIAS Mirpur
mill (the balance of 200,090 ft3 from Mirpur/Aotli), this
would leave 1.2 million ft for the market, which on current
prices, would yield around PRs 24 million additional revenue
after sales expenses.
b. Audit of AKIAS Operations. An independent audit of the various
departments and operations of AIUAS, carried out by a local
reputable firm, would highlight the current loss areas in the
present operations and form the basis for tighter management
planning and control. There would be merit in including an
examination of the market prospects for the Joinery products
and a profitability analysis of the proposed expansion of
this activity.
c. Logging Operations. It is unrealistic to expect young,
inexperienced engineers, no matter how enthusiastic, to devise
suitable techniques without the guidance of an experienced and
competent logger. The possibility of employing an expatriate
specialist on, say, 2 two-year contract justifies serious
consideration. There is no formal logging training in Pakistan
and in the context of the exceedingly difficult terrain in
Azad Kashmir, in-service training is a more fundamental
approach to improving on the present all-manual technology
and the attempt to introduce cable logging which has not been
a technical success. However, improved logging is largely
dependent on the confidence with which clear-felling with
follow-up replanting operations can be introduced, and until
the social and technical aspects inhibiting reforestation are
adequately resolved, the question of substantially increasing
log supply from these difficult hill areas is in doubt.
d. Sawuilling and Joinery. A similar situation exists at the
sawmill and an experienced expatriate samuiller would be able
to adapt the present mill to maximize production and eliminate
bottlenecks in addition to increasing the expertise of the
local staff and operators. Both the logging and sawmilling
posts can be put on a commercial basis and salaries charged
against current revenues.
e. Decision on `?uture Size of Mirpur Mill. As a first approxima-
tion, it is logica] to limit the size of the Mirpur operation
to the size of the market for local timber plus the quantity
for onward disposal south into Punjab, including joinery
components as well as sawnwood. The markets of Rawalpindi
and Islamabad would more rationally be supplied direct from
Muzaffarabad or by roundwood delivery to those towns ex-forest.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 11
There is virtually no wastage at the sawmill (common
throughout Pakistan) and residues, which are reportedly
about 25% of round volune, have a ready market as firewood,
selling at PR8 4 to 6/ftJ, which probably offsets the cost
savings in transport which could be gained by squaring the
logs in the forest. These residues also assist in relieving
the local pressure for firewood. A more meaningful assess-
ment of ultimate mill size would follow after results for
the activities discussed in (b), (c) and (d) above are
known.
B. The Forestry Department
Forest Management
25.      For general management, the territory is divided into two circles,
Musaffarabad and Mirpur, each in the charge of a Conservator of Forests.
Operational management of the demarcated forests is effected through eight
territorial divisions (four in each circle), which are further subdivided
into ranges, blocks and beats. In addition to the territorial divisions,
there is a divisional forest officer (DFO) in each circle with responsibility
for forest demarcation, and a DFO for range management in Muzaffarabad.
Headquarter services and staff assignments include Conservator Planning, with
one DFO in charge of the Foresters' training school, Muzaffarabad and Research,
and another responsible for preparing 10-year working plans for the demarcated
forests; a wildlife warden, three fulltime magistrates and a superintendent
of police. An organization chart is included in Table 5.
Staff and Training
26.        Full-time staff, excluding casual employees engaged for forest
operations, total just over 1,000. The department is headed by a chief
conservator of forests, with three conservators, 13 assistant conservators
and 30 forest rangers. Entry to these grades is normally limited to graduates
from the Forest Institute, Peshawar, VWFP, with about 30% of forest ranger
posts being filled by promotions from the forester grade. Some 13 of the
senior staff have undergone post-graduate overseas training. There are 125
forester grade staff (in charge of blocks) and 413 forest guards (in charge
of beats). Foresters are selected from serving junior staff (e.g., forest
guards) and undergo a one-year training course in the FD school at Muzaffarabad,
which was established in 1956; forest guards have a six-month training at
the same school. There are 20 forester students currently under training at
the school, including four from Baluchistan and two from Gilgit. Without
exception, the staff met by the mission displayed a keen awarenes9 of their
responsibilities, capacity for work, frankmess in discussing problems and the
limitations of present technologies and a commendably high level of physical
fitness.  Table 6 contains dtaila of the staff coMplemnat.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 12
Management Plans for Demarcated Forests
27.      A system of 10-year management plans for the demarcated forests
has been in operation since before 1930. There are four current plans
covering Keran/Sharda, Muzaffarabad/Jhelum, Bagh/Rawalakot and Kotli/(irpur.
These are comprehensive documents, describing the division of the areas
into compartments (for which historical and prescriptive registers are
kept), distinguishing compartments between protection forests and production
forests, and prescribing felling volumes for the latter based on visual
assessment of the stocking density related to proportion of closed canopy
and physical measurement of the girth of the standing trees. This "Selection"
System of felling is designed to preserve a continuous tree cover and maintain
a sustained yield from the forests, with successive fellings at approximately
30-year intervals, being scaled to the density of the forest and the proportion
of trees over a minimum predetermined diameter. Translated into a time-frame,
for example, at a rotation of 120 years, there would be four felling operations
involving the removal of the largest 25% of trees (say, over 30" diameter
at breast height (DBH), with regeneration following each felling to provide
the young stock for the subsequent cycle. By making the diameter the second
criteria for felling decision, the System can be fitted to alternative time
frames or rotations. Felling prescriptions under current management plans
are summarized in Table 7.
28.      Historically, the minimum diameter for felling has been 30" DBH,
which represents a very large tree containing upwards of 150 ft3 and weighing
3 to 5 tons green weight. There are a number of disadvantages in growing
trees to this large dimension; considerable damage to the remaining standing
crop is inevitable in felling such tall/heavy trees; extraction of large
dimension logs down the hillsides results in significant damage to young
regeneration and soil displacement; truck loading and trucking on narrow
mountain roads is more difficult than with smaller logs; efficient sawmill
conversion of large logs requires expensive heavy duty equipment. Moreover,
it is almost certainly the case that annual increment of the older (larger)
trees, e.g., 60+ years for Chir Pine and 80+ years for Blue Pine, Deodar and
Spruce, is dropping below the mean annual increment attained in the earlier
years and greater wood production/acre would be achieved by shorter rotations.
On this basis, the recent Working Plan for the most productive divisions,
Keran and Sharda (1975-1984i), has prescribed for fellings down to 24" DBH
instead of the former 30" with the result that prescribed annual fellings
ha e been increased from around 1.5 million ft3/year to about 3.0 million
ft/year. Realized felling volume is usually about 75 percent of the
measured standing volume after adjustment for over-estimate, breakage and
defects.
29.      In theory, except for the fir areas, natural regeneration of Chir
pine, Blue pine and Deodar from the seeds cast by the remaining trees should
be sufficient to sustain the forest stocking and it is a fact that these
species, particularly Chir and Blue pines, do exhibit vigorous regeneration
in many areas. However, in practice, the widespread grazing, which has been
a cause for concern since the 1930's, and fuel gathering which takes place
throughout the forest, and the inability of the FD to effectively close
large areas to grazing because of local and political pressures, is causing
a breakdown in the system, and greater use of artificial regeneration is
now considered more practicable. This brings into question the efficiency
of the present planting technology, the merits of genetic improvement of
presently used species to maximize on growth rate and desirable tree form,
and the possibility of introducing species with a higher economic value.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7

30.       In the six territorial divisions other than Keran and Sharda,
management is further complicated by the relatively heavy demands for
concessionary timber, which tends to pressure the local forest staff to
permit fellings in areas which are only poorly stocked, and the high incidence
of theft. It is significant that commercial feIlings in these divisions has
been reduced to small volumes (about 200,000 ft3/year for Mirpur and Kotli)
or even zero (Bagh + Rawalakot), in an attempt to build up the stocking
densities of these forests. This is unlikely to succeed unless the pressures
on the forests for fuelwood, grazing and concessionary issues are reversed
and the FD staff released from a preoccupation with boundary protection and
control of concessionary and illegal fellings in order to fully address the
technical problems of intensive forest management.
Forest Exaenditure and Revenue
310       A comparison of normal budget expenditure and revenue for the main
departments of government indicates that the FD revenue is around PRs 30 uillion/
year and represents over 95% of departmental revenues.    Normal budget expend-
iture on forestry, of which about 50% is in staff salarles, is around
PRi 7.4 million/year and ranks third to education (PR. 25 miliion) and police
(PRa 9.2 million). Most of these forestry expenditures are related to revenue
earning activities and protection of the forest estate.

34-        The proposed expenditure pattern indicates the high priority
allotted to preservation of the existing forests (items (c), (d), (g),
(h), (i), (j) and (k) and the development of new forest resources by
plantations establishment (items (a), (b) and (1)). What is not included
and yet is considered to be a vital item to ensure success of the main
program is provision for species trials, provenance trials, and nursery/
plantation establishment trials. This omission has been discussed with
senior FD staff who wholly agree it needs to be rectified.
Other Forestry Investments
35.       Apart from small scale isolated planting by private persons on
their own land, mainly retired government officials developing their small
farms, there are no investments outside FD activities at present, other
than the Mangla watershed management project undertaken by the Water and
Power "'evelopment Authority (WAPDA); see Technical Annex 1, Appendix 3.
WP? Proposed Pro.1ect
36.       The UN/FAO/ '? project is expected to be financed in 1977. The
project is an attempt to arrest encroachment of the forest areas and soil
erosion in four selected pilot areas (Lohargdli and KCathapiran in
Musaffarabad district, Rawalakot in Poonch district and Sarsawa in Kotli



T3MIAL ANNEX 7
Page 15
district), by an integrated land management approach involving reforestation
and erosion control (forestry), farm land terracing and crop improvement
(agriculture) and rangeland/livestock/animal feed improvement (animal husban-
dry), together with the construction of mule tracks, water facilities for
animals, produce stores and offices.  The project would be of five years
duration at an estimated coat of PRa 25 million (WFP PRs 7 million,
GOP 18 mi ll ion) .f
37.       A feature of the project in the inducement of farmers' cooperation
by the free issue of food rations (three man-day rations per man-day worked)
and the free issue of cattle feed (tmize or wheat) for stall-feedings to
participating farmers in the rangelarld development aspects, for the first 1½
years of the project. This approach bas been used under a pilot WFP project
in the adjacent Hasara district of NWPP. There are two opposing views to this:
one argument is that initial inducsemet is a necessary condition to involve
local people in the activities; the other holding that it is basically unsound
to engender an attitude of expectation of subsidy payments among primary bene-
ficiaries of the project. The project document does not indicate the
institutional framework through which farmer participation would be secured.
38.      To the extent that certain activities of any future Rural Development
project will rely upon a self-help contribution, without free food, and
cattle feed issues, there could be a conflict between the WFP and RD approaches,
particularly as both projects are likely to occur concurrently in neighboring
districts.
C.  Development Strategy
Constraints to Develop2ent
39.      An overriding constraint is a genera] historical attitude of the
public that forests are a natural phenomenon freely available to supply the
needs of the populace and capable of reproducing themselves without special
effort and protection, whether for timber, fuelwood or grazing. FD staff
themselves have reacted to the inadequacy of the traditional approach of
sustained yield by natural regeneration in which they were schooled and are
increasingly directing their activities to replenishment of the forests by
protective closure, enrichment planting and reforestation (notwithstanding
techniques so far developed can be significantly improved). Public support
for this is as yet only partial and the conflict between the FD and the
public is evidenced by the extraordinarily high number of prosecutions
brought for forest offenses (para. 5). The public attitude is understandably
related to need, particularly fuelwood and fodder. At the same time, there
is the anomaly that whereas farmers invariably protect their food crops from
damage by grazing animals, they are unwilling to provide the same protection
to fodder areas and seedlings, although these are equally important to their
needs. Other aspects requiring modifications in attitudes are a lack of
awareness of rational land use and the legal status of the forests. Besides
these social constraints, there are a number of management and technical
problems which will need to be addressed in order to prepare the basis for a
long-term development strategy.  These constraints, and the special role of
AKIAS, are discussed below and possible solutions, which have been agreed
with FD and AKIAS officials, are suggested.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 16
40.      Land Use and Watershed Management.  Most of AK is composed of
difficult mountainous country requiring a land use pattern to be evolved
which will enable the farmer to maximize his production and at the same
time reverse the downgrade in the land which is presently occurring
through erosion. In the macro context of the Mangla dam and its command
area, this aspect has national implications. (See Technical Annex 1,
para.    and Appendix 3).  The development of land use plans for sub-
watersheds, along similar lines to the WAPDA project is a sound basic
approach. This needs to be reinforced by the creation of a competent
section for land use and development planning within GOAK which would
secure the involvement of local people in developing sub-watershed/
village development plans and coordinate the activities of forestry
and other departments in the development of plans. The proposed Land
Use and Development Section is discussed in Technical Annex 11.
41.      Legal Status of the Forests.  The present confrontation of the
public versus the FD inhibits development. This largely arises from the
exercise of rights of grazing and concessionary timber issues and is
aggravated by political leaders lobbying FD staff to favor the right
holder. In an earlier period of conflict, grazing fees were instituted
to limit the numbers of livestock to the carrying capacity of the grazing
areas and reports indicate this was substantially successful. The proposed
project would be specifically addressing the technical problems of improved
fodder production on farmland (see Technical Annex 2) and improved fodder
utilization (see Technical Annex 10). Successful development of those two
activities would provide underlying support for introducing measures to
rationalize forest grazing.
42.      Indications are that concessionary timber issues have incremented in
value over time because of pegging maximum price charged per tree; for
example, PRs 5/tree paid by a concessionaire in Sharda Division compares
with a stumpage value for a commercial sale of around PRs 1,500/tree. This
situation adds to the general scramble to make a personal gain from the
public forests.
43.      A review of the current legal structure with a view to making
modifications which would improve on the present unsatisfactory position
is indicated. Such a review should consider the possibility of the re-
introduction of grazing fees and the dedication of some of the forest
areas to local wood supply as a trade off against the forfeiture of rights
over parts of the forests selected for closure for protection and for intensive
commercial management. (See para.     and Technical Annex 12).
44.      Role of AKIAS in Commercial Forest Operations. AKIAS has been
entrusted with the main part of the commercial forestry operations in the
State. Performance to date has been disappointing both with respect to
volumes of timber handled and lack of profitability. The key problems
and possible solutions are discussed in para. 24.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 7
Page 17
45.      Reforestation Techniques. Serious attempts to secure artificial
regeneration have only been undertaken in recent years and a considerable
amount of work needs to be done on improvement of the indigenous species,
introduction of suitable exotics, improving nursery and plantation
establishment techniques. A component covering these activities is included
in the proposed project. (See Technical Annex 8).
46.      Fuelwood. The establishment of sufficient fuelvood to meet the needs
of local people, through a combination of private tree planting, community
tree blocks on shamlat / lands and fuelwood blocks in declared forests or
public land is considered by the FD and the mission to be an urgent need and
a prerequisite to systematic management of the forests and hillsides for
commercial production and watershed management. A limited component, on
the basis of the best techniques so far evolved, would be included in the
proposed project. (See Technical Annex 8). This would concentrate on
improving techniques and developing suitable systems for securing the
participation of local farmer beneficiaries in cost sharing for establishment
and maintenance of the fuelwood blocks, which would serve as a basis for a
follow-up expanded program. At the same time, an assessment of future needs
would be made, taking account of possible improvements in domestic wood
fuel efficiency. (See Technical Annex 12).
47.      Timber Preservation.   The large annual volume of free and concessionary
issues of timber (mainly for house construction), is a significant drain on
the timber resources of the State. (See para. 8). At the present time, there
are no facilities for even simple timber preservation treatments. Simple
preservation could prolong the useful life of construction timber by three
or more times. This could significantly reduce timber usage and also the
labor involved in reconstruction. A pilot timber preservation trials
component is included in the proposed project to test the efficacy of
introducing this activity. (See Technical Annex 12).

PAKISTAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Forestry Anperimental Trials and Pilot Fuelwood Plantations
Introduction
1.       The State's forest resources are being seriously depleted
largely because of the acute shortage of fuelwood. (See Technical Annex
7 para. 4 (b)).     In addition, the general shortage of timber for
construction and general ase in Pakistan is exerting a strong pressure
to over-exploit the natural forests in order to maintain a minimum
flow of timber into the economy. The natural forests of Azad Kashmir
(AK) are a traditional important supply source of timber for the
country benefiting both the State's and the national economy. To
maintain the supply, changes are needed to relieve local pressures on
the forests and to increase forest productivity.
2.       The Forest Department (FD) are changing their approach to forest
management from an historical natural regeneration management system for
timber production, which under prevailing conditions is only partially
successful and of low productivity, to more intensive forest production
using man-made plantations. This new approach is basically sound, but
will require considerable effort to improve techniques of reforestation
to ensure success for commercial application. In this respect, the
proposed Hazara Forestry Technical Development Project would provide a
substantially improved technical base which would have wide replicability
in many parts of AK. Another important recent change in the FD approach
is the initial establishment of plantations for fuelwood for local use,
both in declared forests and through the provision of seedlings to
interested farmers. This has involved the use of introduced species
more suited for fuelvood. The basic techniques for these operations also
need to be improved before embarking on a large-scale program. Whilst
these technical aspects need to be stressed, the development of public
relations to the extent that local residents accept the obligations
necessary to establish, protect and efficiently manage the forests and
tree blocks is an equally or even more important consideration.
ProJect Strategy
3.       The proposed project would concentrate on developing improved
techniques to provide a sounder basis for embarking on a fol3ow-up large
scale fuelwood program;  and, finance a pilot-program of fuelwood
plantation establishment to test improved techniques under field conditions
and develop suitable systems of involving local people, who would be the
beneficiaries of the plantations, in their establishment and maintenance.
During the project period, an assessment would be made of the projected
demand for loca3 fuelwood/poles (see Technical Annex 12) and a program
prepared for inclusion in a follow-up project. The work carried out
under the experimental trials activities would also provide basic
techniques for use in commercial forest operations. A close link would
be maintained with the Pakistan Forest Institute (FFI) and the proposed
Hazara Forestry project to coordinate technical development. Technical



T$HNICAL ANNEX 8

detail s of experimental plot design and size would be worked out with the
PFI and the Hazara project manager.
Project Activities
4.       Experimental Trials.  These would include establishment trials for
nursery and field planting; genetic improvement of existing species through
rigorous seed selection and establishing seed sources; and, species trials.
The main center for trials would be at the FD station at Batika Forest
(about 15 miles from Muzaffarabad) where the experimental nursery would be
established; the nursery would also produce seedlings for fuelvood
plantations in that area. Provision is included for some species trials
to be commenced in the Mirpur area in the second or third year of the
project. Activities of the trials are as follows :-
a. Establishment Trials
(1) Nursery Research. Almost all nursery operations are subject
to significant variation and these variations have important
effects on the size, vigor and survival of stock; for each
operation a range of techniques mast be tested in designed,
comparative experiments. For most of the following operations
at least three quarters should be tested with up to 27 combina-
tions for fertilizer trials.
(i) Sowing Time. This is normally related to the
required size of planting stock and to the conditions
(rainfall, temperature and insolation) at the time of
sowing. Planting has been practised in both the short
and the long rains and there is a range of sowing time
that could produce potential planting stock.
(ii) Seed Covering
Depth. The depth of material has a marked effect on
success of seed germination and plant production. If
materia] is too deep it may inhibit germination and
hypocotyl growth; if it is too shall ow it may not
protect the seed against insolation and desiccation and
it may allow the seed to be washed out of the pot or bed
by water drops, particularly if rotary overhead water systems
are used. For pines a common rule is to cover the seed
to a depth of 1-3 times its own diameter.
Material. Various covering materials have different
capacities for absorbing oxygen, water, heat and light
or preventing them reaching the germinating seed.
Organic mulch (chopped, dried pine needles) should be
compared with sand, gravel, artificial vermiculite, etc.



TZHNICAL ANNEX 8
Page 3
Shading. Once seeds have germinated and the hypocotyls
have appeared above the soil surface they are susceptible
to excess heat and light. Shading reduces this but may
increase the incidence of damping off. Different materials
such as wooden laths or, better, nylon neeting should be
arranged to reduce light intensity by 25, 50 and 75%.
(iii) Tubes vs. Beds: Time of Pricking Out. Bed material
is intended for bare-root or ball-root planting and may
not be successful on a large scale; it should be compared
with potted material at different planting times (para. (2)
(iv)) for different plant sizes (para. (2) (iii). The cost
of filling and transporting pots increases the cost of
nursery stock, but commonly decreases the failure rate.
If potted plants are adopted the seed may be sown direct
into the pots or into beds; if the latter, it is necessary
to test different stages of seedling development for
optimum pricking-out condition. Usually pines are best
pricked out within a few days of germination, just as the
seed coat is shedding; but other stages can be tested;
care must be taken not to touch or damage the hypocotyl,
and seedlings can best be held by the cotyledons.
(iv)   Tube (or Bag) Size.  Different pot sizes affect the
size of transplant produced, the ratio of root to shoot
growth, the depth or breadth of root development and the
extent of root binding ("pot binding", development of
circular patterns of growth at edge of pot). The econouics
of pot size must also be considered, especially the cost
of transporting soil to the nursery and pots to the field.
(v)    Soil Mixture. The composition of soil affects plant
survival and growth through its effect on aeration, water
retention and chemical nutrition. Organic manure has been
demonstrated to be deleterious in some nurseries and need&
further testing and other soil mixtures can be compared
(proportion of soil to sand).
(vi)   Fertilization Composition and Amount. Whatever soil
mixture is used seedling growth and health can often be
increased by use of artificial fertilizers especially
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK). To determine the
optimum composition it is usually necessary to test all 27
combinations of three levels of each element. Such
experiments are relatively simple to conduct in the nursery.
(vii) Root Pruning. This may be practised on pot or bad
plants and it is intended to stimulate the lateral develop-
ment of roots and the production of a dense, fibrous root
system. Different methods can be compared and at different
frequencies.

(2) Development of Establishment and Cultural Techniques.
When healthy, vigorous planting stock are produced
their survival and growth are improved by careful
attention to establishment and cultural methods.
Much of the evidence seen during the mission emphasized
the need for the maintenance of optimum conditions in
the first one or two years. Throughout the following
trials, it is recommended that all transplants are in
tubes and that two provenances of the selected species
be used to minimize the chance of using a source that
is not typical of the species. Provision is included
for 20 acres of trials in both year 2 and year 3 of
the project.
(i)   Ground Preparation.  The manual methods
used may be compared at different times (in
relation to date of planting) and at different
depths of pit preparation and area of pit.
(ii) Time of Planting. These trials should be
co-ordinated with the trials of nursery sowing
times (para. 1 (i)) and size of planting trials
will need to be related to the known rainfall
and temperature patterns to test for the planting
season which yields the maximum establishment
success and initial growth. This will vary
between locations. E.g., in Keran, late winter
and early spring are potential planting times,
with the possibility of early winter planting in
sheltered areas. In southern areas, the late
winter, early monsoon and mid/late monsoon are
potential planting times.
(iii) Size of Translants. In many afforestation
programs the size of transplants is often excessive.
Depending on the early weed competition and the
likelihood of dry, hot periods immediately after
planting, trees should be 20-25 cm tall, but a
range of sizes should be compared.
(iv) Weeding
Frequency. Weeding is an expensive operation
but, under conditions of limited soil moisture, it
is critical. Up to three or four weedings may be
necessary each year for one or more years depending
on the method used. Experiments must be established
to cciapare weeding frequency.
Number of Years. The cost of weeding clearly makes
it desirab7e to reduce the number of years to a
minimum. Trials should therefore compare different
numbers of years and at different frequencies.



TECHNICAL ANNB1 8
Fage 
Method. Several methods should be oompared
(8pot weedingp of varying diameter spots,
line weeding, complete weeding) and effects
on plant vigor measured.
(v)    Fertilizer.
CowDositito and Amou_nt. As with nurssry
fertilization (para. (1) (v7i, it is desirable to
test in the field all combinations of three levels
each of N, P and K. However, the desig of such
trials in the field is difficult and it should be
confined to a Main site with reduced follow-up on
the others. There ia no evidence of micro-nutrient
deficiencies, but tests should be carried out to
confirm this.
Time of Application in Year. Depending on the time
of application, solid fertilizer may scorch roots
or it may be leached out of the soil too rapidly
for use by the plant. Trials are therefore
necessary to compare applications at the beginning,
middle and end of the rains and in the dry season.
Number of Years. The aim of fertilization in the
first year is to give the tree an initial boost to
combat weed growth. However, the fertilizer may
also increase the weed growth itself. Fertilization
after the first year may also be profitable up to
about 12 years (in a 15-year rotation). Experiments
should be conducted initially on the main site but
repeated one year later on ather site types.
b. Species Trials
Trials, including provenances within species, of likely species which
would provide superior volume production and shorter felling rotations
than species presently used. This is particularly important for
securing an early impact on the fuelwood supply position, but also of
prime importance in increasing production of structural and industrial
wood. The activities proposed are :
(1) Confirmation of promising fast growing species for the different
ecological areas and further investigation of their potential in
provenance trials; by screening, in species elimination trials,
of a larger number of indigenous and exotic species which appear
to have promise.
(2) Estimation of yields from a number of species selected from (1)
above. A list of suggested species is given in Table 1. These
will need to be examined more carefully before making the final
selection and a control species selected (e.g., Pinus roxburghii).
Criteria for selection of species would include average energy (BTU)
value of their wood matter and ability to yield leaf fodder.



TSCHNICAL AMWB 8
Page6
(3) Provision is included for 10 acres/year of species/
provenance trials for years two and three of the project.
The final, area needed would be based on the number of apecies/
provenances to be tested and standard replicated plot layout
systems which have been developed for these type of trials.
These details would be worked out with the PFI and in
association with the Hazara Forestry Project. Comonvealth
Forest Institute (CFI), Oxford, Bagland have produced standard
foraats and can advise on these and also the range of likely
species to be included and seed sources. (GOP is a member of
this Institute). The Director, U.S. Forestry Seed Center
can also assist with these services (see Table 1).
c. Genetic IMrovement
Genetic improvement of existing species is needed to ensure
that replanted areas are stocked with tree seedlings raised
from the most productive 'seed sources available. A two stage
approach is suggested as follows :
(1) This can be initiated immediately as a measure of securing
significant gains in production by selecting in existing
plantations, pheno-typically best stands or individuals (seed
stands, seed trees and plus trees), for the production of seed
and confining seed collection to these seed trees. Initially,
the main selection criteria would be vigor and stem straight-
ness.
(2) For the longer term developmant of seed orchards, plus
trees would be selected at relatively low intensity and used
for propagating into seedling and clonal orchards and techniques
developed for vegetative propagation and controlled pollination
of some species. Progeny tests of selected species would be
introduced as early as possible in the program. Improved techniques
of seed collection, testing, certification and storage would be
introduced.
These activities would be coordinated, through the PFI,
with the work to be undertaken by the Hazara Forestry Project,
and would provide a basis for a longer term program of genetic
improvement.
5.      Manegement of Experimental Trials.  The experimental trials and
genetic improvement activities would be the responsibility of a Divisional
Forest Officer (DFO) (Fast Growing Species) to be appointed under the project.
The present DFO (Research) has demonstrated an interest in this work and is
a possible candidate; his present duties, which include the development of
yield tables for indigenous forests and training, would then be undertaken
by a replacement DFO. The DFO (Fast Growing Species) would be responsible
to the Chief Conservator of Forests and through him to the project director
He would be assisted by a Range Officer (Research) Grade 16 and Forester
(Research) Grade 5. The DFO (Fast Growing Species) would give technical
supervision to the pilot fuelwood plantations (see para. 9 ), and would
be provided with a jeep and trailer for carrying and supervision.

6.      Training and Consultancies.  The Pakistan Forest Institute (PFI)
havt undertaken to give technical support to the ;roject.   Pro-ision is in-
cluded for the DFO to have a one-month in-service training at .±e PFI and
proposed Hazart Forestry Project in experimental/trials methods in each
year of the project. Provision is also included for one-month in-service
training at the Hazara Forestry project for the Range Officer (Research),
and pilot plantation senior field staff (two Range Officers and two Deputy
Rangers), for each year of the project. Consultazcy services would be
provided for a plantations/geneticist specialist for one month in year I
to assist in setting up the trials and for one-month in year 3 to assist
in evaluating progress and preparing a follow-up program. These consultancies
would be closely coordinated with similUar consultancies for the proposed
Hazara Forestry Project to maximize the exchange of technical knowledge.
Fuelwood/Pole Pilot Plantations
7.      Whilst the present techniques of reforestation can be substantially
improved through the program of experimental trials discussed above, there
is a sufficient technical base for proceeding with a limited plantations
establishment scheme. Moreover, there is an urgent need to address the
problem of creating supplies of timber for local use and motivating farmers
to devote some of their resources to meet this need. Preliminary assessment
of selected areas indicates that present usage of fuelwoo4 is in the range
of 0.2 to 0.4 maund/day per family, equal to about 180 ft' to 300 ft3 per
family per year, see Table 2. This is equivalent to the natural yearly
increment of about four to eight acres of forest per family under present
management systems. There are probably some 300,000 households using
faelwood, and even at the lower estimate, this usage would consume the
total annual increment of the State's forests assuming it was all accessible
and able to be exploited, which would leave no balance for local construction
timber and commercial exploitation. In fact, much of the forest is inaccessible
and pressures for fuelwood are concentrated where the forests are less extensive
with the result that these are being severely depleted.
8.      On this basis, pilot plantations would be established by the project
in areas of acute fuelwood shortage with the objectives of field testing
improved technology and detenmining suitable management systens involving
local participation for creating local timber supplies. A complementary
component is included for testing the possible introduction of improved
wood burning stoves which could significantly reduce the quantities of
timber needed for domestic use. (See Technical Annex 12).
9.      Pronosed Activities.  These would include :
a. Extension and upgrading of 1½ acres of nursery at each of the
existing nurseries at Bagh, Hajira and Kotli (the Batika nursery
would also be included, (see para. 4), and production of some
three million tree seedlings, of which 600,000 would be for sale
to farmers and 2.4 million for plantations establishment;
b. setting up of four field units at Batika, Bagh, Hajira and
Kotli for establishing 3,000 acres of plantations during the
three years.

10.     Location and Area. Plantations would be established as follows :

Totals         500           1,250           1,250           3,000
The transplant requirements for year 2 plantations would be supplied ftron
existing nursery stocks.
11.     Areas for Planting. Plantations would be located according to land
availability in the different villages using Declared Forest, State Land and
Shamlat or Private tand. The size of individual plantations would vary up to
50 acres or more depending on availability of land and numbers of families
to be served. All blocks would be demarcated and closed to grazing. Controlled
cutting of fodder would be permitted. After agreement as to location, blocks
would be surveyed, mapped and registered with the Land Registry. It is
expected that year 1 plantations would be established in government owned
Declared Forests, whilst forward arrangements are being negotiated for
including a proportion of years 2 and 3 plantations on Shaulat and Private
Lands.
12.     Nurseries.  Extensions of 1½ acres to the existing nursery sites at
Bagh, Hajira and Kotli, (two acres at Batika to provide 0.5 acres for
bEperimental Trials), would include levelling, preparation of terminal
irrigatlon channels, fencing, the construction of a Range Office/Store of
500 ft. and provision of tools. For most species, production would be of
1-year old stock, with targets related to the following year's planting
program on the basis of 800 plants per acre; this allows 20% for culling
and beating up. In addition to seedling production for pilot plantations,
each nursery would produce about 50,000 transplants a year for sale to
farmers; the proposed sale price would be PRs 0.15/transplant. About 60%
of production is expected to be tubed transplanta. Seed supplies would
be obtained through the DFO (Fast Growing Species), who would also advise
on suitable soil mixtures for nursery soils. The Range Forest Officer
(or Deputy Ranger) would supervise the nursery work. (See para. 14).
13.     Technical Data for Plantations.  The species selected would be for
rapid fueJwood production with better quality stems being selected for poles.
Generally species which coppice would be uqed with an expected rotation of
8 to 10 years and yields of 100 to 140 ft. /acre/year. Species which are
easy to establish but do not produce useful timber (e.g., Ailanthus spp),
should be avoided. Planting espacement would be on the basis of 8 feet by
8 feet, (680 trees/acre). Replacement of failed transplants (beating up)
should be carried out as near to the original planting date as practicable.
Technical data is summarized in Table 3.



T'CHNICAL ANNEX 8
Page 9
14. MAna&ement of Plantations. Range Officers (Grade 16) would be
appointed to be responsible for the Bagh and Hajira plantations and Deputy
Rangers (Grade 6) for the Batika and Kotli plantations; the Range Officers/
Deputy Ranger at Bagh, Hajira and Rotli would be assisted by a Forester
(Grade 5), with the Forester (Research) assisting at the Batika plantations.
Range Officers/Deputy Rangers would be responsible to the Chief Conservator
of Forests and through him to the project director. These field supervisory
staff would be provided with motor cycles.
15.     For forward planning of the siting of plantations, field supervisors
would liaise with the project manager to ensure that sites which are chosen
are relatively accessible, are in line with the development planning for the
area, and, for Shamlat and Private Lands, have been formally agreed upon with
the local owners. (See Technical Annex 12).
Costs
16.     Physical requirements and costs for the experimental trials and
pilot plantations are detai]ed in Table 4, and summarized below.   The
experimental trials costs include the capital costs of extending the    2
nursery at Batika, including an office/store/minor residence of 600 ft. ,
a jeep and trailer and furniture and equipment; and, operational costs of
the trials and staff salaries. Nain office accommodation for the DFO
(Fast Growing Species) is already available at the Muzaffarabad Forestry
School. Training and consultancy costs include the attendance at PFI
and the proposed Hazara Forestry project for the DFO and five Range
Officers/Assistant Rangers for one month for each year of the project
and a one-month consultancy of a forestry specialist in years 1 and 3.
The pilot plantations include the capital posts of the nursery extensions,
comprising a small office/store of 500 ft.' at each nursery, tools and
equipment and motor cycles for the four field supervisors. Operating costs
for the pilot plantation have been based on the assumption that all work of
establishment would be on a cash wage basis, whereas it is expected that
in years 2 and 3 of the project, self-help schemes would be introduced for
Shamlat and Private Land to be planted. The full costs are included as a
contingency against possible delays in implementing self-help schemes, in
which event, plantations would continue to be established in Declared
Forest areas.

Benefits and Risks
17.     A main objective of the experimental trials is to establish sound
techniques for planting with known species to provide a confident basis for
proceeding with costing and evaluation of a follow-up large scale program.
The activities of specials trials and genetic improvement would also form
the beginning of a longer-term program of tree improvement from which it
is confidently expected that early yield increases of 20% or more would be
obtained with eventual increases of 50% plus.
18.     A preliminary analysis of the financial costs and benefits of pilot
fuelwood plantations indicates a rate of return in the range of 8% to 17%.
Costs used in the analysis have been based on per acre costs developed from
the project cost data with estimates for future maintenance and additional
capital costs which are likely to be involved under full-program conditions.
The 8% and 17% results relate to different calculations of benefits accord-
ing to the low or high estimates of rotation length, yield and stumpage
value of fuelwood, respectively; see Table 5 . These results do not
include on-site or off-site benefits of soil and water conservation which
are significant.
19.     The main risk is that farm families are slow in responding to the
allocation of some of their land and labor to tree growing. This would
result in a significantly reduced follow-up program and, more importantly,
would indicate that community acceptance of rational land use and development
planning was not making progress.

LIVESTOCK SECTOR
A.   Sector Background
10        Livestock play a very important role in the economy of Azad Kashmir.
In addition to being the sole source of draft power for seed-bed preparation,
livestock rearing provides a cash income for almost all families, as well as
being the source of milk, meat, eggs, manure, wool, and family insurance.
Annual meat consumption averages about 5 kg/capita, of which about 65% is com-
prised of cattle and buffalo beef, 30% of goat and sheep mutton and the balance
of poultry meat. Annual per capita milk consumption is about 85 litres, of which
65 litres is derived from the buffalo herd. 1/ The estimated value of production
of the livestock sector, based on farmgate prices, is approximately Rp 360 million
(Table 1).
2.        Although a livestock census was conducted in April 1976, the most
recent census data available on livestock numbers in the State are from the 1972
Livestock Census of Pakistan. The livestock populations estimated in 1972 are
outlined in detail in Table 2, and summarised below:
Cattle    -      400,000
Buffaloes -      260,000
Sheep     -      190,000
Goats     -      390,000
In addition, there was a poultry population of about 750,000 birds, and small num-
bers of horses, mules and camels.
30        Despite the importance of the sector, the genetic quality and the pro-
ductivity of all classes of livestock are low: animals are generally of non-
descript breeding, and are subject to considerable stress from nutritional defici-
ency and disease incidence0 Approximately 70% of the feed requirements is derived
from grazing of forest areas or cut grass hay (Table 13)o The balance is made up
primarily of by-products from cropping activities: purposive fodder production is
negligible0
4.        The high livestock numbers and the lack of proper grazing control combine
to create a serious and increasing problem of overgrazing in the State (para 47).
While the problem is generally recognised, the solution is evasive, as many tech-
nical and socio-political factors are involved0 Many measures will be necessary
if the overgrazing problem is to be corrected in the future, These include:
(i) improving the efficiency of utilisation of feed resources;
(ii) exploiting the potential for increasing fodder production on
cultivated areas;
1/   Mission estimates, derived from Table 1.

(iii) improving the productivity of the rangeland areas;
(iv) upgrading the productivity of the livestock kept;
(v) reducing or eliminating the goat population; and
(vi) reducing the number of animal units kept.
5.        Cattle. The cattle population of approximately 400,000 is comprised
almost entirely of small, non-descript village cattle, locally known as "tdesil"
cattle. These are usually kept in small units of 1-5 head. The number of cattle
of recognized breeds is unknown, but is probably fewer than 10 , being mostly
Dhanni-cross or purebred Dhanni, a popular draft breed from the northI.ern i>m j:
A few Red Sindhi animals are kept for milk production.
6.        The primary function of the cattle population is the provision of draft
for ploughing purposes0 There are about 165,000 adult working males which are
used in pairs with a yoke harness and wooden tine plough. This number represents
a ratio of one bullock pair to about 6 acres of cultivated land, an adequate ratio
for the existing intensity of land use0 1/ However, because of the small size of
farm, many farms have only one or no draft animals9  The ratio of bullock pairs to
farm holdings is only 1:2.5., and thus farmers often depend on informal borrowing
or hiring to meet their draft requirements. Cows are rarely used for draft purposes.
7.        Mjilk, meat and manure are products of secondary importance: cows are
kept primarily for the purposes of rearing more draft bullocks. Female calves
not required for replacement purposes are therefore disposed of at the end of their
dam's lactation, and female calf mortality is significantly higher than that for
male calves, which are reared more carefully. This functional specialisation is
reflected in the herd composition (Table 2), which indicates that adult males
comprise 42% of the total herd, whereas adult females comprise 32%.
8.        Cattle are grazed on common grazing land for most of the year.  During
the summer months, many are taken to alpine pastures at higher altitudes, and
during the winter months in colder areas, cattle are housed indoors and fed pre-
dominantly on hay and cereal residues0 In the southern areas (South Kotli and
Mirpur Districts), fodder crops such as Egyptian Clover are commonly fed, together
with some concentrates such as mustard seed cake and cottonseed cake.
90        In addition to nutritional stress, diseases such as roundworm, liverfluke,
blackquarter and haemorragic septicaemia are common. Foot and mouth disease is
present, but outbreaks are rare. No data on performance characteristics exist,
but productivity is low and is probably considerably inferior to that of village
herds iA Punjab province.
10.       Neither cattle nor buffaloes are kept for meat production.  Beef is a
by-product obtained when animals are slaughtered after their useful life, and
therefore tends to be tough and unpalatable. Mutton from sheep or goats is generally
1/   c.f. the ratio in the Punjab of one bullock pair for about 10 to 12 acres
at prevailing cropping intensities of 110%.



TECHNTICAI ANNE( 9

preferred to beef as a meat. Slaughtering conditions in the village are
uncontrolled. Slaughter-houses located in the towns are subject to a cursory
veterinary inspection by the Department of Animal Husbandry, but hygenic con-
ditions cannot be imposed due to the lack of appropriate legislation. Retail
beef prices are fixed at Rp 5.6 per kg.
11.       Buffaloes. The herd composition of the buffalo population reflects
more functional specialisation than for cattle. Of the approximately 260,000
buffaloes, about 70% are mature females kept solely for milk production (Table 2).
Most of the buffaloes are of non-descript "desi" type, with small frames, poor
udder development, and low milk yield. Small numbers of an improved breed
(Nili-Ravi) are present, usually purchased from markets in the Punjab.
12.       Typically, a farm family would keep one or two buffalo cows with
followers.  Those in milk are stall fed, the diet consisting basically of
roughage (cut hay and crop residues), with some grazing, Supplementation with
2-5 kg day of cottonseed cake is common for the higher yielding milkers. Milk
surplus to family requirements is sold, or converted to ghee.   Female calves are
carefully looked after, but male calves are generally poorly fed and mortality
amongst them is high. Few adult males are maintained: farmers pay a service
charge of Rp 10-20 to those farmers keeping bulls.
13.       As with cattle, nutritional and disease stresses limit the productivity
of the herd. The disease pattern in buffaloes is similar to that for cattle,
except that the incidence of haemorragic septicaemia is higher. No data are
available on village production parameters, but performance levels are likely to
be inferior to those for the Punjab. Tanner (1976, mimeographed paper) has esti-
mated the annual milk production of a buffalo cow to be 1,290 liters in Mirpur
district (one lactation per year), and only 330 liters in Muzaffarabad district
(three lactations in five years).
14.       With the present availability of animal feed, especially the low levels
of good quality fodder, the buffalo appears to be the rational choice of animal to
provide for the individual family's milk consumption requirements. The primary
sources of feed available at present to most farmers during the winter months are
low quality cut hay and cereal residues. Unlike a cow, a buffalo is able to
produce about two-four liters of milk per day on su3h a high roughage, low protein
diet.
Approximately 75% of the milk produced in the state at present is deri-ved
from buffaloes (Table 1). Organized marketing exists only in the vicinity of the
urban centers, where private traders colle-t and market the milk to local shops
and hotels0 There is no control over milk quality, and adulteretion of milk is
commonplace. The retail price of milk is fixed at Rp 2.8 per kg, although milk
traded privately by farmers (and 'guaranteed" unadulterated) sells for up to Rp 4L4
per kg0
16.       Sheep and Goats. Sheep and goats are usually kept in small, mixed flocks,
and depend primarily upon grazing for their feed resources0 Most flocks are kept
under a transhumant system, i.e., they are kept in valley areas for most of the
year, but are herded to adjoining upland pastures during the summer months0 Some
small household flocks of sheep are kept purely for fattening for sacrificial
purposes. Both the sheep and goat populations are primarily composed of animals
of non-descript breed: the sheep are small-framed with thin tails and coarse wool;
the goats vary widely in body size and length of hair. Small numbers of distinct



Page L
breeds are present; in a remr7te northern area of the Neelum Valley, an indigenous
- ne-wooleed sheep breed known as Kail is found, and highly prized by the local
and nomadic shepherds; and in the southern part of the State, increasing numbers
of the small bodied, prolific-breed-ng Teddy goats are kept0
17.       Data on production parameters are lacking.   However, lambing rates are
thought to be about 80%, whereas kidding rates are higher because of a much
greater incidence of twinning in the goat population. Sheep are usually shorn
t-wice annually, and yield only 3-4 lbs of coarse wool per year. Wool is used for
weaving of rugs and blankets in home-based cottage industries, for which brown
and black fleeces are particularly prized. Goats are rarely shorn for hair, but
are often milked for family consumption (one doe yielding up to 115 kg of milk
per year in excess of kid requirements). Mature animals generally weight only
about 27 kg liveweight.
1 80      Mortality rates are thought to be high (approximately 20% to one year of
age), primarily because of the period of severe nutritional stress during the
winter months. Disease problems are more severe in sheep, particularly internal
parasites (such as liverfluke and lungworm) which have been shown in a survey to
have a very high rate of incidence.
19,       7here is no formal marketing system: animals are sold to livestock
traders in the village, who operate on a commission basis for local butchers or
for the armry (which represents an unknown but very significant part of the local
market). There is, however, some control over slaughtering conditions in the
urban areas: butchers pav a nominal fee (PRs 0.50/animal) for slaughtering and
dressing services in Council abattoir, Purchase price3 vary according to season,
but generally are approximately PRs 5.   per kg liveweight. Retail mutton prices
ire fixed et. PRs 11.1 per kg.
20.       AT current price Levels, farmers aplparently find it more profitable to
keep goats rather than sheep, particularly as yields and quality of wocl are low,
and goats have greater reproduztive efficiency, fewer disease problems, and the
added benefit of 7ielding milk, 'he goats, however, because of their non-selective
grazing habits, and particularly tr-eir darnage to tree seed'ings and shrubs, present
a serious threat to the State's Lcres'. r-esorces.  Previoilu- legislative attempts
to eradicate the goat       f failed, and the St-ate is fac-. -With a arery Tf ere problem.
*10      Poultry.  Poultry production in Azad Kashmir consists -almost entirely
of village production using non-descript "'Desi" birds, which are kept in small
flocks around most households under a scavenging no-cost system0   Commercial
poultry production with caged birds and intensive management is limited to the
overnment Poultry Farm in Muzaffarabad, and a few small private units in Kotli
and Mirpur Districts.
22.       The indigenous "Desi" fowl is a low producing bird, but is hardy and
well adapted to the local village conditions0 Birds reach a liveweight of about
0,7 kg at three months, and females lay about h4 eggs per year. Both eggs and
meat command high prices in the market: eggs, although small, sell] for Frs 0.5 each;
birds are sold live for approximately PRs 12 per kg, A typical household flock
consists of about five birds0 However, because of the well-dispersed pattern of
settlement in the rural areas, the UNDP Poultry Advisor has estimated that the
feed resources from scavenging around each household would support at least twice
as many birds; the numbers currently kept are low primarily because of high
mortalities from disease outbreaks.

230       The disease of majcr irrportance in preventing a buildup in the poultrl-
population is Newcastle Disease, which can be controlled only by regUiar vaccin-
ation of birds three or four times a year. Other important disoa_es are Mareks_
Leucosis, Fowl Pox and Fowl Cholera, altuhough the incidence of these is not
known, The Health Extension service of the Department of Animal Husbandry con-
ducts a regular vacciration program, but the number of birds regularly covered Is
prcbably less than 50,00O   A recent UIDr Poultry Project (para 37) has as its
major thrust the organization of an effective mass vaccination program ov-er the
entire State.
24.       The Nomadic Flocks, Twice each year, over 13000 nomadic families with
their flocks of sheep and goats traverse the state on their way to and from
summer grazing areas. The nomads, who are officially stateless (most having their
origins in Indian-occupied Kashmir), spend the winter months in the cropping areas
of the Punjab grazing stubbles and waste areas, and adjoining low-lying rangelands.
They rnigratc annually to alpine pastures in the Northwest Frontier Province and
Gqlgit Agency. En route, they pass through Azad Kashmir along well-defined corri-
dors, which fan out from the river crossings over the Jhelum River, converge for
a time along a corridor beside the Neelum Valley, then branch off in different
directions to their remote destinations outside Azad Kashmir.
25o       The exact number of nomadic animals is not knmwn, but is thought to total
approximately 90,000 goats and 44,000 sheep. These are generally shepherded in
flocks of 70 to 130 head. The animals are of high genetic quality, since the no-
mads have been skilled practical animal breeders for generations. Their interaction
with the local population is limited to purchase of Kail rams at premium prices,
and to regular arrangements with particular farmers along the routes, who allowJ
the flocks to camp overnight on their fields in return for the benefits from the
manure deposited. The movement and grazing habits of the nomads are not subject
to any control. While the impact cf their grazing on the State as a whole is
insignificant, t,e lcc'Lized effect of the hi&h grazing pressures alcng the
corrid]ors (para jo) is a significant factor contributing to overgrazing and erosion,
and preventing regeneration of forests.

Investigation Laboratory in Muzaffara.bad, staffed by a Disease Investigaticn
Cfficer, Research Officer, and supporting staff of Research Officer,
Research Assistant and four Laboratory A.ssistants.  This laboratory
provides a diagnosis service to the veterinary hospitals, snd undertakes disease
survey work.
Breed Improvement
31.       "Breeding Centers"0   The extensicn work in livestock produlction has
been confir.ed almost entirely tc a breed improvement program involving the dis-
tributicn of improved bulls, rams, bucks and st;Mlions.  Each animal rlaced in
a village is referred to as a "breeding nenter".  Anirvals are prnoided' free to
selected custodian farmers, who are provided with rmaintenarce allowanc-er (PRs 1CC
per morth for bul2s, ERs 20 per month for rams an-] bucks, FIRs 200 per month for
hcrse stallions, and PlRs 300 per month for donkey stallions), and are expected tc
nake the animals available to surrounding farmers without service fees, and to
maintain records of matings and births. The centers are visited regularly by
veterinary extension staff, and provided with full health coverage. Although
breeding center establishmenit has been undertaken by the department since 19h8,
the number of animals distributed and the impact on the livestock population have
-eern mrninm.'i (Table 5)Q  At present. '0 bulls, 31 buffaloes, 32 rams and a few
s-tallions and bucks are being maintained as breeding centers: the average number
of births recorded per center Fer year is 1lL, 19 and 23 for cattle, buffalo and
sheep centers respectively.  In each case, the number of improved progern resulting
from the breeding center program each is less than 0O4% of the total population.
32.       Lachrat Government Sheep 2arm. The sheep farrm wac established by the
department in 1960, with the objective of undertaking breeding research, and
producing improved fine wool rams for distribution to farmers. The farm is situated
on a 500 acre site in a chir-pine forest zone in the Neelun Valley. Tn 1970,
administration of the farm was transferred to the Forestry Department, although
technical responsibility for management of the flock and breeding program remains
with the Animal Husbandry Department. The breeding program of the farm has been
devoted to the development of a fine wool sheep adapted to the local conditions.
After some small-scale experimentation, a program crossing import.ed Rambouillet rams
with local Kail ewes was begun, with the progern being backerossed twice to
Rambouillet to produce the "Topcross" ram for distribution, as follows:

-I ewe   x       Rambouillet ram   Eo Backcross
Backcross ewe x  Hambouillet ram      ? Topcross.
Early indications of Topcross performances (Table 6) (based on very
_rall samples) were encouraging: average fleece yield of greasy wool was about
l lbs(c.f.Kail, h lbs), live weight of ewes was about 80 lbs at 18 months
c.f. Kail, 5o), and fiber diameter of the fleece was 19. micron (c.f. Kail,
32)   However, the early promise of the program has not subsequently been borne
out: the breeding program, for a number of technical and administrative reasons,
has been little more than a holding operation. Lambing percentages have not
reached more than 63%, and the overall h year average is less than 50%; and
mortality rates of young and adult stock have been consistently over 10%. As a
result of these poor performances, the culling rate has been necessarily low (less
than 5%), and the nucleus of breeding ewes has been able to do little else but
replace itself. After 15 years of breeding, a total of 8 active Topcross rams
has been bred, and an output capacity of approximately 12 rams per year reached.
Details of the Flock Register for recent years are shown in Table 7.
34lv      The output of the breeding program has been disappointing and the
quality of stock and performance characteristics appear to be well below early
expectations0  The original stock of 6 Rambouillet rams purchased from Punjab
province has declined to 2 active rams, and no new Rambouillet blood has been
added to the system. 1/ The stock of Kail ewes was supplemented in 1974, but
many ewes were not purebred and progeny are not breeding true to Kail characteristics.
Scanty data on yields of greasy wool from the flock indicate average performances
well below the somewhat idealised projections summarized in Table 6. No evaluation
of the impact of the few rams distributed has been made, to judge whether a
measurable increase in productivity results from the crossing of a "Topcross" ram
with the local"Desill ewe.
35.       One of the principal reasons for the poor performance of the Government
Sheep Farm is the total unsuitability of the site, which is essentially a mature
chir pine forest with a cold aspect and inadequate grazing area. Until last year,
no timber clearing or pasture improvement work had been carried out, as the area
was subject to forestry regulations0 In addition, the joint administrative arrange-
ment has not proved satisfactory: since 1973, no professional officer of the Animal
Husbandry Department has been stationed at the farm, and the breeding program has
been left entirely in the hands of a senior stock assistant with minimal technical
supervision.
36.       The sheep farm has thus minimal value as a base for developing a sheep
improvement program in the State: any breed improvement program, therefore, will
have to rely on imported genetic material (whether as semen or purchased rams).
1/   The quality and genetic purity of the original rams is believed to have
been poor.

37.       UNDP Pouitry Project.   A three-year UNDP project 1/ was initiated in
December 1976, covering the four provinces of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. The
project was preceded in Azad Kashmir and the Punjab by a twelve-month "preparatory
phaseW. The project is focussed kqpon the village scavenger chickens, with the
following objectives:
(a)  to provide mass prophylactic vaccination to all village scavenger
birds against contagious diseases;
(b)  to establish the most suitable type of chicken and feed supplements
for different ruiral areas;
(c)  to provide villagers with improved poultry stock; and
(d)  to train school children and villagers in improved poultry
husbandry systems.
38.       The project is expected to benefit almost all rural families in Azad
Kashmir over the three-year period, by doubling the production of poultry meat and
eggs. This would be achieved primriarily by lowering the presently high mortality
rates through vaccination and the introduction of elementary management practices.
Promotion of supplemental feeding practices and the appropriate type of bird for
village conditions would also increase the productivity of each bird kept. The
preject, with its emphasis on preventative health treatment and widespread coverage
based on maximum local participation, should provide the department with valuable
experience in methods to extend the health coverage of other classes of stock.

0.       The project will place heavy demands on the technical staff resources
of Animal Husbandry Department: it. is articipated that when fully urnderway, 24
graduate staff and 161 staff of grade 5 and 8 status would be involved in the pro-
ject (excluding non-technical staff requirements). The prcnect includes, therefore,
extensive provision for staff training, including short-term coLrses at the Poultry
Research Institute in Karachi, training of matriculants to Stock Assistant level
in Muzaffarabad, and the provision of refresher training courses to staff at each
of the four district headquarters. A resident FAO Poultry Husbandry Specialist is
,provided under the project and is in the post.
41o       UNDP Livestock and Dairy Development Project.  Under a separate UNDP
financed program 1/, the AHD has available the services of a resident FAO Animal
Husbandry Specialist. The three-year national program provides FAO advisory staff
in all four provinces ard Azad Kashmir, and a Chief Advisor to the National
Livestock Development Committee in Islamabad. Provision is also made for 36 man-
months of consultancies as and when required, and for overseas study tours for
twelve senior officers. The objectives of the project include, inter alia, assistance
to the provincial and Azad Kashmir governments in:
(a) preparing coordinated livestock and dairy development plans;
(b) improving the marketing of livestock products;
(c) promoting milk and meat production by improved management, feeding
and health control and forage crop production;
(d) training of livestock and dairy development staff at all levels;
and
(e) identification and preparation of investment programs in the
livestock sector.
42.       Other schemes.  Two other small program  are presently being undertaken
by the AHD. One is a scheme for improving the Muizaffarabad milk supply, which
invclves the provision of Government subsidies to assist farmers in the vicinity
of Mazaffarabad to purchase improved cattle or buffalo cows. They are then provided
extension advice and veterinary services to enable them to supply milk to the urban
market. The other is a pilot scheme for promoting sheep production in the Neelum
Valley, involving extension advice and government subsidy for the establishment of
50 small (4O-ewe) sheep farms.
43.       Ongoing and NewJ Schemes proposed for the Fifth Six-Year Plan. Ongoing
sch;emes (totalling P s 1223 million) still in the development budget of the depart-
ment and to be continued imder the Fifth Six-Year rlan (1977-83) include the

45.       The budgetary allocation to the AHD for the Fifth Six-year plan had not
been determined at the time of the appraisal mission. However, there is a possi-
bility that the full amount requested, based on the abova schemes and estimated
costs, would not be allocated.   In this event, the AHD would need to revise the
proposals and determine those priority proposals which should be undertaken during

46.       Because of the chronic shortage of livestock feed and its severe impact
on the productivity of the livestock population, an attempt has been made to assess
the overall feed balance situation in the State. The objectives of the exercise
were as f(loWS:
(a)  to indicate the major sources of animal feed under current mana-
gement practices;
(b)  to assess the relative importance of the migratory nomadic flocks;

(c) to assess the distribution of existing feed resources between the
different classes of stock.
47.       Assessments of Overgrazing. The deleterious impact of overgrazing on
the forest resources of the State has long been recognized. In a chapter of the
book, "Forests of India", the grazing of both buffaloes and goats is referred to
as the Kashmir Forest Department's number one problem. In a graphic description,
the devastating impact of overgrazing on the Jammu foothills is described: 1/
"One hundred years ago this part of the State was densely wooded;
it was shown on the earlier survey sheets as forest. But by the
early part of the present century, little of this remained. Natural
vegetation, with the exception of useless shrubs, which even goats
will not eat, had been destroyed. Springs had dried up, ravines
had formed, and cultivation had been destroyed by spates 2/ from
the hills. In fact, in many places the people were already finding
it difficult to obtain a livelihood for themselves or grazing for
their half-starved cattle."
48.       The depletion of forest resources in the State, of course, results as
much from population pressure and the attendant illicit tree falling, as from
overgrazing effects. Nevertheless, the State appears to be facing a serious
deterioration of its land resource base., and the impact of the high livestock
numbers (particularly goats) is highly significant. A more recent assessment of
the effect of overgrazing 3/ is that the grazing capacity of the Neelum Valley
area has been reduced by 7'-90% of their potential productive capacity: "where one
acre could support a sheep, 4-10 acres are required now for the same purpose."
49.       Nutrient requirements.  The annual nutrient requirements of the State's
livestock population (Table b) and the nomadic flocks (Table 9) were estimated by
the mission. The per head requirements of Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) and
Digestible Protein (DP) used for each class of livestock were extracted from the
1974 FAO/World Bank Iivestock Sector Survey, and are considered to be conservative,
and appropriate for small animals with low levels of productivity. These per head
requirements were applied to the 1972 Livestock Census of Pakistan figures, although
projections of inter-censal growth rates suggest that the present livestock popu-
lation may be somewhat higher.
50.       The annual nutrient requirements of the livestock population (Tables
8 and 9) are summarized below:

51.       Importance of nomadic flocks. The above table indicates that the
impact of the nomadic flocks is negligible in terms of the overall livestock
feed requirements of the livestock population. Their localised impact along
the traditional stock routes or corridors, and in particular the Neelum Valley
corridor, is assessed roughly below:
(i)  Impact on all corridors.
There are approximately 300 miles of nomadic stock routes within
Azad Kashmir. Allowing a corridor -width of 1 mile, this repre-
sents an affected area of 300 square miles, or 192,000 acres.
This in turn represents       192 000  or 7' of total area of state.
7 t376 160
To compare the relative importance of the nomadic flocks to local
livestock population in these corridors, the nutrient requirements
of the nomadic flocks (over a period of four months, Table 13) are
compared below with those of the local livestock in those areas,
estimated pro rata from the area, i.e., 7% of the total livestock
population's requirements.

(ii) Impact on Neelum Valley Corridor.
The longest route (riollar, Kotli, Bagh, Dhani, Sharda, Kail, and
Helmet) is approximately 150 miles in length; the shortest route
(Ullan, Muzaffarabad, Dhani, and Sharda) is about 85 miles0 For
the purposes of' the exercise, average distance traversed is assumed
to be 120 miles each way.  The Neelum Ilalley corridor, through which
every route passes, is approximately 45 mi'es long; therefare, on

average each individual flock spends 45/120 (40Q) of its
total traveling time in the Neelum Valley, The nomadic
flocks nutrient requirements in the Neelum Valley corridor
are therefore approximately [0% of the total nomadic requirements.
The area of Neelum Valley corridor (45 square miles, represents
1% of the total area of the state, and therefore the local live-
stock population's nutrient requirements are approximately 10 of
the state's total. Thus, the nutrient requirements of the nomadic
flocks are compared with those of the local livestock population

52.       Nutrient Availability. Estimation of the total nutrient availability
from various sources of feed within the State is a far more provisional exercise.
Table 10 outlines a tentative breakdown of the total larnd area into the relevant
land-use categories: forest (commercial and non-commercial.); cualtivated, fallow
and non-arable farm areas; and non-farm areas (11shanlat", residential and waste
area)0 Tables 11 and 12 outline the estimated unit nutrient availability from
various cropland and rangeland sources, respectively.
53.       By applying the appropriate factors to the areas under each land-use
category, a rough breakdow,n of the total nutr-ent availability from each source
was derived and shown in Table 13, Th-s tahle is summarized below,, and compared
with the estimated total nutrient requirements.

Difference::C,
5h.       The degree of overgrazing of the rangeland areas cannot be directly
quantified from the livestock feed balance model.   1/   Since the feed requirements
estimate is considered to be conservative (para 49), and the actual level of
productivity of the rangelands is probably below the estimated poLential r&:ic i-
vity (as a result of overgrazing), the difference between theoretical nutrient
requirements and availability is conceivably much greater than the 51 calculated
above. Substantive differences could only be interpreted as indicating unreliable
data, or extreme morbidity and low performance of the livestock population0
55.       Conclusions.   The above analyses provide support for the following
general conclusions:
(i)  the cattle and buffalo populations together constitute the
source of nearly ninety percent of the total demand for livestock
feed resources;
(ii) the impact of the nomadic flocks is confined to localised corridors;
in the Neelum Valley corridor, their annual demand for feed
resources approaches one-fourth that of the local livestock potOu-
lation; and
(iii)  the single most important source of livestock feed is grazing of
the forest areas, which accounts for an estimated 60-65% of the
total nutrient availability. 2/
1/   This would require substantial time-series data on the dry matter
productivity and carrying capacity for representative sites.
2/   The potential level of productivity of these rangeland areas has been
estimated very crudely from scanty data from the adjoining Hazara District,
and after making several simplifying assumptions (Table 12). However, the
model developed is extremely sensitive to the parameters applied to this
land-use category.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 9
Page 15
56.       Potential for Increasing Feed Resources.    While there is some
potential for increasing the productivity of the dominant feed resource, the
forest areas, there are many formidable technical and institutional factors to
be first overcome. On the other hand, there is considerable potential for rapid
increases in fodder production on the areas under control of the individual farmers,
both cultivated and non-cultivated. A brief outline of the expected potential
for each category of land resource is given below:
(a) Forest areas/rangeland. The Forestry Department, under its
iXeelum Valley Rangeland Scheme for the Fourth Five-Year Plan,
attempted an ambitious program of developing four rangeland areas
totaling 12,000 acres. The range improvement practices were to
include resting of over-grazed areas, weed eradication, artificial
seeding of denuded areas, improvement, of livestock watering
facilities, fencing of demonstration areas, nursery and demonstra-
tion areas, nursery and demonstration plots, and control of public
grazing in project areas. The mission was not able to assess
the impact of the project, as the summer pasture areas were
snow-covered. However, the nursery plcts examined appeare&' to
have been abandoned, and reports of progress in other aspects of
the scheme were disappointing.   Strong resistance from the local
population was encountered, since the attempt at institating
grazing control in the areas apparently infringed on the traditiona'
rights of access to grazing in the forest areas. Since the main-
tenance of even the nirsent levels of productivity of the forest
areas is dependent upon the rationalization of the grazing mana-
gement, considerable efforts must be devoted to educating and
involving the local people in th,e preservaticn ol their oat
resource.  In addition, the base of techlnical kncwledge neePds to,.
be expanded, to ascertain approriate management practices fcr each
area;
(b)  Area under grair crops.  Maize stcie-r clirrently represents aboat,
15% of total available TDM, ancl 11;1i of total a'-_ilable Digestible
Protein.  Wiith the increases in maize yields anticipated as a
result cf the agricultural program, the amcunt of stover avJ,la,b.e
for feeding to livestock will increase considerably. There is
considerable scope for improving the utilization of this resource,
by introducing chopping or chaffing and feeding in troughs.
Simple techniques of silage making from stover and bean stalks using
supplementation with molasses and urea could be devised that are
appropriate for the individual farmer (a si-ilar techniqlue using
cane-tops ensiled in plastic bags is being developed in Mauritis>'.
Similar potential exists for improving the utilizatic'n of straw
from wheat and millet crops. Summer-growing legumes (peas, beans,
lab-lab bean, etc.' could be intrcduced in rotation wi El cereal
cropping;
(c)  Area under wheat for fodder.   The 'catch as catch can" systerm of
producing wheat for fodder as a second option for an lznsucr:essful
wheat crop leaves considerable scope for rationalization. 3y



TECBNICAL ANNEX 9
Page 16
developing cultivation techniques and wheat varieties to
achieve more reliable grain yields, and by introducing varie-
ties of winter fodder crop (especially oats), farmers could be
given the option of planting both grain and fodder crops to
follow their maize. Oats is particularly suited for use as a
fodder cereal, as it can be cut several times during the winter
season, and still, if required, be grown out for grain;
(d) Area under rice cultivation. All irrigable areas currently sown
to rice during the kharif (summer) season could be sown to an
irrigated fcdder legume during winter. Isolated small patches
are alreqdv evident with "berseemn" (Trifolium alexandrium) and
"Shaftal" (Trifolium resupination) being the most common: most
stands inspected, however, looked very poor, which suggests
that there is considerable scope for improving cultivation and
irrigatiorn techniques, as well as increasing the area under
cu'Jt-T,t:on.  The appropriate species for each situation must be
de.ermireci: e.g., lucerne (IMedicago sativa) grown as an annual
on heavy souls cArn often outyield berseem;
(e)  Areas under teng-term fallow. Arable areas not. used fcr cropping
;-irF currerift:T _left wider native vcunteer grasses, all of which
:ire summer-gro-wing and dormant during winter.  There is great
potentiatl for sowing these areas to appropriate mixes of summer
an-' winter orotwing past.ure species, with a legume base.  The land
vtus under pasture could significantly increase the fodder pro-
ducticn on those areas (which are subject to grazing control as they
are part of individual farms), and at the same time serve as a
"pasture ley" phase in a long-term rotation. The few nursery
trials conducted under the Range Management Scheme in Muzaffarabad
District have demonstrated the ready adaptability of several exotic
pasture species (perennial ryegrass, cocksfoot, white clover,
lucerne and vetch); and
(f) "'-hamlat" anci non-arable farm areas, Areas currently cut for
hay, and grazed heavily during winter, can also be made more pro-
ductive by developing management systems including grazing control
and improved hay-making, preserving and feeding techniques. There
is also scope for introduction of exotic legumes and browse shrubs.
D.   Development Strategy
57.       The primary work of the Animal Husbandry Department has historically
been that of a veterinary service, providing diagnosis and clinical services to
the State's livestcck. Almost all professional and semi-professional staff have
basic training and orientation in veterinary medicine rather than in animal hus-
bandry, with the result that in the past, livestock production and development
programs have been neglected in favour of clinical and regulatory functions. The
Department has, however, moved strongly in recent years to reorientate their dev-
elopment program towards production activities, as is evidenced by the ongoing

Pagye 17
Poultry Project (para 37), the appointment of an FAO Animal Husbandry Advisor
(para il1) and the developrnent schemes proposed for incl usion n 'n `.he Fifth Six-
Year Plan (para 41)0  To effectively implement these producticn-oriented pro-ams,
the AID has recognised the need to develop a cadre cf technical staff with specific
training ir animal husbandry and livestockm producticn techniques, rather than
veterinary medicine. The training sub-component of the proposed Technical Develop-
ment Project would support the AHD's for strengthening their staff comrlenent
with staff having graduate and certifi(ate-level traiLning in arimal husbandry
(Technical Annex 10, para 21).
58.       The future development work of the AND would be greatlly facilitated by
the reorganization of the department along functional lines, tc include a specific
Livestock Development Division. A decision is pending on an applicaticn madie
by the AHD for approval tc formally reorganize the department into the fcolowing
divisions:
(a)  Veterinary Division, whose function would be to proiLde continued
clinical and diagnostic services through the network of reterinary
hospitals and dispensaries;
(b)  Disease Investigaticn Divisicn, whose funcLtiicns would be to
provtide labc,rt:,orv services to other divisions, and also to under-
tale researrh i.to im.prCoved methols of disease control;
(c)  Poultry Development Division, which would be concerned with the
implementation cf the UNDP F-oultry Proiect. ancl subsecuent. poultry

(d)  Livestock Deve]cpment Division, which would undep1.ake livestock
development, activities in--,Kuding breed .mnro  der:er:, fodier utili-
sation trials, and other proluction.-criented prcgracri.
59.       The Department shcnld focus its limited resources on areas of priorit,y
for developmernt, rather than att.empt to -a:Idert,ake the broad spectru'.t of actiP .-s

Some priority is also attached by Department to the improvement cf the urbar. milk
supply and the developmenrt of the sheep industry in the Neelum Valley. With the
excepticn of the ongoing pCul-try project, th.ese developmental activities will
recquire an initial period of staff development, field experimentation, and pi0ot
program work before large scale programs can be initiated.

61.       Increasing animal feed resources.  Despite the difficulties inherent
in quantifying the severity of the overgrazing in the State (para 5h), obser-
vations on the low productivity and general morbidity of the livestock population
(particularly in the wviiiter months) suggest that the lack of sufficient grazing
and fodder resources represents the single most important constraint on the
productivity of the livestock population. Attempts to upgrade the genetic potential
of the livestock through breed improvement would be futile unless accompanied by
significant improvements in the fodder resource base to enable genetic potential
to be expressed.
62¢       Responsibilities in the area of development of the fodder resource
base under the project would be shared between the Department of Agriculture and
the AHD. Technical Annex 2 describes the fodder production trials which would be
undertaken by the Department of Agriculture on each of the proposed Experimental!
Demonstration farms. These would both include the development of fodder crops
for cultivation in arable areas, and the introduction of perennial pasture
species for long-term fallow and non-arable farm areas.   The AX41 would focus on
development of techniques of improved fodder utilization, including more efficient
use of grass hay and crop residues, production of silage, the use of mineral
blocks and other feed supplements, and improved management practices for the
proper adjustment of animal feed rations. Details are presented in TechniclJ.
Annex 10.
63.       Breed Improvement of Cattle.  The cattle and buffaao populations accourt
for rearly ninety percent of the pressure of animal grazing on tl-e States limited
feed resources (para 55).  However, because of the traditional practice cf keeping
two separate herds for specialised functions (cattle for draft purposes and buffa-
loes for milk production), there exists the potential for achieving significant
reductions in grazing pressure through the introduction of dual-purpose cattle.
The present "two-herd" system could thereby be largely rerlaced with a single herd
of improved cattle providing both draft and milk requirements.
64.       The introduction of such a rationalised herd structure wouad require a
long-tarm program of genetic improvement of the indigenous cattle, accompanied by
major improvements in the availability of good quality feed (especially in the
winter months) and in standards of animal management and veterinary care.   Without
these parallel improvements in the resource base and managerial levels, individual
farmers are unlikely to be convinced of the superiority of any improved dual-purpcse
breed, since with the existing feed-base of poor quality roughage, buffaloes are
definitely superior in milk production to local or improved cattle (para 14)0
Additional constraints to the early response of farmers to a change in their present
practices are the farmer's scepticism regarding the utility of crossbred cattle
for draft purposes, and their preference for buffalo milk with its high butterfat
content.
65.       Experience elsewhere in the subcontinent suggest that the milk production
of indigenous cattle can be lifted dramatically by cross-breeding with exotic
milk breeds such as Jersey, Friesian or Brown Swiss.   Experience with the draft
performance of the cross-bred bullocks has been generally satisfactory when used
in plains agriculture. The objective of breed improvement of the indigenous
desi cattle in Azad Kashmir is, therefore, to significantly raise the milk pro-
duction of the cows to a noint where buffaloes need not be kept, while retaining
in the cross-bred bullocks a satisfactory level of draft performance under hilly
conditions.

66.       The breed improvement subcomponent of the proposed project would
initiate a pilot program designed to test the practicability of extending the
use of artificial insemination to a significant part of the State including the
hilly areas, and to identify a suitable dairy breed which, when crossed with the
indigenous cattle, would produce progeny with the required characteristics.

I/ Annual requirements per head are derived from Table    after totaling
requirements for each class of stock and dividing by the total n'.Mber of

flocks does not differ greatly from that of the state flocks.
2/ Assuming flocks spend on average 4 months in Azad Kashmir in transit
to and from the northern summer Dastures.

As ,stions
To estimate roughly the current product'vity of the forest and
grassland areas of the State, the folloWing simplifying aaasmptions have been
mades
(i) Forest grazing is confined to non-comrcia    forests,
which are aeied to have a canopy cover of less than
56c.
(1U) All non-commrcial forest grasses are grazed, not cut for
hay, whereas all grassland under private and communal
owmership is cut for hay and not grazed (these asaunptiona
determine the levels of TDN and DP applied to each
category).
t±4_ ) Dry-matter productivity estimated includes grass herbage and
shrub herbage bowsed by soats.
(lr) Dry-matter productivit7 of uncultivated farm areas and
"shamlat" areas is equivalent to that of the non-commercial
forest areas.
(v) Under grazing, TDI - 50% and DP      o of dry matter yiell,
whereas under a system of cuttire hay, TDN - 30% and DP - 3%.
Losses incurred durilng handling of hay are 20o.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Fodder Utilization. Breed Imvrovement. and Animal HishandrY
Training
BackEod
1,e       The Animal Husbandry Department (AMD) is at present in a state of
uncertainty with respect to its directorship which is filled by an assistant
director on additional charge, and a requested reorganization pending approval.
Implementation of the project components proposed for the livestock sector
would be greatly facilitated by the creation of a separate Livestock Production
Division fTechnical Annex 9, para 58).
2.        The UNDP Poultry Project, right3y accorded high priority by the
Department, is making substantial demands on the manpower resources of the AHD
(Technical Annex 9, para 40). After due allowance foa the continuation of the
State's veterinary services, the residual manpower available for deployment
in livestock production programs is very limited. However, the Department has
available the services of a resident FAO Advisor in Animal Husbandry, and the
AHD and FAQ have confirmed that he would be able to participate in the super-
vision of the livestock components which are proposed for the project.
3.        Two priority livestock production activities (see Technical Annex 9,
pam 59) are proposed for financing under the project together with provision
for training of additional manpower in animal husbandry. These activities
are:
(i) fodder utilisation trials: the development of fodder conser-
vation and feeding technologies; and
(ii) breed improvment: the genetic improvement of the indigenous
cattle for use as dual purpose animals.
Fodder Utiliszation
4.       The estimated contribution of total digestible nutrients and digest-
ible protein from various sourCes within the State are as follows (Technical
Annex 9, para 50):
Total      Digestible
Grazing of forest area                        60%         64%
Crop residues, including very
limited fodder production                  24%         16%
Hay froa uncultivated farm areas              13%         13%
Concentrates                                   3%           7%
100%        100%



TECHNICAL ANNEX 10
Page 2
While grazing of the forest areas currently constitutes the most important
sour(e of nutrients for livestock, there is potential for a significant
increase in both the area uneer fodder crops and permanent pasture (see
Technical Annex 9, para. 5), and the efficiency of utilization of the exist-
ing fodder resources.   At present, grass i'ay is customarily cut well after
full flowering, resulting in p{or nutrient quality;    hay storage techniques
are primitive and result in further significant losses of both quantity and
quality; crop residues are fed uncut and wastage due to trampling is high;
mineral supplementation is rare, and little knowledge of ration adjustment for
different classes and age of stock is in evidence. Techniques to improve fod-
der utilization are well established, and include improved haymaking and
storage, silage production, chaffing of crop residues, and feed supplementa-
tion (with minerals, urea and molasses). Such techniques, however, have not
been introduced into Azad Kashmir, and they would need to be adapted to suit
the conditions and resource constraints of the local farmers.
5.        The project would finance the appointment of a Livestock Officer
(Fodder) of Grade 17 level, and equip him to undertake an intensive program
of technique adaptation and carefully monitored demonstration. The program
would be confined in the first year to trials in one area (probably Dhanna,
26 miles from Muzaffarabad 1/). In the third year, activities would be
directed to promotion of tested techniques in areas surrounding the proposed
Experimental/Demonstration farms (Technical Annex 2).
6.        In the area selected, the Livestock Officer (Fodder) would
recruit approximately 30 farmers willing to participate in the program of the
trials. 2/ The trials would consist of two phases: the testing of fodder
conservation methods (hay and silage), and the subsequent testing of feeding
techniques with the sanie group of farmers. The participating farmers would
be divided into six groups of approximately equal size.    Corservation techniques
tested would include the following, together with any additional techniques
devised by AHD:
(i)  traditional havmaking and storing (control);
(ii)  traditional haymaking with improved storage;
(iii) improved haymaking with improved storage;
(iv)  silage making using a bunker silo;
(v) silage making using pit silos; and
(vi) silage making using plastic bags. 3/
1/ It is anticipated that this area woulid also be selected for the initial
phase of the breed improvement program (para. 13).
2/  Approximately 90 cattle ane 60 buffaioes should thus be included.
3/ The use of plastic bags would enable the testing of silage making, using
combinations of variotus levels of nat:''.e grass, green fodder, maize
stover, legume residue and urea/molcsses supplementation.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 10

7.        Subsequently, the farmers would be appropriately subdivided into
groups for trials of feeding techniques, including the use of simple feeding
troughs, chaffing of rations, and provision of water troughs, mineral supple-
ments and concentrates. Details of the techniques to be used would be finalized
by the AHD in consultation with the FAO Livestock Advisor, and would be predominantly
determined by the local availability of materials and labor. Techniques to be tested
in the area in the second year would be devised on the basis of results in the first
year.
8.        Each activity would be carefully monitored as to physical requirements
and costs (labor and cash inputs). The benefits, in terms of additional
nutrients made available to the livestock fed, would be assessed by measuring
total output from each technique and analyzing samples of feed for dry matter
and crude protein content.
9.        Based on the findings of the trials in the first and second years,
the Livestock Officer (Fodder) would undertake promotional activities in the
third year in the vicinity of the four Experimental/Demonstration farms proposed for
the project. He would liaise closely in this work with the Department of
Agriculture staff on the farms, especially the Agricultural Assistants (fodder).
The primary objective of the promotional activity would be to assess the response
of farmers to the improved techniques.
10.       The Livestock Officer (Fodder) would be provided with the necessary
field equipment, office, simple laboratory and laboratory equipment for dry
matter analysis, 1/ and a motorcycle for day-to-day supervision. He would be
assisted by two stock assistants residing in the area selected for trials. A
four-wheel drive jeep and trailer would also be provided. It would be assigned
to the Livestock Development Officer of the AHD, but would be available to the
Livestock Officer (Fodder) whenever required for transport of materials and
equipment. Details of physical requirements and costs are shown in Table 1,
and a job description for the Livestock Officer (Fodder) is attached as
Appendix 1.
11.       The Livestock Officer (Fodder) would be directly responsible to the
Livestock Development Officer of the AHD, and through him and the Director of
the AHD, to the Project Director. He would work closely with the FAO Livestock
Advisor on technical matters.
12.       The Livestock Development Officer would supervise and support the
activities of the Livestock Officer (Fodder), in addition to the breed improve-
ment activities financed by the proposed project, and for these purposes he
would be provided a vehicle (para. 10). He would also be responsible for the
preparation of a livestock component of a follow-up project, for which purpose
he would be responsible to the Project Director.
Breed Improvement
13.       Cattle and buffaloes are presently kept for specialized functions
(Technical Annex 9, paras. 6 and 11). Cattle are kept primarily for draft
purposes, since the draft performance of the castrated bullocks is adequate, but
the milk production of the cows is very poor. Buffaloes, on the other hand, are
able to produce adequate quantities of high butterfat milk on a high roughage
diet (which is the type of fodder resource available to most farmers), but are
unsuitable for draft purposes in hill country because of their large size and
ungainly gait. Under the present resource endowments of the typical farmer,
therefore, the "two-herd" system is rational from the individual farmer's point
1/ Crude protein analyses would be performed using spectrophotometric equipment
proposed for the soil testing laboratory, or by sending milled
samples to laboratories elsewhere for analysis.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 10

of view; it does, however, necessitate the maintenance of many more animals
than should be required. Since the cattle and buffalo populations together
represent nearly 90% of the total demand for livestock feed resources in the
State (Technical Annex 9, para 54), replacing the "two-herd" system with a
single dual purpose herd would significantly lower the intense grazing pres-
sure on the limited land resource of the State.
14.       The most likely method of achieving this would be the genetic
improvement of the local "desi" cattle, by cross-breeding with an improved
dairy breed. If this is accompanied by a simultaneous improvement in the
availability of better quality fodder (through increased fodder production
and improved fodder utilization), the farmer's resource endowment would be
sufficiently altered to induce them to replace buffaloes with crossbred cows
with equal or greater milk production.
15.       The proposed project would finance the development of improved fod-
der production (Technical Annex 2, para 14) and better fodder utilization
(para 4 above).  A program for genetic improvement of cattle, however, is
necessarily long-term in nature and poses two primary questions which need
resolution before a long term strategy for genetic improvement of cattle could
be devised. These are:
(i)  the extent to which an artificial insemination program can
effectively reach large numbers of farmers in the hill regions,
and therefore the appropriate balance between Al and natural
service required; and
(ii)  the choice of improved dairy breed(s) which, when ossed with
the local desi cows, will produce cross-bred progeny with suf-
ficiently high draft and milk performance to induce farmers to
change their traditional "two-herd" ownership pattern.
16.       The successful introduction of an artificial insemination program in
the hilly areas will require the solution of many practical difficulties.
These include:
(i) the scattered settlement pattern and small numbers of animals
per family;
(ii)  mountainous topography making regular access difficult;
(iii) resistance of local religious leaders (inmans) to the use
of AI;
(iv)  the occurrence of pronounced breeding seasons (March/April
and Sertember/October) limiting AI eOffttivens    to these
periods;
(v)  the difficulty of heat detection in local desi cows under
nutritional stress; and
(vi)  the current lack of experienced inseminators and AI equipment
in the State.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 10
Page 5
It is anticipated, however, that these difficulties can be overcome in the
following ways:
(i)  initial choice of areas with a relatively high density of
cattle;
(ii) initial choice of accessible villages in the vicinity of
established veterinary hospitals and dispensaries close to
HMzaffarabad;
(iii) the program would be operated intensively only during the
breeding seasons, with the objective of providing a daily
AI service at the village level during these periods;
(iv) village livestock owners would receive training in oestrous
detection, and would be encouraged to be vigilant in watching
for signs of its onset; and
(v) village livestock owners would receive training in artificial
insemination techniques by arrangement with an appropriate
institution in Punjab province (e.g. the Punjab Livestock
and Dairy Development Board).
170       The project would finance the initiation of an Al program in the
State, including the costs of training of inseminators; semen importation;
purchase of liquid nitrogen containers and insemination equipment; a vehicle
to facilitate supervision and the regular supply of liquid nitrogen; and
operating costs for the duration of the project. The AI program would be
designed to test the practicability of the long-term expansion of AI services
in the hilly areas of the State. In the course of the program, semen of
proven quality dairy type bulls would be imported and used, including Jersey,
Brown Swiss and other small breeds which have proven dairy merit, suitable
characteristics for draft purposes, and would be capable of adaptation to a
mountainous grazing environment. The project would also include provision
for the importation of a number of bulls of breeds having the above
characteristics, to enable:
(i) the testing of breeds for which semen is not readily available;
and
(ii) the testing of the "breeding center" approach in an inaccessible
area unsuited to AI service.
180       The program would be administered by a newly appointed Livestock
Production Officer (Grade 16), who would be directly responsible to the
Livestock Development Officer of the AHD, and through him and the Director of
the AHD, to the Project Manager. He would work closely with the FAO Livestock
Advisor on technical matters.

19.       Detailed proposals for the design and scope of the breed improvement
subcomponent, the staff and equipment requirements, and the type of semen and
bulls to be imported would be repared by the Animal Husbandry Department with
the assistance of FAO. These would be submitted to the Association for approval
before disbursement against project activities for this sub-component.  The
estimated cost of the proposed breed improvement program (Table 2) is
PRs 770,000 (US$77,000); Schedule 6 outlines (for indicative purposes only)
the likely pbysical requirements and costs of the program.
20.       The Animal Husbandry Department would closely monitor the costs and
evaluate the impact of the pilot AI program, and of any bulls which might be
imported under the project. The evaluation of these specific project activities
would be preceded by an exercise in evaluation of the impact of the breed
improvement activities already undertaken in the State. Specifically, the
19 Red Sindhi "breeding centers" maintained over the past decade would be
visited, and the traceable results recorded in a systematic format by officers
of the Department. The format for data collection would be designed by the
Livestock Development Officer in the Department, with the assistance of the
FAO Advisor, and would cover the following aspects:
(i) the performance of the distributed Red Sindhi bulls with
respect to number of progeny, longevity of service life,
disease incidence, etc;
(ii) the breed characteristics of the crossbred progeny;
(iii) the levels of feeding and health control prevailing in
each recorded situation;
(iv) the milk and draf-t power performance of the Fl and F7KY
progeny compared with local "desi" animals;
(v) the response of local farmers to the improved genetic
potential, in terms of preferred use of the exotic bull,
castration of "desill bulls, improved management and
feeding of crossbred progeny, etc;
(vi) the breeding history of the herd in the locality in the
absence of control, i.e. whether the farmers have attempted
to maintain 50/50 blood lines, have progressively upgraded
progeny towards exotic blood, or have allowed the breed
characteristics to dissipate; and
(vii) farmer attitudes as to the utility of the crossbred progeny
for milk and draft purposes.
3/ Fl and F2: First and second filial generations, respectively.

210       All animls Judged to be of at least 50% exotic blood would be
tagged and registered to allow further sonitoring of performance. A represen-
tative sample of animals would be subjeoted to supervised testa of mling and
draft performance.
22.       A cadre of graduates and field assistants with trainin  in Animal
Husbandry will be required to conduct an expanded livestock developent program
(Technical Annex 9, para 57). Provision is therfore made to finance two
strems of training:
(i) three studftb per year wold be funded to undertake the
four-year B.Sc. (Animal Husbandry) course at Lysllpur
University. The first three students would graduate in
1981; and
(ii) five Iivestock Assistants would be trained each year in
aix-month courses in Animal Husbandry conducted by the
University of ly&lpur.
23.       Funding of the training costs would be conditional upon a bonding
arrmngmnt being agreed upon, whereby a student is obliged to serve in Azad
Kashmir flloUwing graduation for a period equal to the legth of training
("year for year bonding"). Costs of the training sub-component  io SLt outJ

SPecific Duties
1*        The tveatock Officer (Fodder) would introduceo    the Stat. appropri-
ate t ehniques of fodder conservation and application, including improved
hayiaking and storage, silage production, chaffing of crop residues, and feed
supplementation. He will demonstrate and evaluate these techniques at the
village level, working in villages in the vicinity of Musaffarabad. Once
tecbniques have been locally adapted and tested, he would proaote their use
in other areas in conjunction with other project-financed activities0
2.        Spelifically, he would implament the following activities with the
cooperation and assistance of local farmers:
(i)  harvesting of grass hay at the optimun time, followed by
recoaended storage and feeding practices;
(ii) production of and feeding of silage using various methods
(bunker and lit silos, and plastic bags) and combinations
of different levels of grass,, miZe stover, green fodder,
legume residue and supplementation with urea and molasses;
(iii)  demonstration of improved feeding techniques, includiAg the
adjustment of ratimn mixtures and quantities; the use of
chaffers and simple feeding trougha; and provisio:i of water
supply; and
(iv) trial use of mineral supplements in block form.
3o        For each technology, he would record the full costs (including pur-
chased materials and labor inputs required) of providing a unit quantity of
nutrient under typical vinlage conditions, and evaluate these in comparison
to presently used ichniques. He would assess to the extent possible the pro-
duction bonefits to be expected following adoption of improved techniques, in
terms of reduced wastage of feed resources and the impact of improved
nutrition. To assist this analysis, he would perform dry matter analyges of
fodder sampleas in a laboratory supplied for thds purpose, and would arrange for
crude protein analyses to be performed locally (in the sAls laboratory) or by
outside laboratories.
4.       He will liaise closly with the Department of Agriculture with
respect to the fodder production trial work which would be performed on the
four experiaental/demonstration tkrms finaced under the project.
5.        He will assist in the preparation of a follow-up project by auppl:<r  g

2.        Ideally, a scale of 1:5,000 would be used for base maps, with
contour intervals of lm. up to not more than 3m., although a scale of 1:10,000
could be effective. The quality of aerial photography needed for both mapping
scale, in terms of definition, accuracy of flight paths and overlap is of an
exacting standard.
3.        Survey of Pakistan are examining the capability for undertaking
mapping photography at this standard, assessing the availability of carto-
graphic equipment, and staff time for undertaking map production, review-
ing the cost provisions for these activities, and, suggesting possible
alternatives if present capacity is inadequate.

PAKISTAN
HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Land Use and Development Planning
Background
1.        The total area of Azad Kashmir is about 4,500 miles     (2,880,000
acres), of which the cultivated area is approximately 510,000 acres. The
remaining area is composed of some 1,440,000 acres of forests, 140,000 acres
non-arable farm-land, 360,000 acres of non-arable shamlat (= joint ownership)
land, 400,000 acres wasteland, including river beds, and 30,000 acres
residential areas. These data, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, are
approximate and should be regarded as indicative. They are largely derived
from the 1972 Tehsil census, which provides a basis for tax assessment in
cultivated lands, and may understate the areas actually under cultivation.
Moreover, it is known that encroachment by cultivators has taken place in some
forest areas. There is also the likelihood that some areas classified as
cultivable have become waste lands because of the rapid soil erosion taking
place over much of the area.
2.        An assessment of land use and land capability was undertaken in
1959-61 by Hunting Technical Services Ltd., as part of the Mangla Watershed
Mlanagement Study commissioned by WAPDA. Whilst this is now outdated, because
of changes which have taken place in the last 20 years in human and livestock
populations and land classifications, it provided a comprehensive assessment
of the physical characteristics, cropping patterns, human and animal popula-
tions of a large part of Azad Kashmir, and provides a preliminary basis for
developing systematic land use activities which can arrest and subsequently
diminish soil erosion, and at the same time achieve improved production in
agriculture, livestock and forestry. A comparison of the data contained in
the study with updated data indicates that human and animal populations have
about doubled during the past 25 years; during the same period, the area under
cultivation has increased by about 50%; see Table 3. The study emphasized the
precarious balance between land capability and actual land use which then
existed. The increased pressure on the land which has since taken place must
have substantially worsened this position and a reassessment of land use and
land capability, based on updated aerial photography is urgently needed.
It should also be noted that the aerial photography used for the Hunting s
study (now 20 years' old) only covered about half the land area of Azad
Kashmir.
3.        The primary objective of the study was the preparation of a plan
for reducing the sediment load of the Jhelum river into the Mangla dam.
To this extent, it is a macro study which attempts to assess and indicate
treatments for the whole watershed. The study makes explicit the need



TECHNICAL ANNEX 11
Page 2
to arrive at this objective through a series of sub-watershed plans. WAPDA
has used this principle in their approach to the Mangla watershed Develop-
ment Project.
4.        Copies of the report are available with WAPDA and have been sent
to the project manager (designate). Accompanying the original report were sets
of land use and land capability maps at 1/50,000 scale. Master copies of
these are with the Survey of Pakistan, Islamabad.
Work Program
5.        The land use and development planning section would assess present
land use, develop a land classification system and prepare sub-watershed
development plans embracing food and fodder crops, tree crops, vegetables
and livestock, with associated soil conservation works, roads, bridges and
storage/marketing facilities. Plans would be developed in cooperation with
the farmers and line departments and take into account the development of
technical packages, extension programs for apples and vegetables production,
etc., and the ownership and land holding patterns of the sub-watersheds.
Initially, emphasis will need to be given to the assembly of base data,
production of base maps and training of staff in methodology and approach.
When fully operative, it is expected the section will produce development
plans for sub-watersheds covering about 100,000 acres/year.
Detailed Features
6.        (a)  Updated Aerial Photography would be provided at 1/30,000
scale. Survey of Pakistan have indicated that proposals for aerial
photography have been agreed with GOAK and this would be undertaken by
the Pakistan Air Force, with Survey of Pakistan providing ground
support. The photography would be of a standard for land use identification
and also the production of accurate topographical maps at a scale of
1:5,000 or 1:10,000. It would also provide a basis for the future updating
of the forest inventory.
(b) From initial examination of the photography, areas would be
selected for the production of topographical base maps for detailed planning
a scale of 1/5,000 or 1/10,000 is recommended, with not less than 3m. contour
intervals.
(c) A Land Classification system would be developed taking account
of systems currently in use and work previously carried out for the area
(e.g., Hunting's Report Vol. 1, App. A).
(d) Present Land Use patterns would be recorded and assessment
made of suitability of these within the framework of maintaining productivity
and stabilization of soil.
(e) Land capability, in the sense of sustainable land use under
various activities, would be assessed and development plans prepared for
the sub-watersheds. The section would liaise with line Departments in
developing cropping patterns and assessing suitability of specific areas



TECHNICAL ANNEX Li
Ca!ge 3
for implementation of the technical packages being develoeJd in food a.nd
fodder crops, livestock feeding, apples, vegetables, fuelj2)(l, etc.
(f)  Soils analysis, whichi would be undertaken by the DepartL&nt
of Agriculture (see Technical Annex 5), and assessment of nuitrient r-ld
trace element deficiencies, would also be incorporated in this asst:s,3mnent.
(g)  Soil conservation techniques, both biological and phiysical,
would be defined for maintaining productivity of the various cropping
patterns prescribed for the sub-watersheds based on economic evaluation of
the systems being developed.
(h)  Areas would be selected for minor irrigation developierf: ind,
in collaboration with Department of Agriculture and PIP, suitable systems
for water delivery and drainage would be designed.
(i) In collaboration with PWD and PWP, road and feeder track
densities to service planned production activities would be established and
road traces selected.
(j) In collaboration with line departments siting of input dis-
tribution/marketing centers to serve production areas.
Complementary Actions
7.        Project management, in collaboration with the concerned line
departments, would assemble additional data and activity proposals to be
incorporated in the sub-watershed plans, (see Technical Annex 12). Com-
plementary data would include:
(a) Land Holding Patterns, defining areas of holdings under
the different categories of single joint and common
ownership; single, joint and common tenancy.
(b) Land Usage Patterns, including rights, concessions
and customary usage of State land.
(c) Economic analysis of present land holding and land usage
patterns to demonstrate present position of farm-family
incomes and changed position under proposed land use
cropping pattern changes.
(d) Demographic data of permanent residents (age/sex distribution)
and migratory population. Distribution of economic activities
between farm-families. Assessment of present labor availability
for specific job functions, indicating seasonal distribution.
Assessment of additional labor inputs required to carry out
proposed development activities and reconciliation of these
with assessed labor availability.

Staffing
8.        A land use planning specialist, (internationally recruited) re-
sponsible to the project manager, would head the section and be assisted
by a team including a socio/economist wlho would take prime responsibility
for the activities discussed in para. 7, three surveyors, three cartographers
and clerical staff. In developing sub-warershed plans, the section would
work with line department officers of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Forestry and WAPDA field supervisors. Job descriptions and qualifications
for the land use planning specialist and socio/economist are contained in
Appendix IA and Appendix 1B respectively.
Equipment
9.        A preiIminary list of equipment is included in Appendix    .   Tnis
includes provision for photogrammetric eauiment for the reprod-ctcI o'
1/10,000 or 1/5,000 base maps from aeria' photography. Since the capacitv of
this machine would he greatirr  A-HS thp  Z   '        rcquArements, it is
proposed to install this a, -Loirvev )L  :       heaGcuarters where its tulC

Aerial Photqgrapihy
10.       It is presently proposed that aerial photography would be under-
taken by the Pakistan Air Force, through arrangements withi Survey of Pakistan
who would supply ground support.   The scale proposed is 1/30,000.   Estimated
total costs are PRs.    million, based on flying/photo cost of PRs. 160/mile
(PRs. 720,000) plls ground support, and reproduction of prints.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ProJect Management and Follow-Up Project Preparation
Introduction
1.         The various activities of the Project would require monitoring,
coordinating, and, several complementary actions by project management.
For example, whilst the technical departments can be expected to address
wholly technical problems, they would need assistance in securing farmer
responses, arranging credit facilities, preparing itineraries for
consultants and arranging training programs.
2.         Project activities would generate a substantial part of the
data required for the preparation of a follow-up project. These data
will however need to be complemented by additional information including
data on population, farm size and tenure systems, employment patterns,
marketing and storage, credit, roads, rural industries and handicrafts,
health and education. The project management would be responsible for
collating this additional information, combining this with the results
of the Project and preparing the follow-up project. The approach to
project preparation would be on the basis of the aggregation of individual.
sub-watershed/village development plans, as outlined in Technical Annex l1.
Project Management
3.         The Project would be under the management of a project director of
secretary rank, who would be responsible to a Project Development Committee
composed of the Chief Secretary as Chairman, the Development Commissioner
and Secretary for Finance. A new post for the project director would be
created of Secretary for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Special Project
(the Project). The proposed management structure closely follows the
present organization of Government. A13 deve]opment proposals a.e current]y
submitted by departmental secretaries to the Development Commissioner
whose function is to coordinate departmental proposals, review these with
heads of departments and Secretary for Finance, and submit to the Chief
Secretary for presentation to Government. Accordingly, the project director
as Secretary for Agriculture and Animal Husbandry would be following
existing procedure with respect to these sectors.
4.         For coordinating and monitoring the forestry activities financed
by the Project, and the various tasks for follow-up project preparation
involving other departments (see below), the Project Development Committee
would direct the project directorin setting up the necessary working relation-
ships with the departments concerned. Project funds would be channelled
through the project directorwho would maintain accounts in line with the
practices of the Association.



TECHNICAL ANNEX 12
Page 2
5.         In coordinating and monitoring the various activities of the
Project, the uroject director would, in consultation with departmental
heads and project staff, prepare work plans for each activity, institute
a monitoring system of physical progress and financial disbursement for
these plans, and prepare quarterJy progress reports for the Project
Development Committee and IDA.
6.        The project directorwould be assisted by;  a land use specialist,
with supporting staff, (see Technical Annex l]), who would coordinate with
line departments in the production of sub-watershed development plans for
preparing a follow-up project; an agricultural specialist, who would be
seconded to the Department of Agriculture with special responsibility for
technical development; a procurement and costings officer; an assistant
accounts officer; and, supporting clerical staff. The land use and
agricultural specialists would be internationally recruited; a draft job
description and qualifications for the agricultural specialist is attached
at Appendix 1. It is expected that the Project staff would be increased
in year 2 of the Project when follow-up project preparation commences, see
para. 29.
7.        The Project would include the construction of a project headquarters
office in Muzaffarabad, which would also contain the drawing/mapping office
of the land use and planning section, office equipment and furniture,
supervision vehicles, staff salaries and office operating expenses. Special
provision is also included for the estimated cost of aerial photography and
a follow-up project preparation fund. Detailed physical requirements and
costs are contained in Table 1.
Coordination of Project Activities
8.        Besides the general need for close monitoring and coordination of
all activities financed by the Project, the following actions would be given
specific attention by project management :-
(a) Operational Areas and Sites. Assisting with the siting
of Experimental farms and Apple Extension buildings;
selecting development areas for maize trials, apple
and vegetable schemes, fuelwood plantations, livestock
feeding unit;
(b)  testing farmer responses to proposed activities;
(c) arranging credit facilities for growers under the apple
scheme;
(d) selection and appointment of senior project staff;
(e) selection and gppointment of consultants and arranging
their itineraries;
(f) finalizing of arrangements with training institutions
for training program and selection of candidates for
specific courses;



TECHNICAL ANNEX 12

(g) liaising with GOP for the Apple Market Study;
(h) instituting a system of cost accounting for project
activities which would assist with monitoring and
also provide data for follow-up project preparation;
(i) arranging for aerial photography and support services
of Survey of Pakistan for base map production;
(j) setting up farmer groups and coordinating activities
of technical departments and land use planning section
in preparation of sub-watershed/village development
pl ans .
Fol low-U Project Preparation
9.        A major task of Project management would be the preparation of a
follow-up project with the objective of preparation being completed in the
early part of year 3 of the project in readiness for appraisal and subsequent
implementation in year 4. Besides the information, which would be generated
by project activities, some additional data is available, but would require
processing to be useful for follow-up project formulation;   for example,
population statistics, farm holding patterns, existing health and education
services, rural handicrafts and industries. Other aspects of a follow-up
project preparation would require special study and eva2uation to assemble
and process the relevant data.
10.       The Project would include a follow-up project preparation fund of
PRs 2.5 million to meet the costs of processing existing data and carrying
out further studies needed. The fund would also be available to meet any
short-fall in the estimated provisions made for preparation studies in the
Project components, e.g., apple and vegetable pilot schemes and land use
development plans. Studies and other expenditure items exceeding PRs 50,000
(US$5,000) would requi.e prior agreement with the Association.
II.       General Approach.  As an initial step, a preliminary overall
assessment of the distribution of human and livestock populations and economic
activities would be made and co-related with the overall land use assessment.
(See Technical Annex 11). From this, areas would be selected for inclusion
in a follow-up project. These areas would then form the subject areas for
the necessary studies; study areas would be further subdivided for the
presentation of data (e.g., sub-watershed/villages). This should minimize
the collection of data which may be of some general interest, but would
have no relevance to project formulation.
12.       Details of Preparation. A number of information gaps and studies,
which are not being specifically addressed in the Project activities, have
been identified and these are briefly described in the following paragraphs.
This list is not exhaustive and it would be within the discretion of the
project management, in close collaboration with the Association, to expand
on these as experience is gained under the project.

Execution of Project Preparation Work
27.       The project directorwould take primary responsibility for follow-up
project preparation. Under his direction, these tasks would be carried out by
(i) regular staff employed on project activities; (ii) staffs of the
various departments of GOAK, or (iii) specialized agencies which would be
employed by the Project. In certain fields, e.g., Demographic, Land Use
Studies, Manpower and Training, Lyallpur University have the expertize
and have indicated willingiess to provide these services.
28.       The project director would assemble a work-plan for the execution
of studies, prepare detailed descriptions and terms of reference for the
specific studies to be undertaken, and, compile a roster of suitable agencies
to undertake these tasks. By April, 1978, a timetable for follow-up project
preparation woul'd be agreed with the Association and kept under review during
visits of Supervision missions.
29.       It is expected that these activities wil] increase in volume as the
project progresses and project financing should be sufficiently flexible to
permit reinforcement of project staff to meet this need. A further possibility
is arranging at a suitable time during project preparation, for the project
directorand senior project staff to visit an ongoing IDA assisted project
of relevance, e.g., Nepal.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Improved Wood Stoves Study
1..       The present levels of domestic wood consumption are very
high, ranging from around 4 tons/year per family unit to as much as
12 tons/year or more in the colder areas. (See Technical Annex 8
Table 2). A main reason for the high consumption levels is the type
of cooking and heating systems commonly used, which result in excessive
heat loss. Properly designed wood-burning stoves (for cooking and
heating) obtain about 60% usage of the energy potential of wood fuel.
Compared with this, it is probable that the energy efficiency of the
customary systems in use in AK is around 10%. Improvement in the system
to increase efficiency to, say, 50%, could have the effect of reducing
household fuel usage to one-fifth of the present level. Even allowing for
a higher consumption level as an immediate consumer response to an
improved stove, there would still remain a dramatic reduction in the
demand for fuelwood. This could significantly assist in resolving the
present crisis of fuelwood shortage and form an integral part in the
design of a fuelwood supply program. In addition, the substantial
reduction in volume of domestic fuel used, would release farm-family
labor for more productive activities.
2.        The project would include a study in the use of improved wood
stoves and evaluate their performance with the objective of assessing the
practicability of their wide adoption by households. For this purpose,
a number of selected households would be provided with stoves and accurate
measurements kept of wood consumption which would be related to other
"control" households using the traditional heating/cooking system. The
Pakistan Forest Institute have undertaken to provide the technical support
of their wood utilization section and advise on possible cooperating
agencies.
3.        A type of wood stove is produced in Pakistan at Quetta.  Although
the merits of this type of stove have not been assessed, it could probably
fonm the basis for comparative studies in design and suitability and be
compared with other imported wood stoves of known efficiency.
4.        Provision would be included in the study for :
(a) Purchase and installation of some 40 wood burning stoves.
(b) A study team leader with supporting interviewing and
recording staff.
(c) Data tabulation and analysis.
(d) Developing local improved stove design.

HILL FARMING TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Wood Preservation Study Outline
I.        The present levels of timber consumption used in local household
construction represent a serious drain on the forest resources. Present
usage for this purpose coul d be equal to the annual production of commercial
timber - see Technical Annex 7, paras. 8 and 47. At present, all timber
used in local construction is untreated. A large proportion of the timber
so used is in roof construction. Most dwellings (and shops) have a flat-
roof construction, which results in a continual dampening of the roof
timbers. This accelerates wood rot.   Simple wood preservative treatments
(e.g., hot and cold creosote treatment) would extend the useful life of
such timber by three or four times. This would have a significant impact
on the demand for local construction timber and provide a sizeable savings
in labor required for buil dings maintenance.
2.        The project would include a study in the use of simple wood
preservation systems with the objective of assessing the practicability
of the wide adoption of these practices. Whilst the study would be primarily
directed to households, it could also have application in other uses, e.g.,
Government and Army buildings and would make a significant contribution to
developing the production of durable poles and fencing posts. For purposes
of the study, a small-scale wood preservation plant would be set up, in
conjunction with the Forest Department and other related departments (e.g.,
Ministry of Works), who will provide supervision of the operation, from
existing staff capacity with advice on equipment being obtained from the
Pakistan Forest Institute and other relevant agencies (e.g., Railways and
Posts and Telegraphs). The plant would be operated on the basis of providing
treated timber to selected households (and other relevant users) and detailed
records maintained of operating costs and user responses. Comparative studies
would al so be initiated of treated versus untreated timber for future
analyses.
3.        Provision would be included in the study for :
(a)  Purchase and installation of the plant.
(b)  Operating costs of the plant, including plant operator
and helpers for two years.
(c)  Study tour of four weeks (in Pakistan) for Supervisor.
(d) Data tabulation and analysis.
The study is expected to be conducted in years 2 and 3 of the project.
