MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR AN ESSENTIAL DRUGS PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$68.1 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be payable over 20 years,
including five years of grace, at the variable interest rate 1982. The
project would assist the Government in effectively launching its National
Essential Drugs Programme.
2.        Background.  Public health services in Nigeria are severely
handicapped by an acute shortage of drugs, the most serious constraint
occurring at the primary health care (PHC) level. The main reasons for
this shortage are: (a) major cutbacks in public expenditures on health,
following the decline in oil revenues; (b) pervasive inefficiencies in
selecting, procuring, storing, prescribing and using drugs; and (c)
increased costs due to exchange rate adjustments. Fragmentation and
duplication among sectoral institutions exacerbate the problem. Besides
compromising most therapies, the shortage of drugs has caused a major
decline in the utilization of health services, a concomitant increase in
self-medication, and a loss of public confidence in vital preventive
programs. Although private sector outlets have a more reliable supply of
drugs, these are often unaffordable to the poor, and recently as a result
of the Government's declining capacity to monitor drug quality, adulterated
and fake drugs have flooded the market. The Government intends to resolve
this crisis through a National Essential Drugs Programme, which would
reform and strengthen drug supply and quality assurance at all levels,
introduce equitable cost recovery to help ensure sustainability, and at a
later stage, promote local drug production. Project preparation has been
supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), which helped to organize
technical assistance and staff training financed by the Government through
the Federal component of the Sokoto Health Project (Loan 2503-UNI).
3.        Rationale for Bank involvement.  First, Bank involvement in the
drug supply subsector would help to alleviate the impact of structural
adjustnent by bringing down the cost of drugs, and support Government's
goal of increasing accessibility and efficiency in the health sector.
Second, the Government is seeking Bank assistance in introducing cost
recovery in the sector and, as the Bank's research on health financing has
found, charging for drugs is the most appropriate way to do so. Finally,
the Bank has a comparative advantage in working in this subsector because
of the magnitude of resources required, its ability to promote efficient
procurement, and its capacity to mobilize the support and cooperation of
other external agencies such as WHO and the United Nations Development
Programme.



4.        Pro1ect obiective.  The project's objective is to ensure that
the public has access to a sustainable supply of safe, effective and
affordable drugs. It would do so by reorienting, consolidating and
strengthening existing drug supply and quality assurance efforts carried
out by the three levels of government.
5.        Prolect description.  The project has four main componentst (a)
developing an affordable and sustainable supvly of safe druss (working
capital in the form of drug seed stocks needed to establish a functioning
system of cost recovery and drug revolving funds (DRFs); improved
procedures for selecting, procuring, storing and distributing d&4gs; and
strengthened capacity, including expanded laboratories, for assuring drug
quality); (b) improving the skills of health workers in providins dru8s
(in-service training, reorientation of basic training curricula, and irug
information systems for practitioners)s (c) changing the practices of
beneficiaries (educational materials and public information campaigns on
harmful practices and the reasons for introducing charges for drugs); and
(d) strengthening institutional capacities to undertake essential drugs
programs (additional staff and technical assistance, especially in
financial management; and special studies). Four states (see attached map)
and their local governments, covering one-seventh of Nigeria's population,
and FMOH, through its system of national quality assurance laboratories and
Federal hospitals, would implement the project. As a step in shifting more
responsibility to Nigerian institutions for project development and
administration in the health sector, merchant banks would oversee
procurement and cost-recovery activities. The project, to be carried out
over five years, provides funds for seed stocks of essential drugs, civil
works, equipment, vehicles, materials and supplies, technical assistance,
studies, incremental operating costs, and preparation of follow-on
projects. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$85.1 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$64.5 million (76X). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown at Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule
are shown at Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are at Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also included. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7428-UNI, dated August 10, 1989, is attached.
6.        Agreed actions.  At the June 1988 meeting of the National
Council on Health, FHOH and all State Ministries of Health endorsed the
national essential drugs policy. To build on the new national policy, the
four participating states have approved acceptable essential drugs lists
and policies, including commitment to Cull cost recovery, to preserving the
integrity of DRFs by covering exemptions and unanticipated losses, and to
using international competitive bidding as the primary means for procuring
drugs (including those purchased with recovered funds), and PMOH prepared
standard procedures for drug procurement, including a centralized system of
prequalification, and appointed two additional staff to its Essential Drugs
Unit. During negotiations, FMOH and/or the states, as appropriate, gave
assurances that: (a) irugs procured with loan funds, as well as with the
proceeds of revolving funds, will be limited to those on approved essential
drugs lists, which would be updated no more frequently than once a year,
and by January 1, lM.I., FMOH will propose to the Bank an acceptable process
for systematically updating the national list; (b) regular deposits, to the



- 3 -
extent possible in advance, will be made into DRFs to cover the cost of
drugs provided to exempt patients; and (c) not later than as part of their
second year's work programs, commencing on January 1, 1991, FMOH and the
states will initiate actions for expanding their systems' capacities for
effective provision of drugs through renova:ion of storage facilities,
adoption of operational manuals, in-service training of involved staff,
briefing of community leaders on the reasons for cost recovery, and
development of public education materials. It was agreed that, as
conditions of loan effectiveness, FMOH will appoint two coordinators of
project activities (one in the Department of Food and Drug Administration
and Control and the other in the Department of Hospital Services and
Training), a Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be signed between the FGN and
at least one state, and both FMOH and that state would make initial
deposits into their project accounts'. Finally, to prevent premature
release of drugs into the system, setting up an effective cost-recovery
system was agreed as a condition of disbursement for drug purchases by each
state and FMOH.
7.        Benefits.  Provision of a reliable supply of safe and affordable
drugs would prevent many unnecessary deaths in Nigeria and increase the
productivity of people, particularly the rural and urban poor, who are ill
longer anA more seriously than need be. Availability of drugs would help
to revitalize the health system, increase the utilization and credibility
of the full range of its services, and attract more people to take
advantage of vital preventive and promotive programs such as maternal and
child health and family planning. Even with full cost recovery, patients
vould be able to obtain drugs for about half of current prices and at the
same time be assured of better quality. Finally, a revitalized and
reliable drug supply system and increased demand for essential drugs would
stimulate local production.
8.        Risks.  To counter resistance from strong vested interests, the
states have subscribed to comprehensive essential drugs policies, including
commitment to fixed lists of essential drugs and to efficient procurement.
To ensure that the drug revolving funds will not be decapitalized,
appropriate pricing policies are being set and control procedures
introduced that take into account lessons learned in the operation of other
revolving funds in Nigeria and elsewhere.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
