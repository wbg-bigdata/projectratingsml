RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ)
Guarantor:               Republic of Bulgaria
Loan Amount:             US$95.0 million equivalent
Terms:                   Twenty years, including 5-year grace at the Banks's standard
variable interest rate
Project Objectives
and Description:         The objective of the project is to support the restructuring
process which the BDZ and the Government have initiated. As
the first Bank intervention in the sector, the project supports a
set of policy measures that are or will be embodied in the new
Railway Law, the RAP (Annex 1) and a Contract Plan with the
Government.
The project would only finance necessary investments which are
in line with the restructuring concept and would help the railway
through the restructuring process. These include: (a) Track
Renewal and Maintenance on Priority Routes; (b) Management
Information System (MIS); (c) Signalling and
Telecommunications; (d) Traction and Rolling Stock
Improvements; (e) Rehabilitation of Passenger Coaches; and
(f) Technical Assistance and Training.
Benefits and Risks:      The immediate benefits will be resource savings resulting from
the restructuring process and lower transport costs. The main
risks are of policy slippage, due to changes in the political
environment. Further deterioration of economic conditions in
Bulgaria would pose a risk of lack of counterpart funds and
reduced rail traffic. These risks are outside Bank control, so it
is proposed to hold a mid-term review to assess progress in
achieving the development objectives of the project and
restructure it as necessary.

I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1. 1        Bulgaria is a medium size European country with an area of 112,000 sq. km
and population of 9.0 million. The population density is low at 80 per sq. km. Per capita
income in 1993 was estimated at about $1,400. At the end of World War II, the economy
was based primarily on agriculture, but postwar development stressed industrialization.
Bulgaria specialized in machinery, particularly electro-mechanical and electronics and
chemicals. The heavy dependence on CMEA trade, which has been severely disrupted,
greatly affected the Bulgarian economy in general and the transport sector in particular.
1.2         Bulgaria has about 37,000 km of roads of which 250 km of motorways. Road
density, with regard to both population and land area, is the second lowest among Central
and Eastern European (CEE) countries after Romania, with very little difference between the
two countries. The rail network is 4,300 km of which 2,600 km are electrified and 900 km
have double track. The Danube offers a navigable distance of some 500 km in Bulgaria.
Varna and Burgas are the main ports on the Black Sea.
B. Traffic
1.3         Bulgaria's transport sector has been somewhat less railway oriented than other
centrally planned economies (Tables 1 and 2). In 1989, rail accounted for only 45% of the
freight traffic (tkm) compared to 70% in neighboring Romania. Rail freight reached 80
million tons and 18 billion tkm in the late 80s, but has fallen dramatically since 1989. Since
1992, traffic stabilized around 30 million tons and 8 billion tkm or 57% less than in 1989.
Passenger traffic held up better, being down about 36%. In recent years, the National
Railways (BDZ) transported some 70 million passengers achieving more than 5.0 billion
passenger-km (pkm).
1.4         Road traffic was, until recently, growing at about 4% annually, with heavy
traffic growing at about 10% annually, although this growth has now been affected by the
economic situation and the sanctions against the former Yugoslavia. The share of road
transport, about 50%, is the highest in CEE countries, although well below Western
European levels.
1.5         Port traffic has also fallen to nearly half of what it was in 1989. At Varma,
traffic in 1993 and 1994 was about 6 million tons of which two-thirds were bulk and the rest
general cargo. A similar situation prevails at the smaller port of Burgas. Container traffic is
still small, each port handles only 10,000 TEU per year. River transport accounts for only
5% of land transport and pipelines for about 2%.



- 2 -
C. Institutions
1.6          The Ministry of Transport (MOT) oversees the sector as a whole. It has been
reorganized to concentrate on policy making and regulatory functions rather than being an
operator of transport means (Chart 1). Its staff has recently been reduced from 350 to 250.
The road network is administered by the General Road Administration (GRA) and the rail
transport by the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ). The two principal ports, Varna and
Burgas, are autonomous enterprises which are profitable, despite the fall in traffic. The
MOT oversees a number of public enterprises operating road transport services, port and
airport facilities as well as air transport services, but is in the process of privatizing many of
them.
D. Investments
1.7          In the 1980's, investments in the transport sector were around US$450 to 500
million per year. The share of railways investments fell from 35% of the total in 1980 to
25% in 1989, while the road and road transport share increased from less than 50% to over
60%. The share of water and air transport remained constant around 15% with some annual
fluctuations reflecting purchase of ships or airplanes. In the last three years, investments in
the sector have come to a virtual halt. For instance, in 1992, investments for the whole
sector totalled US$24 million, only allowing for urgent repairs and periodic maintenance and
no new investments (Table 3).
E. Sectoral Issues
1.8          One of the main problems faced in defining a strategy for the sector is to
forecast the future volumes and pattern of transport demand. The shift to a market economy
is resulting in less emphasis on transport intensive industries such as steel, cement and
petrochemicals and more on high value-added light industry and agro-industry. The latter
will require lower transport volumes and are more likely to use road transport than rail or
water transport. Railways are unlikely to recoup most of the lost traffic and will have to
concentrate on developing new markets such as international freight and combined transport.
On the passenger side, the need to increase tariffs to reduce the need for subsidies could
moderate travel demand until income growth resumes. Growing competition from road
transport, is also likely to dampen demand for rail passengers.
1.9          The sector was no exception to the general distortions resulting from
administrative rather than market prices. In the past few years, there has been some
progress and presently prices of road transport for freight and inter-city passenger services
are freely set and fuel prices reflect world market prices. Railway tariffs however have
remained controlled (para. 2.25).
1.10         In the eighties, investments in the sector were skewed toward new projects
with little regard for economic and financial feasibility. On the other hand, funds for
maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement of old equipment and modernization were scarce.



- 3 -
Due to this, and to the budget squeeze of the past few years, existing infrastructure and
equipment are obsolete and service availability is low. The Bank, together with EBRD and
EIB, is introducing the use of economic feasibility studies as a basis for improving decision
making on investments.
F. Sector Strategy and Bank Role
1.11         The following principles and policies are guiding the future action of
Government, through its MOT, in the transport. sector:
- preparing certain transport enterprises for privatization and for those, like
the railways, which will remain state enterprises, organizing their
restructuring;
- decentralizing and demonopolizing transport activities
- bringing the transport vehicles and infrastructure as well as their mode of
operation in line with international standards and requirements of a market
economy;
- ensuring fair inter and intra-modal competition together with free modal
choice by transport users;
- guaranteeing safety and reliability of transport services and
- protecting the environment in the development and operation of transport
activities.
This strategy is basically sound and forms a good basis for the work of the Ministry of
Transport, which is to concentrate on regulatory functions and inspection to ensure safety and
protection of the environment.
1.12        The proposed project will be the first Bank loan in the sector. The broad
economic and political changes occurring in Eastern Europe have a considerable impact on
their railway. Bulgaria is no exception. The need to restructure the railways is important
not only for the transport sector but also from a macroeconomic point of view. The Bank
together with EBRD, which financed a restructuring study completed in September 1993, can
play a catalytic role in assisting the Government with the difficult, although necessary,
restructuring process.
1.13         Against this background, the Bank's strategy in the transport sector is to
promote efficiency in investments and in operations, through competitive environment and by
attracting private investment wherever possible, promote sound pricing policies, and help
ensure that environmental concerns are well handled. In the specific case of the railway, the
Bank strategy is to support their downsizing to an economic level, complemented by
measures to improve their efficiency thus controlling the need for public financing and to set



the stage for future private sector participation. This strategy provides a strong linkage
between the proposed operation and the objectives set in the CAS that was discussed by the
Board on March 9, 1993, which emphasize macroeconomic stabilization, transformation of
state enterprises and modernization of Bulgaria's physical infrastructure.
II. THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Organization. Management and Staff
2.1         BDZ is an independent legal entity (established in 1989 under the authority of
Resolution No. 50 of the Council of Ministers) and registered as a state-owned company.
Besides the headquarters in Sofia, BDZ's operations are organized into four regions. The
chief executive is the Director General, answerable to a Governing Council. This Council
was reorganized in December 1993; it was reduced in size from 17 to 11 members and now
has a majority of non-BDZ representatives. The Governing Council is expected to manage
both the strategic and operational functions.
2.2         Until now, BDZ's organization was a conventional one for railways i.e.
dominated by the technical functions of infrastructure, traction and rolling stock and
operations. This structure is inappropriate for a market oriented railway. The restructuring
study recommended commercial/marketing focused organization with two basic business
groups - freight and passenger - and two service functions - infrastructure and finance.
However, it also suggested that such a change had little chance to succeed if applied at once,
and that an intermediate organizational structure, that would allow marketing and commercial
skills to develop would be preferable. In March 1994, the Governing Council approved such
an intermediate organization and it is gradually being put into place (Chart 2). Major
features of the new organization are: (a) the creation of a strong Marketing and Product
Development group under a Deputy Director General (DDG); (b) the consolidation under a
single DDG of all track, signalling, telecommunications, catenary and power supply
responsibilities under "Infrastructure"; and (c) the placing of all locomotives, coaches and
freight cars under a DDG for "Traction and Rolling Stock".
2.3          Between 1989 and 1993, the total number of staff was reduced by 18,000 and
by another 6,000 in 1994 for a total reduction of almost 30% (Table 4). At the end of 1994,
BDZ employed about 58,000 persons, of which some 50,000 or 86% work in transport
activities (including 27,000 operational, 15,000 infrastructure and 8,000 traction/rolling stock
staff). Because staff cuts to date have not yet matched the loss of traffic, productivity
(measured in traffic units per traffic employee) is 25% lower in 1994 than in 1989,
however, it has been increasing regularly since the low point reached in 1991. BDZ is at the
same time overstaffed for its reduced traffic level and short of staff with new skills such as
marketing, financial management, computerization, etc.
2.4         BDZ plans to reduce staff by a further 10,000 by 1998 (see Annex 1,
attachment 1) and this would restore productivity to the 1990 level, which was acceptable,
even if traffic remains stable. Such staff reductions would result from: the closure of
stations and lines; the reduction of wagon load traffic; the reduction in use of rolling stock



fleet, installation of better equipment and improvement of working practices; and improved
efficiency in the system at the whole. The staff reduction program should be complemented
by an extensive training program coupled with a system of performance reward that the
project will support.
B. Railway Facilities
Network
2.5          The Bulgarian railway system consists of about 4,300 route km including 245
km of narrow gauge (IBRD Map No. 26019). About 960 km or 22% are double track and
2640 km or 61 % electrified (25 Kv and 50 Hz). The network is in a relatively sound
condition, but deteriorating, as maintenance expenditures have been drastically reduced.
Much remedial work is required to prevent impairing safety and to prepare for future
improvements.
2.6          The track is mainly 49 kg/m rail, with welded points (about 13% of total track
ldlometers). It is laid on reinforced concrete sleepers, except on switches, crossing and
curves where timber sleepers are used. Rails were imported from Poland, the Soviet Union
and Czechoslovakia. The ballast is supplied by BDZ's quarries with relatively low crushing
strength and is not of acceptable quality. Under the project, all five quarries should be
separated from BDZ with a view to privatization and ballast should be brought to UIC
specifications. The concrete sleepers are produced in a BDZ factory at Svistov, with a
capacity of about 200,000 p.a. The production technology is outdated (1966 level) and
quality is not satisfactory. The existing factory will be modernized to produce higher quality
sleepers with a view to become a commercial company and eventually to be privatized. The
rail fastening is locally produced based on imported steel and on 1960 technology. BDZ is
now planning to introduce modem technology for elastic fastenings.
2.7         About 10,000 switches and 250 double crossing throughout the system are
severely worn out, imposing speed restrictions through the stations to ensure safety. Future
relaying should introduce selectively a heavier rail section, minimum E-54 UIC rail profile,
to allow increased axle loads. There are 982 bridges of which 337 are steel construction (all
over 60 years old but strengthened for 23-25 ton axle loads) and 645 are concrete (6 bridges
of suspect load capacity, subject to speed restriction up to 40 km/h). The total aggregate
length of 183 tunnels is about 47 km.
2.8         Annually, some 500-600 km of track need periodic maintenance and 250-300
km need renewal (capital overhaul). In recent years, less than half of these amounts were
performed due to lack of funds. The middle range maintenance is done by the maintenance
department (RVP) of BDZ and the track renewal by the railway construction unit of MOT
operated by the military. Pre-fabrication of track sections is undertaken by this unit which
has the monopoly on all track lifting and relaying works. It was agreed that track renewal
would gradually be done on the basis of contracts. During negotiations, assurances were
given that equipment for track renewal and maintenance to be financed by the project will
remain with BDZ and not be passed on to MOT's unit (para. 6.1 b).



- 6 -
2.9         Most track maintenance equipment is beyond refurbishment (85% of RVP's
equipment is overaged) and reliable heavy maintenance equipment and small tools are
lacking. Therefore, track maintenance, and procurement of track maintenance machines,
together with updated technology, is essential and high priority, necessary for safety reasons
in train operation. In addition, major organizational changes and concentration of
responsibilities together with staff training are needed. The major focus of the project is on
track maintenance. The electrification system is also in need of urgent rehabilitation and
replacement due to significant failures in power supplies and in overhead contact lines
(OCL).
Signalling and Telecommunications
2.10        The system is generally good, but some important stations need a new
interlocking system on safety and commercial grounds. Half of the stations are equipped
with signals of which about one-half are mechanical, electro-mechanical or key interlocking,
locally produced or imported from the former Soviet Union or East Germany. Centralized
Traffic Control (CTC) exists on the single line Sofia-Karlovo (equipment is of 1972 Russian
origin - now totally obsolete, spares for which are no longer available) and Sofia-Plovdiv line
(very modem installation, with computerized automatic routing - provided by ISKRA of the
former Yugoslavia in 1989). Automatic Train Stopping equipment (ATS) were fitted on 103
locomotives and should be extended. There is a total of about 1,300 rail level crossings, of
which about 570 or 44% are protected.
2.11        BDZ's communications are based on small carrier system, operated for about
80% by cable and for the remainder over aerial pole route, with the steel wire needing to be
replaced (over 20 years old and with insufficient capacity). There are a total of 112
telephone exchanges serving about 25,000 extensions (1930 German technology needing
replacement). A data transmission network between centers Sofia, Plovdiv, Gorna and
Vama using x.25 with speed 9.6 k bound, is primarily used for the wagon control. Train
radio, covers about 1200 km of trunk lines and some locomotives. Improved
communications, replacement of aerial wires, telephone systems and train radio extensions
are needed and will be financed by the project.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
2.12        The proportion of traffic hauled by electric traction rose from 76% in 1986 to
85% in 1993. BDZ operates 347 electric and 220 mainline diesel electric locomotives of
which about 34% and 37% respectively are over 20 years old. Availability of electric and
diesel locomotives in 1993 was about 84% and 78% respectively. It dropped to about 62%
in 1994 due to shortages of spare parts (Table 4). The passenger fleet consists of about
2,000 units with a capacity of about 126,000 seats. Almost 50% is over 20 years old.
There are over 37,000 freight wagons with a total capacity of 1.9 million tons and an
average capacity of about 51 tons, some 20% are over 20 years old. Availability for both
coaches and wagons is sufficient, largely because of the excess supply resulting from the
decreased traffic.



2.13        The technical parameters of the traction fleet remain behind in terms of speed
and other performance criteria compared to Western European Railways. In aggregate
terms, fleet capacity for traction and rolling stock exceeds actual and expected traffic
demand, but the fleet does not meet qualitative and structural requirements and should be
progressively modernized, at a pace consistent with financial constraints. Reduction of the
fleet is part of the Restructuring Action Plan (RAP) (para. 2.40).
Workshops and Depots
2.14        There are 15 workshops, all in generally bad conditions (2 for infrastructure, 2
for locomotives, 5 for wagons, 3 for coaches, and 3 for containers) and 32 locomotive
depots. The rationalization of fleet types and spare parts inventory, along with fewer re-
equipped maintenance depots will bring great economy and improved efficiency once the
backlog of maintenance, rehabilitation and modifications has been completed. The heavy
repair workshops are outdated and in need of rationalization, re-design and re-equipment.
Their workload will decline as fleet sizes reduce and as BDZ introduces maintenance
practices based on component exchange rather than heavy overhauls in main works.
Workshops that have markets outside the railways such as container manufacturing and the
foundry can be separated immediately, with the objective of privatization. Workshops
necessary for the maintenance and operation of traction and rolling stock would remain with
BDZ, but would be reduced in number and the remaining ones modernized to increase
efficiency. Joint venture companies with BDZ's participation are also an option. Surplus
workshops would be separated from BDZ for sale or closing down. The timetable for this
program is in the RAP (para 2.40).
Marshalling Yards
2.15        BDZ operated with 14 marshalling yards until the introduction of a new
timetable in January 1994 when eight yards were closed and marshalling operation are now
regrouped in six major mechanized yards in Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Gorna, Ruse and Burgas
(see Map).
C. Traffic
2.16        The major political changes in CEE countries have been accompanied by
massive economic and industrial upheaval which have profoundly affected railway traffic.
With the collapse of the Council of Mutual Assistance (CMEA or COMECON), trading
relationships and traffic movements between and within member countries have been
undergoing vast changes in volume and patterns. Economic and industrial structures are
changing; markets are altering or disappearing; old products and demand patterns for raw
materials are declining; the dominance of railways, created by centrally planned command
economies, is declining and demand for railway services is being eroded by emerging
competition from road transport. The quality and level of railway services have deteriorated
due to continued reliance on traditional operating methods, low productivity, increasing costs
and inability to invest in modern working system, technology and management techniques.
The requirements of the customer have not been met because the railways lack a commercial
orientation and the concept of marketing is barely recognized.

Freight Traffic
2.17         From its peak in 1986, freight traffic fell 57% in terms of tkm (from 18.3
billion to 7.8 billion in 1994) and 65% in terms of tonnage (from 85 million tons to 30
million in 1994). The average length of haul increased from 215 km to 260 km. In 1993
and 1994, traffic stabilized and remained close to the level reached in 1992. Most BDZ
freight traffic is domestic and has been affected by the level and structure of domestic
economic activity and to a lesser extent by road competition. International trade plays a
relatively small part in BDZ's operations with exports, imports and transit accounting for less
than 10% of the freight traffic (Table 5). It has been affected lately by the situation in
former Yugoslavia.
Passenger Traffic
2.18          Passenger traffic did not decrease as much as freight, going down only 36%,
from 8.0 billion passenger-km in 1986 to 5. 1 billion in 1994. International passenger traffic
is of minor importance and is less than 3% of the total (Table 6).
Future Traffic
2.19         In the present economic and political circumstances, both domestic and
external, the uncertainties surrounding forecasts must be emphasized. Railway freight traffic
may continue to hold up its new present level, provided BDZ adopts an active market-based
approach catering to identified customer needs. The restructuring process may well hold the
key to success or failure here. Certain specialized international operations such as
transshipment through Varna to Black Sea destinations, inter-modal operations with Rhein-
Main-Danube shipping and connections to Thessaloniki could, and probably will, assume
importance in the future.
2.20         Passenger traffic is particularly difficult to forecast at this time, but can be
expected to decline in the medium to longer term given the negative population growth, the
growing car ownership and particularly the nascent competition of buses offering competitive
services. The rate of decrease will depend on general economic conditions (affecting
consumer expenditure and car ownership), the outcome of the BDZ restructuring process,
fares policy and the approach adopted to public service contracts.
2.21         Taking into account recent trends in rail traffic volumes and the above
mentioned factors, it appears realistic to base the project on figures which do not assume any
traffic growth from the 1994 base. Forecasts are summarized below and detailed in Tables 5
and 6. A mid-term review is proposed under the project (para. 3.16) and at that time the
forecast will be revised to take into account recent developments. This may result in some
changes in investment priorities which would be taken into account under the project by
reallocations between categories.

(pkm + tkm)
D. Operations
2.22         In 1993, BDZ's operational performance showed either stagnation or decrease
compared to 1986 due to continued sharp decrease in traffic, notably in the utilization of
rolling stock (passenger and freight services) and in the availability of electric and diesel
locomotives (Table 4). BDZ needs to avoid unnecessary maintenance of surplus traction and
rolling stock. The availability rate should be lifted by first scrapping surplus wagons, and
then assessing whether maintenance efforts need to be intensified. Targets for utilization and
availability have been agreed as part of the RAP (Annex 1).
2.23         Freight train operations have been traditional with "wagon load" working
between a large number of terminals (about 400), with about 120 trains per day and average
train load of 1,170 t/train. About 40% of tonnage loaded is in block-trains. About 75% of
traffic passes through private industrial sidings. The new operating system introduced in
January 1994, established a timetable for delivery within three time zones of 24, 36 and 48
hours and reduced marshalling. To further reduce costs, future BDZ freight services should
be based on the following principles: (i) customer-designed transport of bulk freight to and
from main production sites, and to a small number of key distribution centers; (ii) trainload
operations of containers between ports and between key inland handling depots; and (iii)
international freight operations for container and bulk material movement.
2.24         Passenger traffic is more widely spread than freight but there is a large
number of stations with low volumes. Many have been already closed or reduced to
unmanned halts and this program will continue. The quality of passenger environment on
and off trains is poor. Average train loads are high but, in some cases, excessive provision
of accommodation is apparent. The domestic passenger train services were restructured in
January 1994 into intercity and regional trains. Poorly occupied and costly long distance
regular trains were cancelled. The new timetable, adjusted further in May 1994, includes:
(i) 'express' trains between major cities with frequency of two hours or four hours; (ii)
international passenger services where these are commercially feasible; (iii) complementary
'stopping' mainline train service for intermediate stations/halts where passenger traffic
justifies; (iv) branch line passenger service at minimum cost; and (v) commuter services
operated as part of integrated urban transport networks (service retention only in cases where
a socio-economic return is demonstrated).

E. Tariffs and Costs
2.25         Legally, BDZ is free to set its tariffs for both freight and passengers. In
reality, BDZ's proposals have to be agreed with the Government, including, in the case of
passenger tariffs, representatives of the trade unions and political parties. Both freight and
passenger tariffs have lagged behind inflation since 1990 (by December 1993, freight tariffs
had increased 15 fold and passenger tariffs 10 fold, while general price indices had increased
about 18 fold). Freight tariffs were raised fairly regularly. For passengers, however, a six-
fold increase in early 1991 was rolled back within 15 days to a four-fold increase and tariffs
were not raised again until June 1993. Passenger tariffs were increased further by 65% on
June 1, 1994 and again by 39% on January 1, 1995. With this increase, passenger tariffs are
now 313% above their May 31, 1993 level, i.e. a 45% increase in real terms. In 1994,
average revenues were Leva 0.83/tkm for freight and 0.27/pkm for passenger. Typically in
Western Europe, Japan and North America, unit passenger revenues are substantially higher
than unit freight revenues. This is another illustration of the lag affecting passenger tariffs.
It also reflects the fact that about half the passengers travel with a discount mandated by the
Government. The RAP provides for further passenger tariffs increases of 20% per year in
real terms until they almost double by 2000 (para. 2.40).
2.26         Costs of fuel and materials have doubled between 1991 and 1993, and staff
costs including social insurance have almost quadrupled (360%). Although detailed costing
by activity is not available, estimates indicate that freight traffic covers its costs, including its
share of the joint costs, while passenger traffic cover only about one-third of its costs.
However, elimination of passenger service is not always possible because alternative means
of transport have not been developed yet; in such cases the government should compensate
BDZ for the services provided; this will be reflected in the contract plan.
F. Budget. Accounting and Audit
Planning and Budgeting
2.27         BDZ's present planning and budgeting principles and procedures do not meet
the needs of a commercially oriented railway for the following reasons:
(a) the planning cycle covers one year only while the nature of the railway
transport business requires longer perspectives;
(b) the focus of past budgets has concentrated on expenditures with little
consideration to the revenues potential;
(c) revenue budgets are not established by specialists in the marketing and
commercial functions; and
(d) there is limited involvement in the planning process at lower levels of the
organization, leading to little sense of accountability for achieving
budgeted performances.



- 11 -
2.28        To make up for the above deficiencies, BDZ should institutionalize the annual
preparation of a five-year revolving financial plan, the first year of which would provide the
basis for annual detailed budgets. This revision in BDZ's Planning and Budgeting functions
is included in the reorganization of the railway's Finance and Accounting Department
described below.
Accounting
Existing Situation
2.29        BDZ's accounting policies used are generally in accordance with
internationally accepted accounting principles. The accounting system may be summarized as
being:
-   standardized throughout the organization;
-   principally manual based;
-   geared towards meeting statutory external reporting requirements and;
-   inadequate to provide management accounting and traffic costing
information needed for monitoring BDZ's operating efficiency and
financial viability.
2.30        BDZ's present financial management, accounting and financial reporting is
based on 141 operating units (called cost or profit centers) spread over the four Railway
Regions and Headquarters. No unit conforms strictly to the modern definition of a cost or
profit center. Each operating unit has an economics and planning section and a separate
accounting section. The economics and planning unit is essentially a management accounting
function, while the accounting function covers financial accounting matters.
2.31        With effect from April 1991, BDZ has complied with the requirements of the
new Bulgarian Accounting Law. One adverse effect of this compliance has been the loss of
detailed production of data for railway operations, further limiting BDZ's ability to cost rail
operations so as to establish cost-based tariffs, which is essential for operating a
commercially oriented Railway.
Reorganization of BDZ's Financial Management and Accounting Function
2.32        There is a critical need to streamline and modernize BDZ's financial and
accounting organization and procedures in order to adapt them to the needs of a
commercially oriented and financially viable entity. Technical assistance for this purpose is
being financed by EU PHARE. Consultants have started work in January 1995 on the basis
of terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and EBRD. The timetable for implementing the
reorganization of the finance and accounting functions of BDZ and the introduction of
modern financial management and accounting procedures, including cost accounting is
included in the RAP (para. 2.40).
2.33        Since the modernization and reorganization of BDZ's financial and accounting
function will take some time, a simplified costing model has been calibrated and installed in
BDZ. Financial assistance for this work, including training of BDZ staff on the use of the
model, was provided by Canada in 1994.



- 12 -
Management Information System (MIS)
2.34        The new financial procedures will be integrated into a system wide
management information system (MIS) which will allow managers to make quickly
technically and financially justified decisions. The cost of technical assistance, software and
hardware required for implementing the new MIS will be financed from the proposed loan.
Auditing
External Audit
2.35        Assurances were given during negotiations that BDZ's accounts, including
Project related accounts, Special Account and Statements of Expenditures will be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and audit reports satisfactory to the Bank will be
provided within six months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 6. lc!. The auditors reports
will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting systems and internal
controls, and separate opinions on (a) the reliability of Statements of Expenditures as a basis
for loan disbursements, (b) the operation and use of Special Accounts, and (c) compliance
with financial covenants.
Internal Audits
2.36        According to BDZ's new organization structure, an internal audit department
reporting directly to the General Director has been established. The internal audit
department major tasks would consist of:
(a) the constructive auditing of:
-the financial offices within BDZ;
-random audit checks to ensure compliance with procedures;
-the auditing of defined managerial and operational procedures;
(b) liaison with relevant departments to ensure that new applications can be
properly audited;
(c) the submission of reports on inspections carried out to management and
relevant departments; and
(d) meetings with managers following audits to discuss problems identified
and necessary corrective actions.
G. Development Strategy and Restructuring Process
Basic Principles
2.37        The Government and BDZ recognize the need to adapt the railways to the new
economic situation of the country. With the assistance of EBRD, a study on the
Restructuring of the Bulgarian State Railways was completed in September 1993. The



- 13 -
Government subscribes to the general principles of the European Union (EU) Directive on
Railways for the restructuring of BDZ, which establishes that the railways should operate
independently, in a commercial manner, according to market principles and that the State
will compensate the railways for any losses incurred as a result of social tariffs or public
service obligations imposed on the railways. The state will also assume partial responsibility
for infrastructure as it does for roads. The above principles have been embodied in a draft
railway law which has been approved by the Council of Ministers and forwarded to the
Parliament. Parliament has approved a first reading of the law in March 1995 and final
approval is a condition of effectiveness of the Loan (para. 6.2(a)).
Measures Already Implemented
2.38         Substantial progress has been made on measures that had been agreed with the
first preparation mission (October 1993) and on developing operation and action plans for
restructuring. Achievements since October 1993 include:
(a) Approval of the draft railway law by the Council of Ministers on
April 28, 1994 and approval in first reading by Parliament in March
1995;
(b) Appointment of a new and smaller BDZ Goveming Council with a
majority of non-BDZ representatives;
(c) Cancellation of passenger services on two low density lines on
April 1, 1994 -- these lines are now operated as industrial branches --and
drafting of a decree to change the status of over 1,000 km of low density
lines (25% of the network). Of these lines, some with very low
passenger services (340 km) are proposed for freight operations only or
closure, some serving large power plants and mines (185 km) would be
transferred to these industries, and another 540 km serving larger urban
areas could be operated under contract with local authorities;
(d) Freight tariffs increased by 10% in December 1993, 37% on
April 1, 1994 (combining the effect of a 15% tariff increase plus 18% for
VAT) and 20% on January 1, 1995;
(e) Passenger tariffs were raised by 50% in June 1993, 20% in December
1993, 65% on June 1, 1994, and 39% in January 1, 1995 and are now
313% above their May 31, 1993 level, (i.e. a 45% increase in real
terms);
(f) A further staff reduction of about 6,000 persons during 1994 (staff has
been reduced by nearly 24,000 persons, i.e. about 30%, since 1989); and
(g) Introduction of new timetables for freight and passenger services in
January and in May 1994, rationalized passenger and freight trains
operated daily and stations served. As a result of these changes, fuel



- 14 -
savings have reached about 8%, marshalling yards have been reduced
from 14 to 6 and 180 stations have either been closed or reduced to
unmanned halts.
Restructuring Action Plan (RAP)
2.39         Operational plans were developed for the various activities of the railways
such as track maintenance and rehabilitation; signalling and telecommunications; traction and
rolling stock needs and performances, including assets scrapping and disposal; maintenance
of traction and rolling stock; MIS; and human resources including staff reduction and
training. These operational plans served as a basis for developing a five-year RAP
(Annex 1).
2.40         The RAP sets objectives for all aspects of BDZ's activity and organization,
actions needed to reach these objectives, responsibilities to carry out these actions and their
timing and, finally, the operational and financial targets to be reached as a result of the
actions specified in the plan. Some of the main targets are: a further staff reduction of
10,000 people, from 58,000 to 48,000 by 1998 and massive scrapping of locomotives (30%
of the electric locos and 40% of the diesel and shunting fleets) and rolling stock (30% of the
coaches and 40% of the freight cars). The RAP also deals with: i) the separation of non-
core activities, paving the way for privatization as Bulgaria's business climate improves; ii)
the change in status of lines and stations; and iii) the modernization of financial management.
The RAP will form the basis for negotiating a multi-annual contract plan with the
Government. The contract plan, to be updated annually will govern respective BDZ and
State responsibilities and specify operational and financial objectives, staff reductions, public
services support, capital contribution for infrastructure and investment plan. At negotiations.
the RAP was confirmed (para. 6. la). Signing of a satisfactory Contract Plan with the
Government is a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 6.2(b)) and agreement was reached
that such plan will be updated annually (para. 6.11).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.1          The objective of the project is to support and deepen the restructuring process
which the Railways and the Government have initiated. The project supports a set of policy
measures that will be embodied in the new railway law, the RAP and a Contract Plan with
the Government as described in paras. 2.37-2.40 above.
B. Description
3.2          The project will only finance necessary investments which would be in line
with the restructuring concept and would help the railway through the restructuring process.
These would include:



- 15 -
(a)   Track Renewal and Maintenance on Priority Routes (67% of project cost)
Given BDZ's difficult financial situation, track conditions have deteriorated
over the last five years. As a result, train speeds have been reduced (speed restrictions affect
some 750 km, about one-third of the length of main lines), safety is becoming a concern and
operating and maintenance costs are increasing. Unless progress is made soon, track
condition will become an increasingly serious impediment to all other efforts BDZ is making
to recover its financial and commercial position. BDZ needs sufficient capacity to annually
renew about 300 km; correct track alignment and profile on about 4,300 km; and replace
about 200 switches. The project includes: renewal of over 400 km of priority lines, together
with introduction of new technology; replacement of track maintenance machines (of which
more than two-thirds have exceeded their useful life), improved sleepers; the re-equipment of
the rail welding shop; and the introduction of wheel and flange lubricators. The lubricators
apply grease to the flanges of vehicle wheels to reduce wear on rails and wheels, particularly
of track with small radius curves. They can extend rail life in curves by up to 15 years.
(b)   Management Information System (MIS) (6% of project cost)
BDZ computers are mostly obsolete with little residual value and of little
utility due to their insufficient capacities, lack of terminal equipment in operating units and
lack of communication circuits in working condition available to the computers. The existing
application systems support only a limited set of BDZ's operation or administrative functions.
The project includes an integrated information and network technology in a contemporary
architecture and consisting of (i) central and regional computers; (ii) a modest upgrade of
BDZ data network; (iii) user equipment (mostly personal computers); (iv) system, data base,
program development and application software; (v) expert support and training during
introductory stage; and (vi) spares and initial supplies. The Freight and Passenger
Information system would cover the entire network and organization of BDZ in online
operation. A modern Financial Information System with a business orientation is necessary
to support BDZ's reorganized financial and accounting functions (para. 2.32);
(c)   Signalling and Telecommunications (11 % of project cost)
Most existing facilities are technically obsolete and below modem safety
standards. Furthermore, the diverse types of equipment complicates maintenance. The project
would start solving these problems and include: (i) automatic train protection system; (ii)
improvement in centralized control and interlocking system; (iii) Automatic Block System,
including axle counters; (iv) automatic telephone exchanges and cabling; and
(v) extension of the Train Radio System (on 2 lines and shunting locomotives);
(d)   Traction and Rolling Stock Improvements (7% of project cost)
The project includes equipment, tools, and environmental improvements at
selected maintenance depots located at the main nodes of the network. These would remain in
use after the ongoing rationalization process and would be expected to take the extra work from
depots being closed.



- 16 -
(e)   Rehabilitation of Passenger Coaches (7% of project cost)
Necessary for BDZ to retain its customers in intercity services and to be able to
raise tariffs, reflecting improvements in quality of services;
(f)    Training and Technical Assistance (2% of project cost)
To ensure that the objectives of the project are attained, complementary training
and equipment will be needed in particular for: the railway restructuring process, marketing,
finance and accounting, human resources, change management skills and technical and
operation. Assistance, which would be financed by the IBRD under the proposed project
provides for about 160 man-months at BDZ, MOT and MOF for high, middle management and
specialist training estimated to cost about $0.9 million (Annex 4). Additional training and
procurement of the locomotive driver simulator would be financed by EBRD.
C. Cost Estimates
3.3          The total project cost (including contingencies, taxes and duties) is estimated to
be about US$296.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$170.0 million
or 57% of the total project cost. Cost estimates were prepared by the BDZ departments and
Railway Institute and consultants on the basis of quantity estimates from substantially completed
engineering, using unit prices from similar projects under implementation in other countries. A
detailed analysis of costs has been made to determine the foreign exchange component and local
costs. All project costs have been estimated in US Dollars on the basis of -end 1994 prices and
an exchange rate of 55 Leva per 1 US dollar. Price contingencies have been applied to base
costs following the Bank guidelines. The import duties (5% for rails, 10% for other track
material and maintenance machines, 15% for MIS, signalling and telecommunication equipment)
and VAT of 18% for total costs have been calculated and added to the local component. About
50% of the local cost consists of taxes and duties. Physical contingencies (from 5% to 10%)
have been added to cover possible increases in quantities and price contingencies have been
applied to base costs following the Bank guidelines.

E. Implementation and Monitoring
3.6         The proposed loan for US$95.0 million equivalent would be made to BDZ and
guaranteed by the Republic of Bulgaria. The project would be implemented by BDZ, which
would assume direct obligation towards the Bank on the matters under its jurisdiction. A
project management team (PMT) was established in October 1994. Its members include a
Chairman and eight higher level officials in managerial positions, at least one for each project
component, including a procurement specialist familiar with the Bank's procurement procedures
and requirements.
3.7         PMT would review and follow-up on procurement procedures and bidding
documents, monitor and coordinate every aspect of the project implementation and assemble, in
quarterly reports, all project implementation information. PMT will prepare detailed work
schedules, with phasing, critical activities and responsibilities and coordinate project activities.
PMT will also be responsible for liaising with and coordinating all the cofinanciers' project
tasks and keeping direct contact with their missions. During negotiations. agreement was
reconfirmed that PMT will remain in operation and be fully staffed throughout the project
execution (para. 6.Id).
3.8         The project is scheduled to be completed by 1999. The Project's Implementation
Plan (PIP) is shown in Annex 4. The proposed loan would close on June 30, 2000, six months
after the projected project completion date of December 31, 1999. Proposed monitoring
indicators for the preparation of PMT's quarterly reports were agreed with MOT and BDZ.
During negotiations. agreement was confirmed on the PIP, monitoring criteria, and reporting
methodology (para. 6. le and Annex 4).
F. Procurement
3.9         Procurement arrangements for the Bank financed project elements are
summarized below and further details are in Annex 4. Procurement would be made in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines for all Bank-financed items including the
Bank approved Standard Bidding Document for Goods for Bulgaria. The material and
equipment components, cofinanced in parallel by the Bank and EBRD would be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures with tendering for their respective
contracts open to contractors of the Bank's and EBRD's eligible countries.

3.10         All contracts above US$250,000 for materials (rails, fastening, points, and
tensile steel for concrete sleepers) and equipment (machines, hardware and software,
components, spare parts, etc.) would be procured under ICB with post-qualification of
bidders. Goods manufactured in Bulgaria will be granted a preference of 15% or related
duties, whichever is less, provided that the value added in Bulgaria is more than 20%.
Contracts for flanged plates, spiral rings and consumables for thermic welding materials
(total aggregate amount US$0.6 million) would be procured by International Shopping (IS)
based on the comparison of three price quotations from at least three different eligible
countries. Equipment for rail welding plant and rail lubricators would be procured under
LIB, due to the limited number of manufacturers of such goods. Contract for STREIT
system, which is a proprietary item and must be purchased from the original supplier to be
compatible with existing machines, may be awarded after direct negotiations with supplier up
to an aggregate amount of US$0.2 million. Services for training will be procured in
accordance with World Bank guidelines and provided by a) firms, b) individual consultants
and c) through study tours. Training programs and implementation procedures are described
in Table 1 of Annex 4.
3.11         All contracts exceeding US$250,000 (over 99% of total project cost) would be
subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Other contracts will be reviewed ex post
by supervision missions. All procurement will be done in 19 packages, of which 15 exceed
US$1.0 million (Annex 4), which should encourage supplier interest. Procurement
information will be included in the quarterly project progress reports agreed with the
borrower. The borrower will also promptly inform the Bank regarding procurement plans,
solicitations, proposed contract awards and progress in the implementation of their
procurement activities. During negotiations. agreement was reached with BDZ on all
procurement arrangements including the list of equipment and materials and the procurement
timetable (para. 6. If and Annex 4!.
G. Disbursements
3.12         The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as
follows:
Amount            % of Expenditures
Category      Description                US$ million Eq.       Financed

of taxes and duties) and
80% of local
expenditures for other
items procured locally.

- 21 -
3.13        Withdrawal applications for contracts above US$250,000 would be fully
documented and for contracts valued at US$250,000 or less would be made on the basis of
statements of expenditures (SOE). Retroactive financing in an amount of US$100,000 would
be provided to cover training expenses incurred after April 24, 1995 for upper and middle
management of BDZ and the Ministries of Finance and Transport on topics that include, inter
alia, management, marketing, finance, accounting and environment. Documentation to
support expenditure financed under SOE would be maintained by the Borrower in one
location and made available upon request, for review by Bank representatives in addition to
being audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations. agreements were
confirmed on the foregoing arrangements (para. 6. ig).
3.14        A schedule of disbursements is given in Table 9. To maintain an adequate
flow of funds for eligible project expenditures with a minimum of administrative delay, the
Borrower will establish a Special Account with an authorized allocation of US$5 million at a
bank of its choice that is acceptable to IBRD. The initial deposit will be limited to US$2.5
million, and the additional remaining portion of the allocation will be disbursed when total
disbursements have reached US$10 million. Replenishment of the Special Account would be
submitted to the Bank on a quarterly basis, or when the balance of the Special Account is
one half of the Special Account deposit, whichever occurs first. In addition to the evidence
of payments, each replenishment application would be supported by monthly bank statements
of the Special Account which have been reconciled by the project implementing unit. All
other applications for direct payments or Special Commitments must be for an amount not
less than 20% of the Special Account deposit. Records of the Special Account proceeds and
outlays would be available for review by the Bank's supervision missions and subject to
annual audit. The foregoing arrangements. including the figures above were confirmed
during negotiations (para. 6.1h).
3.15        BDZ will establish and maintain project related accounts. Such accounts shall
be maintained in accordance with recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory
to the Bank. BDZ will provide quarterly reports and annual financial statements to reflect
the financial performance and the position of BDZ and of the project. An auditor's opinion
and report satisfactory to the Bank on the annual financial statements, will be provided within
six months of the close of each fiscal year (para. 2.35). The foregoing project accounting,
financial reporting, and auditing arrangements should provide adequate and timely
information to the Bank for supervision of the project. These arrangements were discussed
and confirmed during negotiations (para. 6.1i).
H. Project Supervision
3.16        A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared jointly with BDZ to
ensure a shared understanding of the activities to be carried out and their timing (Annex 4).
At negotiations. BDZ confirmed its commitment to carry out said plan in a timely manner
and to review it and adjust it as necessary during the proposed mid-term review (para. 6. lIj.
Such review would cover execution of the RAP and implementation of the project. In
addition to direct monitoring and assistance on day to day matters, which will be provided
from the Resident Mission in Bulgaria, three two-week Bank supervision missions per year



- 22 -
during the first two to three years of project implementation would be needed to supervise all
project activities. Thereafter, this could be reduced to two missions per year. The missions
would be staffed by a railway engineer, a financial analyst and an economist, responsible for
all engineering, financial and economic aspects of the project. A mid-term review will be
conducted in 1997, its scope was agreed at negotiations (para. 6. lj) In sum, the proposed
project would require about 10 staff weeks in FY95, and about 20 staff weeks in FY96 to FY
2000.
I. Environment
3.17         The project has been classified as "B" for purpose of O.D. 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment, meaning that only a limited environment review is required. A
preliminary environmental review was carried out during project preparation to identify
benefits, examine potential negative impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed
(Annex 3). The appraisal team concluded that the type of rehabilitation and maintenance
envisaged for the proposed project would have relatively minor effects largely limited to the
area of the railroad itself. Environmental assessments for investment projects are required by
the Republic of Bulgaria's Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation (No. 1 of December
28, 1992). The regulation and the Ministry of Environment's evaluation process, mechanism
and capacity were reviewed and found satisfactory. Should any environmental assessments
of a project component be required, it would be prepared under the supervision of the
Ministry of Environment and submitted to the Bank. Railway rehabilitation would improve
the competitiveness of the railway versus its main competitor, automobile transport, and
would bring overall environmental benefits. No resettlement issues have been identified.
3.18         The proposed railway restructuring would eliminate inefficient activities, and
reduce the number of lines and stations in operation. The environmental consequences of
lines/stations closures (e. g. polluted loading and unloading areas, abandoned underground
and above ground storage tanks used for hazardous chemicals, transformers and other
facilities, waste disposal areas) would be subject to environmental auditing. The Bank
assisted the Ministry of Environment in drafting a new Environmental Audits Regulation,
which would specify the auditing procedures. Until this Regulation is approved by the
Council of Ministers, all restructuring activities in the railways (both within and outside of
the scope of this project) would be reviewed by the Regional Environmental Inspectorates or
the Ministry of Environment, depending on the scale and the expected environmental
consequences of any particular restructuring operation.
3.19         Normal concerns for railways such as disposal of waste (including oil),
cleaning of tank settlements, water treatment, use of chemicals for track maintenance, and
transport of hazardous materials are covered by the national environmental legislation and
regulations, and mitigation measures are in place in BDZ practice. Still problems exist,
resulting both from shortcomings of the regulatory framework and to weak enforcement.
Among those are: (1) waste water discharge and treatment in some depots and maintenance
stations (especially the outdated ones); (ii) solid waste disposal; (iii) use of chemicals for
track maintenance; (iv) development and enforcement of safety and hygiene instructions and
procedures; and (v) staff performance quality (Annex 3).



- 23 -
3.20        During negotiations. agreement on the following steps to improve the
environmental conditions of rail operations was reconfirmed and included in the RAP (6.1k
and Annex 1'.
(i)  Environment Management Capacity Building. The Environmental
Specialist position in the central administration would be clearly defined
in detailed Terms of Reference; training would be provided; and proper
documentation and communications among the departments established;
and
(ii) Setting Environmental Priorities. An environmental performance review
for the railways would be prepared and decision made for targeted use of
funds according to the identified priorities on the basis of environmental,
economic, and financial considerations.
The workshop component financed by EBRD also includes financing of
environmental equipment for these workshops.
IV. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
Financial Performance 1991-94
4.1         Under the centrally planned system, railways were always profitable and BDZ
was no exception. The situation began to change in 1991, when, under decreasing traffic
and rapidly increasing costs, the first small deficit (US$ 3 million) was incurred. Over the
following two years, the situation became gradually worse; costs trebled while revenues only
doubled. For the first time, Government granted operating subsidies to partially compensate
BDZ for its losses on socially imposed passenger tariffs. These subsidies, however, were
insufficient and BDZ was forced to borrow from local Banks at high nominal rates of
interest. Maintenance of infrastructure and equipment was postponed and the quality of
service, particularly for passengers deteriorated.
4.2         The net deficit after depreciation and interest charges was Leva 2.7 billion
(US$ 100 million) in 1993 and Leva 1.9 billion (US$35 million) in 1994. The Government
contribution for operations amounted to Leva 1.8 billion in 1993 and 1.0 billion in 1994. At
the end of 1994, BDZ's debt, all to local Banks, was Leva 1.4 billion.
Financial Forecast
4.3          The financial forecasts are based on the forecasts, operational targets and
staffing levels of the agreed RAP. However, the basic financial scenario uses a somewhat
more pessimistic freight traffic forecast than the RAP, i.e. a further 2% annual fall in freight
traffic to 1998. Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the major variables affecting
revenues and costs. Forecasts are in constant 1995 Leva and are shown in Annex 2.



- 24 -
4.4          The basic scenario is based on the following assumptions:
Revenues: (i) freight: traffic decreasing 2% p.a., unit revenues constant; (ii)
passenger: traffic per RAP, unit revenues increasing 20% per year in real
terms; (iii) other revenues include sales of scrap at Leva 165 million per year
(US$3 million) and sales of 1 % of fixed assets per year. Government
contribution kept at its 1995 level in constant terms.
Costs: (i) Salaries based on staff levels in the RAP with constant unit wages;
(ii) operating costs decreasing 5% per year in constant terms; (iii) renewal of
track - 60 km in 1995, increasing to 100 km per year thereafter, and deferring
payment of social charges on salaries for 18 months. (The Ministry of Finance
has agreed to grant this to BDZ).
Investments: Limited to: the annual Government contribution from the capital
budget (Leva 500 million in 1995) and the proposed project.
4.5          Since freight traffic provides 70% of BDZ's revenues, the financial situation is
most sensitive to any further decline in freight demand. BDZ is conscious of the importance
of freight revenues and has initiated a policy of quarterly increases in tariffs to keep up with
inflation. The introduction of traffic costing and marketing will provide BDZ the tools
needed to take better control of its freight business.
4.6          Passenger revenues cover only 30% of their costs, therefore there is a need to
continue a gradual increase of unit revenues in real terms. From June 1993 to January 1995,
tariffs increased 45% in real terms and financial forecast assume a further doubling of
passenger revenues in real terms by 2000. Failure by the Government to allow BDZ to
increase its passenger tariffs in real terms according to these projections would have to be
compensated by increased subsidies. In 1994, budgetary allocation to compensate BDZ for
social passenger tariffs and to contribute to track maintenance has been considerably reduced
(to the equivalent of US$18 million, only 30% of the 1993 allocation in real terms). The
1995 budget proposal indicates a real term contribution at 85% of its 1994 level. This
contribution covers only one-third of the shortfall between passenger revenues and costs.
Government agreed to allow BDZ to set its tariffs for passenger and freight traffic according
to market conditions and as contemplated by the Railway Law. For freight this would mean
keeping up with inflation and for passenger, about doubling in real terms by 2000.
4.7          BDZ has many assets which have a potential commercial value. In particular,
the RAP indicates the surplus of motive power and rolling stock. BDZ should put a major
effort in preparing all available scrap in the system for quick sale. Options for leasing and
selling of assets within the legally authorized limits should also be pursued actively. Some
start on scrap sale and leasing of commercial space on BDZ property has been made in 1994
and the forecast is based on a conservative estimate of scrap sales and on sales of 1 % of its
fixed assets each year.



- 25 -
4.8         On the cost side, salaries and social taxes account for almost 60% of working
costs with social taxes being 43% of salaries. The financial forecast is based on staff
numbers in the RAP i.e. a further decrease of 10,000 by the end of 1998 and on unit wages
constant in real terms. BDZ's plan is actually to compensate annually for only 90% of
inflation, but this may be unrealistic given that present levels are already quite low.
4.9         A major cost item, about 20% of the total, is the overhaul of track, motive
power and rolling stock. This is the area that can stand the largest adjustment to balance,
annually, the investment program of the railways with available financial resources.
However, such overhaul of infrastructure and equipment cannot be postponed for too long as
further deterioration of quality of services and operating efficiency and costs would
compromise BDZ's chances to compete with other modes. In 1995, BDZ has decided that it
will be able to perform only about 60 km of track renewal versus the 250-300 km needed
annually. The financial forecast is based on 100 km of track renewal from 1996, which
would be supplemented over the next three years (1996-98) by the 400 km included in the
project.
4.10        Financial charges could be reduced by negotiating with the Banks a conversion
of part of BDZ's short term debt into an overdraft. This would reduce interest charges on
the fluctuating outstanding balances. Within the month, the difference between the low and
high balances is about Leva 400 million (about 30% of the outstanding short term debt).
Treating this as an overdraft rather than fixed borrowing would considerably reduce interest
charges. BDZ completed a financial workout program with its major commercial banks that
will enable it to manage its finances without financial support from the Government beyond
the presently expected levels.
4.11        With these assumptions, the financial situation of BDZ would be acceptable
throughout the period 1994-98. However, the provision for track overhaul (100 km per
year) is well below technical requirements. The financial targets included in the RAP are: 1)
a working ratio not to exceed 1.0 by 1998 and 2) a debt service ratio gradually increasing to
1.0 by 1998 (see Annex 1, attachment 1).
4.12        Sensitivity analysis has been performed by increasing and decreasing freight
traffic + 10% around the base case by 1998; keeping passenger revenues constant at their
1994 level; and reducing other operating costs (except salaries) by half as much as in the
base case. Summary results are in Annex 2. In cases more unfavorable than the base case,
BDZ would have to adjust the amount of capital overhaul until costs and revenues can be put
back on track, or eventually deepen further its downsizing program if demand fails to
materialize as expected. Need for such actions would be considered during supervision and
discussed in detail at the proposed mid-term review.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.1         With the traffic shortfall experienced over the last few years, the railways have
excess capacity but, due to years of skimping on maintenance and renewal, the quality and
efficiency of services have deteriorated. As a result, operating and maintenance costs are



- 26 -
high. Project components are directed to the rehabilitation of various parts of the system,
such as track, signalling, motive power, rolling stock and workshops. There are no capacity
increasing investments. Benefits of the project will be in terms of cost savings and improved
safety and quality of service.
Track Renewal and Maintenance on Priority Lines
5.2          This is the largest component, accounting for about two-thirds of total project
cost. It includes track renewal on major routes as well as plant and equipment for track
maintenance. The proposed project focuses on selected track renewal on Lines 1, 2, 3, 5
and 8 which are the main priority rail routes in Bulgaria and have a total length of 1,880 km.
Track renewal and medium range maintenance are already overdue on 25% (526 km) of this
network, considering the two standard criteria of accumulated gross ton-kilometers and the
number of years since the last major maintenance investment. However, because regular
maintenance has also been curtailed, and poor quality materials were used in previous
rehabilitation work, in practice nearly half (930 km) the total length of these five priority
lines are currently subject to speed restrictions due to track condition. Priority sections for
renewal (about 400 km) have been identified on the basis of a thorough analysis of track
conditions and importance of the traffic.
5.3          Poor track condition causes BDZ serious problems: a) speed restrictions must
be imposed and these mean that a larger fleet of locomotives and other rolling stock is
required to carry a given volume of traffic; b) in some cases additional restrictions on
permissible axles loadings are necessary; c) sub-standard track condition increases the cost of
maintaining locomotives and rolling stock; d) many passenger services now take longer than
the bus journey on the same route and this, together with passenger discomfort, reduces the
attractiveness of the railway and exacerbates the loss of traffic to road; e) inadequate track
maintenance increases the risk of derailments which carry a heavy penalty in terms of
operation disruption, and can result in damage to the environment or, in a worst case, death
and injury; and f) when timely track maintenance is not undertaken, the subsequent cost of
bringing the track back to its normal operating condition increases substantially.
Furthermore, the accumulated backlog of track maintenance becomes an increasingly
significant burden - both financial and operational - on BDZ.
5.4          Benefits. Restoring the track to its normal operating condition would give rise
to benefits which would result from:
-    removal of speed restrictions;
-    reduced future maintenance costs;
-    reduced incidence of derailments.
The evaluation period is taken as thirteen years (i.e., three years for project
implementation plus ten years of operation). Traffic on the five lines to be improved under
the project is estimated to comprise 60% of total traffic. The "without-project" alternative is
not a "do-nothing" alternative because the present poor condition of the track requires
significant maintenance effort in order to provide the minimum conditions necessary for safe
train operations. It is therefore assumed that the alternative to carrying out the investments



- 27 -
proposed under the project would be a more gradual implementation of the required major
periodic maintenance. It is assumed that it would take about ten years to achieve
approximately the same level of track rehabilitation which would be obtained in three years
with the project.
5.5          Based on the above, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the investment in track
renewal and track maintenance equipment is 34%. Including passenger time savings, this
increases to 40%. Detailed analysis of the benefits and calculations are in the Project File.
Management Information System
5.6          The introduction of improved management information system would bring the
following benefits: reduce expenditures on foreign wagons used in Bulgaria and better control
of domestic freight cars, better control of sales of passenger tickets which combined with
improved financial management, particularly the cash flow will result in reduced interest
costs. The IRR for this equipment is estimated at 22%.
Risks
5.7          Given the political uncertainties in Bulgaria, there is a risk that some of the
more difficult decisions embodied in the RAP regarding staff reductions, tariff increases, etc.
will be delayed. There is also a risk for some shift of traffic away from rail if the railways
do not clearly assess the needs of the markets in this period of transition in the economy.
The measures taken up-front (para. 2.38) indicate that the railways and Government are
committed to restructuring. The proposed mid-term review (para. 3.16) would provide an
opportunity to assess the situation and recommend any changes in the project that may be
required. The physical components do not pose significant risks, since all investments are
for rehabilitation of the core components of the system which would have high priority under
any restructuring scenario.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.1          During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:
(a)  implementation of the Restructuring Action Plan (RAP) (para. 2.40 and
Annex 1);
(b)  track renewal and maintenance equipment financed by the project will
remain with BDZ and not be passed on to MOT's Unit (para. 2.8);
(c)  auditing of BDZ's account by independent auditors and audit reports
acceptable to the Bank (para. 2.35);
(d)  continuation throughout project implementation of the Project
Management Team (para. 3.7);

BULGARIA
RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Environmental Review
Environmental management in the Bulgarian State Railways (BDZ).
1.    The railways provide a way of transportation which is safer for the environment
compared to their main competitor, the automobile transport. The impact of rail operations on
air pollution is minimal and there are no severe problems associated with traffic noise, water
pollution, soil contamination in loading and unloading areas, spills of hazardous cargo and waste
disposal. In compliance with the Bulgarian Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation, for
all investment projects in the railways (including reconstruction and rehabilitation projects)
assessments of the potential negative environmental impacts and mitigation plans are required.
In order to address the environmental problems occurring in operations, cars and locomotives
manufacturing and maintenance, and car hygiene provision, and to comply with the
environmental laws and regulations, environmental management functions are allocated in three
different departments of BDZ. The technical specialists in these departments are highly qualified
and competent in their field, although unexperienced in operating in a market oriented
environment.
2.    Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and provision of overall
environmental expertise.  These functions are delegated to the Department for Strategic
Development, which is in charge of restructuring planning and BDZ's adjustment to the new
market conditions. The department employs one full time environmental economist in the
central administration, who coordinates all so called "designated environmental experts" in the
BDZ's branches (usually those are the labor safety experts whose position descriptions include
environmental protection). It appears that the delegation of responsibilities to "designated
experts" is rather formal (during mission visits to depot and workshops where non-compliance
with environmental standards occur no such experts were present). In addition, the Department
for Strategic Development has a core group of experts currently working on incorporating
environmental considerations in the strategy for railway development. In particular, they are
assisting the BDZ's management in assessing the full social costs for different types of
transportation, comparing accident rates and environmental externalities between the road and
rail transport.
3.    Veterinarian and disinfection control in railways operation. A Sanitary Department (7
experts, directly reporting to the Director General of the BDZ) manages veterinarian and
disinfection control, practiced by 13 regional specialized stations (with staff of 248). The
railway sanitary service was created in 1934, using German and Austro-Hungarian models.
Until 1976 the department and the specialized sanitary stations provided services exclusively to
the BDZ. In 1976 the Department was reorganized into a Transport System Sanitation Service,



-54-                               ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5
and all means of transport (rail, water, air and auto-transport) have been given access to the
existing facilities. Nonetheless, it continues to be under the direct supervision of BDZ's
Director General in order to ensure the maintenance of the above services during the economic
transition.
4.    Management of landscape and track maintenance. Landscape rehabilitation, afforestation
and track maintenance are carried out by a separate Department under the Director General, with
a total staff of 224. While the Department is mostly concerned with track safety, it is also
responsible for environmental protection of the track areas. Aside of issues related to use of
chemicals in vegetation control, the staff of this Department is experiencing problems with their
landscape rehabilitation activities, mostly resulting from inefficient coordination with the
environmental authorities on nature conservation (permission from the Ministry of Environment
or the Regional Environmental Inspectorates is required for deforestation, afforestation, and
terrain maintenance).
5.    In addition to the above functions, regulations and control of hazardous materials
transportation are provided by a Department for Hazardous Cargo (a military unit in the central
BDZ administration).
6.    Issues and recommendations.   Currently there is little coordination among the
Departments addressing the above environmental issues. It appears that no company-wide
environmental assessment and planning has been carried out. At negotiations, it should be
agreed that the Department for Strategic Development should incorporate in the job description
of the environmental specialist: (i) environmental performance assessment of BDZ's branches;
(ii) setting priorities for BDZ's environmental expenditures; (iii) internal coordination on the
environmental activities; and (iv) development and implementation of standard reporting
procedures. Training should be provided on environmental impact assessment and auditing
regulations, on low cost sanitation and on market-based incentives for environmental protection.
Key Environmental Problems in Railway Operation and Maintenance.
7.    Normal concerns for railways such as disposal of waste (including oil), cleaning of tank
settlements, water treatment, use of chemicals for track maintenance, and transport of hazardous
materials are covered by the national environmental legislation and regulations, and mitigation
measures are in place in BDZ practice. Still problems exist, resulting both from shortcomings
of the regulatory framework and to weak enforcement. Among those are: (i) waste water
discharge and treatment in some depots and maintenance stations (especially the outdated ones);
(ii) solid waste disposal; (iii) use of chemicals for track maintenance; (iv) development and
enforcement of safety and hygiene instructions and procedures; and (v) staff performance
quality.
8.    Waste Water Discharge and Treatment. Waste water discharge appears to be the most
significant case of systematic violation of Bulgaria's environmental standards by the railways.
Nine of BDZ's depot, workstations and plants have been paying non-compliance sanctions to the
environmental authorities on a regular basis. In 1993 the railways paid a total of 1,238,485



-55-                                ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 5
Leva. The sanctions were spread unevenly among the separate polluters. According to the data
for the level of these sanctions for each of the nine violators, two of the depots were charged
with 93 percent of the total amount (Sofia Depot paid 77 percent of the 1993 sanctions, and
Drujba Depot paid another 15 percent). Four factors seem to constrain efficient response to
waste water discharge problems: (i) lack of funding; (ii) obsolete facilities and/or lack of
appropriate space for construction of waste water treatment plants; (iii) low level of the
sanctions (below the costs of abatement) causing disincentive; and (iv) low priority of
environmental issues for some branch managers.  In depot and workshops where the
management is proactive both good housekeeping and low cost solutions are implemented and
the pollution problems are significantly reduced. For example, use of sediment depositors and
bypasses for waste water discharge in the city collector eliminated the need of local waste water
treatment facility in Nadezda Depot in Sofia.
9.    Waste disposal.  Solid waste is generated both in operations and maintenance.  In
operations, waste problems (passenger and cargo waste) occur mostly in the depot and
maintenance stations. While for passenger waste the key problem is waste disposal, leftovers
in cars from freight cargo could also lead to soil and ground water contamination, and create
health risks for the maintenance staff. Freight cars are often sent for maintenance with non-
identified, possibly hazardous, cargo leftovers. Trash is often spread around stations and along
the tracks (caused by improper loading, unloading and handling, passengers neglect and lack of
proper sites). Scrap from maintenance, as well as from decommissioning of locomotives and
cars, is normally sold for recycling. Inefficiency of the responsible central administration
service, low scrap prices and insufficient economic incentives for the local staff restrict scrap
sales and recycling. A particular problem is reselling/reuse of steel and nickel car batteries.
They are often stored on the ground, creating risk of soil and ground water contamination.
10.   Chemical application. All chemicals for track maintenance are tested and approved by
the National Center for Hygiene, and by the Ministry of Agriculture. There are procedures for
chemicals application, which should minimize health risks for the Departmental staff, employed
in track maintenance, and prevent the spread of chemicals over agricultural land. Due to lack
of specialized track maintenance cars, and to staff negligence, these procedures are not always
followed.
11.   Veterinarian control and car hygiene. Currently there are 13 specialized stations. An
Ordinance of the Director General specifies where should a railcar be sent for disinfection,
depending on the cargo, for which it was last used. The stations have a good record with the
environmental authorities (only one fine was reported for improper handling of railcars after the
transportation of hazardous cargo). All stations operate according to regulations for hygiene
parameters, usage of cleaning chemicals and hygiene control. An Operational Manual for these
station is incorporated in the Veterinarian Activities Act.
12.   Most of the existing stations need rehabilitation and expansion. In almost all of them the
existing waste water treatment facilities are inadequate. Incinerators are available only at
airports, and often waste is stored in municipal waste disposal sites without proper handling.
Freight cars are repeatedly not directed to the stations by station personnel (either due to



-56-                                ANNEX 3
Page 4 of 5
shortage of cars, or because of low qualification of the staff, involved in loading and unloading
operations). Since autocars are not exposed to the same hygiene control as rail cars, cargo
transfer from auto to rail cars causes hygiene risks to the railway. Although since 1981 the state
autotransport companies have been required to control car hygiene, the newly expanding private
carriers avoid the control. Strengthening the sanitary control is needed at the borders. A new
sanitary station should be constructed at the border with Turkey (near Svilengrad).
13.   Currently the managerial and financial organization of the railways does not encourage
cost recovery in freight car cleaning. Both revenues from and expenditures for the hygiene
services are centralized in BDZ's consolidated budget. The tariffs for these services are not
linked to costs (only for oil cars cleaning the tariff is set at a higher level). In addition, the
costs for cleaning for some types of cargo are higher than the fine that can be imposed on the
user for violating the sanitary regulations. Many users prefer to pay the fines and transfer the
responsibility and the costs for car cleaning to the sanitary stations.
14.   Hygiene regulations and procedures. Existing regulations specify in details hygiene
requirements in railway operations and maintenance. There are, however, two areas where
further work would be needed to improve cargo specifications: (i) regulations for proper
treatment of freight cars after use); and (ii) instructions for dealing with the consequences of
accidents with hazardous cargos.
15.   Staff performance. Most of the environmental problems caused by the railways are
escalated by bad housekeeping and staff negligence. Services like waste handling and disposal
are very unattractive and even the current high unemployment level does not assure reliable
staff. Some of the BDZ's branches are contracting hygiene services to private firms, which
seems to contribute to quality improvements. There are, however, trade union constraints to
broader application of the contracting practice, since it leads to loss of permanent jobs.
16.   Conclusions and recommendations.  In short and medium term the BDZ' financial
situation would allow only limited investments in environmental protection. On the other hand,
further tightening of pollution control and increase in the level of pollution sanctions and charges
would help to address the most serious environmental problems of the BDZ. The Department
for Strategic Development, in collaboration with the environmental authorities, should prepare
environmental performance assessment of the railways and set priorities for environmental
expenditures within the budget constraint. Rehabilitation of existing facilities (e. g. the waste
incinerator in Nadezda Depot, the waste water facility in Sofia Depot etc.) and completion of
advanced projects (e. g. train wash station in Plovdiv) should be given priority. Proper pricing
of the environmental services (e. g. car hygiene, landscape maintenance, terrain rehabilitation)
should be imposed to encourage efficient resource allocation. Some of the above services should
be privatized.
Environmental Consequences from Railway Rehabilitation and Restructuring.
17.   Railway rehabilitation would improve the competitiveness of the railway versus its main
competitor, the automobile transport, and would bring overall environmental benefits. There



-57-                               ANNEX 3
Page 5 of 5
could be, however, environmental consequences of lines/stations closures that may require
mitigation measures
(e. g. clean up of polluted loading and unloading areas, as well as of waste disposal sites;
liquidation of abandoned underground and above ground storage tanks used for hazardous
chemicals; removal of transformers and other facilities).
18.   These consequences have not been overseen by the existing regulations. The appraisal
team assisted the Ministry of Environment in the drafting of a new Environmental Audits
Regulation, which would allow the development of auditing procedures for lines and stations
closures. Until this Regulation is approved by the Council of Ministers, all restructuring
activities in the railways (both within and outside of the scope of this project) would be reviewed
by the Regional Environmental Inspectorates or the Ministry of Environment, depending on the
scale and the expected environmental consequences of any particular restructuring operation.
19.   The restructuring of BDZ responds to declining railways share of passenger and freight
traffic and targets improved performance of the company. There are, however, environmental
concerns related to the rapid increase of road transportation. In response to it the Ministry of
Environment plans to introduce gasoline charges, linked to the air pollution from motor vehicles,
which would internalize some of the externalities from the road transport. Such measure would
have comparative advantages for the railways. The Ministry of Environment intends to prepare
a study to assess the environmental consequences from different transport strategies, and to
design economic instruments for internalizing the environmental externalities from the
automobile transport. If this study is undertaken, it would complement current efforts of BDZ
staff to assess and compare the full social costs of the rail and the road transport.
Operational implications
20.   The restructuring and modernization of the railways would gradually scale down the
company and would eliminate some of the activities causing environmental problems. In
addition, the BDZ should undertake steps to improve the level of responsiveness to
environmental problems. For the proposed operation the following recommendations should be
agreed at negotiations:
(i)    Environmental management capacity  building: the Environmental
Specialist position in the central administration should be clearly defined
in detailed Terms of Reference; according to them training should be
provided; proper documentation and communications among the
departments should be established (Paragraph 6);
(ii)   Setting environmental priorities: an environmental performance review for
the railways should be prepared and decision should be made for targeted
use of funds according to the identified priorities on the basis of
environmental, economic, and financial considerations (Paragraph 16); and

RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
Project Implementation Plan
Project Objectives
1.    The objective of the project is to support the restructuring process which BDZ and the
Government have initiated. BDZ has prepared a four-year Restructuring Action Plan 1995-98 (RAP).
This plan including operational and financial targets is in Annex 1 of the Bank's Staff Appraisal
Report (SAR). It gives the objectives to be reached, the actions needed to reach the objectives,
responsibilities for these actions and their timing.
Project Description
2.    The items to be partially financed by IBRD and EBRD are high priority items for the
rehabilitation of the core network and equipment of the railways, necessary to improve performance
and reduce costs in order to achieve the targets set in the RAP. The description of the project
components, their cost estimates (foreign and local cost, the latter including an estimate of taxes and
duties), the proposed financing plan are in Sections B, C and D of Chapter III of the SAR.
3.    To further support the execution of the RAP, BDZ's personnel needs training, particularly in
the fields of modern management, marketing, finance and accounting, strategic planning, commercial
operation, environment and new techniques of operation, including greater computerization of various
activities. The agreed training program, to be financed by the project, is in Table 1 of this Annex.
Its implementation will start in May 1995 and progress will be reviewed at the occasion of Bank's
supervision missions and at least annually.
Implementation Arrangements
4.    The Project will be implemented by BDZ. A Project management team, already established
by BDZ, will remain in operation and fully staffed throughout execution of the project. A Deputy
Director General has already been assigned to head the team.
5.    A new railway law specifying, inter alia, the relationship between the railways and the
Government has been submitted to Parliament by the Council of Ministers. According to the law,
BDZ and the Government will enter into multi-year contract plans that will be updated annually.
The contracts will govern the respective BDZ and State responsibilities and specify operational and
financial objectives, staff levels, public service support, capital contribution for infrastructure and
other investments.
6.    The role of the Bank during project implementation is in section H of Chapter 3 of the SAR.
It will, in particular, include a mid-term review within 18-24 months of effectiveness.

Page 2 of 2
Implementation Plan
7.    The implementation plan is given in a set of tables attached to this Annex:
- Items eligible for IBRD financing are detailed in Table 2;
- The timetable for the bidding process is in Table 3;
- The procurement plan, including the implementation schedule for each project component,
with details of the tendering process, such as the number of contracts for each item, the
procurement method and the schedule for bidding and awarding contracts is in Table 4;
- The Implementation Schedule with the estimated annual contractual and other payments is
in Table 5. This disbursement schedule is somewhat different from the IBRD
disbursement schedule shown in Table 10 of the SAR, which reflects a more conservative
estimate. BDZ will do its best to meet the schedule given in Table 5 herewith.
8.    The financial and economic analyses of the project, including the assumptions made in
preparing these analyses are in Chapters IV and V of the SAR. Details are in Annex 2 and in the
project file.
9.    Auditors for the project will be appointed before the end of calendar 1995, in time to prepare
the financial audits for BDZ's 1995 financial year by June 30, 1996.
Monitoring and Evaluation
10.   The indicators that will be monitored for measuring progress towards the project objectives
are the operational and financial targets included in the RAP (Annex 1). The RAP is included as a
side letter to the Loan Agreement.
11.   To measure progress of physical implementation, the indicators are the installation of the
various equipment and material procured. For instance, for track rehabilitation, the number of
kilometers rehabilitated in 1996, 1997 and 1998, and the placing into service of the track maintenance
machines and for the MIS component the installation of hardware and the beginning of utilization of
the new software. An agreement was reached during negotiations, on a methodology for the
preparation of progress reports for better project monitoring and supervision (Attachment 3 to the
Minutes of the Loan negotiations).
