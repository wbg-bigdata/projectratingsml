MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BULGARIAN STATE RAILWAYS
FOR A RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Bulgarian State Railways for the equivalent of US$95 million, with the guarantee of the
Republic of Bulgaria to help finance a Railway Rehabilitation Project. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of twenty years, including five years of grace.
A parallel financing totalling US$75 million is being provided by EBRD and EU PHARE.
2.    Background. The broad economic and political changes occurring in Central and East
European (CEE) countries have a considerable impact on the transport markets of these countries.
Bulgaria is no exception. Socialist economies were characteristically heavy users of freight transport.
For instance, Bulgaria generated three to four times more freight transport (measured in ton-km per $
of GNP) than West European countries of comparable size and transport distances. This situation
resulted from the disproportionate role played by heavy industry, a large user of rail transport. The
diversification of the economy toward consumer-oriented goods and services is reducing overall
transport demand and shifting some of it from rail to road. After three years of decrease, freight
traffic in 1993 and 1994 stabilized at the level reached in 1992, i.e. about 60% below its 1989 level.
While most of this decline can be attributed to the general downturn in the economy, some of it is
structural and traffic is not expected to return to its previous level when the economy recovers.
3.     Passenger travel in socialist economies was also unusually rail oriented in comparison to
market economies. As for freight, the rail share can be expected to gradually diminish as bus
competition develops and private car ownership increases. This will be particularly true on lower
density routes serving smaller towns and rural areas. In such areas, buses will generally be a more
economic alternative for providing public transport services than continuation of rail services. In
1994, BDZ passenger traffic had fallen 36% from its 1989 level.
4.    As a result of the much reduced traffic and real increases in cost of inputs such as fuels and
other materials, BDZ's financial situation deteriorated rapidly. In 1992, for the first time, budgetary
support, borrowing, and increased arrears were needed to balance expenditures, and needed
maintenance was postponed. The losses would have been even higher if adequate maintenance had
been done. If unresolved, BDZ's financial problems will perpetuate inadequate maintenance and
result in further deterioration of the quality of its services, which would further reduce operating
efficiency and compromise BDZ's chances to compete with other modes. A railway restructuring
study sponsored by EBRD was completed in September 1993 with recommendations for improving
the situation.
5.    BDZ's management is convinced of the need for in depth restructuring in order to reduce
costs, increase revenues and progressively reduce the need for Government's financial assistance.
The Government supports BDZ's restructuring plans and since October 1993, substantial progress has
been made in the implementation of short term measures and in the development of operation and
action plans for restructuring.



6.    Achievements since October 1993 include: (a) introduction of a satisfactory railway law by
the Council of Ministers to Parliament; (b) appointment of a new and smaller BDZ Governing
Council with a majority of non-BDZ representatives; (c) cancellation of passenger services on two
low density lines on April 1, 1994-- these lines are now operated as industrial branches-- and
introduction of a draft decree to change the status of over 1,000 km of low density lines (25% of the
network). Of these lines, some with very low passenger services (340 km) are proposed for freight
operations only or closure, some serving large power plants and mines (185 km) would be transferred
to these industries, and another 540 km serving larger urban areas could be operated under contract
with local authorities; (d) freight tariffs increased by 10% in December 1993, 37% on April 1, 1994
and 20% on January 1, 1995; (e) passenger tariffs increased by 20% in December 1993, 65% on
June 1, 1994, and 39% on January 1, 1995 and are now 313% above their May 31, 1993 level, (i.e.
a 45% increase in real terms); (f) a further staff reduction of about 6,000 persons during 1994 (staff
has been reduced by nearly 24,000 persons, i.e. about 30%, since 1989); and (g) introduction of new
timetables for freight and passenger services in January and May 1994 with further rationalization in
passenger and freight trains operated daily and stations served. As a result of these changes, fuel
savings have reached about 8%, marshalling yards have been reduced from 14 to 6 and 180 stations
have either been closed or reduced to unmanned halts.
7.     Proiect Objectives. The objective of the project is to support and deepen the restructuring
process which the BDZ and the Government have initiated. The Government subscribes to the
general principles of the European Union's Directive on Railways for the restructuring of BDZ, and
those are reflected in the railway law, i.e. that the railways should operate independently in a
commercial manner according to market principles and that the State would compensate the railways
for any losses incurred as a result of social tariffs or public service obligations imposed on the
railways and also assume partial responsibility for infrastructure, as it does for roads.
8.    The BDZ Governing Council approved a plan for reorganization along business lines, under
the principles of the Trade Act for state owned joint stock companies. Modern financial management
including cost accounting, allowing the separation of accounts for various activities, will be
introduced under the project. Some non-core activities which have markets outside the railways, such
as container manufacturing, the foundry and the quarries would be separated, paving the way for
privatization as Bulgaria's business climate improves. A four-year restructuring action plan has been
agreed and would form the basis for a contract plan to be signed by the railways and the State as
specified in the draft law. The restructuring plan covers objectives for all aspects of BDZ's activity
and organization, actions needed to reach these objectives, responsibilities to carry out these actions
and their timing and, finally, the operational and financial targets to be reached as a result of the
actions specified in the plan. Some of the main targets are: a further staff reduction of about 10,000
people, from 58,000 to 48,000 by 1998 and massive scrapping of locomotives (30% of the electric
locos and 40% of the diesel and shunting fleets) and rolling stock (30% of the coaches and 40% of
the freight cars).
9.     Proiect Description and Implementation. The project would support the policies needed to
achieve the objectives summarized above. The proposed loan will only finance necessary investments
which are in line with the restructuring concept and would help the Government and the BDZ through
the restructuring process. These would include: a) track renewal and maintenance on priority routes
(67% of project cost); b) Management Information System (MIS) (6% of project cost); c) signalling
telecommunications, traction and rolling stock improvements, and coach rehabilitation (25% of project



- 3 -
costs, financed by EBRD) and d) technical assistance and training to support the restructuring process
(2% of project costs). The project would be implemented by BDZ. A project management team has
been established and a Chairman and higher level officials in managerial positions appointed.
10.   Project Financing. EBRD, which financed the initial restructuring study is co-financing the
proposed project and has organized suppliers' credit financing as well as obtained additional co-
financing from EU PHARE. EU PHARE grant financing has been secured also for technical
assistance to reorganize the finance and accounting functions of BDZ including the introduction of
cost accounting and a Canadian grant was obtained for the installation and training on a simplified
costing model to be used until the modernized financial system is in place. Both activities started
ahead of the project in the fall of 1994. Installation and training on the costing model was completed
in early 1995. In addition, grants have been provided by USTDA for a feasibility study of
telecommunications and data transmission system and by KtW of Germany to assist BDZ with the
finalization of bidding documents.
11.   Retroactive financing in an amount of US$100,000 would be provided by the Bank to cover
training expenses incurred after April 24, 1995 for upper and middle management of BDZ and the
Ministries of Finance and Transport on such topics as management, marketing, finance, accounting
and environment.
12.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Bulgaria, discussed by the Board on March 9, 1993, aims at supporting the Government's structural
adjustment program and macroeconomic stabilization objectives. The proposed project fits well in
such strategy due to the drain on fiscal resources that could be expected if restructuring were not to
take place. In addition, such restructuring will align the railways with the overall changes in
economic structure that are being pursued. The proposed project would be the first Bank intervention
in the sector. If the initial measures taken by the railways are not followed up and reinforced by
restructuring, the financial situation of the railways can be expected to become a continuous and
potentially large drain on fiscal resources. The Bank has a long experience in advising and lending to
railways and has followed closely the restructuring process that has been unfolding over the last 25
years in railways of North America, Western Europe and Japan. Realizing early that railways in
CEE countries are now facing similar problems as railways in market economies, the Bank organized,
in 1990 and again in 1992, railway roundtables for CEE countries. Representatives of ministries of
transport and railways attended these conferences (including Bulgaria at the second one) to review this
international experience and identify the critical elements for a successful restructuring of railways.
The Bank is now involved in railway restructuring in virtually all CEE countries and the extension to
Bulgaria is a logical next step which is also welcomed by the Government. It is already clear that the
restructuring study and the joint preparation missions with EBRD have been a catalyst in pressing on
with the difficult although necessary restructuring process.
13.   Railway restructuring is a lengthy and continuous process, the most difficult aspects of which
are the downsizing which is required in terms of staff, motive power and rolling stock, workshops
and infrastructure (lines and stations). All are necessary to bring costs under control but politically
difficult to achieve. This is particularly so for staff reductions since Bulgaria faces high
unemployment (17% at end 1994). In 1994, budgetary allocation to compensate BDZ for certain
classes of passenger tariffs imposed on BDZ by Government for social reasons and to contribute to
track maintenance has been considerably reduced (to the equivalent of US$18 million, only 30% of
the 1993 allocation in real terms) although expenditures continue to grow faster than revenues.



- 4 -
Continuous Government support is needed for some years, until costs can be brought under control.
The Government supports the Restructuring Action Plan mentioned in paragraph 8 above.
14.    Agreed Actions. The Restructuring Action Plan with its operating and financial targets was
agreed at negotiations and incorporated as a side letter to the loan agreement. The plan sets targets
and timetables, as applicable, for: traction and rolling stock needs and performance, (including assets
scrapping and disposal); maintenance of traction and rolling stock; infrastructure rehabilitation and
maintenance (track, signalling, telecommunications); change in status of lines and stations; separation
of non-core activities; human resources (including staff reduction targets and training); and financial
targets consisting of a working ratio and a debt service ratio. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the
country's economic prospects and external environment, the plan will need to be periodically revised
and adjusted to prevailing circumstances. Hence, at negotiations, agreement was reached on a formal
mid-term review to take place in 1997. Final ratification of the Railway Law is a condition of
effectiveness together with signature of a satisfactory Contract Plan, specifying the mutual obligations
of BDZ and the Government. Agreement was confirmed at negotiations that such plan will be
updated annually. A cross-effectiveness condition has been agreed with EBRD and is included in the
Loan Agreement.
15.    Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. This is the first project in the sector but reflects
the Bank's experience worldwide indicating the need to develop commercially oriented and
autonomous railways that can adapt to the market and competition from other modes, complemented
by a business approach that will seek expanded private participation in sector activities. This implies
restructuring to increase efficiency and also a clear definition of the relationships between the BDZ
and the State.
16.    Sustainability. The Project will help launch a restructuring process that will result in
improved efficiency and financial situation so as to ensure sustained railway operations in the future.
17.    Environmental Aspects. The project is classified as "B" for the purpose of O.D. 4.01. Most
of the project consists of the procurement of equipment for track maintenance, signalling, data
processing and transmission; works will be limited to track renewal on existing priority lines.
Therefore, the environmental impact of the project will be limited to the area of the railway itself.
Workshops' modernization and improvement are financed by EBRD and include an environmental
improvement component. Railway rehabilitation would improve its competitiveness versus
automobile transport and would bring overall environmental benefits. There are no resettlement
issues.
18.    Benefits and Risks. The immediate benefits will be resource savings resulting from the
restructuring process and lower transport costs. The main risks are of policy slippage, due to changes
in the political environment. Further deterioration of economic conditions in Bulgaria would pose a
risk of lack of counterpart funds and reduced rail traffic. These risks are outside Bank control, so it
is proposed to hold a mid-term review to assess progress in achieving the development objectives of
the project and restructure it as necessary.

19.   Recommendations. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
