MEMORANDUM AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
Of THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR AN EDUCATION SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zaire for SDR 15.0 million (US$21.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity to help finance an
education sector rehabilitation project. The project would be cofinanced
by France (US$4.2 million equivalent), UNDP (US$0.5 million equivalent),
UNICEF (US$0.6 million equivalent) and WWF (US$ 0.3 million equivalent).
2.      Background.  Underfinancing of the Zairian primary and secondary
education system, if continued, is likely to undermine the significant
achievements of past decades (gross enrollment rates reached 79Z in primary
and 23% in secondary education in 1987/88). Public spending for education,
barely 10 of the total state budget at present, has been falling for the
past fifteen years, while external assistance remained limited and
dr lining.  The education sector has therefore come to rely increasingly on
use-s' contributions, which currently represent 60X of total education
expenditures -- probabhly close to the limits of payment capacity. Total
resources available to the education sector are skewed against primary
education (where unit costs of $24 are among the lowest in Sub-Saharan
Africa), and overwhelmingly absorbed by the salary bill at the expense of
nonsalary recurrent inputs.
3.    The management of primary and secondary education is weak at all
levels, from the central services of the Ministry of Primary, Secondary and
Vocational Education (MEPSP) to the schools. Planning and programming
capacities are particularly deficient. Ninety-five percent of the students
are enrolled in public schools, two thirds of which are managed under the
mandate of religious nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); such schools are
often better off financially and administratively. Initial primary school
teacher training is inadequate, in-service training is practically
nonexistent and supervision is insufficient.
4.    The quality and internal efficiency of primary and secondary
instruction are declining and primary level enrollments are leveling off.
The immediate reasons for this deterioration include: (a) an acute shortage
of textbooks and basic learning materials, especially at the primary level;
(b) low-paid and underqualified teachers with high turnover and absentee
rates; and (c) ill-equipped and ill-maintained facilities.
5.    Confronted with the degradation of the sector, the NEPSP has
initiated a number of corrective measures such as curriculum development
and a more efficient teachers' pay system. The MEPSP has also designed a
comprehensive long-term sectoral strategy which identifies clear and
attainable priorities and indicates the conditions needed for sustainable
development of the sector, based on public and private initiatives (letter
of education sector strategy of January 18, 1991). The strategy sets
enrollment objectives, with a priority for basic education and more
emphasis on short technical secondary studies, and provides mechanisms to
reduce repetition; it also makes specific recommendations on cost
containment, realistic financing plans and resource mobilization. This
strategy constitutes the policy framework that the proposed project would
both embody and assist.

6.     Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Sustained development in Zaire
depends on a sound management of public resources and on the instauration
of a favorable climate for private investment. It also requires the
rehabilitation of physical and social infrastructure. IDA's objective in
social sectors --essentially education and health, is to prevent any
further degradation and to assist core operations aiming at giving those
sectors the necessary impetus to regain a minimum level of efficiency.
IDA's involvement in rehabilitating the long-neglected education sector
will be highly beneficial even before resumption of an appropriate
macroeconomic policy. The project supports policy measures aimed at
increasing budgetary allocations to the sector to alleviate past
underfunding, and at shoring up the legal framework for NGO participation
to reduce uncertainties and improve the delivery of educational services.
Efficient and equitable education services not only permit direct
productivity gains, but also help to alleviate poverty and are critical to
long-term progress on the status of health and nutrition. They also
greatly contribute to improve the status of women and boost awareness in
population and environment problems. The proposed operation would build
upon previous IDA involvement in the sector (Educational Technical
Assistance and Training Project -- Credit 1519-ZR), and would complement
the ongoing Higher Education Rationalization Project (Credit 1839-ZR). In
particular, it would intensify efforts to strengthen education planning
activities and bolster collaboration between the MEPSP and the Ministry of
Higher Education (MESURS) to harmonize control of student flows and
resource allocation policy in the two education sub-sectors.
7. Proiect Obiectives.   The project has two main objectives: (a) to stop
the deterioration of quality in primary education, and to boost it by
taking immediate steps to increase the availability of key educational
inputs; and (b) to help the government to restore the conditions for a
balanced long-term development of a more viable and adequately financed
education sector, by taking the necessary measures proposed in the sectoral
strategy.
8. Policy Measures include: (a) redefinition of the conditions of school
management by NGOs (in particular church networks) to reduce state
interference, (b) mobilization of incremental budgetary resources for
recurrent expenditures in the sector, through the Special Budgetary
Allocation, (c) creation of the Sectoral Strategy Committee (CSS), with
representatives from both education ministries, which will monitor sectoral
developments, (d) control and adjustment of enrollment (through admission,
transition, and examinations), according to educational priorities and
financial constraints, (e) organization of a progressive scaling down of
repeater rates at the primary level, and (f) preparation and monitoring of
sectoral public expenditure programs (PEP).
9. Proiect Descrintion. The project would have three components:
(1)   Support to the government's sectoral strategy through (a)
technical assistance to the Committee for Sectoral Strategy (CSS), and
(b) strengthening of the MEPSP' planning and programming capabilities
(including PEP).
(2)   Promotion of quality, efficiency, and equity in primary education,
through: (a) the provision of basic textbooks and teacher guides, (b)
in-service training associated with textbooks, (c) rehabilitation of the



-3-
local education environment (multi-level classrooms in rural areas,
pilot teacher training school, and pilot incentive schemes for teachers)
in Haut-Zaire, and (d) construction of about five primary schools on the
crowded periphery of Kinshasa.
(3)   Institutional reinforcement byt  (a) rationalizing working
conditions of the central administrative staff (office consolidation,
training, computerization and technical assistance for the teacher pay
unit, the office of statistics and the primary education unit), and (b)
improving work conditions at local levels (training and equipment of
administrators and supervisors).
10.     The estimated project cost is US$29.7 million equivalent, including
US$0.6 million taxes, with a foreign exchange component of US$17.4 million
(58Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Zaire are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9145-ZR, dated January 30, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
11.      ARreed Actions.   The government has already started implementing
a comprehensive long-term sectoral strategy (para. 5), including an
enhanced role for NGOs. It also made a special budgetary allocation to
increase resources available for financing recurrent education
expenditures. The CSS has already been created, and the list of books
eligible to be produced under the project is ready. Conditions of
effectiveness are that (a) the CSS be adequately staffed, (b) the project
implementation unit sign program contract with units of the MEPSP directly
involved in the implementation of the project, (c) contributions by French
Cooperation Agency (FAC), UNDP and UNICEF to the project be secured, and
(d) the project advance account be opened, and an initial deposit of
US$200,000 be mad'.
12.    Other agreements include the government's commitment to further
special budgetary allocation for education for the years 1991-93. The
MEPSP will prepare and update each year a three-year rolling sectoral
public expenditures program, which will be transmitted to the Association,
for comment.  The MEPSP will take appropriate measures to regulate
enrollment and repetition at the primary level. Each year during project
implementation, IDA will review (a) the state of implementation of the
sectoral strategy, and of project operations, (b) the state of allocation
of the special budgetary resources for the previous year, and (c) the
operational plan for the implementation of the allocation for the following
year.
13.      Justification and Risks.  The project will ultimately boost
student achievement at all levels, and help prevent the deterioration in
Zaire's human capital base. The risks stem from the fact that government
may not make sufficient budgetary allocations to the sector, and from
MEPSP' weak managerial performance. The project addresses these risks by
strengthening the ministry's planning, programming and budgeting capacities
with external assistance, equipment and training, and by sectoral policy
measures. Other risks are associated with textbook distribution in a large
country with poor communication. Relying on well-organized church networks



- 4 -
will help reduce this risk, as was the case in the recently completed
project in the sector.
Recommoendation
14.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.
