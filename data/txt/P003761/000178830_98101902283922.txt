REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A THIRD BAPINDO PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $40 million for relending
to a development finance company, Bank Pembangunan Indonesia (BAPINDO).
Interest on the loan would be 8.2% per annum. The proceeds of the proposed
loan would be onlent to BAPINDO at an interest rate of 11%. The amortization
schedule will be adjusted to conform substantially to the aggregate of the
repayment schedules of subloans made by BAPINDO, whose maturities will not
exceed 15 years including 3 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY /1
2.        The last economic report on Indonesia, "Indonesia:    Recent
Developments and Medium-Term Perspective," of March 8, 1977 (1516-IND)
described the recovery of the economy from the world recession and the
financial troubles of Pertamina, the state oil company, and examined some
of the important development issues which the country faces in the next few
years.
3.        During Indonesia's First Development Plan period (1969/70-1973/74)/2,
the rehabilitation of the Indonesian economy was almost completed. Transport,
power, irrigation works and other infrastructure facilities, after years of
neglect, were greatly improved and strengthened. Agricultural output expan-
ded at an average rate of 4.5% a year and foundations of modern industry -
fertilizer, cement, etc. - were laid. During this period, the annual rate
of economic growth exceeded 7.5%; domestic savings and investment also rose
rapidly. With the start of the Second Development Plan period (1974/75-
1978/79), the Government expected that rehabilitation would be completed and
a start made on a course of long-term development which would assure not only
a satisfactory rate of economic growth but also a wider distribution of
income. The first two years of the Plan were dominated by the developments
in the oil sector - the sharp increase in the price of oil and Pertamina's
serious financial difficulties. The latter arose from Pertamina's under-
taking of a large and diversified investment program without arranging
satisfactory financing. With the onset of the world recession, bank credit
became much more restrictive. Pertamina was unable to roll over its short-
term debt and failed to meet the financial obligations which were falling
due. In the event, the Government stepped in and undertook to honor the oil
company's obligations. The repayment of these obligations, along with the
fall in export earnings as a result of the recession, necessitated large
foreign commercial borrowing, seriously strained the Government's budgetary
resources and Indonesia's balance of payments, and led to a sharp decline in
the foreign exchange reserves.

the President's Report No. P-2075-IND dated May 10, 1977 for the Teacher
Training Project.
/2 Indonesian fiscal year April 1 to March 31.



4.        During 1976/77 Indonesia's exports recovered strongly following
improvements in the world economy, and rose to a level higher than expected
earlier. Imports continued to increase rapidly, but the rate of price
increase slowed down and Indonesia's terms of trade improved. Most of
Pertamina's short-term debt had been repaid by the end of 1975/76, and
disbursements on foreign borrowing continued to be high in 1976/77. As a
result, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves rose to a more comfortable
level, i.e. $1.2 billion at the end of 1976 (and even higher levels in recent
months) corresponding to about two months of imports.
5.        The Government's budgetary position was also much better in 1976/77.
With the boost in oil exports and a further renegotiation of oil contracts,
oil revenues rose by close to 40%. Non-oil revenues also rose over and above
the amounts budgeted, mainly as a result of Government efforts to curb
smuggling and a more rigorous collection of customs duties. The additional
revenues together with continued restraint in increasing current expenditures
enabled the Government not only to increase development expenditures substan-
tially but also to repay the debt to Bank Indonesia, which it had incurred in
the previous year. This helped to neutralize the monetary expansion on
account of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. The rate of
inflation over the year decreased, from a high of 17% in the first quarter to
only a modest increase in the last two quarters of 1976/77, giving an average
increase of less than 15% for the year as a whole.
6.        In 1976, the domestic economy recovered in other respects also.
The available indicators suggest that industrial output and private invest-
ment rose faster than in the previous two years. The output and prices of
tree crops rose with foreign demand, thus raising the incomes of the producers.
This provided a welcome relief to the small producers, who had suffered from
the declining foreign prices of their produce combined with rising domestic
prices of consumer goods. However, the production of food crops slackened
and rice output failed to rise appreciably for the second year in succession.
The domestic price of rice was kept stable by means of very substantial
imports, which reached 1.6 million tons (about 10% of domestic consumption)
in 1976/77. Early in the year floods, and later on drought, affected both
the wet season and dry season harvests. More importantly, a pest infesta-
tion afflicted large areas in Java, particularly those planted with the high
yielding varieties of rice, and the area under BIMAS and INMAS (the two
credit extension schemes for rice growers) remained fairly constant over the
last three years following a rapid increase during the First Development
Plan period. Rice output also failed to increase because the use of
fertilizer did not rise despite ample availability. The Government has now
relaxed controls on the distribution of fertilizer and set its fertilizer/rice
price ratio at a level that should encourage fertilizer use.
7.          The large increase in the oil revenues over the past three years
has been invested, not consumed. Government development expenditures more
than quadrupled over this period and in 1976/77 amounted to Rp 2 trillion
(or about $5 billion); even after allowing for the high rate-of inflation
development expenditures rose in real terms by 35% a year. Rough estimates
indicate that at present more than 20% of GNP is being invested in Indonesia.



- 3 -
8.        The effect of the high level of investment expenditures, however,
cannot yet be seen in the growth of the Indonesian economy. In fact, the
economic growth in the first three years of Indonesia's Second Development
Plan, i.e. 1974/75 - 1976/77, has been somewhat slower than the observed
long-term trend rate of 7.5% a year. The world recession, uncertainties
following the Pertamina crisis and domestic inflation (which made certain
domestic industries uncompetitive with imports), all had a dampening effect
on the growth of the economy. Indonesia's growth rate also failed to accel-
erate because the economic benefits from investments in recent years have
been slow in coming and because the growth in the private sector slackened.
New investment has been concentrated on relatively capital-intensive indus-
trial and infrastructure projects with long gestation periods; some projects,
such as Krakatau steel and the LNG, have been further delayed by slow imple-
mentation. Moreover, the realization of economic benefits from investments
in such sectors as transportation, telecommunications, etc. depends on the
growth in demand which in turn is determined by the growth of the rest of the
economy, which in Indonesia is mostly the private sector. Unfortunately, the
private sector seems to have failed to provide the necessary momentum of
growth. The indications are that investments in this sector, because of the
Government's attempts to control domestic inflation or because of the world
recession, rose only modestly in the first two years of the Plan.
9.        The orientation of the public sector investments was partly affected
by the Government's takeover of Pertamina's projects in the non-oil sector,
but was also a result of its attempt to raise investment rapidly in response
to the sharply rising oil revenues. It was easier and quicker to develop
capital-intensive projects; plans for several of them in fact existed even
before the improvement in public finances. On the other hand, new projects
in such sectors as rural development, transmigration, health and education
generally required not only innovation but also setting up new institutions.
Nevertheless, the Government views the orientation of its investment program
with some concern. As part of its efforts to rescue Pertamina from bankruptcy,
it initiated a careful review of all public sector investment proposals and
strengthened its control over the direction of investments. Where practicable,
the Government rejected or scaled down costly proposals. The budget for
1977/78 provides for a larger share of development expenditures in such
sectors as agriculture, health, family planning, education and regional
development.
10.      Reliable data on the recent trends in employment are not available.
The labor force has been increasing at a rate of more than one million
persons a year, but the current level of unemployment and the extent of
underemployment are not known. While considerable investment activity and
general economic prosperity is in evidence in urban and rural areas of
Indonesia, there is no indication that the labor market has tightened or that
the wages of unskilled workers have more than kept pace with domestic infla-
tion. However, the Government's efforts at family planning appear to have
yielded impressive results. Preliminary estimates from an inter-censal
survey in 1976 indicate that since 1971 the birth rate in Java and Bali has
significantly declined.
11.        The long-term consequences of the Pertamina crisis remain in the
form of large foreign debt and burdensome unfinished investment projects.



- 4 -
The heavy foreign borrowing in the last two years has raised the level of
debt service, which is now expected to reach $1.87 billion by 1980 or close
to 17% of the projected export earnings compared to 13% in 1976. This does
not take account of the contingent liabilities incurred with regard to the
hire-purchase of tankers, the exact amount of which is subject to litigation.
12.       The prospects for Indonesia's export are generally good; the
principal constraint is expected to be quantities available for export rather
than foreign demand. Indonesia's export earnings, at least over the next
five years, are expected to rise rapidly and it should not be difficult to
meet the debt service obligations and still to finance essential imports of
consumer, intermediate and capital goods. However, to maintain the pace of
development, Indonesia will continue to need a substantial inflow of foreign
assistance on concessional terms. In order to keep the debt service burden
manageable, resort to commercial borrowing in the next few years will have to
be kept to a minimum. It is estimated that Indonesia will need $2.1 billion
in new external financing commitments in 1977, and about the same amount next
year, of which no more than one-third should be on commercial terms. At the
meeting of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) in April 1977,
aid pledges of over $500 million from bilateral sources were made. The
likely commitments from those IGGI donor countries which did not pledge, from
the multilateral agencies and from OPEC and East European countries should
raise the total of official development assistance to $1.5 billion.
13.       The heavy foreign debt service requirements will also reduce the
public sector resources available for investment. The net resource transfers
from abroad are expected to decline from $1.56 billion in 1976/77 to about
$640 million in 1980/81, or from about 5% to 1% of GNP. In order to maintain
the high rate of domestic investment already reached, the Government would
need to raise substantial additional revenue over the next few years, the
bulk of which would have to come from non-oil sources. The additional
revenue raising effort is also necessary to keep inflation under control.
The Government has already taken steps in this direction; income tax procedures
have been simplified and import duties are being more strictly enforced.
These measures as well as some additional ones need to be vigorously pursued.
14.       The medium-term outlook of the Indonesian economy is good.     Over
the last eight years, GNP rose at an average rate of 7.5% a year, and food
production expanded in step. This rate of growth could be maintained in
future if the rate of investment continues to be high and the orientation of
investments is shifted to less capital-intensive forms.    Thus the Government's
efforts in mobilising domestic resources and careful investment planning
would be crucial in maintaining the relatively high rate of economic growth
and creation of employment opportunities. The Government would also need to
pay special attention to the production of rice, and food crops generally, so
that the recent setbacks remain a temporary phenomenon.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
15.       The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for
a development program which provides productive work opportunities (with



- 5 -
resultant increased incomes) for Indonesia's presently underemployed and
growing labor force. Major efforts are needed to increase labor-intensive
employment and programs directed towards improving the incomes of the poor and
their living standards. To assist the Government in attaining its goals, the
Bank is planning to increase its commitments to Indonesia and in particular to
support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit; rehabilitate and
expand irrigation systems; assist transmigration and other land development
outside Java and Bali for and by smallholders; increase nonagricultural employ-
ment in the rural areas and small towns through the establishment of small-
scale industries, rural credit schemes as well as vocational and nonformal
education programs; develop the electric power system; construct urgently
needed water supply and transport facilities; and expand the national family
planning program.
16.       As of March 31, 1977, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits totaling
$561.8 million and 23 Bank loans amounting to $1,155.5 million. At that date,
IFC investments totaled $59.7 million. The share of the Bank Group in
Indonesia's total external debt (disbursed) outstanding at the end of 1976
was about 6% and the share of debt service was less than 1%. By 1978 these
ratios are expected to increase to around 12% and 5%, respectively. A summary
statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of March 31,
1977, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects are contained in
Annex II.
17.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitation,
seven Bank loans and IDA credits for the rehabilitation and expansion of the
irrigation systems, two for fisheries, and one each for seeds production, beef
cattle, sugar, smallholder tea, smallholder rubber, agriculture research,
food crop extension services, transmigration and nutrition development. The
Operations and Evaluation Department of the Bank is undertaking a study of
Bank Group lending in the agricultural sector. In the industrial sector, the
Bank has assisted in three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer production
and distribution capacity, three for development finance companies (Government-
owned and private) which play a major role in fostering the growth of indus-
trial enterprises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial estate. Loans and
credits have also been extended to the education (including technical and
agicultural education, textbook production, vocational and civil service
training), telecommunications, tourism, power generation and distribution,
transportation (including highways, inter-island shipping, railroads and
ports), population, urban and water supply sectors. Also a loan was extended
for a national resource survey and mapping project and four credits for
technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and formulating its
development programs and projects.
18.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation; lending on Bank terms began in June 1974. Dis-
bursements on loans and credits are now at satisfactory levels. The
Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the cost to the
country of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome procedures
and of the need to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS (the
National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request, the Bank
arranged in 1974 for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance Credit



- 6 -
(Credit 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system. It is hoped
that the system which is due to commence operation shortly will lead to
better project administration.
19.      Nine Loans have been made to Indonesia this fiscal year prior to the
proposed loan, and the proposed loan would bring this fiscal year's total
lending to $415.5 million. Projects for nucleus estates and smallholder
development, population, small enterprise credit, rural credit and non-formal
education are expected to be ready for presentation in the next several months.
Progress Under Previous DFC Projects
20.       Prior to the proposed loan the Bank has financed five DFC projects
in Indonesia. BAPINDO has been the beneficiary of a credit of $10 million
(Cr. 310-IND) in 1972 and a loan of $50 million (Ln. 1054-IND) in 1974 and
the Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI) of a credit of
$10 million (Cr. 436-IND) and a loan of $15 million (Ln. 1363-IND) in 1974 and
1977, respectively. All these credits and loans were made for financing indus-
trial subprojects. BAPINDO is also executing an inter-island fleet rehabilita-
tion project financed under a separate credit of $8.5 million (Cr. 318-IND)
which was made in 1972. Credits 310-IND and 436-IND have been fully committed
and as of April 30, 1977, the uncommitted balance of Cr. 318-IND and Ln. 1054-IND
was about $1.3 million and $8.4 million respectively. The latter balance is
expected to be committed by the end of the second quarter of 1977. Loan
1363-IND was approved on January 25, 1977, and became effective on April
21, 1977.
21.       Both BAPINDO and PDFCI have contributed to the sound development of
industry in Indonesia and considerably strengthened their own institutions.
Further improvements are, however, necessary and are expected to materialize
gradually in the next few years as the operational experience of these compan-
ies grows. Particularly, BAPINDO requires to improve its arrears situation,
to speed up its appraisal work and to control its administrative costs. A
program of Action has been formulated and agreed with the Bank, which should
help BAPINDO cope with these problems (see paras. 40 and 41).
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRIAL FINANCE
The Role of Industry
22.       In Indonesia, heavy reliance is being placed on industrial expansion
to achieve income and employment growth targets. In view of the necessity
for the industrial sector to provide substantially increased employment
opportunities, the Government is attempting to encourage the development of
small- and medium-scale industries using labor-intensive methods of production.
23.       Indonesia's manufacturing sector contributes only about 11% to
total GNP. Value added in manufacturing grew at the rate of about 9% p.a.
from 1968 to 1975, as against about 7.5% for the economy as a whole. During
1974 and 1975, the growth of the industrial sector was adversely affected by



- 7 -
international developments, slowing down in terms of output to 7% in 1975.
In 1976, however, the industrial sector has shown signs of recovery and is
estimated to have grown by 14% during the year.
24.       Although in recent years a number of new types of industrial
enterprises have been established, such as industrial chemicals, steel products
and motor vehicle and radio and television set assembly; their direct contrib-
ution to employment creation is still small. Small-scale enterprises /1
represent an overwhelming majority (97%) of the number of industrial firms;
in 1972, they accounted for 64% of industrial employment even though they
were responsible for only 17% of value added in manufacturing. Within the
group of larger establishments, firms with less than 100 employees accounted
for 90% of the number of such establishments, employed around 32% of the
labor force and contributed 18% of value added in manufacturing. Geographic-
ally, manufacturing activity is concentrated in Java, particularly in the
Jakarta area.
25.       The Government's industrial investment policies are partly reflected
in the incentives it provides under the Domestic and Foreign Capital Invest-
ment Laws which are administered by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB).
These incentives usually apply equally to domestic and foreign companies but
are not automatically granted as a package. The main elements of the incent-
ive system include initial tax holidays, reduction or exemption from import
levies and accelerated depreciation allowances. The Government also influen-
ces the course of industrial development through the tariff system, direct
import controls and, to a lesser extent, its interest rate policy.
The Financial Sector
26.       In terms of structure, diversity of institutions, financial services
offered and the variety of financial instruments available for mobilizing
savings, the financial system in Indonesia is still in its early stages of
development. Indonesia's financial sector consists of Bank Indonesia, 5
large state commercial banks, 4 national development banks (the Government-
owned Development Bank (BAPINDO), the Private Development Finance Company of
Indonesia (PDFCI), the Indonesian Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) and
P.T. Bahana) 26 regional development banks (RDBs), 11 branches of foreign
banks, 97 small private domestic commercial banks, and about 5,000 savings
and small village and rural banks. There are also 11 merchant banks and a
dormant stock exchange. Overall, the financial system remains principally
geared to serving short-term financing needs.
27.       Over the last few years, the Government has attempted to strengthen
the financial sector. BAPINDO was reorganized with Bank Group assistance,
with a view to making it the predominant institutional source of medium- and
long-term finance for both public and private industry. It is the only state
/1 Defined by the Government As those employing ten workers or less without
power equipment, or five or less with power equipment.



- 8 -
bank allowed to grant term loans with maturities of over five years. A pro-
gram to upgrade the five state commercial banks was initiated and is still
underway. In 1972 IDFC was reorganized as a joint venture between the
Government (through Bank Indonesia) and the Netherlands Overseas Finance
Corporation, in which the Dutch Government has a majority interest. IDFC
specializes in assisting small industries and extends term loans, participates
in equity financing and provides a limited amount of technical assistance to
its clients. In 1973, again with Bank Group assistance, the Government was
instrumental in establishing a third, largely privately-owned development
bank (PDFCI), which is empowered to make medium- and long-term loans, invest
in equity and provide technical and managerial consultancy services. The
same year (1973) a specialized institution, P.T. Bahana, was set up to
provide equity financing and managerial assistance to financially weak enter-
prises. Since 1973 when a law was passed governing the establishment and
operations of nonbank financial intermediaries, 11 merchant banks have
been set up as joint ventures between foreign and local banks. Finally, to
help meet the need for term financing and assist in small-scale industrial
development, the Government has instituted two investment credit schemes, the
Medium-Term Investment Credit (INVESTASI) and the Small Investment Credit
program, administered by Bank Indonesia and handled by the state banks
including BAPINDO. Both types of credits have a maximum term of five years.
28.       The main source of medium-term credit (up to five years) is the
INVESTASI program which was introduced by the Government in 1969. Under
this program, term loans are available for almost all sectors from state
banks and RDBs, with Bank Indonesia refinancing 65-80% of the disbursed loan
amounts. Loans under the program bear an interest rate ranging from 12-15%
per annum depending on the size of the loan and carry maturities of between
one and five years.
29.       The Small Investment Credit Program consists of two credit schemes,
the Kredit Investasi Kecil (KIK) for financing fixed investment and the
Kredit Modal Kerja Penanaman (KMKP) for working capital financing. Both
schemes are handled by state banks and selected regional development banks,
with Bank Indonesia refinancing 70-80% of the disbursed loan amounts. All
productive activities in industry, agriculture, trade and services are
eligible for KIK and KMKP financing. A limit is placed on the amount of
individual loans which may be approved for any single project. It is presently
Rp 5 million ($12,000 equivalent) each under KIK and KMKP. Maturities range
from one to five years including a grace period of up to two years, with
interest rates of 12% for KIK and 15% for KMKP loans.    World Bank support
for these credit schemes has been requested by the Government, and a project
has been appraised.
Interest Rates
30.       Interest rates applied by state banks are set by Bank Indonesia,
while private banks are free to set their own rates. Deposit rates were
reduced in December 1974 and January 1977 and at present, range from 3% per
annum for 1 month time deposits with state banks, and for demand deposits
with private banks, to 18% for time deposits up to 24 months. Lending
rates applied by state banks range from 12% for INVESTASI loans below
Rp 100 million and for special short-term agricultural credits, to 24% for



- 9 -
other short-term loans. The standard lending rate for term loans above
Rp 100 million is 15% per annum. The Government is aware of the anomalies in
the structure of the interest rates and is giving active consideration to
further steps for reducing and ultimately eliminating these anomalies. These
issues are being discussed between the Government and the Bank.
31.       The Government did not raise term lending rates during the recent
period of very high inflation since it feared that this would hurt the
smaller and financially weaker enterprises (mainly indigenous) which are
unable to obtain offshore loans on their own, while larger and stronger
companies (usually nonindigenous joint ventures) could borrow from financial
markets abroad, i.e. Singapore and Hong Kong, at rates which are at present
about 10-11% (with the foreign exchange risk borne by the borrower).
32.       The rate of inflation was 40% in 1974 but declined to 19% in 1975
and 15% in 1976. As a result of curbs on the expansion of money supply and
other policies to combat inflation, the Government expects to reduce the rate
of inflation further to an average of about 10% over the 1977-80 period. If
their efforts are successful the 15% standard rate being charged by BAPINDO
for medium- and long-term credits would represent a positive real rate of at
least 5%.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
33.       The project was appraised in October 1976 and negotiations were
held in Washington on April 20-26, 1977; the Government was represented by
Mr. Julianto Moeliodiarjo, Director General of Monetary Affairs, Ministry of
Finance, and BAPINDO by its President Director, Mr. Kuntoadji. The appraisal
report dated May 9, 1977 is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors.
Past Reorganization and Progress
34.       BAPINDO was established in 1960 as a State-owned financial inter-
mediary. The Bank's association with BAPINDO started in 1969 when a Bank
mission, at the Government's request, undertook a preliminary examination of
BAPINDO. Strengthening of BAPINDO's organization and management has been a
key objective of the Bank's involvement with BAPINDO from the outset. The
Government requested the Bank's help not merely in assisting BAPINDO finan-
cially but in reorganizing and upgrading the institution with a view to
enabling it to perform its intended role as the principal financial inter-
mediary in the industrial sector. In June 1970, the Government and the Bank
agreed on a plan to reorganize BAPINDO. Through the implementation of this
plan, BAPINDO has achieved considerable institutional improvements.
It has focused its activity on development financing by gradually shedding
its commercial banking operations. In consultation with the Bank, it has
adopted a policy statement providing appropriate financial and operational
guidelines for its activities.     It has reduced its surplus staff and



- 10 -
excessive network of branch offices, strengthened its management, established
internal operating procedures and, to a large extent, rationalized and
streamlined its organization to develop the basic operational capability of a
development bank. With the assistance of foreign advisors financed by UNDP,
bilateral aid and the Bank, it has built up a nucleus of trained staff
including an adequate capability for project appraisal and follow-up work.
35.       These improvements in internal organization and operational capa-
bility have enabled BAPINDO to considerably expand its term-lending operations
which rose by 52% (to Rp 25.9 billion) in 1974, by 64% (to Rp 42.4 billion)
in 1975, and by another 17% (to Rp 49.4 billion) in 1976. Since 1973, BAPINDO
has also initiated a program for co-financing small business enterprises with
14 of the 26 regional development banks (RDBs) operating in the country. As
of December 31, 1976, under this program, BAPINDO had financed jointly with
the participating RDBs an amount of Rp 8.8 billion for over 3,600 projects,
or an average of Rp 2.4 million ($5,000 equivalent) per loan. BAPINDO's
growing importance as a source of industrial finance is reflected in the
steady increase from 18.1% at end-1973 to 31.3% at end-1975 of BAPINDO's
share of total outstanding credits to the manufacturing sector under the
INVESTASI program. In 1975, BAPINDO's financing was equal to about 15% of
industrial investment in the country approved by the Investment Coordinating
Board and BAPINDO's disbursements for term loans in 1975, Rp 20 million,
accounted for 5.7% of the country's total industrial investment.
36.       In parallel with its administrative reorganization, BAPINDO's
financial position has been considerably strengthened, through large increases
in its share capital (Rp 3:3.4 billion in 1974-75-76) and more adequate
provisions for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO's total
assets stood at Rp 124.9 billion, with a long-term debt/equity ratio of 0.8:1
(as against a contractual limit of 3.0:1), and a current ratio at 1.3:1. Its
accounts have been audited by qualified independent accountants, whose
reports from 1973 onward were without qualification.
Remaining Institutional Problems
37.       In spite of the past progress outlined in the preceding paragraphs,
BAPINDO still faces some major problems, the most serious of which is the
continuing unsatisfactory situation of portfolio arrears. As of December 31,
1976, 69 out of 168 term loans (or 42% by number) were in arrears, with total
arrears (principal and interest) amounting to Rp 5.9 billion or 8.8% of the
term portfolio outstanding, arrears of principal amounting to Rp 3.1 billion
or 7.8% of term loans in the repayment stage, and term loans affected by
arrears accounting for one third (by amount) of the term loan portfolio
outstanding. The loan collection rate (i.e. amounts actually collected as a
percentage of amounts due) was only 54.3% in 1976. Further, write-offs for
bad debts totalling Rp 7.0 billion had to be made in the four-year period
1973 to 1976, equivalent to 10.6% of outstanding term loan portfolio at the
end of 1976. The loan collection ratio and arrears ratios have shown a
slight improving trend since 1973, but more significant improvement is needed.



- 11 -
38.       The factors contributing to the high level of arrears and poor loan
collection performance were inter alia: (a) existing regulations favor
borrowers vis-a-vis lenders; (b) more than half of BAPINDO's arrears relate
to loans BAPINDO had made prior to its reorganization in 1971 when no project
appraisal and follow-up was undertaken; (c) restrictive credit ceilings
imposed by the Government since 1974 which compounded the liquidity problems
of companies; (d) BAPINDO's low penalty rate (9%) on interest in arrears acts
as an incentive for some delinquent borrowers not to repay; (e) the Government
policy requiring lending only to indigenous companies most of which are
managerially and financially weak; (f) short maturities (less than 5 years)
required under Bank Indonesia regulations and unrealistically short repayment
schedules set by BAPINDO; (g) delays in the completion of subprojects; and
(h) the poor performance of the official loan collection agency (PUPN) which
among other things, awaits the expiry of the final maturity of loans before
it takes action on delinquent accounts transferred to it by BAPINDO. Some of
these factors are beyond BAPINDO's control and require corrective measures by
the Government.
39.       Other problems on which there have been improvements but which
require further efforts from BAPINDO include: (a) the slow pace of appraisal
work and weakness in economic and market analysis of projects; (b) inadequate
developmental work in such areas as project promotion and industrial studies;
and (c) the still generally low level of institutional efficiency, as reflected
in its high administrative cost (3.8% of average total assets in 1976) which
in turn is largely attributable to BAPINDO's surplus staff and its excessive
branch network.
Proposals for Further Improvement - The Program of Action
40.       The Bank reviewed BAPINDO's current problems with the Government
and BAPINDO during both appraisal and negotiations. As a result, a comprehen-
sive Program of Action was agreed upon. This program includes specific
remedial measures to deal with major problems and related matters. The
implementation of this Program is expected to result in appreciable improve-
ments by BAPINDO on a broad front, financially, administratively and from a
developmental standpoint, but particularly in regard to the arrears situation.
41.       In order to deal effectively with BAPINDO's existing problems,
the Government and BAPINDO have agreed to complete the following essential
steps of the Program of Action prior to the effectiveness of the proposed
loan (Section 6.01(c) and (d) of the draft Loan Agreement): (a) to relieve
BAPINDO of all financial liability pertaining to such projects as are financed
by BAPINDO at the Government's behest; (b) to enable all state owned enter-
prises to make payments of principal and interest in respect of arrears which
are overdue to BAPINDO in excess of three months at the date of the Loan
Agreement (accounting for about 20% of the total arrears); (c) to partially
compensate BAPINDO by paying to it an amount of Rp 3.0 billion for BAPINDO's
losses on raw cotton loans (the remaining amount of Rp 4.5 billion, to compen-
sate BAPINDO for its total losses on such loans, will be paid by the Government
not later than March 31, 1978); (d) to undertake a review of the loan collec-
tion procedures of the official loan collection agency (PUPN), furnish to the



- 12 -
Bank the results of this review, and pending implementation of the measures
recommended by the review, issue a ministerial decree requiring PUPN to take
immediate action for the enforcement of foreclosure on delinquent accounts
transferred to PUPN by BAPINDO without waiting until the expiry of the final
maturity of the loans. Furthermore, prior to the effectiveness of the proposed
loan, BAPINDO will submit to the Bank comprehensive plans, satisfactory to the
Bank: (a) to control its administrative costs and (b) to improve the position
of arrears (Section 6.01 (e) of the draft Loan Agreement).
42.       Technical Assistance.   While BAPINDO has benefited from technical
assistance provided by UNDP and through bilateral aid, it still needs assist-
ance from outside experts in overall development banking activity as well as
economic and marketing research. Consequently, an amount of $240,000 is
earmarked under the proposed loan for financing the services of three experts
for 36 man-months: a general DFC advisor, a senior economic advisor and a
marketing expert.
43.       That there remain many problems still to be solved by BAPINDO
reflects the fact that institutional improvement and strengthening is a long
process, especially in cases with as serious problems as BAPINDO faced prior
to reorganization in 1971. Also, in Indonesia, industrial expertise and
business entrepreneurship are still scarce. The agreed Program of Action
lays a reasonable basis for dealing promptly with BAPINDO's most serious and
immediate problems.
Organization and Type of Operations
44.       BAPINDO has a Supervisory Board and a Board of Managing Directors.
The Supervisory Board is composed of the Minister of Finance and the Governor
of Bank Indonesia. Its role is to supervise BAPINDO's affairs and to provide
policy guidance to the Board of Managing Directors. The Board of Managing
Directors is composed of a President and four Managing Directors and is
responsible for BAPINDO's day-to-day management. As of June 30, 1976 BAPINDO
had staff of about 800, about one-half professionals, working in 16 departments
at headquarters, 10 branch offices and 8 representative offices.
45.       BAPINDO's operations include:    capital loans in foreign and domestic
currency, working capital loans in domestic currency and investments in
equity shares. These operations cover activities in manufacturing, land and
maritime transportation and tourism sectors; operations used to include also
short-term financing of raw cotton imports, but BAPINDO stopped this activity
in 1975.
BAPINDO's Prospects and Resource Requirements
46.       BAPINDO expects its term financing to grow at an annual rate of 18%
in the 1977-80 period. On a disbursement basis its share of total investment in
Indonesia is still small (5.7% in 1975) and could easily be expanded as
BAPINDO's operational capacity and resources grow. Also the outlook for indus-
trial investment is expected to continue to improve in the next few years.
With the strengthening of BAPINDO's financial organization and procedures



- 13 -
through the implementation of the Program of Action, BAPINDO should have
adequate operational capacity to achieve the projected volume of operations
provided it obtains the required financial resources. These are estimated to
amount to Rp 214 billion in domestic currency and $360 million in foreign
exchange, for the four-year period 1977-80. In the past, the Government and
Bank Indonesia have been willing to provide BAPINDO with adequate rupiah funds
as needed to sustain its operations. BAPINDO is also considering the issue of
domestic bonds, for which it expects to obtain the same interest rate subsidy
from the Government that is given to other state banks on their time deposits.
In regard to foreign exchange, BAPINDO has since 1972 relied almost exclusively
on the Bank except for a DM 22 million loan from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) of Germany. In the future BAPINDO expects to finance part of its
expanding foreign exchange requirements from sources other than the Bank;
apart from the proposed Bank loan of $40 million, BAPINDO hopes to obtain a
first loan of $30 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the next
year or so. Together with the uncommitted balance of $8.4 million (as of
April 30, 1977) under Loan 1054-IND these resources would cover BAPINDO's
foreign exchange commitments up to about September 1978.
Projected Financial Position
47.       On the basis of its forecast volume of business, BAPINDO's total
assets are expected to increase from Rp 124.9 billion at December 31, 1976 to
Rp 342.3 billion at end-1980 or at an average annual rate of about 15%. The
liquidation of the short-term raw cotton portfolio by March 31, 1978 will
substantially modify the structure of assets; the term portfolio which
accounted for only 62.5% of total assets in 1976 would represent 85.7% of
these assets in 1980, while the share of current assets would correspondingly
decline from 37.6% to 10.2%. BAPINDO is planning to finance a major propor-
tion of the increase in assets through long-term debts which would rise from
Rp 38.5 billion in 1976 to Rp 275.5 billion in 1980. BAPINDO also expects
the Government to make an additional capital contribution of Rp 6.0 billion
before the end of 1977, thereby raising its paid-in-capital to the presently
authorized level of Rp 50 billion. The current ratio is estimated to range
between 1.3:1 and 3.0:1 over the projection period, which would be satisfac-
tory. In view of the continuing unsatisfactory portfolio arrears situation
the present 3.0:1 debt/equity limit would be maintained; this would require
the Government to make addditional cash subscription to BAPINDO's capital
before 1979 in order to enable BAPINDO to incur additional debt.
Projected Financial Results
48.       As a result of higher leverage, BAPINDO's net profit iq expected to
increase from 2.7% of uct worth in 1976 to 3.3% in 1980, which is still
modest. Profit before tax and provisions as a peroentage of average total
assets will increase slightly from 2.2%, to 3.7%.   General and administrative
expenses are projected to decline only marginally from 3.8% of total assets
in 1975 to 3.2% in 1980 which would be still high. Debt service coverage
is expected to decline marginally' from 1.6 in 1975 to 1.4 in 1980. Loan
collection rates for industrial term loans are assumed to grow from 63% in
1977 of amounts due to 90% in 1980. Projected financial position and results
are satisfactory.

Objectives of Proposed Loan
49.       Apart from partly replenishing BAPINDO's foreign exchange resources,
the proposed loan would contribute to the sound development of Indonesian
industry by providing finance on suitable terms and further strengthen
BAPINDO's organization and management and improve its operations, a process
started with the first credit (Credit 310-IND) in 1972. In spite of past
progress achieved by BAPINDO, much remains to be done before it becomes an
efficient and innovative financial intermediary. Within the Indonesian
financial system, BAPINDO is the state bank entrusted with the responsibility
for assisting the industrial sector and no other institution has, or is
likely to have in the foreseeable future, the same overall impact on this
sector. The Government and the Bank agree that a strong BAPINDO is highly
important for the sound development of Indonesian industry, both public and
private. While major improvements will not materialize quickly and expecta-
tions of future progress need to be realistic, there is good reason to
believe that with the Implementation of the Program of Action agreed with the
Bank and other measures presently under consideration by BAPINDO's management,
BAPINDO will make substantial further progress during the period of commitment
of the proposed loan. As the predominant industrial finance institution in
Indonesia, BAPINDO is also by far the most important channel for Bank funds
to the industrial sector. Although further progress is needed, BAPINDO has
an adequate appraisal capability and is a suitable allocator of Bank
funds. By continuing its assistance to BAPINDO, the Bank can play a useful
role in the Indonesian economy.
50.       As in the case of the previous credits and loans for BAPINDO and
PDFCI, the Government has requested that the loan be made to the Government
for relending to BAPINDO. The proceeds of the loan would be made available
by the Government to BAPINDO under a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory
to the Bank. The signing of the subsidiary loan agreement will be a condition
of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement). BAPINDO
would pay interest at the rate of 11% per annum to the Government and would
relend the proceeds at 15% per annum. This would allow BAPINDO a spread of
four percentage points which is adequate. The Government would assume the
foreign exchange risk. The 15% interest rate to be charged by BAPINDO for
local currency loans to medium-size companies appears reasonable in light of
the rate of 10-11% currently paid by the better established companies (mostly
non-indigenous and joint ventures, which include foreign partners) when they
obtain foreign exchange loans from the Singapore and Hong Kong markets.
51.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of imports, 60% of the total expenditures for machinery and
equipment procured in Indonesia, 40% of total expenditures for civil works
and locally procured vehicles and 100% of the costs of experts.
52.        As BAPINDO has recently improved its appraisal work and further
progress is expected in this respect under the proposed Program of Action,
BAPINDO would be able to assume greater responsibility for appraisal. It is
therefore recommended that the free limit of $0.5 million under Loan 1054-IND
be increased to $1.0 million, with an aggregate free limit of $10 million.



- 15 -
The proposed increase in the free limit is also justified because of the
substantial rise in the cost of capital goods in the past two years. Subloans
amounting to about 75% of the proposed loan amount are still expected to
require prior Bank approval, which would be sufficient for the purpose
of effective subproject review and monitoring by the Bank.
53.       As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the proposed loan would have a
flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to the aggregate of
the repayment schedule of BAPINDO's subloans which would have maximum matur-
ities of 15 years including grace periods not exceeding 3 years.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and the
Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and BAPINDO, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and the text of a draft Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
55.       Special conditions of the Project are listed in Section III of Annex
III of this Report. Additional conditions of effectiveness of the Loan
(Section 6.01 of the draft Loan Agreement) include:
i)   making satisfactory arrangements to relieve BAPINDO in respect
of loans made at the Government's behest, payment of arrears by the
state enterprises and partial compensation in respect of raw cotton
losses;
ii)   a review of the operations of the Government collection agency
PUPN including issuance of a ministerial decree enabling PUPN to
take immediate action on delinquent accounts; and
iii)   preparation by BAPINDO of a comprehensive plan to improve its
arrears and to reduce its administrative costs.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
57.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates: US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 194 Second Agricultural Estates: US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is good in the oil palm group which has surpassed
the appraisal report target for new planting by 100%. Progress in the rubber
group has been unsatisfactory with only 50% of the appraisal report target
for new planting achieved. Planting costs are excessive and investment
planning weak. The project has suffered from management deficiencies and
shortage of funds for investment. The Minister of Agriculture has recently
made the necessary changes in management of the rubber group and the Govern-
ment is expected to review its financial policies, particularly with regard
to dividends.
Cr. No. 195 Second Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970; Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1977.
Progress has been delayed first by initial difficulties in equipment
procurement and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction costs.
Project completion will therefore be about 2-1/2 years behind schedule. The
rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and hydraulically
adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is improving with
the availability of operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than
previous levels. The credit is about 96% disbursed and the remaining funds
will finance all outstanding civil works. The estimated project cost has
more than doubled since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in
contract quantities, but the estimated economic rate of return remains satis-
factory because rice prices and yields have been higher than those projected
during appraisal.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 220 Third Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Overall project completion is expected by October 1977, about two
years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties
in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations, heavy
rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently high inflation rates
and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been mainly overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is improving with the availability of operation and maintenance funds sub-
stantially higher than previous levels. The estimated project cost is about
twice the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and yields substantially higher
than those projected at appraisal enable the project to achieve an estimated
economic rate of return of over 20%.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds: US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Construction of the irrigation infrastructure and the seeds proces-
sing plant has been completed satisfactorily. Land development at Sukamandi
will be limited to about 1,600 ha (65% of appraisal estimates) by the Closing
Date to enable the project authorities to consolidate production and other
operations. Significant results for 1976/77 are expected to be: (a) area
under production - 1,800 ha (58% of the appraisal estimate), (b) yields of
rice seed - 3.5 tons per ha (87%), and (c) production of certified seed -
4,900 tons (42%). Due mainly to the delay in the development of irrigation
infrastructure, and partly to overly optimistic assumptions during appraisal,
the targets for per ha yield and certified seed production will not be
achieved by September 1977. Due to cost escalation and implementation
difficulties, only one seed multiplication district, out of the three planned
at appraisal, has been developed. Based on present levels of production the
National Seeds Corporation (NSC) is not commercially viable and will need
continued financial support from the Government. The future of the project
and of NSC depend on Government policy for the further development of the
seed industry.
Cr. No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded appraisal expec-
tations necessitating construction and rehabilitation of three additional
factories. Project completion, estimated for December 1977, can probably be
advanced. Rising costs are creating pressure on available funds and the main
challenge for the two PTPs will be to reduce working capital requirements,
as well as overhead and indirect costs, and improve labor productivity.

Cr. No. 260 Second Highway: US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31.1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overruns have been relatively
small despite sharp price increases due to efforts to reduce construction
quantities, and to cost savings for consulting services. Construction work
is completed; however, postponement of the Closing Date to December 31, 1978
has been agreed to permit payments for the completion of detailed engineering
of the Padang-Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to reconsider
road design standards in relation to those recently developed for the highway
betterment program and to take into account IDA's recommendations regarding
standards for urban portions of the road.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education: US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;'
Closing Date: March 30, 1978.
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of late
appointment of consultant architects and lack of funds to meet cost overruns.
The main causes of delay have been overcome and significant progress is being
made. All civil works are expected to be completed by September 1977. Furni-
ture and equipment are being delivered. The expert services are virtually
completed. Progress of the fellowship program and teacher training is satis-
factory. The Government has made budgetary provisions to meet the cost
overruns. Disbursements have improved. Delayed implementation required
postponement of the Closing Date by 15 months to March 30, 1978.
Cr. No. 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and price
escalation due to unexpected inflation. The bulk of the remaining work will
be accomplished largely witlh Government funds. Completion of the project is
expected by September 1978.   The Government has therefore, requested that the
Closing Date be postponed to December 31, 1978. Feasibility studies
included in the project have been completed and groundwater investigations
are nearing completion.
Cr. No. 300 Population: US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The national family planning program, of which the project is an
integral part, is expanding in terms of the numbers of new acceptors recruited
annually and now covers about 15% of all married women in the reproductive
age group. Implementation of the civil works component is now on schedule;
because of the shift in strategy from static to mobile services, and because
of a large scale Government--financed program to construct and rehabilitate



ANNEX II
Page 7
Maternal and Child Health/Family Planning centers, the Government has
requested a reduction in the number of centers to be constructed under the
project, to which IDA and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(as partners in jointly financing the project) have agreed.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I): US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: August 31, 1977.
Prior to the original Closing Date which was December 31, 1976,
about $700,000 remained undisbursed and the Closing Date has been postponed .to
August 31, 1977 to allow time for BAPINDO to submit documents for reimbursement.
Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation: US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1978.
At the request of the Government the Closing Date has been post-
poned to September 30, 1978 in order to provide for several new projects of
ship rehabilitation. It is expected that the Credit will be fully disbursed
by the new Closing Date but that, due to sharply increased costs, just over
half the tonnage of shipping expected at appraisal will have been rehabili-
tated.
Cr. No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Physical progress of the project which is being executed by PNP X,
a Government-owned estate group, continues to be satisfactory, with plantings
of rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent condition.
Coffee is a promising crop, and cloves planted in 1974 are growing well. A
hybrid coconut seed garden has been established, the first in Indonesia. PNP X
management needs to pay more attention to cost control and financial planning.
Substantial cost increases have taken place largely due to an expansion in the
size of the program compared with appraisal estimates. The Government has
agreed to provide part of the shortfall in project funding and discussions
with the Government are proceeding on a proposed increase in the budgetary
allocation. PNP X is participating in the execution of smallholder develop-
ment under the Transmigration and Rural Development Project (Loan 1318-IND)
and the proposed Nucleus Estates and Smallholders Project.
Cr. No. 334 Second Electricity Distribution: US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND and
334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays due to procure-
ment problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result the project is



ANNEX II
Page 8
two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties have been resolved
and recent progress is encouraging and no further delays are expected. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 355 Beef Cattle Development: US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously delayed project implementation.
Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. The last supervision mission undertook
a thorough project review and its recommendations, which include major changes
in project scope and objectives, are being prepared for consideration by the
Executive Directors.
Cr. No. 358 North Sumatera Smallholder Development: US$5 million Credit of
February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project's goals of oil palm and rubber plantings by smallholder
participants should be completed by the end of 1977 at the present rate of
progress, which is now ahead of schedule. Costs of the project have increased
from $10 million estimated at appraisal to about $26 million by completion
date. However, higher than anticipated output of and prices for rubber and
palm oil and changes in project development techniques have more than compen-
sated the cost increases, and the project's return to the economy is likely
to be higher than anticipated at appraisal. No effective mechanism for the
credit-assisted portion of the project has yet been developed.
Cr. No. 387 Third Education: US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: August 29, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 million
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
school teachers. Distribution of the first 31 million textbooks has been
completed and they are beginning to be used in schools this year. Production
of 49 million textbooks scheduled for 1976 is well under way. Book delivery
has been improved and teaching equipment has been procured and delivered.
Teacher training continues to proceed on schedule. Project management has
been strengthened by addition of Indonesian staff to a reorganized project
unit, and by recruitment of specialists under a technical assistance contract
signed with UNESCO.
Cr. No. 388 Third Highway: US$14 Million Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date: June 25, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections included

and extra amounts of unforeseen work. The project is 50% complete and the
Closing Date will probably have to be postponed by one year. Project costs
are likely to exceed original estimates by 80% mainly due to sharply escalated
prices. As a consequence, the disbursement rate for construction is now in
the process of being lowered. The training program has been successfully
completed. Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for the road bet-
terment program are nearing satisfactory completion.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 MW units at Muara Karang were
about 65% higher than estimated at the time of appraisal. This, together
with construction cost increases, has resulted in an increase in the total
project cost of more than 100%. Government will provide the additional funds
required. PLN has satisfactorily met the initial targets in its financial
recovery plan provided for under the terms of the Credit Agreement.
Cr. No. 400 Smallholder and Private Estate Tea: US$7.8 million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Fewer than anticipated credit applications have necessitated scaling
down project targets from 10,000 ha to about 6,000 ha for smallholder tea and
from 3,500 ha to 2,300 ha for estates tea. The demand by farmers for technical
assistance has been encouraging.   Over 3,000 farmers have been instructed in
tea cultivation at village level courses and at the Project Management Unit
(PMU) training center.   The project spin-off has been excellent; about 2,000 ha
of tea were replanted or rehabilitated using funds outside the credit program
but still under the influence of the PMU.    A marketing study indicates that
tea consumption in Indonesia increases by 5% yearly and all of the tea produced
by the project will be consumed domestically. Tea prices at farm level are
well above appraisal estimates which is part of the reason why farmers have
been reluctant to apply for long-term credit.
Cr. No. 405 Sugar Industry Rehabilitation: US$50 Million Credit of
June 26, 1973; Effective Date: April 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The scope of the project has been reduced by the deletion of six
minor rehabilitations from the project description due to cost overruns.
The revised project consists of the major rehabilitation of two factories
and the construction of a new factory together with associated agricultural
development, sugar research and technical assistance components. Due to
late project start-up and delays in arranging consultancy services, project
completion will be delayed by one year. Factory construction and rehabili-
tation is progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 428 Pulo Gadung Industrial Estate: US$16.5 Million Credit
of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is developing satisfactorily. Of 430 ha earmarked for
the project, about 270 ha had been acquired by September 1976, and 128 ha had
been developed for occupation. Seventy-four factories are located on the
estate of which 37 are operating and 37 are in various stages of construction
or commission. Factory employment is 16,275 and an estimated 1,400 are
employed on average in both factory construction and land development.
Overall, operations are profitable.
Cr. No. 436 Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI): US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date: March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorily. The Credit is
almost fully committed.
Cr. No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: February 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial difficulties.
The evaluations of project tenders have been approved by IDA. Infrastructure
construction started in July 1976 and completion is scheduled for October
1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the Bali Tourism Development
Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Preliminary discussions with three
potential hotel investors are underway. Promotional efforts to attract addi-
tional investors and tourists have been intensified, and additional flights
from Sydney and Hong Kong to Bali have been approved by the Minister of
Communications and Tourism.
Cr. No. 480 Fisheries Credit: US$6.5 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: January 8, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After some initial delays, the project as a whole has generally been
progressing satisfactorily. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon is



ANNEX II
Page 11
nearing completion. Boat construction is underway and the contract for equip-
ment has been awarded. The quality of lending for fishpond development needs
to be improved although lending for this component in terms of the number of
subborrowers and area covered had met targets envisaged during appraisal.
Bidding for ice plant construction should start soon. The justification for
the trawler subproject is being reviewed by the Government.
Cr. No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Initial organizational difficulties and a delay in awarding the
first construction contract caused a delay of about 18 months in the project
schedule. The first construction contract was awarded in February 1977, the
next four are scheduled for November 1977, and the last two for May 1978.
From a revision of bid prices for the first contract, the total cost of civil
works is now estimated to be about 40% higher than at the time of the last
review of project progress. The total project cost has increased about 130%
since appraisal in May 1974.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been slow due to
poor organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now improved. The
bulk of the contracts have been signed. Passenger traffic in 1975 was
slightly lower than in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic
has continued to decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive
power. Efforts are being made to strengthen the effectiveness of the technical
assistance program and to more closely monitor project developments. Although
tariffs were raised in May 1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25%
and freight revenues by about 10%, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate
further, as operating costs have continued to rise at an even faster rate.
Loan No. 1040 Jakarta Urban Development: US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The kampung improvement part of the project is substantially
complete. Some 2,080 ha have been upgraded as compared with the original
plan of 1,980 ha. The sites and services component is about 15 months behind
schedule.  This is primarily due to land acquisition problems encountered in
the early stages of the project. Project costs are expected to be about 7%
above the appraisal estimate. The allocation of plots and core houses is
expected to begin in July. Some problems have arisen with regard to the
procedures to be utilized in allocating the plots, and these are being
reviewed currently by the Government.

Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$14.5 Million Loan of
October 31, 1974; Effective Date: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Due to administrative and managerial problems the project is
running 13-18 months behind schedule. This delay together with higher rates
of inflation than anticipated is expected to increase project costs 25-30%
above the appraisal estimate. Detailed engineering and preparation of tender
documents have been completed and the project has reached its construction
phase. The reorganization of the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering and the
establishment and development of local water enterprises are proceeding
satisfactorily.
Loan No. 1054 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO II): US$50 Million
Loan of November 20, 1974; Effective Date: January 14,
1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan is expected to be fully committed in the second quarter of
1977. Despite significant institutional improvements achieved by BAPINDO,
the company has still a high level of arrears; its appraisal work is slow and
administrative costs are excessive. These problems are being addressed
through a Program of Action discussed and agreed between the Government,
BAPINDO and the Bank.
Loan No. 1089 Second Fertilizer Expansion: US$115 Million Loan of
February 28, 1975; Effective Date: April 29, 1975;
Closing Date: August 31, 1978.
The Project (PUSRI III) was mechanically completed in December 1976,
one montlh ahead of schedule. As there was a slight delay in the completion
of the related gas project, the gas requirement of PUSRI III for start-up
during November 15, 1976 - January 7, 1977 was met by advancing the scheduled
shutdown of PUSRI II for annual maintenance by two months.   Meanwhile, the
PUSRI III gas system has been completed. Total cost of PUSRI III is expected
to be within the appraisal estimate.
Loan No. 1100 Sixth Irrigation: US$65 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: June 20, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982.
Most of the project programs have advanced well during the first
year of operation. Design of works for the Cirebon and Rentang subproject
systems are beyond the capability of PROSIDA to execute, and assistance will
be provided in Irrigation VIII to expedite this work. Critical review of the
program for benefit monitoring is underway.

Loan No. 1127 Fourth Power: US$41 Million Loan of June 17, 1975;
Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980.
The project provides for the expansion of the Muara Karang thermal
power station at Jakarta by addition of a third 100 MW generating unit. The
general construction contracts covering this unit as well as the first two
financed under Credit 399-IND have been awarded. The project is on schedule
and expected to be completed in early 1980.
Loan No. 1139 Fertilizer Distribution: US$68 Million Loan of
July 10, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All the contracts for the original project have been let and most
materials and three ships have been delivered to Indonesia. Savings of about
$30 million were realized in the original project. Procurement of an
additional ship and bulk reception facilities to serve expansion of fertilizer
output beyond that anticipated at appraisal was approved by the Executive
Directors on April 5, 1977. The expanded project is underway and is likely
to be completed successfully by the revised Closing Date, postponed by one
year.
Loan No. 1179 Agricultural Research and Extension: US$21.5 Million Loan
of December 19, 1975; Effective Date: February 23, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
Project implementation is one year behind schedule due to problems
in the appointment of executive architects for detailed design and supervision
of construction of the research centers and of the consultant firm which will
provide research and extension specialists. However, the pace of implementa-
tion has recently improved; the contract for research and extension services
was signed in February 1977 and negotiations with the architects are in
progress.
Loan No. 1197 National Resource Survey and Mapping Project: US$13.0
Million Loan of February 5, 1976; Effective Date: April 2,
1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project agency, BAKOSURTANAL, has made considerable progress
since the Loan was signed. Several senior staff required for administration
and project procurement have been appointed and preliminary designs for
project facilities have been completed. Preparation of equipment specifica-
tions and planning of aerial photography operations to support detailed
resource surveys of the southern Sumatera region are also proceeding.

Loan No. 1236 Fourth Highway Project: US$130 Million Loan of April 15, 1976;
Effective Date: August 13, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Contracts have been signed or awarded for the construction of the
first package of roads totalling 585 km and for nine consultancy assignments.
Progress is about six to nine months behind the initial project implementa-
tion schedule, mainly due to the unforeseen bunching of many activities
(negotiations for the consultancy assignments, prequalification of contrac-
tors, tendering, etc.) and a general shortage of staff to deal with the
rapidly increasing work load.
Loan No. 1237 Fourth Education Project: US$37 Million Loan of April 15,
1976; Effective Date: June 17, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Project implementation units have been established and the team
leaders for technical assistance are in place. Contracts with the consultant
architects have been signed. Site selection and acquisition are generally
satisfactory with some exceptions due to difficult site conditions and higher
site costs. The project is about 10 months behind schedule due to initial
delay in the appointment of consultant architects and signing of agreements
with UN agencies for technical assistance. The problems causing delays are
being followed up with the Government agencies concerned.
Loan No. 1250 Second Shipping Project: US$54 Million Loan of May 20, 1976;
Effective Date: October 8, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The appointment of a number of consultants has been delayed which
could cause a lag in the implementation of the project. The financial
position of the state shipping company (PELNI) is unsatisfactory, which may
result in financial problems for the project entity (PANN). The Government
is aware of this potential problem and is considering steps to deal with it.
The project is being closely followed.
Loan No. 1254   Third Fertilizer Expansion Project:   US$70 Million Loan of
May 20, 1976; Effective Date: August 15, 1976; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
The Project (PUSRI IV), which is designed to have an annual cap-
acity of 570,000 tons of urea, is about four months ahead of schedule,
but the related gas project is experiencing some delay. Efforts are being
made by the Government to accelerate the gas project. According to present
indications, PUSRI IV is likely to be commissioned in mid-October 1977. No
cost overrun is foreseen for this project.
