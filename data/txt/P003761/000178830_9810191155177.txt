APPRAISAL OF BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPINDO)
SUMMARY
i.        BAPINDO was established in 1960 as a state-owned financial interme-
diary to succeed Bank Industri Negara, which had been in existence since 1951.
The Bank's association with BAPINDO started in 1969, when a Bank mission, at
the Government's request, undertook a preliminary examination of BAPINDO which
revealed serious institutional weaknesses. In June 1970, the Government and
the Bank agreed on the steps necessary to reorganize BAPINDO with the objec-
tive of gradually transforming it into an effective development bank intended
to be the main source of term finance for industry. After substantial pro-
gress had been made toward strengthening BAPINDO, IDA made a credit of US$10
million for it in 1972 for industrial financing, and in the same year another
credit of US$8.5 million for financing the rehabilitation of inter-island
shipping. In 1974 a Bank loan of US$50 million followed for industrial
financing. Since 1972, BAPINDO has also benefitted by a technical assistance
program, which still continues although with reduced scope. That program is
executed by the Bank and financed jointly by UNDP, the Bank and bilateral
aid.
ii.       Indonesia's economic prospects remain bright.  Despite recent finan-
cial difficulties arising from the Pertamina crisis, the Government has man-
aged to expand its investment program significantly in the last two years,
and remains committed to the objectives of creating new employment opportuni-
ties and improving living standards. The Second Five-Year Development Plan
(April 1, 1974-March 31, 1979) aims at achieving a long-term annual growth
rate of 7.5% coupled with an annual rate of employment generation of 2.3%.
To this end, increasing reliance is being placed on the continued expansion
of the industrial sector which is expected to grow, in terms of output, at
around 12% per annum over the next several years.
iii.      BAPINDO's record to date, in terms of achieving the essential objec-
tives which both the Government and the Bank sought in connection with the
previous IDA Credit and Bank Loan, is a mixed one. BAPINDO has generally made
good progress in implementing the reorganization program agreed in 1970. It
has adopted a policy statement setting sound financial and operational guide-
lines for its activities; established internal procedures and reorganized its
departments; considerably improved its accounting and bookkeeping and manage-
ment information systems; curtailed its staff surplus and its excessive net-
work of branch offices; strengthened its management; and developed a nucleus
of trained staff, particularly in project appraisal and follow-up. By and
large, BAPINDO has developed its basic operational capability, although
further specific improvements are still needed in some aspects of its
operation.
iv.       The improvements in internal organization and operational capability,
outlined above, have enabled BAPINDO to considerably expand its term-lending
operations in recent years, by 52% (to Rp 25.9 billion) in 1974, 64% (to
Rp 42.4 billion) in 1975, and by another 17% (to Rp 49.4 billion) in 1976,



- ii -
during which year BAPINDO's financing was equivalent to about 15% of approved
domestic industrial investment in the country.  In addition, BAPINDO has
initiated since 1973 a useful program for co-financing small business enter-
prises with regional development banks (RDBs). This program, as of December 31,
1976, involved 14 RDBs (out of a total of 26 operating in the country), with
cumulative approvals by BAPINDO amounting to Rp 8.8 billion for over 3,600
projects or an average loan size of Rp 2.4 million (US$5,000 equivalent).
BAPINDO's growing importance as a source of industrial finance is reflected
in the steady increase from 18.1% at end-1973 to 31.3% at end-1975 of BAPINDO's
share of total outstanding credits to the manufacturing sector under the
INVESTASI program. BAPINDO's disbursements for term loans in 1975, Rp 20
billion, accounted for 5.7% of the country's total industrial investment.
v.        In parallel with the administrative reorganization referred to in
para (iii), BAPINDO's financial position has been considerably strengthened,
through massive increases in its share capital (Rp 33.4 billion in 1974-75-76),
write-offs of uncollectible loans, and more adequate provisions for doubtful
accounts. As of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO's total assets stood at Rp 124.9
billion, with a long-term debt/equity ratio of 0.8:1 (as against a contractual
limit of 3.0:1), and a current ratio at 1.3:1. Its accounts have been audited
by qualified independent accountants, whose reports from 1972 onward were with-
out qualification.
vi.       In spite of the substantial past progress outlined in the preceding
paragraphs BAPINDO still faces some important problems, the most serious of
which is the continuing unsatisfactory situation of portfolio arrears. As of
December 31, 1976, 69 out of 168 term loans (or 42% by number) were in arrears,
with total arrears (principal and interest) amounting to Rp 5.6 billion or 8.8%
of the term portfolio outstanding, arrears of principal amounting to Rp 3.1
billion or 7.8% of term loans in the repayment stage, and term loans affected
by arrears accounting for one-third (by amount) of the term loan portfolio
outstanding. The loan collection rate (i.e. amounts actually collected as
a percentage of amounts due) was 54.3% in 1976. Further, write-offs of bad
debts totalling Rp 7.0 billion had to be made for the four-year period 1973
to 1976, equivalent to 10.6% of outstanding term loan portfolio at the end
of 1976. Nevertheless, the loan collection ratio and main arrears ratios
have shown an improving trend since 1973.
vii.      Other problems still facing BAPINDO include:  (a) the slow pace of
appraisal work and weakness in economic and market analysis of projects;
(b) inadequate developmental contribution by BAPINDO in such areas as project
promotion and industrial studies; and (c) the generally low level of insti-
tutional efficiency, as reflected in its high administrative cost (3.8%
of average total assets in 1976) which in turn is largely attributable to
BAPINDO's surplus staff and its excessive branch network.
viii.     Focusing on BAPINDO's current problems, as highlighted in the two
preceding paragraphs, extensive discussions took place during both appraisal
and negotiations, between the Government, BAPINDO and the Bank. As a result



- iii -
of these discussions, a comprehensive Program of Action was agreed upon,
which sets out specific immediate remedial measures and those for achieving
further progress by BAPINDO. The implementation of this Program, by both
the Government and BAPINDO, is expected to result in gradual but substantial
improvements by BAPINDO on a broad front, financially, administratively and
from a developmental standpoint, but particularly in regard to the arrears
situation. The more essential steps of the Program (contained in its Part A),
relating to BAPINDO's financial situation, are specified as additional con-
ditions to the effectiveness of the proposed loan.
ix.       That there remain many problems to be solved by BAPINDO reflects
the fact that institution-building is a long-term process, especially in the
light of BAPINDO's serious weaknesses prior to its 1971 reorganization and of
the Indonesian context in which industrial expertise and business entrepreneur-
ship are still scarce. While major improvements will not materialize very
quickly and expectations of future progress need to be realistic, the agreed
Program of Action lays a reasonable basis for overcoming BAPINDO's important
current problems.
x.        As can be seen from paragraph (iv) above, BAPINDO is an important,
indeed by far the main, institutional source of term finance for industry.
Further, BAPINDO among the state banks is entrusted with the specific respon-
sibility for assisting the industrial sector. A strong BAPINDO is therefore
highly important for the continued development of Indonesian industry, both
public and private. The Government attaches great priority to BAPINDO and is
intent on strengthening BAPINDO. No other financial intermediary has, or is
likely to have in the foreseeable future, the same impact on Indonesian in-
dustry. By continuing its assistance to BAPINDO in terms of both finance
and guidance, the Bank can play a useful role in the Indonesian economy.
xi.       A Bank loan of US$40 milion is recommended.  Apart from replenishing
BAPINDO's foreign exchange resources, it would enable the Bank to continue
to assist BAPINDO in the on-going institution-building process. The loan is
also justified as a means, not otherwise available, of transferring Bank re-
sources to viable industrial projects in Indonesia. The proposed loan,
supplemented by BAPINDO's prospective borrowing from the Asian Development
Bank, is expected to cover BAPINDO's estimated foreign exchange commitments
for one year or so.
xii.      As with previous IDA credits and Bank loans to financial intermedia-
ries in Indonesia, the proposed loan would be made to the Government for re-
lending to BAPINDO under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank.
The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk. The proceeds of the
loan would finance, in addition to direct imports, an agreed percentage re-
presenting the foreign exchange component of domestically procured capital
goods (60%) and that of locally procured vehicles and civil works (40%). The
spread allowed to BAPITDO on the use of loan proceeds would be four percentage
points. The long-term debt/equity limit would be maintained at 3:1. The free
limit would be raised from US$0.5 million to US$1 million, with an aggregate
of US$10 million. A ceiling of US$3 million would be set on the size of in-
dividual subloans. An amount of US$240,000 under the loan is earmarked for

financing, on a 36 man/months basis, the technical services of a general DFC
advisor, a senior economic advisor and a marketing expert. The other terms
and conditions of the loan would be similar to those of recent Bank loans to
DFCs, including a flexible amortization schedule conforming substantially to
the aggregate of the repayment schedules of subloans.

APPRAISAL OF BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPIND0)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises BAPINDO  and recommends a new Bank loan of
$40 million to it for industrial financing.
1.02      BAPINDO was established in 1960 as a state-owned financial inter-
mediary to succeed Bank Industri Negara, which had been in existence since
1951. The Bank's 1/ association with BAPINDO dates back to 1969, when a Bank
mission, at the Government's request, undertook a preliminary examination of
BAPINDO which revealed serious weaknesses. These included a lack of autonomy
in operational decisions, poor management and staff, inadequate capability
for project appraisal and a chaotic financial condition. In June 1970, the
Government and the Bank agreed on a reorganization program involving an organ-
izational restructuring as well as a financial strengthening of the institu-
tion. After substantial progress had been made toward strengthening BAPINDO,
IDA made a first (DFC-type) Credit (Cr 310-IND) of US$10 million for it for
industrial financing in May 1972. At that time, BAPINDO also became the
beneficiary, as part of its reorganization, of a technical assistance program
executed by the Bank and financed jointly by UNDP, the Bank and the Govern-
ments of Japan and Australia. Subsequently, IDA made a second Credit (US$8.5
million) for financing inter-island shipping projects through BAPINDO in June
1972, which was followed in November 1974 by a DFC-type Bank loan (1054-IND)
of US$50 million for industrial financing.
1.03      It is clear from the foregoing that institution-building was a key
objective in the Bank's initial involvement with BAPINDO. The Government
requested thne Bank's help not merely in assisting BAPINDO financially, hut
in reorganizing and strengthening it with a view to transforming it over
time into an effective development finance institution, intended to be the
main source of term finance for the industrial sector in the country.
1.04      BAPINDO's record to date in terms of achieving the essential ob-
jectives which both the Government and the Bank sought, in connection with
the previous IDA Credit and Bank Loan, is a mixed one. On the one hand,
BAPINDO has made considerable progress in implementing the reorganization
program referred to in paragraph 1.02 above. As of now, BAPINDO has ac-
hieved a basic operational capability (including particularly the capacity
for project appraisal and follow-up), and is a far more effective institu-
tion than it was in 1971. On the other hand, BAPINDO still faces many prob-
lems, including a continuing high level of loan arrears, slowness of appraisal
work, insufficient developmental inputs and a still low level of overall
institutional efficiency. In view of these problems, the proposed loan in-
cludes specific arrangements for further strengthening BAPINDO financially,
Aministratively, and from a developmental standpoint.

II. BAPINDO'S ENVIRONMENT
2.01      The economic, industrial and financial environment in which BAPINDO
operates is analyzed in Annex 1. Some salient features are summarized in the
following paragraphs.
2.02      The Role of Industry.  Indonesia's manufacturing sector contributes
only about 11% to total GNP. Value added in manufacturing grew at the rate
of about 9% p.a. from 1968 to 1975, as against about 7.5% for the economy as
a whole. During 1974 and 1975, the growth of the industrial sector was ad-
versely affected by international developments, slowing down to 7% (in terms
of output) in 1975. In 1976, however, the industrial sector has shown signs
of recovery and is estimated to have grown by 14% during the year. Although
in recent years a number of new types of industries have been established,
such as industrial chemicals, steel products and motor vehicle and radio and
television set assembly, their direct contribution to employment creation has
been small. An overwhelming majority (97%) of industrial enterprises are
small-scale. Geographically, manufacturing is concentrated in Java, parti-
cularly in the Jakarta area.
2.03      Government incentives for industrial development include tax pri-
vileges, import duty exemptions and accelerated depreciation allowances. The
Government also seeks to influence the course of industrial development through
the tariff system, some direct import controls and the interest rate policy.
In view of the failure of the industrial sector over the past decade to sub-
stantially increase employment opportunities, the Government is encouraging
the development of labor-intensive small- and medium-scale industries (paras.
17-19 of Annex 1).
2.04      The Financial Sector.  The Indonesian financial system is still at
an early stage of its development. Over the last few years, the Government
has attempted to strengthen it. With Bank Group assistance, BAPINDO was
reorganized in 1971 with a view to making it the predominant source of term
finance for industry, and the Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia
(PDFCI) was established in 1973 with an equity participation by IFC and has
since obtained an IDA credit and a Bank loan totalling US$25 million. To-
gether with the Indonesian Development Finance Company (IDFC), a quasi-public
intermediary specializing in small industry financing, BAPINDO and PDFCI make
up the core of the Indonesian development banking system. In addition, a
specialized institution, P.T. Bahana, was set up in 1973 to provide equity
financing to indigenous enterprises. Short-term loans to all economic sectors
are extended by the state banks and commercial banks for up to six months with
the possibility of roll-over. The financial sector is dominated by the six
state banks, including BAPINDO. Although there is some overlapping, the Gov-
ernment has allocated to each state bank the responsibility for term financing
of one or more specific economic sectors, with BAPINDO being entrusted with
industry and transport (including shipping). There are 26 regional development
banks (RDBs), located mostly in provincial capitals, that finance small-scale
enterprises. Small business financing is refinanced (up to 80%) by Bank



Indonesia under two investment credit schemes for fixed investment and work-
ing capital respectively (para 16 of Annex 1). BAPINDO presently assists 14
of the 26 RDBs in financing small enterprises under these two schemes, and
also provides them with some technical assistance. A Bank loan specifically
for financing small-scale enterprises has been requested by the Government
and the appraisal report is under preparation. With that loan, the Bank's
assistance would cover the the full spectrum of Indonesian industry-large,
medium and small.
2.05      Interest Rates.  Interest rates applied by state banks including
BAPINDO are set by Bank Indonesia. Because of the importance of the state
banks in the financial system, their rates in turn determine the general
level of interest rates in the economy, though private banks are free to set
their own rates. At present, lending rates applied by state banks (Annex 1,
Appendix 1) range generally from 12% (for term loans below Rp 100 million) to
24% p.a. (for working capital loans), with a standard lending rate of 15% p.a.
for term loans above Rp 100 million. In January 1977, the Government slightly
reduced deposit rates, which now range from 6% to 18% p.a., depending on the
duration, thus narrowing the discrepancy between deposit rates and lending
rates applied by the banking system. This represented an important step in
the right direction. The Government continues to keep the interest rate
structure under review, and the Bank intends to join the Government in dis-
cussing this matter in the near future. The 15% standard lending rate it-
self, which will also be BAPINDO's relending rate under the proposed Bank
loan (para 6.06), is adequate, in relation to (a) projections of future in-
flation in Indonesia (15% in 1977, and around 10% on average over the period
1977-80); and (b) the cost of borrowings from the Singapore and Hong Kong
capital markets, which at present is around 10-11% (with the foreign exchange
risk borne by the borrower).
III. PAST REORGANIZATION AND PROGRESS
Historical Perspective
3.01      BAPINDO's history up to 1970 was a checkered one.  From its incep-
tion in 1960 to 1965 BAPINDO was used as a mere conduit for Government funds
to projects specified by the Government, not necessarily developmental, and it
had no autonomy. Its resources were exhausted by 1965, and its operations
virtually stopped. In 1966, BAPINDO's functions were enlarged to include com-
mercial banking, but its operations continued to be severely constrained by
the shortage of financial resources and by organizational problems. In October
1970, Bank Indonesia instructed BAPINDO to discontinue making term loans to
new clients because of its critical financial position and organizational
problems. Bank Indonesia withdrew that restriction in December 1971.
3.02      The Bank's preliminary examination of BAPINDO in December 1969 re-
vealed that it was inefficient, poorly managed, and in financial difficulties.
It had an unduly large staff of about 1,350 employees. Its network of branch



- 4 -
offices was excessive for its needs. It suffered from poor coordination at
all levels. It did not have the ability adequately to appraise investment
projects for term financing. It did no follow-up work on its portfolio. The
standard of its bookkeeping was inadequate and its accounts had never been
audited by independent accountants; consequently its financial condition and
the quality of its portfolio at the end of 1969 could not be exactly ascer-
tained, although both were evidently poor.
The Reorganization and Subsequent Steps
3.03      On the basis of the Bank's findings summarized in the preceding
paragraph, the Government and the Bank agreed in 1970 that, if BAPINDO
were to effectively perform its potentially important role, namely that of
a major financial intermediary in the industrial sector, it needed a drastic
reconstruction and strengthening. With the Bank's cooperation, a reorganiza-
tion scheme was formulated and has since been implemented by BAPINDO. That
scheme involved, inter alia, the following main elements:
(a) BAPINDO was to focus on development financing and to
become a specialized institution providing term finance
to industry. To that end it was, as soon as possible,
to give up its commercial banking operations, except
on behalf of its term loan clients;
(b) BAPINDO was to adopt a comprehensive "Policy Statement"
(Annex 2, Appendix 2) drafted in consultation with the
Bank, to provide sound financial and operating guide-
lines for its operations;
(c) from an organizational standpoint, the following steps
were adopted: (i) the appointment of a new President
and enlargement of the Board of Managing Directors;
(ii) the granting to BAPINDO by the Government of
adequate operational autonomy; (iii) the reduction of
surplus staff and of the branch network; (iv) the
regrouping of existing departments and creation of
new ones where needed, with a view principally to
improving BAPINDO's organization and to building up
an adequate capacity for appraisal and follow-up work;
and (v) a technical assistance program executed by the
Bank and financed jointly by UNDP, the Bank and the
Governments of Australia and Japan; and
(d) from a financial standpoint: (i) massive increases in
BAPINDO's equity capital through both budgetary allo-
cations and conversion into equity of some loans from
the Government and Bank Indonesia; (ii) the write-off of
uncollectible loans then representing some 16% of BAPINDO's
outstanding term-loan portfolio and 14% of its short-term
portfolio; (iii) relieving BAPINDO of all financial



liability with respect to its loans to 19 state enter-
prises; and (iv) the audit of BAPINDO's accounts by
independent qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank.
3.04      Subsequent to the adoption of the above program, BAPINDO's management
has initiated many steps to further improve the institution and to adapt its
organization to changing operational requirements. These steps include, inter
alia: (i) the creation of a new department equipped with the requisite staff
and expertise to handle maritime lending operations; (ii) the use of outside
consultants to undertake various organizational studies; (iii) the introduction
in late 1974 of a new system for internal control and accounting (partly com-
puterized) designed by outside consultants; (iv) the tightening up of project
supervision work through the establishment in 1974 of a separate unit for this
activity and the introduction in 1976 of a comprehensive "Follow-up Manual";
(v) expanding efforts in staff training; and (vi) the introduction in 1973 of
a scheme for co-financing of small business enterprises with selected RDBs.
Institutional Improvements to Date
3.05      BAPINDO's implementation of the reorganization scheme and other
steps referred to in the preceding paragraphs has resulted since 1972 in
substantial improvements of which the most notable are outlined below.
3.06      Administration and Organization.  Annex 2 analyzes some organiza-
tional aspects of BAPINDO. BAPINDO today operates as a development finance
institution with adequate operational autonomy vis-a-vis the Government.
Following its restructuring in February 1975 (para 2 of Annex 2), the Board
of Supervision (in which the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia are
represented) has been providing BAPINDO with active guidance and effective
supervision. The Board of Managing Directors was strengthened by the appoint-
ment of a new President, Mr. Kuntoadji, in January 1971, and two additional
Managing Directors in 1972; BAPINDO's Managing Directors, who were generally
new to development banking when they were appointed, have since gained con-
siderable experience and correspondingly reduced their reliance on the expa-
triate advisors. The technical assistance program, providing BAPINDO with the
services of six expatriate advisors (four for development banking, two for
maritime operations) since 1971-72, has significantly contributed to BAPINDO's
operational progress and staff training. BAPINDO has reduced the size of its
staff by about 40% during 1972-73 to lessen overstaffing. It has curtailed
its branch network, which numbered 20 branches in 1972, by closing 2 and down-
grading 8 to the status of representative offices. BAPINDO's management, in
consultation with its advisors, has since 1971 regrouped BAPINDO's activities
among its departments, and in the process has created a number of new depart-
ments/units, including a Collection Department; a Branch Supervision Department
to coordinate the operations of the branches and to handle BAPINDO's work
relating to the RDBs; a Project Promotion Department to work on new investment
opportunities; a Follow-Up Unit within the Credit Department; and the engineer-
ing staff has been concentrated in a new department instead, as previously,
of being spread throughout BAPINDO. BAPINDO today is a much more effective
organization than it was in 1971.



- 6 -
3.07      On erational Standards and Capability.  BAPINDO, which in 1971 was
not equ'iTped to make adequate appraisals for term lending and follow-up work,
has by ane- Large developed the basic institutional strength of a development
bank, as well as a nucleus of trained and dedicated staff. The standards
of its appraisal, follow-up work and bookkeeping have improved substantially
in recent years. Although the quality of its appraisal work remains uneven
and requires further upgrading (paragraph 4.19), some of its recent appraisal
reports were quite satisfactory.
3.08      Expansion of Operations.  The improvements in internal organization
and operational capability noted in paras 3.06 and 3.07 have enabled BAPINDO
to considerably expand its operations in recent years. BAPINDO's approvals
of term loans (for both the industrial and maritime sectors) increased by 52%
to Rp 25.8 billion in 1974 (from Rp 17.0 billion in 1973), by 64% to Rp 42.4
billion in 1975 and by 17% to Rp 49.4 billion in 1976. It has broadened its
financing activity by starting equity investments in 1974, although these
(Rp 1.8 billion outstanding in 9 companies) are still small in relation to its
total portfolio. On the other hand, in line with its objective of focussing
on term financing (para 3.03(a)), BAPINDO has gradually stopped making short-
term raw cotton loans. In 1973, BAPINDO initiated a program for co-financing
small business enterprises with selected RDBs. This useful program has ex-
panded rapidly and as of December 31, 1976, involved 14 RDBs (out of a total
of 26 operating in the country), with cumulative approvals by BAPINDO amount-
ing to Rp 8.8 billion for over 3,600 projects or an average loan size of
Rp 2.4 million (US$5,000 equivalent). BAPINDO's growing importance as a
source of industrial finance is reflected in the steady increase, from 18.1%
at end-1973 to 31.3% at end-1975, of BAPINDO's share of total outstanding
credits to the manufacturing sector under the INVESTASI program (referred to
in para 14 of Annex 1). BAPINDO's approvals of industrial term loans in 1975
(Rp 27.7 billion) were equivalent to about 15% of the amount of domestic
industrial investment approved by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB)
during that year. BAPINDO's operations from 1972 up to December 31, 1976 are
analyzed in Annex 3. The developmental impact of BAPINDO's lending is dis-
cussed in para 4.22 and in Annex 4.
3.09      Financial Strengthening.  BAPINDO's capital structure has been con-
siderably strengthened in the past three years through additional cash sub-
scriptions by the Government to BAPINDO's paid-in capital of Rp 18.6 billion
in 1974, Rp 4.5 billion in 1975 and Rp 10.3 billion during 1976. Apart from
the continuing unsatisfactory condition of the portfolio (paras 4.14 to 4.19)
BAPINDO's financial position is adequate, with a long-term debt/equity ratio
of 0.8:1 (as against a contractual limit of 3:1) as of December 31, 1976, a
total debt/equity ratio of 1.7:1 and a current ratio of 1.3:1. BAPINDO's
profitability, however, is low, with net profit averaging only about 3% of
average net worth in the three-year period 1973-76 (see paragraph 4.06).
Annex 6 analyzes in more detail BAPINDO's financial position and performance.
3.10      Audit.  On the Bank's recommendation, the Government arranged for
an independent annual audit of BAPINDO's accounts which has been in effect
since 1969. BAPINDO's auditors are the firm of Drs. Utomo, Mulia and Co.
(affiliated with the well-known SGV Group of the Philippines). The auditors



- 7 -
found that for 1969 and 1970, BAPINDO's books and records were inadequately
kept, and they were therefore unable to express an opinion on BAPINDO's
accounts for those two years. The auditors, in the course of their audit
of BAPINDO in 1969-70, made many recommendations for improving BAPINDO's
accounting and procedures, which BAPINDO implemented. From 1971 onwards,
the auditors have been able to certify BAPINDO's accounts and their reports
from 1973 through 1976 were without any qualification.
IV. REMAINING PROBLEMS AND PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVEMENT
4.01      The substantial improvements described in paras 3.05 to 3.10 not-
withstanding, BAPINDO still faces a number of current problems, of which the
most serious are the continuing high level of loan arrears, the slowness
of appraisal work and the generally low level of institutional efficiency.
Furthermore, there is a need for enhancing BAPINDO's developmental contribu-
tion to the Indonesian economy in areas such as promotional work and industry
studies. The Bank has discussed these problems with BAPINDO's management and
Government officials, and an agreement has been reached on specific remedial
measures and on those for achieving further improvements. Those measures,
the more important of which are contained in a Program of Action, (hereafter
Program for short), shown in Annex 5, are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Institutional Aspects
4.02      Staff Size and Allocation.  In spite of the 40% reduction in staff
size in 1972-73 (para 3.06), which occurred mostly at the junior level,
BAPINDO's staff remains, prima facie, too large in relation to the volume of
business transacted. This staff surplus is reflected, among other things, in
some operational ratios (such as the amount and number of loan approvals per
professional staff member) which are high compared with other DFCs associated
with the Bank (para 5 of Annex 2), and in BAPINDO's high administrative cost
(para 4.05). The Bank did not suggest that BAPINDO should dismiss a part of
its surplus staff, in view of the undesirable social consequences that such a
step would entail. In the light of the surplus, however, the Bank suggested
and BAPINDO intends to: (a) gradually reduce staff surplus by attrition over
the coming years (para. A-6 of Program); (b) limit recruitment of additional
staff to categories of specialists in which BAPINDO is under-staffed, such as
project appraisal officers, trained economists and engineers; and (c) intensify
and systematize staff training in order to upgrade staff quality and to make
more productive use of staff time.
4.03      There is staff misallocation, reflected in staff shortage in some
critical operational units, particularly the appraisal and follow-up teams,
on the one hand, and staff surplus in other units, especially some branch
offices on the other hand. To correct this situation, BAPINDO intends to:
(a) convert a number of support staff into operational (i.e. appraisal and
supervision) staff (para. B-3 of Program); and (b) more generally to undertake



- 8 -
a comprehensive review of its present staff deployment with a view to effect-
ing appropriate staff transfers between units so as to achieve more efficient
staff allocation.
4.04      Branch Network.  In spite of a reduction in 1972 (para 3.06),
BAPINDO's existing branch network requires further review. Some branch
offices do not appear necessary from the standpoint of the business at hand.
Staff size in some branch offices is excessive in relation to the actual or
propsective workload. There are both an unclear demarcation of functions
and an unnecessary duplication of work (particularly in project appraisal
and follow-up) between headquarters and the branch offices.
4.05      In the light of the situation described in the preceding paragraph,
BAPINDO intends (para B-2 of Program) to carry out a comprehensive study of
the existing branch network with a view to: (a) judging the appropriateness of
location, in order to close a branch office where it is not needed or to
open new ones where there is good potential for business development; (b)
adjusting staff size in each branch to the volume of work; and (c) rational-
izing and specifying more clearly the functions of each branch. In connec-
tion with (c) above, BAPINDO also intends to: (i) centralize appraisal
work for term loans at headquarters, at least until adequate appraisal
ability has been built up in the branch offices; (ii) entrust the branches
with greater responsibility for project supervision work; and (iii) delegate
more authority to managers of selected branch offices to approve working
capital loans up to a specified amount.
4.06      High Administrative Cost and Low Profitability.  BAPINDO's profit-
ability is low. Its net profit averaged 2.7% of net worth in the 1973-76
period. (The same ratio for the ten other DFCs in East Asia for which com-
parable data are available ranged from 4% to 20% in 1975). This low profit-
ability is attributable 1/ mainly to: (a) BAPINDO's high administrative
expenses, 3.8% of total assets for both 1975 and 1976; and (b) the magnitude
of provisions for doubtful accounts, which represented about 3.2% of total
assets in the same period 1973/76. The high level of BAPINDO's administrative
cost (the ratio for comparable DFCs in East Asia ranges generally from 1% to
2%), is largely attributable to the large staff size referred to in para. 4.02,
and the extensive branch network noted in para 4.04. Although profitability
per se is not an essential objective for a public development institution
such as BAPINDO, it is nevertheless important for BAPINDO to try to achieve
greater operational efficiency, by exerting a tighter control over its ex-
penditures and gradually reducing the ratio of its administrative cost to total
assets. BAPINDO intends to achieve this objective (para A-5 of the Program),
inter alia, by reducing its staff surplus by attrition over the coming years
and by closing down unnecessary branch offices. 2/
1/   Apart from BAPINDO's low leverage, as reflected in a debt/equity
ratio of only 0.7:1 (para 3.09).
2/   This step was specified as a condition of effectiveness to the
proposed loan (para 7.03 (d)).



- 9 -
4.07      Financial Liability in State Enterprises.  As noted in para 3.03 (d)
(iii) above, the Government in 1970, at the Bank's recommendation, relieved
BAPINDO of the financial liability pertaining to loans to 19 state enterprises
(all of whom were then in some financial difficulty), with the objective of
strengthening BAPINDO's financial position. Since then, however, BAPINDO
has financed other state enterprises. BAPINDO's loans to these state enter-
prices can be broadly classified in two categories, namely: (a) those made
by BAPINDO on its own initiative on the basis of normal project evaluation
and its usual lending criteria as set out in its Policy Statement; and (b)
those made by BAPINDO at the Government's behest and without a genuine and
independent appraisal.
4.08      There is nothing inappropriate for the Government to direct
BAPINDO, as a state bank, to make "behest loans" to some Government projects
deemed by the Government to be of national importance. For these loans, the
Government usually, though not always, provides BAPINDO with part or all of
the funds required. Furthermore, the absence of appraisal by BAPINDO can be
explained by the fact that the technical Government department (for instance,
Ministry of Industry or Ministry of Telecommunications) sponsoring the project
has itself usually ascertained the feasibility and/or viability of the project.
However, it is inappropriate for BAPINDO to assume (as it does) the financial
liability for these "behest loans", since BAPINDO's role in practice is limited
to that of "administrator" of Government funds. The concept of "administra-
tion" should be applied, whereby BAPINDO should be relieved of all financial
liability for these loans, which should be segregated from BAPINDO 's own port-
folio. The financial liability should be borne by the Government, and BAPINDO
should receive a handling fee. During negotiations, the Government and BAPINDO
agreed (para A-1 of Program), as a condition of loan effectiveness, that the
administration concept as described above will be applied to: (a) all five
existing "behest loans" totalling about Rp 11.6 billion (US$28 million) on
BAPINDO's books; and (b) all future loans to state enterprises to be made by
BAPINDO at the Government's behest.
4.09      Conversely, BAPINDO will continue to assume full liability for its
loans to and investments in those state enterprises which it finances on its
own initiative on the basis of normal project evaluation and its usual lending
criteria.
4.10      Appraisal Work.  It should be noted that BAPINDO began only in 1971
to build up its capability for project appraisal. Despite considerable improve-
ments since 1971 in appraisal work as evidenced by the satisfactory quality of
some recent appraisal reports, there is still a need for further upgrading the
standards and accelerating the speed of BAPINDO's appraisal work. One serious
weakness of BAPINDO's appraisal work is its slowness. A sample examination
indicates that an average of 360 days (140 at the branch offices and 220 at
headquarters) was required for loan processing from receipt of loan applica-
tion to approval. At this pace, project appraisal can be a hindrance to,
rather than an effective tool for, decision-making. Even allowing for rea-
sons beyond BAPINDO's control (e.g. poor project formulation by clients, lack
of adequate country statistical data, complexity of investment laws and regu-
lat :>ns in the country), this slowness is excessive and should be corrected.



- 10 -
Other weaknesses are in economic evaluation and market analysis. Partial
economic indicators of projects (such as employment created, value added,
foreign exchange earnings/savings) are usually not systematically analyzed
in BAPINDO's appraisal reports, and BAPINDO introduced only recently the
calculation of rates of return in its appraisal work. Furthermore, the qua-
lity of individual appraisal reports is sometimes uneven, which indicates the
need for closer quality control at the senior level.
4.11      To speed up, and raise the standards of, appraisal work, BAPINDO
intends to: (a) adopt an indicative "work flow chart" prescribing a time
limit for each stage of loan processing, in order to complete the full pro-
cessing cycle for an ordinary project within 150 days (para B-7 of Program);
(b) expand considerably the number of its appraisal staff (para B-3 of Program);
(c) concentrate term loan appraisal work at headquarters to avoid unnecessary
overlapping with the branches, at least until adequate appraisal capability
has been built up in some branches; (d) make more systematic use of partial
economic indicators (e.g. employment, value added, export earnings and/or
import savings); (e) introduce a mechanism for comparing the actual economic/
financial costs and benefits of projects in the operating stage with estimates
made during project appraisal; (f) undertake the calculation of economic
rates of return for all projects requiring BAPINDO's financing for $1 million
equivalent or more (para B-8 of Program); and (g) create a suitably staffed
Market Analysis Unit within BAPINDO's Research Department (para B-6 of Program).
4.12      Operating Policies.  One unsatisfactory feature of BAPINDO's recent
financing has been the trend toward larger and fewer industrial loans. While
the amount of approvals for industrial loans went up from Rp 13.4 billion in
1973 to Rp 23.5 billion in 1974 and Rp 27.7 billion in 1975, the number of
these loans declined steadily from 133 in 1973 to 85 in 1974 and to 80 in
1975. The number of investment (i.e. equipment, as opposed to working capi-
tal) loans in particular declined from 73 in 1973 to 49 in 1974 to 37 in 1975
resulting in an increase in the average size of these loans from Rp 140 mil-
lion in 1973 to Rp 380 million in 1974 and to Rp 618 million in 1975. This
trend continued during 1976, when the average loan size for approved projects
increased to Rp 825 million. The sharp rise in the average size of industrial
loans (which exceeded the increase in industrial equipment prices)
is attributable mainly to BAPINDO's financing of Government-sponsored projects
(usually large-scale) which in the two-year period 1975-1976 accounted for 60%
(by amount) of BAPINDO's commitments (Rp 38.9 billion out of Rp 65.1 billion)
but only for 12% by number (19 out of 157). It is entirely justified for
BAPINDO to finance large projects undertaken by either the public or private
sector (if these projects are otherwise sound), since BAPINDO alone among the
six state banks has the responsibility for providing term finance to the in-
dustrial sector. On the other hand, BAPINDO, which is the predominant devel-
opment finance institution in the country, should also emphasize its assistance
to medium-sized, private sector, industrial projects, especially since PDFCI
and IDFC (para 2.04), the two other DFCs operating alongside BAPINDO, both
have limited staff and financial resources for assisting such projects. The
recent concentration on financing large projects undertaken by state enter-
prises did not reflect a deliberate policy on BAPINDO's part, but rather the
fact that, as a state-owned institution, BAPINDO understandably (and in spite
of its adequate operational autonomy vis-a-vis the Government noted in para
3.06) was under some pressure from the Government to finance these projects.



- 11 -
4.13      Following discussions with the Bank, BAPINDO and the Government
agreed that in future BAPINDO (para B-11 of Program) will seek to finance an
increasing number of medium-sized investment projects (i.e. those requiring
BAPINDO's financing for US$1 million equivalent or less). An examination of
BAPINDO's project pipeline as of February 28, 1977 shows a preponderance of
projects (58 out of 86 projects) requiring BAPINDO's financing not exceeding
US$1 million equivalent. It is therefore expected that BAPINDO's financing
in the immediate future will shift to medium-sized, as opposed to larger,
projects. In addition, a ceiling of US$3 million would be set for individual
subloans under the proposed Bank loan, to ensure that the loan proceeds would
finance a relatively large number of medium-sized projects (para 6.09).
Portfolio Arrears
4.14      Past Trend and Present Situation.  A serious problem facing BAPINDO
is the continuing unsatisfactory condition of its portfolio and its poor loan
collection performance, in spite of some improvements in the past four years.
Annex 6 (paras 6 to 12) and the relevant appendices attached to that Annex
give an analysis and tabular summary of BAPINDO's arrears.
4.15      The table in Appendix 4 of Annex 6 shows that, for term loans (both
industrial and maritime loans), 69 out of 168 borrowers (or 42% by number)
were in arrears for over three months as of December 31, 1976. Total arrears
(of both principal and interest) amounted to Rp 5.9 billion or 8.8% of the
total term loan portfolio outstanding. Arrears of principal amounted to
Rp 3.1 billion or 7.8% of the term loan portfolio in the repayment stage.
Term loans affected by arrears amounted to Rp 22.4 billion representing about
one-third of the total term loan portfolio outstanding of Rp 66.5 billion.
The aging of arrears indicates that a proportion of 38% relates to arrears of
more, and the balance of 62% relates to those of less, than 12 months. The
loan collection rate (i.e. amounts actually collected as a percentage of
amounts due) for term loans was 54.3% in 1976. Write-offs of bad debts
totalled Rp 7.0 billion for the four-year period 1973-76, which is equivalent
to 10.6% of BAPINDO's outstanding term loan portfolio as of year-end 1976.
4.16      BAPINDO has undertaken an account-by-account analysis of its term
loan portfolio (para 4.20 (iv)), which resulted in the following qualitative
classification of this portfolio as of February 28, 1977 (amounts in
Rp million):



- 12 -
Portfolio
Loans Outstanding           Affected         Arrears
Number    Amounts    %    Amounts        %   Amounts    %

In Arrears             20       14,330    21      14,330    _        1,871   26
Sub-total            54       36,285    53      14,330    55       1,871   26
Total            165       68,471   100      25,993   100      7,204  100
In the above table, "normal projects" are defined by BAPINDO as those servicing
their debt regularly or with arrears of less than three months; "bad projects"
are those for which foreclosure is undertaken and/or contemplated and those
with little prospects for resuming regular repayment; "problem projects" are
those requiring special attention but with reasonable prospects for resuming
regular repayment. All ten "bad" loans are those made by BAPINDO prior to
its 1971 reorganization, as are the majority of the 30 "problem projects."
Projects already completed accounted for 74% of total arrears, those under
construction for the balance of 26%. About three-fourths of arrears on proj-
ects under construction relate to interest, as opposed to principal. The
factors which account for BAPINDO's high level of arrears are discussed in
para 4.19. In BAPINDO's view, one particularly important and common contri-
buting factor is the delay encountered in the completion of projects (para
4.19 (h)), which in turn results in the borrowers' inability to meet the
repayment schedules of BAPINDO's loans; this explains why 20 of 54 projects
under construction (as seen from the above table) are already in arrears,
and the need for BAPINDO to reschedule many of its loans.
4.17      BAPINDO's term loan portfolio, as described in the preceding para-
graphs, although unsatisfactory, has generally improved in the past four
years (see Appendix 4 of Annex 6), viz: (a) the ratio of term loans affected
by arrears in relation to total term loans outstanding improved from 50.4% in
1973 to 45.2% in 1974 and to 29.3% in 1975 before slightly deteriorating to
33.7% in 1976; (b) the ratio of total term loan arrears (both principal and
interest) to total term loans outstanding declined steadily from 39.1% in 1973
to 25.2% in 1974, 10.3% in 1975 and 8.8% in 1976; (c) the ratio of arrears of
principal to total term loans in the repayment stage also declined steadily



- 13 -
from 14.8% in 1973 to 12.5% in 1974 to 8.7% in 1975 and 7.8% in 1976; and
finally, (d) the loan collection rate (as defined in para 4.15) went up from
37.0% in 1973 to 43.4% in 1974, 47.5% in 1975 and 54.3% in 1976. The improve-
ment in the above ratios is attributable partly to write-offs (totalling Rp.
7.0 billion of principal during 1974-76) and loan reschedulings (involving Rp
7.6 billion in principal in 1974-76). Most of the reschedulings made by
BAPINDO were, however, justified as they were aimed either at extending
unrealistically short (five years or less) original repayment schedules (para
4.19 (e)) or at taking into account frequent delays in projects' completion
(para 4.18 (h)).
4.18      Arrears on short-term portfolio relate exclusively to BAPINDO's
raw cotton loans. As of December 31, 1976, all raw cotton loans totalling
Rp. 35.0 billion were overdue. Of this amount, however, BAPINDO's own finan-
cial exposure is limited to Rp. 8.4 billion (including accrued interest of
Rp 5.1 billion), with the balance of Rp 26.6 billion or 76% 1/ being financed
by Bank Indonesia and another state bank (Bank Ekspor-Impor). Two large state-
owned textile mills account for 94% of BAPINDO's financial exposure. A
characteristic feature of BAPINDO's raw cotton financing is that it was done
largely at the Government's orders. BAPINDO did not appraise these short-term
loans; instead, the Government identified borrowers and indicated amounts to
be lent, and BAPINDO acted merely as an agent for opening letters of credit,
handling documents and collecting payments. Further, Bank Indonesia and Bank
Ekspor-Impor together provided 87.5% of the funds, as stated above. Since
BAPINDO's raw cotton financing was undertaken at the Government's behest and
without independent appraisal, the Government in the past has been willing
to compensate BAPINDO for losses arising from this financing. During negotia-
tions, the Government agreed to compensate BAPINDO for its outstanding finan-
cial exposure totalling Rp 7.9 billion in the above-mentioned two state-owned
textile mills (para 4.21). The small balance of Rp 0.5 billion (Rp 8.4 bil-
lion minus Rp 7.9 billion) representing BAPINDO's raw cotton loans to nine
privately owned textile mills, is expected to be collected by BAPINDO within
a year or so.
4.19      Reasons for Arrears.  The unsatisfactory situation of BAPINDO's
portfolio and its poor loan collection performance are attributable, inter
alia, to the following factors: (a) the loan repayment record of borrowers
in Indonesia has generally been unsatisfactory, owing partly to a legal system
favoring borrowers vis-a-vis lenders; (b) a large proportion (above one-half)
of BAPINDO's arrears relate to loans made by it prior to its 1971 reorganiza-
tion, when practically no project appraisal and follow-up was undertaken;
(c) the severe credit restrictions imposed by the Government since 1974
in order to control inflation, which compounded the liquidity problems of
companies; (d) the Government policy requiring state banks including BAPINDO
to lend only to pribumi (i.e. non-Chinese) enterprises, the majority of which
are financially and managerially weak; (e) BAPINDO's term loans had unreal-
istically short amortization schedules (5 years or less) as required by
1/   For the principal only (i.e. excluding accrued interest) the combined
share of Bank Indonesia and Bank Ekspor-Impor is 87.5%.



- 14 -
a Bank Indonesia regulation that was relaxed only in 1973; (f) BAPINDO's own
tendency to set unrealistically short repayment schedules with the objective
of trying tc collect its loans as early as possible; (g) BAPINDO's low rate
(9% p.a.) on interest in arrears, which acts as an incentive for some de-
linquent borrowers not to repay; (h) delays 1/ in the completion of projects
(compounded sometimes by the failure of BAPINDO's appraisal staff to estimate
accurately the projects' completion schedules), which in turn resulted in
these projects' inability to service their debt on schedule; and (i) the slow-
ness and generally inefficient performance of PUPN, the Government collection
agency through which all loan foreclosure and legal actions by state banks,
including BAPINDO, must be coursed.
4.20      Proposed Measures for Improvement.  Both the Government and BAPINDO's
management share the Bank's concern about the serious situation of BAPINDO's
portfolio arrears, and are acutely conscious of the need for achieving improve-
ments. BAPINDO's management has recently endeavored to remedy the situation by
tightening up considerably BAPINDO's follow-up work, with (i) the establishment
in 1974 of the Follow-Up Department within BAPINDO's organization; (ii) the
strengthening of the follow-up staff in the branch offices; (iii) the adoption
in 1976 (para 3.04) of a comprehensive Follow-Up Manual; and (iv) an account-
by-account review (which still goes on) of the portfolio in arrears with the
objective of determining the repayment capacity of each borrower and steps for
dealing with problem projects.
4.21      In spite of the foregoing, however, much remains to be done by both
the Government and BAPINDO to substantially improve the situation of BAPINDO's
portfolio. During negotiations, it was agreed that the following measures
(the most important of which are included in the Program of Action) toward
that objective will be implemented by the Government and BAPINDO.
(a) The Government agreed to take the following measures, prior
to effectiveness of the proposed loan:
(i) It will relieve BAPINDO of all financial liability
pertaining to existing and future loans made to state-
owned enterprises at the Government's behest 2/
(para A-1 Program; see also para 4.08);
1/   Some of these delays were reportedly attributable, in recent years, to
the congestion at the Jakarta port which prevented the timely clearance
of imported machinery and raw materials.
2/   Five of BAPINDO's existing loans to state enterprises, totalling
Rp 11.6 billion on an outstanding basis, as of Feb. 28, 1977, or 17%
of BAPINDO's portfolio, were identified as "behest loans."



- 15 -
(ii) It will make financial arrangements to enable all
state-owned enterprises 1/ borrowing from BAPINDO to
settle their arrears with BAPINDO of over three months
as of the date of the loan agreement (para A-2 of
Program);
(iii)  It will compensate BAPINDO for its financial exposure
totalling Rp 7.9 billion (para 4.18) in raw cotton
loans to two state-owned textile mills, of which amount
a first installment of Rp 3.0 billion will be paid to
BAPINDO prior to loan effectiveness and the balance not
later than March 31, 1978 (para A-3 of Program); and
(iv)  It will present to the Bank a plan outlining specific steps
for improving the operation of PUPN (para 4.18 (h) above),
and pending the implementation of such plan, will issue a
ministerial decree requiring PUPN to take immediate action on
BAPINDO's delinquent accounts transferred to PUPN by BAPINDO,
instead of, as has been the practice to date, waiting until
the final maturity of these loans (para A-4 of Program).
(b) BAPINDO agreed:
(i) to undertake a comprehensive program (to be submitted to
the Bank as a condition of loan effectiveness) to deal with
the portfolio arrears (para A-5 of Program), which program
should include (i) setting annual collection targets for
each branch office or loan collection unit; (ii) monthly
review by its Board of Managing Directors with relevant
staff of the portfolio situation (e.g. evaluation of
arrears; reschedulings; write-offs; steps taken or con-
templated to deal with overdue accounts; status of delin-
quent loans transferred to PUPN); (iii) monthly reporting
by BAPINDO to its Board of Supervision on the portfolio
situation as detailed above; and (iv) raising the rate
on interest in arrears (presently 9% p.a.) to the pre-
vailing level of time deposit rates (presently 18% p.a.);
and
(ii)  in view of the high level of existing portfolio arrears,
to increase the total amount of provisions for doubtful
accounts to at least 5% (as compared with about 3% at
end-1976) of total outstanding portfolio by December 31,
1977, contingent upon availability of existing reserves
and prospective 1977 income after taxes. (To enable
this build-up of BAPINDO's provisions, the Government
agreed to forsake for 1977, if necessary, a 40% divi-
dend that it would otherwise receive from BAPINDO).
1/   Six state enterprises were identified as having arrears of over three
months as of February 28, 1977. Their arrears totalled Rp 1.4 billion,
or 19% of BAPINDO's total arrears as of that date. Of this amount
Rp 434 million was paid to BAPINDO by the Government on April 22, 1977.



- 16 -
Enhancement of Development Impact
4.22      Annex 4 analyses BAPINDO's contribution to the Indonesian economy.
Quantitatively, BAPINDO has become an important institutional source of term
finance for industry. Its disbursements for both industrial and maritime
loans in 1975, Rp 20 billion, accounted for 5.7% of the country's total in-
dustrial investment (including the maritime sector) estimated at Rp 350 bil-
lion during that year. The volume of BAPINDO's approvals for industrial term
loans in 1975, amounting to Rp 27.7 billion, was equivalent to about 15% of
the amount of domestic industrial investment approved by the Invesmtent Co-
ordinating Board (ICB) during that year.
4.23      BAPINDO's qualitative contribution to the economy (in such areas
as project promotion, industrial studies, improvements in resource alloca-
tion, technical assistance to clients, influence on project design, etc.),
however, has been modest. One notable developmental achievement to date
has been its useful program for co-financing small business enterprises
with selected RDBs, referred to in para 3.08. As the major development
finance institution in the industrial sector in the country, BAPINDO is
intended not just to channel funds to industry, but to make an important
qualitative contribution to that sector. Having by and large succeeded in
building up its basic operational capability, BAPINDO intends now to endeavor
to broaden its economic role and enhance its development impact. Following
discussions with Bank staff, BAPINDO has formulated a statement of
"Development Strategy", along the lines of para B-12 of the Program, shown
in Appendix 2 of Annex 4, outlining some specific objectives and activities
(apart from its ordinary lending activity) on which it intends to put
special emphasis during 1977-1978. This strategy includes, inter alia,
the following elements: (a) active business identification and project
promotion, which constitutes a particularly important activity for a develop-
ment finance institution operating in the Indonesian context in which business
entrepreneurship is scarce; (b) technical assistance to clients and the
business community; (c) efforts at improving the design and formulation of
projects financed by BAPINDO; (d) more systematic use of partial economic
indicators of projects (e.g. employment impact, use of domestic raw materials,
foreign exchange savings/earnings, etc.) in project selection; (e) providing
help in upgrading the operational capability of cooperating RDBs and in
monitoring the performance of small-scale projects financed jointly by
BAPINDO and the RDBs; and (f) input by BAPINDO into Government policies
concerning industrial investment, and close cooperation with the Investment
Coordinating Board (ICB) in the formulation of investment criteria and the
selection of projects approved for investment incentives.
Assessment of Program of Action
4.24      The Program, which the Government, BAPINDO and the Bank agreed
upon at negotiations, and the principal elements of which are outlined in
the preceding paragraphs, provides a reasonable basis for BAPINDO to deal
with its more important current problems and to achieve further progress, and
consequently for the Bank to continue to support BAPINDO. Its implementation



- 17 -
should lay the groundwork for gradual but substantial progress on a broad
front, particularly in the following areas: (i) the reduction in loan arrears;
(ii) the quality and speed of appraisal work; (iii) further strengthening of
BAPINDO's financial position, including increased provisions for doubtful
accounts; (iv) the strengthening of BAPINDO's long-term resource base through
advance planning and exploration of additional sources of foreign exchange
borrowings; (v) a more effective operation of the branch network; and
(vi) the enhancement of BAPINDO's developmental impact. Both the Government
and BAPINDO's management are alert to the need to strengthen BAPINDO and to
gradually transform it into an efficient, innovative, development finance
institution which would make an important contribution, qualitative as well
as quantitative, to the Indonesian economy. Apart from the Program, BAPINDO's
management is searching for additional steps to strengthen the institution.
Toward that objective, BAPINDO has commissioned a team of outside management
consultants (associated with the well-known Bancom Group of the Philippines)
to undertake a comprehensive organizational study and recommend measures for
improvement. The consultants' work is still under way.
V. BAPINDO'S PROSPECTS
Projected Operations
5.01      As noted in Annex 1, the value of approved investments in the manu-
facturing sector declined in 1974-75, as a result of the international reces-
sion, credit restrictions imposed by the Government, and a stricter applica-
tion of the "pribumi" policy. BAPINDO nevertheless expects its term financing
to grow significantly in the 1977-80 period. This expectation is based on the
following premises: (a) BAPINDO's share of total industrial investment is
still small (5.7% in 1975) and could easily be expanded as its operational
capacity and resources grow; and (b) the outlook for industrial investment is
expected to improve in the next few years. BAPINDO is unlikely to face a
problem of lack of demand for its financing. Its volume of business in the
next few years is likely to depend essentially on resource availability and
staff capacity (see para 5.03).
5.02      BAPINDO's projected volume of operations is presented in Appendix 1
of Annex 8; projected commitments are summarized below:

Total commitments             41,887    66,500    85,700   99,800  112,700
From 1977 through 1980, total commitments are expected by BAPINDO to grow at
an average annual rate of 18%, not an unduly optimistic assumption.  BAPINDO's
projected commitments for 1977 (Rp 66.5 billion or US$160 million equivalent),
however, appear to be on the high side, exceeding the actual level in 1976
by 59%, although they are not entirely out of line with BAPINDO's project
pipeline as of February 28, 1977, which included 86 projects 1/ (at various
stages of processing) which would require BAPINDO's financing totalling
about Rp 61 billion or US$147 million equivalent, of which US$75 million
would be for foreign currency financing. BAPINDO is likely to fall short of
its projected commitemnts by as much as 20% in 1977 (i.e. Rp 53.2 billion
instead of Rp 66.5 billion) and 10% in 1978 (i.e. Rp 77.1 billion instead
of Rp 85.7 billion), but may be able subsequently to achieve its projected
level of business for 1979 and 1980.
5.03      The prospective loan processing capacity of BAPINDO's staff taking
into account the contemplated expansion in the size of the appraisal staff
(by one third each year in 1977 and 1978), their growing experience, and pro-
cedural improvements under way, will be adequate to enable BAPINDO to achieve
the volume of operations it has projected for the next few years, provided
BAPINDO obtains the required resources.

Resource Requirements
5.04      Currencies.  Because of the free convertibility of the Indonesian
currency (para 22 of Annex 1), BAPINDO in principle can utilize its domestic
currency funds for financing imports. Furthermore, all BAPINDO's foreign
resources (such as previous Bank loans and IDA credits, the KfW loan and
bilateral credits channelled to BAPINDO by the Government), were relent by
the Government to BAPINDO in rupiahs (para 6.05), and thus can be treated as
domestic currency resources in the strict sense. However, it is the Govern-
ment's policy, based on balance of payments considerations, that BAPINDO
should, as a rule, finance imports with foreign borrowings, not with rupiah
funds. For the period prior to 1972, BAPINDO had to finance imports entirely
with its rupiah resources (mainly under the INVESTASI program referred to in
para 14 of Annex 1) because it had no foreign exchange resources available.
From 1972, when BAPINDO obtained the first IDA Credit, it began to finance the
bulk of the import requirements of its clients with foreign borrowings, but
still had to continue to finance a proportion of these imports with its rupiah
funds, because of the shortfall in its foreign exchange resources. Available
data show that in recent years 54% of BAPINDO's total disbursements for term
loans were on account of imports, whereas only 35% of these total disbursements
were financed from BAPINDO's foreign exchange resources. This indicates that
BAPINDO has financed imports with foreign borrowings to the extent of about
65% (i.e. 35:54), and the balance of 35% with rupiah funds. In its business
projections, BAPINDO assumes (for planning purposes) that in future, financ-
ing of imports will continue to account for the same proportion (54%) of its
total financing, but that its foreign exchange resources will increase sub-
stantially and ultimately account for about 80% of its import financing by
1980, with the balance of 20% to be financed by rupiah funds.
5.05      Domestic Currency.  BAPINDO's disbursements of domestic currency
from January 1, 1977 through December 31, 1980 are estimated at Rp 233.8 bil-
lion. At the beginning of that period, BAPINDO had Rp 13.6 billion available
for disbursement. The table below indicates how BAPINDO plans to meet its
domestic currency requirements.

- 20 -
As can be seen from the foregoing, rupiah loan collections I/ and retained
earnings (totalling Rp 24.1 billion) are expected to finance a proportion of
just over 10% of BAPINDO's rupiah requirements, and the balance of Rp 209.7
billion will have to be covered by new resources, such as loans from the Gov-
ernment, Bank Indonesia and other state banks. Apart from loan collections,
retained earnings and negligible deposits, BAPINDO remains completely dependent
on the Government for domestic currency resources. BAPINDO is considering the
issuance of domestic bonds, for which it expects to obtain from the Govern-
ment the same interest subsidy as that given to state banks for time deposits
(para 22 of Annex 1).
5.06      Foreign Currency.  BAPINDO plans to commit about US$360 million in
foreign exchange 2/ in the four-year period 1977/80. As of Dec, 31, 1976,
its available foreign exchange resources consisted of the uncommitted balance
of US$17.2 million of the last Bank loan (1054-IND) 3/ and a DM 22 million
(about US$9 million equivalent) loan from KfW of Germany. These amounts are
expected to be fully committed by BAPINDO prior to September 1, 1977, or around
the expected effectiveness of the proposed loan. Apart from the proposed Bank
loan of US$40 million, BAPINDO expects to obtain a first loan of US$30 million
from ADB in the first quarter of 1978. These two loans, totalling US$70 mil-
lion, would cover BAPINDO's foreign exchange commitments for a period of about
12 months, i.e. up to September 1978.
5.07      Resource Planning.  BAPINDO's resource position as of December 31,
1976, is summarized in Annex 7. Its resource requirements over the period
1977-80 are analyzed in paras 5.05 and 5.06. With respect to domestic
currency resources, the Government and Bank Indonesia have, in the past,
whenever the need arose, provided BAPINDO with adequate funds (in the form
of both equity and loans). There are, however, indications that in future
BAPINDO may be faced with a shortage of rupiah resources owing to the Govern-
ment's budgetary constraints and Bank Indonesia's restrictive credit policies.
With respect to foreign currency resources, the Bank so far has virtually been
BAPINDO's sole source of funds, accounting for 88% of its foreign currency
resources as of December 31, 1976. The Bank has informed the Government and
BAPINDO that it expects BAPINDO in the near future to mobilize additional
sources of foreign borrowings so as to gradually reduce its dependence on the
Bank's financing. A first step toward diversifying BAPINDO's sources of
1/   Loan collections are assumed net of repayments by BAPINDO, which borrows
from Bank Indonesia and other state banks at maturities not exceeding five
years (under existing Bank Indonesia regulations) and re-lends at maturi-
ties averaging about eight years, thus financing with its own equity
the later maturities of these loans.
2/   As stated in para 5.04, BAPINDO's shortfall in foreign exchange resources,
if any, will be financed out of BAPINDO's domestic currency resources,
because of the convertibility of the Indonesian currency.
3/   This balance had declined to US$8.4 million by April 30, 1977.



- 21 -
fo-t4gn exchange was made when the Government recently approached ADB
for a US$30 million loan to BAPINDO, which is expected to materialize in
early 1978 (para 5.06). During negotiations, the Government stated its
intention to provide BAPINDO with adequate resources, both domestic and
foreign, to sustain its future operations (para B-9 of Program).
Projected Financial Position
5.08      Projected balance sheets through 1980 are shown in Appendix 2 of
Annex 8, and selected financial ratios in Appendix 5 of that Annex. On the
basis of its forecast volume of business, BAPINDO's total assets should
increase from Rp 124.9 billion at December 31, 1976 to Rp 342.3 billion at
end-1980 or at an average annual rate of about 15%. This growth is entirely
attributable to the term loan portfolio which is projected to reach Rp 304.8
billion in 1980 after increasing at an average rate of 40% from its 1976
level of Rp 76.8 billion. This, and the disappearance of BAPINDO's short-term
raw cotton loan portfolio by the end of 1977, will substantially modify the
structure of assets; the term loan portfolio (excluding provisions for doubt-
ful accounts) which accounted for only 62.5% of total assets in 1976 would
represent about 85.7% of these assets in 1980, while the share of current
assets would correspondingly decline from 37.6% to 10.2%. A major proportion
of the increase in assets will be financed through long-term debts which will
go up from Rp 38.5 billion in 1976 to Rp 275.5 billion in 1980. BAPINDO also
expects the Government to make an additional capital contribution of Rp 6.0
billion before the end of 1977, thereby raising its paid-in capital to its
presently authorized level of Rp 50 billion. The current ratio is estimated
to range between 1.3:1 and 3.0:1 over the projection period, which would be
satisfactory. The projected long-term debt/equity ratio shows an increase
from 0.8:1 in 1976 to 5.0:1 in 1980, exceeding the contractural limit of 3.0:1
in 1979. In view of the continuing unsatisfactory arrears situation (para
4.12), it is recommended that this 3.0:1 debt/equity limit be maintained for
the present. The Bank should not consider an increase in the debt/equity
limit until BAPINDO's arrears situation has materially improved. The mainte-
nance of the existing limit would require the Government to make additional
cash subscriptions to BAPINDO's capital before 1979 to enable BAPINDO to incur
further borrowings.
Projected Financial Results
5.09      Projected income statements for 1976-80 are given in Appendix 3 of
Annex 8, and indicators of financial performance, in Appendix 5. BAPINDO's
profitability will remain modest, with net profit increasing from 2.7% of net
worth in 1976 to 3.3% in 1980, as a result of higher leverage, and profit be-
fore tax and provisions as a percentage of average total assets will increase
from 2.2% to 3.7%. General and administrative expenses are projected to dec-
line only marginally, from 3.8% in 1976 to 3.2% in 1980, which would still be
,igh. There is room for BAPINDO in future to try to control more tightly the
rise in its administrative cost (see para 4.06; and A-6 of Program). Projected
cas;L flow statements are given in Appendix 4 of Annex 8. Debt service cover
is expected to decline marginally from 1.6 in 1975 to 1.4 in 1980. (Collection
rat, for industrial term loans are assumed at 63% of amounts falling due in



- 22 -
1977, rising gradually to 90% in 1980; for working capital loans, the corres-
ponding figures are respectively 64% and 84%.)
VI. OBJECTIVES AND FEATURES OF PROPOSED LOAN
Objectives and Justification
6.01      Apart from replenishing BAPINDO's foreign currency resources, the
proposed loan would enable the Bank to continue the institution-building
process started with Credit No. 310-IND in 1972. Since then, the Bank has
continued to follow BAPINDO's progress closely and to make available to
BAPINDO such advice and guidance as BAPINDO considers it needs and the Bank
considers it can offer. It is clear from the preceding parts of this report
that, in spite of considerable progress in the past few years, much remains
to be done to further strengthen BAPINDO and transform it into an efficient,
innovative development finance institution. As stated in para 2.04, BAPINDO
among the state banks is entrusted with the specific responsibility for
assisting the industrial sector. A strong BAPINDO is therefore highly im-
portant for the continued development of Indonesian industry, both public
and private. While major improvements will not be achieved very quickly, and
expectations of future progress need to be realistic, there is good reason to
believe that BAPINDO will make substantial further progress during the period
of commitment of the proposed loan, with the implementation of the measures
contemplated in the Program of Action (Annex 5) and others presently under
consideration by BAPINDO's management. That there remain many problems to be
solved should not be construed as a failure on the part of BAPINDO, but rather
to reflect the fact that institution-building is a long-term process, espe-
cially in the light of BAPINDO's serious weaknesses prior to its 1971 reorga-
nization, and of the Indonesian context in which industrial expertise and
business entrepreneurship are relatively scarce. The Government attaches
great priority to BAPINDO, and no other financial intermediary has, or is
likely to have, the same impact on Indonesia's industrial sector. By conti-
nuing its assistance to BAPINDO in terms of both finance and guidance, the
Bank can play a useful role in the Indonesian economy.
6.02      Lending to BAPINDO is also justified as a means, not otherwise
available, of transferring resources from the Bank to industrial projects
in Indonesia. With the recent improvements in BAPINDO's appraisal work
(para 3.07), and expected further improvements, BAPINDO is an adequate
allocator of Bank funds. The subproject review process (para 6.09) should
further ensure that Bank funds would go to industrial projects that are
economically as well as financially viable.
6.03      Loan Amount.  As stated in para 5.06, a Bank loan of US$40 million
(together with BAPINDO's prospective foreign borrowings from other sources)
is expected to cover BAPINDO's estimated foreign exchange commitments for a
period of about one year. This represents a departure from the Bank's usual
practice of lending to DFCs on a two-year basis. Although the Bank expects



- 23 -
BAPINDO to resolve its problems and achieve further improvements with the
implementation of the Program of Action, it is deemed appropriate for the
Bank at this time to limit the amount of the proposed loan to US$40 million,
in view of BAPINDO's remaining problems, in particular the unsatisfactory
situation of its loan portfolio.
Features of Proposed Loan
6.04      Form of Bank Loan.  As with other Bank loans to Indonesia, the
loan would be made to the Government for relending to BAPINDO, under a sub-
sidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank, the signing of which will be
a condition of effectiveness for the proposed loan.
6.05      Utilization of Loan Proceeds.  As with the previous Bank loan to
BAPINDO, the proposed loan would finance, in addition to direct imports of
machinery and equipment, the foreign exchange component of domestically
procured capital goods estimated at 60% and that of locally procured vehicles
and local civil works estimated at 40%.
6.06      Foreign Exchange Risk.  The Government has expressed the wish to
onlend the Bank loan to BAPINDO in rupiahs, thereby itself assuming the for-
eign exchange risk. This arrangement is similar to that under previous Bank
loans and IDA credits to BAPINDO and PDFCI. The Government's unwillingness
to require Indonesian sub-borrowers to bear the exchange risk is based on the
consideration that the Indonesian currency has been and remains relatively
stable, and that most domestic enterprises (especially the indigenous ones)
are not sophisticated enough to appreciate the complexities of multiple cur-
rency exchange risks, whereas the better-established companies (mostly non-
indigenous and joint ventures) can borrow from the Singapore and Hong Kong
capital markets at an interest rate presently around 10-11% (with the exchange
risk borne by the borrower).
6.07      Relending Rates.  BAPINDO intends to relend the loan proceeds at
an interest rate of 15% p.a. 1/, as long as this rate remains the standard
rate for medium- and long-term credits charged by state banks in Indonesia.
The Bank would be consulted by BAPINDO prior to any changes in the proposed
relending rate. As stated in para 2.05 of this report and para 22 of Annex 1,
the 15% rate would result in sub-borrowers' paying an adequate real rate in
excess of 5% based on projections of future inflation in Indonesia.
6.08      Spread Limitation.  The Government intends to on-lend to BAPINDO
the loan proceeds (in rupiahs) at an interest rate of 11% p.a., thus giving
1/   For loans below Rp 100 million, at 12% p.a. in accordance with prevail-
ing rate structure.



- 24 -
BAPINDO a spread of 4 percentage points 1/, which is adequate. The Govern-
ment's own spread of 2.8 percentage points (11% minus the Bank's assumed
lending rate of 8.2%) represents a guarantee fee for its assuming the foreign
exchange risk.
6.09      Free Limit.  As stated in para 3.07, BAPINDO's appraisal work has
recently improved. The Program of Action includes measures for achieving
further improvement. It is therefore recommended that the free limit (US$0.5
million under the previous Bank loan) be increased to US$1.0 million, with an
aggregate free limit of US$10 million. The proposed increase in the free
limit also takes cognizance of the substantial rise in the cost of capital
goods in the past two years. With this free limit, sub-loans accounting for
at least 75% (by amount) of the loan will require prior Bank approval. This
should be sufficient for the purpose of effective subproject monitoring by
the Bank.
6.10      Ceiling on Subloans.  To ensure that the proceeds of the loan
would be spread over a relatively large number of medium-sized projects,
a ceiling of $3 million would be set on the size of individual sub-loans.
6.11      Financing of Technical Assistance.  While BAPINDO has benefited
from technical assistance provided in the past by UNDP and through bilateral
aid (para 3.06), it still needs assistance from outside experts in overall
development banking activity as well as economic and marketing research.
Consequently, corresponding to the estimated cost for 36 man/months, in
amount of US$240,000 is earmarked under the proposed loan for financing the
services of three experts (36 man/months): a general DFC advisor, a senior
economic advisor and a marketing expert.
6.12      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the pro-
posed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming substan-
tially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of BAPINDO's sub-loans
the maximum term for which would be 15 years including the grace period.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, understandings were reached with the Govern-
ment and BAPINDO on the Program of Action, shown in Annex 5, designed generally
to remedy BAPINDO's existing problems and achieve further improvements.
1/   BAPINDO's spread is reduced to 1 percentage point for sub-loans below
Rp 100 million, for which it charges a lending rate of 12% p.a. Since
BAPINDO is not expected to make many sub-loans below Rp 100 million,
its overall spread is expected to be close to 4 percentage points.



- 25 -
7.02      Agreement was reached on the following matters:
(a)  maintenance of the debt/equity limit at 3.0:1 (para 5.08);
(b)  a free limit of US$1 million with an aggregate free limit of
US$10 million (para 6.09); and
(c)  a US$3 million ceiling on the size of individual subloans
(para 6.10).
7.03      Further, the following steps (contained in Part A of the Program
of Action) were specified as additional conditions to the effectiveness of
the loan:
(a)  the Government will:  (i) relieve BAPINDO of all financial
liability pertaining to projects financed by BAPINDO at
the Government's behest; (ii) make arrangements to enable
all state enterprises to settle with BAPINDO their arrears of
principal and interest of over three months as of the date of
the loan agreement; (iii) compensate BAPINDO for its losses
on raw cotton financing by making a partial payment of Rp 3.0
billion (with the remaining balance to be paid not later than
March 31, 1978); and (iv) furnish to the Bank the review of
PUPN, the official collection agency, and issue a ministerial
decree requiring PUPN to take immediate action on BAPINDO's
delinquent loans instead of waiting until expiry of the last
maturity of these loans as has been the practice to date
(para 4.21 (a); and
(b)  BAPINDO will furnish to the Bank plans, satisfactory to the
Bank, for: (i) controlling its future administrative cost
(para 4.06); and (ii) improving its arrears situation along
the lines of para A-5 of the Program of Action (para
4.21 (b) (i)).

Economic, Industrial and Financial Environment
A. The Indonesia Economy 1/
1.        Background.  During the First Five-Year Development Plan (April 1,
1969 - March 31, 1974), the Government's efforts succeeded in rehabilitating
existing plant and infrastructure, thus setting the economy back on a devel-
opment course. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual
rate of more than 7%, with the highest growth rates being recorded in the
mining (particularly oil), manufacturing and trade sectors. Gross domestic
capital formation increased at an average rate of around 25 percent in real
terms, and rose as a proportion of GDP from 9% in 1968 to 19% in 1973. Fol-
lowing the boom in oil and other commodity exports in 1973-74, a mood of
optimism prevailed at policy-making levels. It was thought that earlier
resource constraints had eased sufficiently to allow a substantial increase
in consumption and investment expenditures. The Government intensified its
efforts to promote economic development by stepping up budgetary expenditures
in line with the expected rise in oil revenue, and by raising the level of
external borrowing. However, the slackening of export demand and the gradual
realization, in early 1975, of the magnitude of Pertamina's financial diffi-
culties have since then forced the Government to review and in many cases
scale down its plans. Once again, capital resource scarcity has become the
major factor hampering the economic develpment of Indonesia, a country whose
long-term prospects remain otherwise promising.
2.        Recent Performance.  In 1975 real GDP is estimated to have grown
by 4-1/2 % compared to 7.5% in 1974. The decline in the rate of GDP growth
was primarily the result of a decrease in the production of major agricul-
tural products and mineral exports, including oil, as a result of poor har-
vests, unfavorable price development for major agricultural export products
and the recession affecting Indonesia's principal trading partners. For
1976 the growth of the GDP is expected to have recovered around 1974 levels
1/   For a detailed discussion please refer to the latest basic economic
report (No. 1516-IND) dated March 8, 1977. A study of public sector
investment is presented in the report entitled "Public Sector Invest-
ment and Financial Resources in Indonesia", No. 1187-IND, dated
May 24, 1976.

and a turraround in mining due to developments in the oil sector. Prelimin-
ary data si,gest that the rice harvest has risen slightly again in 1976 after
no growth in 1975 while production of other primary products such as rubber,
coffee, logs and timber have picked up due to favorable export prices or the
pick-up of economic activities in the developed countries. Government pol-
icies over the last two years were dominated by the efforts to cope with the
problems caused by the Pertamina crises and to put Indonesia back on the road
towards long-term development. These efforts have by and large been success-
ful as the Government was able to execute the program announced in 1975:
foreign borrowings have been kept well within last year's limits; the mech-
anisms are in place for further sharply reducing them in the current year;
public sector borrowing from the domestic banking system was cut sharply
and inflation was further reduced; some planned large new investment projects
and equipment purchase contracts were deferred; and tax revenue and public
savings targets were reached.
3.        Current Government expenditures in 1975/76 dropped (even in current
terms) by about 7% after having almost doubled in 1974/75 while development
expenditures increased by around 50% during 1975/76 as compared to 30% in
1974/75. The restraint on current expenditures in 1975/76 had become neces-
sary because of the lower than expected growth in resources (5%) about 40%
of which come from oil exports. International reserves which had started
to decline in the latter half of 1974/75, further decreased during 1975/76,
despite substantial capital inflows, because exports failed to increase
while imports continued to climb. Debt service payments on behalf of Per-
tamina also peaked (about US$1.5 billion). In 1976/77, however, reserves
increased again despite a small increase in the trade deficit, because a
larger share of imports was financed by long-term loans disbursed, notably
of IGGI project aid (US$1.4 billion as against US$1.0 billion in 1975/76),
while the large short term loans contracted by Pertamina had been repaid in
the previous year. Gross investments continued at high levels in 1975/76,
judging by the 100% increase in imports of capital goods, primarily on
account of some large industrial projects which had been under preparation for
some time; investment interest however was on a decline as for instance the
approval of foreign investments by the Capital Investment Coordinating Board
was sharply lower if one excludes two very large projects (mining and alu-
minum). Prices continued to climb though at a reduced rate, the Jakarta con-
sumer price index rising at an annual rate of around 15% in 1976 (as compared
to 19% in 1975 and 40% in 1974). The inflation which was in earlier years
caused by a severe drought in 1972, followed by the commodity boom of 1973
was further fuelled by continued rapid expansion of bank credits to finance
public investments. Total liquidity in 1975 for instance increased by close
to 40% with about half of all credits going to the public sector thus forcing
some credit squeeze on the private sector. The improved financial situation
of the Government in 1976 helped considerably to slow down inflation, as the
Government decided to reduce sharply the public sector's use of bank credits.
4.        Future Directions and Prospects for Growth.  All through the recent
financial difficulties caused by the Pertamina Crisis, the Government has
remained committed to its objective of improving living standards and creating

new employment opportunities. As stated in the Second Five-Year Development
Plan (April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979), the aim is to achieve a long-term
annual growth rate of 7.5% coupled with an annual rate of employment creation
of 2.3%. Priority is being given to achieving self-sufficiency in food
production; increasing industrial production; and further expanding both
physical and social infrastructure. With present and projected resource con-
straints, the Government's task is a difficult one. However, the attainment
of a real growth rate in excess of 7% remains feasible. Continued expansion
of agricultural output with a concomitant increase in real agricultural
incomes, together with further public and private investment should help
sustain industrial output expansion, particularly in labor-intensive indus-
tries serving both the export and domestic markets. This is needed not so
much as a source of foreign exchange earnings or savings, but as a source of
income and employment for Indonesia's population. To ensure a stable climate
for continued growth, the government is also determined to reduce the present
rate of inflation. Given its policy of curbing the expansion of total liquid-
ity to about 20% in 1977/78 and maintaining it at that level thereafter, the
rate of inflation is expected to average around 10% for the period 1977-1980.
B. The Industrial Sector
5.        The Role of Industry.  Over the long-term, heavy reliance is being
placed on industrial expansion in achieving income and employment growth tar-
gets. In view of the failure of the industrial sector, over the past decade,
to provide employment opportunities commensurate with levels of investment,
the Government is gradually moving away from its past policy of promoting
large capital intensive projects and is encouraging instead the development
of small- and medium-scale industries using more labor intensive methods of
production, which are also likely to strengthen intra- and inter-industry
linkages and contribute to a wider regional distribution of investment.
6.        Recent Growth.  Between 1971 and 1975 manufacturing and mining
industry expanded rapidly, growing (at constant prices) at 15% p.a. and
11% p.a. respectively. Since over the same period the economy as a whole grew
at 8% p.a., the relative share of these two sectors in GDP rose from 19% to
22% combined (manufacturing from 9% to 11% and mining from 10% to 11%).
Together with the construction sector, industry accounted for 27% of GDP in
1975 and provided employment for around 8% of the total labor force. During
1974 and 1975, the growth of the industrial sector was adversely affected by
international developments. Faced with higher production costs and declining
demand, some sectors serving the domestic market experienced low levels of
capacity utilization. This was notably the case of the textile industry which
in addition had to compete with imports. Export-oriented sectors such as
mining and wood-based industries suffered from the recession in the indus-
trialized nations. Overall, the industrial sector's growth slowed down to an
annual rate of 11% in 1974; in real terms, mining output expanded by 3%,
manufacturing by 16% and construction by 22%. More recently, the industrial



ANNEX 1
Page 4
sector has shown signs of recovery. Demand for oil and wood products has
strengthered in export markets, and textile production is on the rise.
7.        Structure.  Inadequate statistics permit only a broad analysis of
the structure and composition of the manufacturing sector, which, in 1975,
accounted for around 40% of all industrial activity and contributed 11%
of GDP. The latest surveys are out of date and can therefore only provide
orders of magnitude and structural relationships. According to these surveys,
four industry groups accounted for about 75% of manufacturing value added;
these were food processing, tobacco manufacture, rubber products (mostly
crumb rubber and sheets) and textiles. These industries were also predominant
in terms of employment (85%) and number of establishments (75%). In recent
years, a number of new industries have been established in such fields as
industrial chemicals, steel products as well as motor vehicle, radio and
television sets assembly. Their contribution to employment creation, how-
ever, has been minimal. In terms of size distribution, very small-scale
enterprises 1/ represent an overwhelming majority (97%); in 1972, they
accounted for 64% of industrial employment and 17 percent of manufacturing
value added, which suggests a very low productivity. Even within the group
of establishments exceeding the definition of small-scale enterprises, small
and medium sized firms (i.e. those with up to 100 employees) accounted for
90% of the number of establishments, employed around 32% of the labor force
and contributed 18% to gross value added. Geographically, manufacturing
activity is concentrated on Java, which has 78% of existing medium- and
large-scale firms, and 86% of total manufacturing employment. It is also
on Java that the largest scale of production is to be found, with an aver-
age of 53 workers per plant. The Jakarta metropolitan area accounts for
11% of the number of enterprises located, and 7% of manufacturing employment
in Java. Other large Javanese cities (notably Surabaya, Semarang and Bandung)
are also important industrial centers.
8.        Industrialization Strategy.  Indonesian manufacturing is geared
mainly to production for the domestic consumer market. This is attributable
to an industrialization strategy which has placed heavy emphasis on import
substitution, linked with the build up of capital intensive production of
basic products such as steel, fertilizer and cement. The combination of
an easily convertible domestic currency pegged at fixed exchange rate to the
US dollar since 1971, and of a high rate of inflation which caused long-term
interest rates to be negative in real terms, might also have induced manufac-
turing investment to be more capital intensive than otherwise necessary. The
Government has shown a growing awareness of these problems and is taking mea-
sures to shift the structure of production more toward labor intensive manu-
facturing. This is reflected in its present industrialization strategy which
appears essentially three pronged. First, investments now underway in large
projects are to be completed. These should extend downstream processing of
industrial exports (e.g. mineral ore smelters, liquified natural gas plants)
1/   Small scale enterprises are officially defined as those employing 10
workers or less without power equipment, or 5 workers or less with
power equipment.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
or encourage domestic production of intermediate goods (steel, cement, fer-
tilizer, pulp and paper). Second, medium-large projects are to be promoted,
especially those aimed at developing the non-traditional export base and
allowing for more integration in existing industries. Third, increasing
emphasis is to be placed on fostering the growth of small industries which
will address the objective of employment generation, regional dispersal of
investment and production closer to raw material sources and markets. Once
the heavy demand which the first group of projects which are mainly in the
government sector, is placing on available financial resources has been
satisfied, projects in the small- and medium-industrial category, mainly
private, will have a better chance to materialize. At present, their devel-
opment is seriously impaired by existing credit restrictions.
9.        Policies and Incentives.  The Indonesian Government's policies on
industrial investment are partly reflected in the incentives it provides
under the Domestic and Foreign Capital Investment Laws which are administered
by the Investment Coordinating Board (ICB). These incentives usually apply
equally to domestic and foreign companies but are not automatically granted
as a package. They vary according to priority ranking of industry and the
economic impact of the project, measured by employment creation, foreign
exchange earnings, training of domestic skilled workers, degree of pribumi 1/
management, regional location, etc. The main elements of the incentive system
include tax privileges, reduction or exemption from import levies, depreciation
allowances and other important rights and guarantees relating to management
control, transfer of profits and compensation in the event of nationalization.
Other means of control at the Government's disposal are the use of protection
policies, applied both through the tariff system and the imposition of direct
import controls, 2/ and, to a lesser extent, the interest rate policy. These
policies were originally designed to promote investment which would, over the
long-term, yield the greatest returns to the economy and ensure sound resource
allocation. Whether they have succeeded in doing so is difficult to determine.
In certain cases (e.g. motor car assembly), these policies have resulted in
the country's incurring higher foreign exchange costs. It is also alleged
that ICB incentives serve to do little apart from partially countering the
distortions introduced by tariffs and import controls, and that the very
nature of the incentive system seems to promote capital intensiveness and, as
a corollary, low capacity utilization. While this is true to a point, any
recommendations on the subject must await the findings of the Bank industrial
sector review mission which is expected to present its report later this year.
10.       Manufacturing Investment.  Information on the level and direction
of investment in manufacturing is lacking. Available data pertain only to
investments approved by the ICB, which do not include the large public sector
industrial investments presently underway. On this basis it appears that
manufacturing investment activity slackened in 1974 and has further declined
1/   Ethinic Indonesian.
2/   Overall, the level of protection is low in Indonesia, though direct
import controls and high tariffs do exist for selected products.



ANNEX I
Page 6
since then. In 1975, the ICB approved 43 foreign investment projects involv-
ing a total planned capital outlay of US$1.0 billion. Of this amount, 85% was
accounted for by one large project, the Asahan aluminum plant (with cost of
US$870 million), a joint undertaking between foreign private investors and the
Government. If one excludes this project, the value of foreign investment
approved in 1975 was substantially below its 1974 level of US$1.1 billion.
This represents a continuation of the declining trend exhibited by foreign
investment applications since late 1973, particularly in the manufacturing
sector, and is no doubt largely due to the recessionary conditions in capi-
tal exporting countries which adversely affected private industrialists'
investment interest. Pertamina's financial difficulties might also have
influenced prospective investors. On the domestic side, investors had reacted
earlier to changed economic conditions and restrictive Government measures.
The sharp decline took place in 1974 when approvals of private domestic invest-
ment projects fell to Rp 230 billion for 259 projects compared to Rp 569 bil-
lion for 550 project in 1973. In 1975, domestic investors maintained a
cautious wait-and-see attitude. Total approvals stagnated at Rp 236 billion
for 168 projects. While most of the factors presently discouraging private
investment are expected to be of a short-term nature and do not reflect any
changes in the long-term opportunities offered in Indonesia, others such as
the stricter enforcement of the pribuminization regulations 1/, as well as
administrative and bureacratic obstacles may depress the private investment
climate on a longer term basis.
C. The Financial Sector
1i.       Overview.  In terms of structure, diversity of institutions,
financial services offered and the variety of financial instruments avail-
able for mobilizing savings, the financial system in Indonesia is still in
its early stages of development. The core of the system is a large commer-
cial banking sector dominated by five State banks and regulated by the
Central Bank, Bank Indonesia (BI). There are in addition a variety of spe-
cialized financial institutions e.g. term-financing institutions, merchant
banks, and savings institutions, some of which have only recently been estab-
lished. Overall, the financial system remains essentially geared to serving
short-term financing needs. This is the consequence of a regulatory environ-
ment governing credit markets and interest rates which simply does not make it
profitable for private institutions to mobilize long-term funds to finance
long-term investments. Only Government institutions can do so, thanks to the
special facilities provided to them by the Central Bank. As a result these
institutions have grown rapidly (but unprofitably) in a fairly unorganized
fashion.
1/   Pribumi enterprises are defined as those with at least 50% pribumi
(ethnic Indonesian) ownership and with predominantly pribumi man-
agement or 75% ownership if management is non-pribumi.



ANNEX I
Page 7
12.       Over the last few years, the Government has attempted to remedy
some of the shortcomings affecting the financial sector. With Bank Group
assistance, BAPINDO, was reorganized with a view to making it the predominant
source of medium- and long-term finance for industry. A program to upgrade
the five State commercial banks was initiated and is still underway. In 1972,
the Indonesian Development Corporation (IDFC) was reorganized as a joint ven-
ture between the Government (through Bank Indonesia) and the Netherlands
Overseas Finance Corporation, in which the Dutch Government has a majority
interest. In 1973, again with Bank Group assistance, the government was
instrumental in establishing a third largely privately-owned development bank,
P.T. Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Apart from an
equity investment of US$0.5 million by IFC, PDFCI has received an IDA credit
of US$10 million and, early in 1977, a Bank loan of US$15 million. A special-
ized institution, P.T. Bahana, was also set up the same year to
provide equity financing and managerial assistance to financially weak enter-
prises. Since the passage, in 1973, of a law governing the establishment
and operations of non-bank financial intermediaries, 11 merchant banks have
been set up as joint ventures between foreign and local banks. Their ope-
rations are still concentrated in short-term commercial paper, but are ex-
pected to include in the future long-term securities and equity investments,
thus paving the way to the establishment of an active capital market. Finally
to help meet the need for long-term funds, the Government has instituted two
investment credit schemes, the Medium-Term Investment Credit (INVESTASI)
and the Small Investment Credit (KIK and KMKP) programs, which are adminis-
tered by the Central Bank and handled by the State banks.
13.       Indonesia's financial sector consists of Bank Indonesia, five large
State commercial banks, four national development banks (BAPINDO, PDFCI, IDFC
and P.T. Bahana), 26 RDBs, 11 branches of foreign banks, 97 small private
domestic commercial banks, and about 5,000 savings and small village and rural
banks. There are also 11 merchant banks and a dormant Stock Exchange.
14.       Short-Term Credit.  Short-term credit is extended by banks for
periods of up to one year; most loans are for three to six months duration
and can be renewed depending upon the bank/borrower relationship. The com-
mercial paper market started operating only recently following the estab-
lishment of the merchant banks.
15.       Medium- and Long-Term Credit.  Term credit is available from most
banks, though foreign banks must obtain Bank Indonesia's approval to make
loans for more than one year. However, with the exception of the INVESTASI
program and loans from development banks, maturities are usually limited to
three years with possible rollover. The main source of term finance remains
the INVESTASI program which was introduced by the Government in 1969. Under
this program, term loans are available for almost all sectors from State
banks and RDBs, with Bank Indonesia refinancing 65 to 80% of the loan amounts.
Since the inception of this program, most loans have gone to the private
sector which accounted for about 70% of cumulative loan approvals totalling
Rp 224 billion as of September 30, 1975. Of this amount, Rp 104 billion
(or 46%) had been approved for projects in the manufacturing sector, three-



ANNEX 1
Page 8
fourths of which had been disbursed. The INVESTASI program is limited by
annual budget appropriations. Loans under the program bear an interest
rate ranging from 12 to 15% per annum and carry maturities of between one
and five years. Their interest rate is therefore subsidized as the rate
on two-year time deposits is 18% per annum.
16.       Four national development banks specialize in extending term financ-
ing to industry. BAPINDO is by far the most important and is the only State
bank allowed to grant term loans with maturities of over five years. By
year-end 1975, BAPINDO's term loans outstanding amounted to about 28% of all
outstanding term loans under the INVESTASI program, and had increased al-
most three-fold since 1972. BAPINDO finances industrial projects of every
size (large, medium and small) in both the public and private sectors. The
Indonesian-Dutch joint venture development bank, IDFC, extends term loans,
participates in equity financing and provides a limited amount of technical
assistance to its clients. So far, it has disbursed about US$12 million for
27 projects in such sectors as food processing, textiles, printing, tourism,
shipping and farming. Because of its limited financial resources, as well
as on grounds of corporate policy, IDFC concentrates on financing relatively
small projects. The average size of its loans to date is Rp 165 million
(US$400,000). In 1973, the Government and the Bank Group cooperated in
setting up PDFCI, in which IFC organized the participation of eight foreign
banks (32%), taking up itself 8% of the share capital. PDFCI is empowered
to make medium- and long-term loans, invest in equity, provide guarantees,
underwrite corporate equity and debt securities and provide technical, finan-
cial and managerial consultancy services. One of its most important objec-
tives is the identification of new projects and the promotion of new enter-
prises. From 1974, when it started operations, to June 7, 1976, PDFCI ap-
proved a total financing of around US$12 million, of which US$800,000 rep-
resented equity investments, for 12 industrial projects. The fourth devel-
opment bank, P.T. Bahana, was established by the Government in 1973 with
the main objective of providing equity financing (up to 12.5% of the share
capital of its clients) particularly to enterprises with a weak capital
structure. All four development banks can enter into co-financing agreements
but there have been few so far.
17.       Financing of Small Scale Industries.  Since December 1973, two cre-
dit schemes are available to small entrepreneurs: the Kredit Investasi Kecil
(KIK) for the financing of fixed investment, and the Kredit Modal Kerja Pena-
naman (KMKP) for working capital financing. Both schemes are handled by State
banks and selected RDBs, with the Central Bank refinancing 70% to 80% of the
loan amounts disbursed. All productive activities (in industry, agriculture,
trade and services) are eligible for KIK and KMKP financing. A limit, how-
ever, has been placed on the maximum loan amount which may be approved for any
single project. This limit is presently Rp 5 million (US$12,000 equivalent)
under both KIK and KMKP. Maturities range from 1 to 5 years including a grace
period of up to two years, and interest rates applied to sub-borrowers are 12%
for KIK and 15% for KMKP loans. Unlike the INVESTASI program, loans under KIK
and KMKP do not carry any minimum self-financing requirement. Similarly, the
program regulations specify that the main collateral under KIK is the project



ANNEX 1
Page 9
to be financed and, should this value be considered insufficient, additional
collateral should not exceed 100 percent of the credit being sought. As of
February 29, 1976, over 60,000 loans had been approved under both schemes
for an amount exceeding Rp 65 billion (US$150 million), of which Rp 46
billion had been disbursed. Overall, both schemes have worked reasonably
well, and have provided a large number of small entrepreneurs with much
needed long-term funds. Difficulties experienced so far include the unfa-
miliarity of State commercial banks with term-financing operations (e.g.
collateral requirements exceed too often the program's guidelines), lengthy
loan processing periods, and the low level of the loan ceilings which dis-
qualifies a number of otherwise suitable projects.
18.       In 1972, the Government established P.T. Asuransi Kredit Indonesia
(ASKRINDO) to insure bank loans made to small businesses for up to 75% of the
total risk. This automatic insurance was to induce State banks to pursue
more vigorously their term lending to small scale enterprises. Automatic
insurance, of course, has its inherent drawbacks but so far there are no
signs that State banks have taken undue advantage of this facility. To date,
P.T. ASKRINDO's experience has been satisfactory and few defaults have occurred.
However, the KIK and KMKP programs are still fairly new and it is too early to
assess their record.
19.       As mentioned earlier, P.T. Bahana was set up to provide equity and
technical assistance to financially weak enterprises; it also engages in lend-
ing operations to a limited extent. Since most small enterprises fall into
this category, P.T. Bahana's operations have focused on this sector though
there are actually no size limitations which confine its lending to small
scale industry. As is the case for most new institutions in Indonesia, P.T.
Bahana has found it difficult to attract experienced personnel, especially in
the field of management assistance to small-scale industry; its lending activ-
ity has therefore been limited.
20.       BAPINDO began a small industry financing program of its own in
1973, in collaboration with selected regional development banks. Under the
initial agreement, BAPINDO would extend a line of credit to these banks with
the understanding that it would serve to finance 80 percent of the amount
approved for each individual sub-loan, the RDB financing the balance out of
its own resources. This system was modified in 1974, following the introduc-
tion of the KIK and KMKP programs. Under both programs, the RDB's financing
share is now fixed at 10%, with the amount non-refinanceable with Bank Indo-
nesia coming out of BAPINDO's own resources (i.e. 20 percent and 10% for KMKP
and KIK respectively). BAPINDO also provides technical assistance to the
RDBs in the form of organizational upgrading programs and staff training.
As of December 31, 1976, fourteen RDBs (out of a total number of 26) had been
selected by BAPINDO and had entered into co-financing agreements. Cumulative
approvals granted by these participating RDBs under both the KIK and KMKP
programs amounted to Rp 8.8 billion (US$21.2 million) for about 3,600 proj-
ects, i.e., an average sub-loan size of around Rp 2.4 million (US$5,000)
equivalent).



ANNEX 1
Page 10
21.       Interest Rates.  Interest rates applied by the State banks are set
by Bank Indonesia. Because of the importance of the State Banks in the
financial system, their rates in turn determine the general level of interest
rates in the economy, though private banks are free to set their own rates.
Lending rates applied by State banks range from 12% for INVESTASI loans
below Rp 100 million and for special short-term agricultural credits, to 24%
for general loans, with a standard lending rate of 15% p.a. for term loans
above Rp 100 million. Lending rates charged by private banks are slightly
higher and, if loans are financed from foreign exchange sources, they usually
carry a floating rate plus a fixed margin with the exchange risk being assumed
by the borrower. In January 1977, deposit rates were slightly reduced by the
Government and now range from 6% to 18% p.a., depending on the duration thus
reducing the discrepancy between deposit rates and lending rates applied by
the banking system. This represented an important step in the right direction.
The Government continues to keep the interest rate structure under review,
and the Bank intends to join the Government in discussing this matter in the
near future.
22.       Compared with deposit rates, particularly those for 18- and 24-
month time deposits with State banks, term lending rates in Indonesia are low.
This interest rate structure does not unduly affect the State banks finan-
cially, as (i) they receive direct interest rate subsidies from Bank Indonesia
for time deposits, and (ii) a substantial portion of their lending is refi-
nanced by Bank Indonesia at low rates (4% to 10%). This rate structure,
however, does affect the profitability for private domestic banks and their
ability to compete with State banks for long-term deposits, since they are
not eligible for interest rate subsidies. The high deposit rates act also
as a disincentive for project sponsors to contribute a larger share of equity
funds, since it is more profitable to place excess funds in deposit accounts
and borrow as much as possible.
23.       The convertibility of the rupiah also exerts some influence on the
domestic interest rate structure. Bank lending rates (other than those
applied by State banks) have remained relatively low in part because of the
proximity of the Singapore and Hong Kong financial markets which are willing
to lend, at least to the better established companies, at rates about 2 or 3
percentage points above the Asian dollar market rates. This in practice gave
an interest rate which over the past few years has been lower than the 15%
rate applied by the State banks on their industrial loans (the exchange risk,
however, was borne by the borrower). In general, Indoesian companies have
been willing to accept the foreign exchange risk either because this was the
only way to obtain funds directly, or because the risk was perceived as not
being too great in light of the stability of the rupiah. In previous borrow-
ings from the World Bank for BAPINDO and PDFCI, the Government has insisted
on assuming the foreign exchange risk on the grounds that the Indonesian
rupiah was a relatively stable currency and because most domestic enterprises
were not sophisticated enough to appreciate the complexities of multiple
exchange rates. The free convertibility of the rupiah was also one of the
reasons why the Government did not raise term lending rates during the recent
perid of very high inflation since it was feared that this would hurt the



ANNEX 1
Page 11
smaller and financially weaker enterprises (mainly indigenous) which are
unable to obtain foreign exchange loans on their own, while larger and
stronger companies (usually non-indigenous joint ventures) would still be
able to borrow from financial markets abroad. As stated in para 2 above,
the rate of inflation which stood at 40% in 1974, declined to 19% in 1975 and
around 15% in 1976. With the Government's policy of curbing the expansion of
total liquidity to about 20% in 1977/78, the inflation rate is projected to
average around 10% over the 1977-1980 period. If this materializes, the 15%
standard rate for medium and long-term credits (Appendix 1) would represent a
substantial positive real rate of around 5%.

Institutional Aspects of BAPINDO
A. Organization, Management and Staff
1.        The Act - In 1974, the Bank, the Government and Bapindo reached
an understanding that the BAPINDO Act should be amended to reflect two key
requirements: (a) an increase in the authorized capital from Rp 60 million
to Rp 50 billion; and (b) the delegation of the authority of the Minister
of Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia, within BAPINDO's Super-
visory Board, to qualified representatives who could devote more time
to overseeing BAPINDO's operations. Both provisions were implemented,
in February 1975, by Gbvernment regulations. A third undertaking by
Government, namely that to explore the possibility of appointing three
additional members (representing the public) to the Supervisory Board
with a view to enlarging the Board's representativeness and enhancing
its effectiveness, is still under consideration by the Government.
This matter, however, is not pressing at this time, in view of the
fact that the Supervisory Board, as presently constituted, is functioning
satisfactorily ( para 2 below).
2.        Supervisory Board - The BAPINDO Act designates the Minister of
Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia as the two members of the
Supervisory Board. Their preoccupation with state business, in the past,
has prevented them from effectively supervising and guiding BAPINDO's
operations. The Bank therefore suggested, and the Government agreed,
that the abovementioned officials delegate their authority within the
Supervisory Board to qualified alternates who would have more time to
oversee BAPINDO's business. These alternates, appointed in February
1975, are Dr. Julianto Moeliodihardjo, Director General, Ministry of
Finance, and Mr. Soeksmono Martokoesomo, Managing Director, Bank Indonesia.
Following their appointment, the Supervisory Board, which now meets usually
once a month, has been providing BAPINDO with active guidance and effective
supervision.
3.        Board of Managing Directors - With one exception, there has been
no change in the composition of the Board of Managing Directors since the
last Bank appraisal. Mr. Samadikun, who for the past 5 years was head of
the Maritime Credit Department, was recently appointed to the Board of
another State Bank. The decision on his successor has not yet been
announced, Except for one Board member promoted from within, Dr. Priasmoro,
all other members including the President, Mr. Kuntoadji, were new to
development banking when they were appointed. Since then, they have
gained considerable experience and correspondingly reduced their reliance
on the expatriate advisors. Mr. Kuntoadji continues to provide BAPINDO
with capable leadership. In December 1975, upon expiration of his initial
term, he was reappointed for another five-year term.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        Advisors - Of the four development banking expatriate advisors
who joined BAPINDO in 1971 and early 1972, only Mr. Ronald Elms remains.
Upon expiration of his term in mid-1976, BAPINDO requested and obtained
a one-year extension of his contract. The three others had left between
May and December 1974, upon expiration of their contracts. The develop-
ment banking advisors collectively have significantly contributed to
BAPINDO's institutional progress and staff training. The term of the
two shipping advisors, who joined BAPINDO in late 1972, expired in
October 1976. In view of its continued need for technical assistance
in the shipping field, BAPINDO has requested and obtained a one-year
extension of their contracts. During negotiations of the proposed loan
BAPINDO requested and the Bank agreed that a small portion of the loan
(US$240,000) be set aside for BAPINDO to employ outside experts to
provide it with general development banking, economic and market analysis
expertise.
5.        Staff - BAPINDO, which faced a problem of surplus staff until
the early 1970's, reduced the size of its staff by 40% during 1972-1973.
Following this reduction, which occurred mainly at the junior and clerical
levels, the staff has remained fairly stable and as of June 30, 1976
totalled 794, of whom about 48% are classified as professionals. Prima
facie, the size of BAPINDO's existing staff is still too large in relation
to the volume of business transacted. The amount-of loan approvals for
each professional staff member for BAPINDO was about $0.3 million in 1975,
among the lower of the 11 DFC's in East Asia for which comparative data
are available. The number of loan approvals for each professional staff
member, about 0.3 to 1 for BAPINDO in 1975, was the lowest among the same
group of DFCs. The large size of BAPINDO's staff is also reflected in
an unusually high ratio (3.8% in 1976) of administrative expenses (para 5
of Annex 6) in relation to total assets. There is also staff misallocation,
reflected in staff shortages in some critical operational units, particularly
the appraisal and supervision staff (para 10 below), on the one hand, and
surplus staff in other units, especially some branch offices (para 8 below),
on the other hand. The organization also appears somewhat top-heavy as
there are 33 directors and deputies, for 32 division heads.
6.        There has been a considerable improvement in staff quality, owing
to the above-mentioned staff reduction (which cut into the dead wood), the
resumption of term lending activity in early 1972 and training, both on-the-
job by the expatriate advisors, and through more formal training programs
in house and abroad. While BAPINDO offers its staff a large variety of
training courses in banking operations, communications and management
development (in 1976 there were altogether 60 courses or seminars attended
by 323 employees from the level of junior officers to managing directors),
these courses do not seem to be systematically coordinated and BAPINDO
does not appear to have formulated a comprehensive training and career
development program. Although BAPINDO has a nucleus of competent and
dedicated staff at every level of the organization, staff training should
continue to receive top priority from BAPINDO's management as the quality
of staff at present is still uneven.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
7.        Cirganization Structure - BAPINDO's organization is shown in
Appendix 2.  There are 16 departments at the head office.  These have
been grouped according to broad functions, with each group (except for
the Secretariat and Audit Inspection Department) reporting to one of the
four managing directors. There have been no changes in the organizational
structure since the first Bank loan apart from the transfer of the super-
vision function for problem loans from the Project Promotion Department
to the Credit and Follow-up Department. Appraisals of industrial loans
are handled by the Credit and Follow-up Department (after screening and
preliminary appraisal by the branch offices) with the assistance of the
Engineering and Legal Departments. The appraisal teams are also involved
in supervision work as they follow the projects through completion of
construction before handing over the loans to the Follow-up Division.
Maritime loans are handled by the Maritime Department which also does
its own follow-up work. Supervision work involves several departments
including branch offices (for loan administration), the Follow-up Depart-
ment (for periodic review and nursing of problem clients), Engineering
and Credit Department (for preparation of rehabilitation plans), Legal
Department (for documentation) and Collection Department (for loans that
have been written off). In order to further enhance BAPINDO's overall
institutional efficiency, BAPINDO's management has commissioned a well-
known firm of management consultants, Bancom Corporation of the Philip-
pines to carry out a comprehensive organizational study. The consultant's
work is still under way.
8.        Branch Offices - In 1972, as part of the agreed reorganization
program (para 3.03), BAPINDO reduced the scope of its branch network,
which numbered 20 branches at the time, by closing two of them and down-
grading eight others to the status of representative offices. The present
network comprises ten branches and eight representative offices. While
the geographic configuration of Indonesia in itself justifies a relatively
large branch network, BAPINDO's present set-up warrants further review as
staff size in some branches does not seem to relate to the actual volume
of work (for instance one branch with 20 employees had 5 industrial clients
under supervision while another branch with 25 clients under its jurisdiction
had to operate with a total of 24 employees). In addition, there is unclear
demarcation of functions and unnecessary duplication of work between head-
quarters and the branch offices particularly in project appraisal and
follow-up, which often leads to delays in loan processing (para 10 below)
and difficulties in communications between branches and head offices.
B. Policies and Procedures
9.        Policy Statement - In November 1975, BAPINDO's Supervisory Board,
with the concurrence of the Bank, approved an amendment to its Policy State-
ment (Appendix 1) replacing the previous provision limiting BAPINDO's total
debt/equity ratio to 3:1, with a less restrictive provision which limits



ANNEX 2
Page 4
its long-term debt/equity ratio to 3:1. This amendment is in line with
the present contractual debt limitation under the latest Bank loan agree-
ment. Both the long-term debt/equity ratio and the total debt/equity ratio
at present are well below the 3:1 limit (para 2 of Annex 6).
10.       Appraisal - At present, the bulk of the appraisal work at head
office is done by twelve appraisal teams totaling 29 officers and 19 assist-
ants who in addition undertake also a share of projects supervision work
(para 7 above). This number is extraordinarily small in relation to total
professional staff (386) for a term lending institution and is partly
responsible for the slowness of appraisal work, since too many appraisals
have to be handled by one team. As to the quality of appraisal, substantial
improvements in the standards of BAPINDO's appraisal since 1972 notwithstand-
ing, there is room for further improvement in many areas, especially in the
economic and marketing evaluation of projects. Moreover, inaccurate assump-
tions on construction schedules and financing plans have often resulted in
under-capitalization and insufficient working capital for projects, which
is one of the reasons for the high level of arrears (see para 7 of Annex 6).
The quality of appraisal reports is uneven, which indicates the need for
more effective quality control at the senior level. A major weakness in
BAPINDO's appraisal work is its slowness. A sample examination indicates
that an average of 360 days (140 at the branch offices and 220 at the head
office) was required for loan processing from the time of loan application
to approval (i.e. exclusive of time spent on implementation steps such as
preparation of loan documentation, etc.). Even allowing for reasons beyond
BAPINDO's control (e.g. poor project formulation by clients, lack of adequate
statistical data, complexity of investment laws and regulations in Indonesia),
this is excessive. BAPINDO's management realizes this problem and, as a
start, has recently introduced some mechanical appraisal techniques
(computerized forecast models), Other actions likely to speed up the
appraisal work include faster transfer of loan applications from the branches
(which often lack the necessary skills) to the head office; better coordi-
nation of work among the appraisal team members; transfer of the supervision
function from the appraisal staff to the supervision staff at the time the
loan has been approved, instead of after completion of construction as at
present (para 7 above) which would enable the existing appraisal staff to
devote more manpower to appraisal work; and finally the gradual improvement
of appraisal capabilities, including the provision of better support services
(research, economic and marketing data).
11.       Follow-up - In view of the growing size of its portfolio and the
high level of arrears (para 5.07), BAPINDO's management has recently endeavored
to tighten up considerably its follow-up work. A separate unit (in the form
of a division within the Credit Department) specifically for supervision was
set up at the head office in 1974 and is headed by a staff member who underwent
relevant training abroad (with PDCP in the Philippines). A Follow-up Manual
has recently been put into application.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
BAPINDO's management has also initiated a study on the causes of high
arrears in the portfolio, which is expected to be completed early in
1977. Such a study, by shedding light on the underlying reasons for
BAPINDO's unsatisfactory arrears situation and for the poor repayment
performance of its clients, can provide a valuable basis for future
improvements. As with its appraisal work, BAPINDO is short of follow-
up staff at head office, which numbered 10 at the end of 1976. In view
of the need for intensive supervision of many clients and the recent
loss of well qualified personnel to the Branches, the need to further
buildup and strengthen the quality of its follow-up staff whould remain
of highest concern to BAPINDO's management.
12.         Procurement and Disbursements - BAPINDO's procurement and
disbursements procedures are satisfactory. No formal competitive bidding
is required by BAPINDO, but the engineers in the appraisal teams closely
review the adequacy of the proposed machinery as well as its estimated
cost. Quotations from several suppliers are normally requested. Loan
disbursements for imported items are made after checking appropriate
documents, including suppliers' invoices and bills of lading. Loan
disbursements for local expenditures are made on the basis of physical
inspection and verification of documents supporting expenditures. There
have been no major problems with disbursements under the existing World
Bank Group loans.
13.       Overall Operational Capabilities - Substantial improvements,
in relation to the pre-1972 situation, are noticeable in most aspects of
BAPINDO's internal operation, specifically in appraisal and follow-up
work. A new internal control and accounting system, devised by SGV-Utomo
and introduced in late 1974, has also improved BAPINDO's bookkeeping,
accounting and internal flow of information. There is, however, scope
for further, gradual improvement in the specific areas outlined in the
preceding paragraphs. To that end, BAPINDO's management has commissioned
a firm of outside consultants to carry out the organizational study referred
to in para 7 above. Present shortcomings notwithstanding, BAPINDO has
succeeded in building up its basic organizational strength, and most
importantly, a nucleus of qualified and dedicated staff at every level
of its organization. This should enable it to achieve significant
institutional improvements in the years ahead.

5. Relationship with Enterprise
a)  BAPIND) shall not have a controlling interest
in an enterprise which would result in giving
it primary/single responsibility for manage-
ment of the enterprise. Therefore, it will not
normally participate in more than 25% of the
share capital of any single enterprise.
b) To safeguard BAPINDO's interests and/or the
interests of the economy, in case of jeopardy
and notwithstanding 5 a) above, BAPINDO will
take effective measures for providing adequate
supervision and guidance for the enterprise.
It may seek representation on the managing body
of the enterprise concerned.
c) It is recognized that as a result of its under-
writing of share issues of enterprises BAPINDO
may hold issued share capital of an enterprise
in a ratio greater than that as mentioned in a)
above. In such cases, BAPINDO will dispose of
the excess portion of the share capital as soon
as possible following the guidelines of 6 below.
6. Portfolio Management
a) BAPINDO will conduct its operations in such a
manner as to assist in the growth of a sound
capital market in Indonesia.
b) BAPINDO will endeavor to diversify the holding
of securities in its portfolio, and to revolve
the contents of its portfolio whenever possible
on satisfactory terms.
c)  In revolving its portfolio, BAPINDO will pay due
regard not only to its own interests, but also
to market conditions, and to the interests of
other holders of the securities and of the
enterprise concerned.
7. Risks and Profitability
a) Although BAPINDO's decisions to give financial
assistance will be based upon its judgement of
the overall prospective profitability of the
enterprise, BAPINDO will obtain and secure in
accordance with sound business practice, adequate
security for the financial assistance it provides.



ANiiNEX 2
Appendix 1
Page 4
b) BAPINDO will not carry the foreign exchange
risk attendant upon its borrowing and lending
activities. The risk will be passed on to
its clients or covered by other suitable means.
c)  In order to finance its activities BAPINDO will
endeavor to acquire sufficient funds of a stable
nature, on as reasonable terms as possible, to
be able to give financial assistance to its
clients on terms which will allow a healthy
growth in the economy.
d)  In carrying out its activities, BAPINDO will
adopt level of charges which will allow it a
satisfactory return, after meeting all expenses,
including the necessary provisions. This should
also allow BAPINDO to build and maintan reserves
consistent with sound financial practice and
adequate legal reserves for strengthening its
equity.
8. Organization and Staff
BAPINDO will rapidly build an effective organization and develop
an adequate well-trained staff in the fields of financial, marketing, economic,
engineering, accounting and legal services in order to discharge effectively
its duties and to enable it to assist its clients in the formulation and
implementation of their projects.
9. Revision of Policies
This Policy Statement will be amended when necessary to secure
BAPINDO's successful operations, and to give flexibility in its activities.
10. Transitional Policies

gradually with as little disruption as possible to either BAPINDO or its
clients.

Characteristics of BAPINDO's Operations
1.        Overall Operations-- After being allowed by the Government to
resume term financing in 1972, BAPINDO expanded its operations rapidly,
with approvals of term loans (for both the industrial and shipping sectors)
increasing by 52% to Rp 25.8 billion in 1974 (from Rp 17.0 billion in 1973)
and by another 64% to Rp 42.4 billion in 1975. Approvals for 1976 grew somewhat
less (by 17% to Rp 49.4 billion), mainly because of a drop in maritime loan
approvals. Since 1972, BAPINDO's shipping financing has increased proportion-
ately more rapidly than its industrial financing. BAPINDO began to expand
its equity investment activity in 1974, although its equity investments at
present (Rp 1.8 billion outstanding in 9 companies)are still small in relation
to its total loan portfolio. BAPINDO's financing of small business through
the regional development banks (RDBs) has also increased considerably in the
past few years. On the other hand, short-term financing of raw cotton imports
declined sharply in 1974 and stopped in 1975 (when no new approvals were made)
in keeping with a previous understanding (in 1972) between the Bank and the
Government that BAPINDO would gradually reduce its commercial banking activities
and concentrate on its primary function, namely development financing. The
main features of BAPINDO's recent financing are analyzed in the following
paragraphs. A summary of operations for 1972 - 1976 is shown in Appendix 2.
2.        Industrial Loans - Appendix 3 gives the characteristics of BAPINDO's
industrial loans for the years 1973 - 1976. Approvals of industrial loans in
1975 totalled Rp 27.7 billion for 80 projects, an increase (by amount) of 17%
over 1974. In 1976, BAPINDO approved 87 industrial loans of Rp 40.5 billion,
an increase of 46%. There has been a noticeable improvement in the sectoral
diversification of BAPINDO's industrial financing, with the share of lending
to textiles (the traditional sector) declining from 55% of total industrial
lending in 1973 to 29% in 1974, 13% in 1975 and further to 11% during the first
half of 1976. As a result, the inter-industry distribution of BAPINDO's
industrial loan portfolio is now satisfactory, with textiles accounting for
24% of the total; metal works 19%; cement, ceramics and glass 16%; pulp,
paper and printing 16%; chemicals 9%; with the balance of 21% going to
miscellaneous industries (light industries, pharmaceuticals, hotels, rubber,
etc.). As a matter of deliberate policy, BAPINDO has begun to set longer
loan maturities (averaging 8.1 years for investment loans in 1975, versus 6.4
years in 1974), which is a welcome development given that its previous practice
until 1973 (imposed by Bank Indonesia) of limiting loan maturities to a
maximum of 5 years was partly responsible for the high rate of arrears in
its portfolio. This five-year limit on maturities of loans by other state
commercial banks, however, has caused BAPINDO some problems since the Govern-
ment has recently decided that all investment loans, to be refinanced by Bank
Indonesia under the INVESTASI scheme (see Annex 1, para 15), above Rp 300
million (US$725,000) have to be offered to other state banks for consortium
financing. Since state banks are not allowed to grant maturities exceeding



ANNEX 3
Page 2
five years, BAPINDO has to take the later maturities in such consortium
financing operations. BAPINDO's financing remains heavily concentrated
in the island of Java, which accounts for 85% of its cumulative industrial
lending for 1972 - first half of 1976. This geographical concentration,
however, is not out of line with Java's share (78%) of the country's
industrial investment.
3.        Number and Size of Projects Assisted.  A notable feature of BAPINDO's
recent industrial financing has been a sharp trend toward larger and fewer
loans. While approvals of industrial loans increased from Rp 13.4 billion in
1973 to Rp 23.5 billion in 1974 and Rp 27.7 billion in 1975, the number of
these loans declined steadily from 133 in 1973 to 85 in 1974 to 80 in 1975.
The number of investment (i.e., equipment, as opposed to working capital)
loans in particular declined from 73 in 1973 to 49 in 1974 to 37 in 1975, as
the average size of these loans went up from Rp 140 million in 1973 to Rp 380
million in 1974 to Rp 618 million in 1975. This trend continued during 1976
when the average loan size for approved projects increased to Rp 825 million
(US$2.0 million). The sharp rise in the average size of industrial loans
is attributable mainly to BAPINDO's financing of Government-sponsored projects,
which in 1975 accounted for 68% (by amount) of BAPINDO's commitments (Rp 16.8
billion out of Rp 24.7 billion) but only for 17% (12 out of 70) by number.
It is entirely justified for BAPINDO to finance large industrial projects
undertaken by either the public or private sector (if these projects are
otherwise sound), especially since BAPINDO alone among the six state banks
has the responsibility for providing term finance to the industrial sector
and is best able to appraise projects for long-term financing. On the other
hand, BAPINDO, which is intended to be the predominant industrial financing
institution in the country, should also emphasize its assistance to medium-sized,
private sector industrial projects, particularly since neither PDFCI nor IDFC
at present has adequate financial or staff resources significantly to assist
this category of industry. The above-mentioned figures and ratios suggest
clearly that BAPINDO's financing since 1973 has been increasingly skewed
toward large projects undertaken by state enterprises.
4.        Maritime Lending - Appendix 4 gives the characteristics of BAPINDO's
maritime loans for the years 1973 - first half of 1976. After BAPINDO was
designated by the Government to handle credits for the shipping sector, its
maritime operations quickly gained momentum. A Maritime Credit Department
was set up in 1972, operating under one of the four managing directors.
BAPINDO's maritime loans fall into two main categories: (a) those for financing
the rehabilitation of the existing inter-island Regular Liner Service (RLS)
out of IDA Credit No. 318-IND (US$7 million)l/ and (b) those for other shipping
and related activities such as dockyards, lighterage, ocean-going vessels, etc.
which are financed by funds obtained by BAPINDO from other sources. From a
very low base (Rp 64 million) in 1972, commitments for maritime loans increased
to Rp 2.2 billion in 1973, Rp 3.4 billion in 1974, Rp 10.1 billion in 1975
and Rp 11.0 billion in 1976. As of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO's outstanding
maritime portfolio stood at Rp 18.4 billion, (equivalent to about 38% of its
1/ Not inclusive of a US$1.5 million amount for technical assistance.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
outstanding industrial portfolio). As of December 31, 1976, the uncommitted
balance of IDA Credit No. 318-IND was about US$1.3 million. BAPINDO envisages
financing RLS projects when the above-mentioned IDA Credit has been fully
committed, with its other foreign currency resources, including the DFC-type
lines of credits obtained from the Bank. However, the demand for BAPINDO's
financing of RLS projects is likely to be limited in future in view of the
recent creation by the Government of a specialized institution to finance this
activity, P.T. PANN, in which BAPINDO holds a 40% share ownership and to which
BAPINDO currently is providing consultancy services. (In May 1976, the Bank
approved a US$54 million loan for financing RLS projects through P.T. PANN).
Raw Cotton Financing
5.        In 1972, the Government and BAPINDO agreed with the Bank that
BAPINDO's raw cotton lending would be phased out, and that BAPINDO would
concentrate on its primary business, namely term financing. In keeping
with this undertaking, the Government decided in mid-1973 to divide the
raw cotton business between the Bank Ekspor-Impor and BAPINDO on a 50-50
basis, and reflecting this decision, approvals of raw cotton loans by
BAPINDO in 1974 declined considerably to Rp 16.4 billion from Rp 38.5 billion
in 1973. In 1975, the raw cotton business was entirely transferred to Bank
Ekspor-Impor with BAPINDO, however, retaining its outstanding portfolio.
Outstanding portfolio of raw cotton loans declined from Rp 43.3 billion as of
year-end 1974 to Rp 25.0 billion as of December 31, 1976. BAPINDO's raw
cotton portfolio is expected to be liquidated by 1978.
Equity Financing
6.        Except for a small investment (Rp 25 million) approved in 1972,
BAPINDO's equity investment operations started in mid-1974. Appendix 5
summarizes BAPINDO's equity financing as of December 31, 1976. As of that
date, BAPINDO had committed a total of Rp 1,783 million in nine companies.
Of this amount, P.T. PANN, the Government-owned shipping company
accounts for Rp 800 million or about one-half. BAPINDO's equity investments
in six privately owned companies (all unlisted on the stock exchange) were
made in combination with term loans, because the equity base of these
companies was too small to enable BAPINDO to give them larger loans. In
four of the nine companies, BAPINDO's shareholding ranges from 40% to 81%
of their respective share capital, as against a stipulation in its policy
statement that "BAPINDO will normally participate in not more than 25% of the
share capital of any single enterprise." As long as this 25% limit (which
reflects normal financial prudence) remains on its policy statement, BAPINDO
should exceed it, if at all, only for a few exceptional cases and after due
deliberation. Alternatively, BAPINDO may consider reviewing the appropriate-
ness of the existing policy statement limitation if it has grounds for believing
that it is unduly restrictive. (An amendment to the policy statement requires
the Bank's consent by virtue of the loan agreement).



ANNEX 3
Page 4
7.        In late 1975, Bank Indonesia set up a Participation Fund, whose
business is to make share investments in foreign joint ventures. BAPINDO
was appointed to manage the Fund (which is wholly-owned by Bank Indonesia),
without financial liability, and with an annual management fee of 0.5% of
the amount of the year-end outstanding portfolio. To date, no transaction
has occurred, and it is difficult to assess the operational/financial prospects
of the Fund.
Co-Financing of Small Business with RDBs
8.        BAPINDO introduced this scheme in 1973.  Under the present arrange-
ments, a participating RDB, "approved" by BAPINDO following an appraisal, is
given a line of credit by BAPINDO to finance small business projects (industry,
agriculture, trade and services are activities eligible for financing). Bank.
Indonesia in turn refinances the loans made by BAPINDO/RDBs under the recently
set up KIK program 1/ (for fixed investment) in the following proportions:
80% by Bank Indonesia, 10% by BAPINDO and 10% by the RDB; and under the
KMKP 1/ (for working capital) as follows: 70% by Bank Indonesia, 20% by
BAPINDO and 10% by the RDB. A limit of Rp 5 million (US$12,000 equivalent)
is set on individual loans. Interest rates applied by RDBs to sub-loans
are 12% for investment (fixed assets) loans and 15% for working capital
loans, with BAPINDO charging the RDBs 6% and 10%, and Bank Indonesia charging
BAPINDO 4% and 8% respectively. The full financial risk on loans is insured
by ASKRINDO, the state-owned credit insurance institution, which charges a
one-time fee of 3% borne evenly by Bank Indonesia and BAPINDO. Apart from
channelling funds to the RDBs, BAPINDO also provides them with technical
assistance, including staff training.
9.        Since its introduction, the program has expanded rapidly.  As
of December 31, 1976, it involved 14 RDBs (out of a total of 26 operating in
the country). Cumulative loans approved by BAPINDO for small entrepreneurs
amounted to Rp 8.8 billion for over 3,600 projects, or an average loan size
of Rp 2.4 million (US$5,000 equivalent). The regional distribution of
financing is broadening as the number of participating RDBs increases
(Appendix 6). As indicated in its operational projections, BAPINDO expects
its small business co-financing to continue expanding rapidly over the next
few years and ultimately to involve most of the existing RDBs. BAPINDO
also envisages broadening somewhat the scope of its co-financing by extending
it to selected projects requiring loans from RDBs in excess of the present
Rp 5 million limit.
10.       BAPINDO's co-financing with RDBs serves a useful economic purpose,
and represents an innovative contribution by BAPINDO to the small business
sector in Indonesia. BAPINDO's management intends to further enhance this
contribution through a systematic effort by BAPINDO to help upgrade the
operational capability of the participating RDBs (especially regarding project
appraisal and follow-up work) and to monitor the performance of projects
financed.

BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA
BAPINDO'S Developmental Impact
1.        Share of Investment.  It is difficult to assess with precision
BAPINDO's share in industrial investment in Tndonesia, because of the lack
of reliable country data on this subject. Some available partial data in-
dicate, however, that BAPINDO has become an important, though by no means
preponderant, source of term finance for industry. Under the INVESTASI
program, for instance, BAPINDO's share of total outstanding credits to
the manufacturing sector has increased steadily from 18.1% at year-end
1973 to 22.0% in 1974 to 31.3% in 1975. The volume of BAPINDO's approvals
for industrial term loans in 1975 (Rp 27.7 billion) was equivalent to
about 15% of the amount of domestic industrial investment approved by the
Investment Coordinating Board (ICB) during that year. BAPINDO's share in
investment in the maritime sector is estimated to be substantially higher
than its share in industrial investment. BAPINDO's disbursements for both
industrial and maritime loans (for equipment and other fixed assets finan-
cing) in 1975, Rp 20 billion, accounted for about 5.7% of the country's
total industrial investment (including the maritime sector) estimated at
around Rp 350 billion during that year.
2.        Economic Benefits of Projects.  It is even more difficult to
assess the economic efficiency and/or benefits of BAPINDO- financed pro-
jects, since (except for two projects in 1975) BAPINDO so far has not in-
cluded the calculation of the economic rates of return in its appraisal
work, and even partial economic indicators were not systematically given
and analyzed in BAPINDO's appraisal reports. Data on the 28 "A" projects
financed by BAPINDO with Bank funds (Appendix 1), however, indicate that
these projects are estimated to generate a total investment of Rp 95.4
billion (including BAPINDO's financing of Rp 30.5 billion or 32.0% of the
total cost of projects). These projects are, in general, highly capital
intensive, with an average cost of fixed investment per worker of about
US$77,000. However, excluding the seven very large Government projects,
with a fixed investment cost of Rp 73.1 billion for an additional employ-
ment of 658, the average cost per job would amount to US$14,600, reflecting
the capital-intensiveness of industrial investments taking place in Indonesia
in recent years. Most of BAPINDO's projects are oriented toward the domestic
market. Of the 19 manufacturing projects covered in the above-mentioned
sample (i.e. excluding 5 maritime projects and 4 hotels) 5 are export-
oriented, with their annual gross exports estimated at Rp 3.6 billion
(US$86 million) or 6% of the total incremental sales of these 19 projects.
This also reflects the low degree of export-orientation of the Indonesian
manufacturing sector at present. Ex-ante financial rates of return
(FRRs) calculated by BAPINDO for 8 of the 28 projects range from 12% to
28%. Economic rates of return (ERRs), available for only 2 projects
(pulp and paper) were estimated at 13% and 12%, compared with FRRs of 21%

and 20% respectively. Considering that many of the projects financed by
BAPINDO are either based on domestic raw materials (glass, cement), cheap
labor (printing, textiles) or basic demands (hotels, marine transportation),
it appears that BAPINDO's investment decisions are leading to the establish-
ment of economically worthwhile projects.
3.        Promotional Work.  Within the Government system, the promotion of
industry is primarily the responsibility of the Investment Coordinating
Board (ICB). ICB, however, being a regulatory agency, confines its pro-
motional role generally to the granting of investment incentives to in-
dustrial projects approved by it. BAPINDO, on the other hand, plays a
rather passive role as financier. While recognizing that BAPINDO has been
carrying out useful promotional work, particularly with respect to its
support of RDBs, BAPINDO's management agreed, during discussions with the
Bank, on the desirability of BAPINDO's getting involved much more actively
in business identification and project promotion of medium sized projects.
To that end, it would be appropriate for BAPINDO to reorient its Promotion
Department which would, inter alia, identify business opportunities, promote
new enterprises, seek out entrepreneurs, undertake feasibility studies for
specific industrial activities, etc. The need for more active promotional
work by BAPINDO is suggested, among other things, by the declining number
of industrial projects (particularly those from the private sector) assisted
by BAPINDO in the past three years (para 3 of Annex 3).
4.        Future Development Strategy.  As the major financial institution
in the industrial sector in the country, BAPINDO is intended not just to be
a channel for funds for industry, but to make an important developmental
contribution to this sector. Having by and large succeeded in developing
its basic organizational strength, it is now time for BAPINDO to broaden
its economic role and enhance its developmental impact. To enable it to
focus on its short-term developmental objectives as well as to mobilize
efforts for implementing them, BAPINDO has formulated a statement of
"Development Strategy" (reproduced in Appendix 2) outlining specific
objectives and activities (apart from its normal lending activity) on which
it intends to place special emphasis in the next two or three years, and
the proposed means for fulfilling them.

BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPINDO)
Statement of Development Strategy for 1977-1978
During the two-year period 1977-1978, BAPINDO will endeavor to
broaden its economic role and to enhance its developmental impact, particularly
in the specific areas outlined below.
Lending Policy
1.        BAPINDO will give due weight to the economic merits of projects in
taking investment decisions. For that purpose, BAPINDO will: (a) make more
systematic efforts at collecting and analyzing partial economic indicators
of projects (e.g., employment generation, value added, degree of effective
protection, foreign exchange earnings/savings, geographic dispersal, etc.)
in appraisal reports; and (b) undertake the calculation of the economic rates
of return for projects requiring BAPINDO's financing exceeding, say, US$1 million
equivalent.
2.        BAPINDO will seek to finance an increasing number of medium-sized
(i.e., those requiring BAPINDO's financing not exceeding US$1 million equivalent),
labor-incentive, investment projects undertaken by either the private or public
sector.
Project Promotion and Technical Assistance
3.        BAPINDO will get involved actively in identifying new business
opportunities, promoting projects, and seeking out and assisting new
entrepreneurs.
4.        For the purpose outlined in paragraph 3 above, the staff of the
Project Promotion Department will be adequately strengthened.
5.        BAPINDO intends to increase its technical assistance to clients,
with a view particularly to improving the formulation and design of their
projects and the organizational and managerial arrangements of their enterprises.
For this purpose, the appraisal staff will be appropriately expanded.
Industrial Studies and Policies
6.        BAPINDO intends to undertake studies on selected industrial activities,
including studies on wood, silica and cassava processing.
7.        BAPINDO will endeavor to contribute to Government policies concerning
industrial investment, through, among other things, close cooperation with the
Investment Coordinating Board.
8.        For the purpose outlined in paragraphs 6 and 7, the staff of the
Research Department will be strengthened. In addition, outside consultants and
experts will be used, as needed, to help BAPINDO's staff undertake industrial
studies.

Cooperation with Regional Development Banks (RDBs)
9.        In continuing its on-going program of co-financing small enterprises
with the RDBs, BAPINDO will put particular emphasis on assisting the RDBs
in upgrading their operational capability (e.g., appraisal and follow-up) and
on monitoring the performance of projects financed jointly by BAPINDO and the
RDBs.

BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDUONSIA
Program of Action
PART A
1.        BAPINDO will be relieved of the financial liability pertaining to
Government projects financed or to be financed by it at the Government's behest.
It will, however, continue to assume full financial liability for its invest-
ments in those state enterprises which it finances on its own initiative on the
basis of normal project evaluation and its usual lending criteria. The Govern-
ment will determine on a case-by-case basis whether a given project falls into the
former or latter category. The projects financed at the Government's behest are
defined as those which the Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS consider to be of
national importance and instruct BAPINDO to finance even though if such projects
do not meet the normal standards of BAPINDO. In its balance sheet, BAPINDO will
segregate these projects from BAPINDO's own portfolio and will show them in a
special account belonging to the Government and called "managed funds". For
such "managed projects", BAPINDO will assume no financial liability and will
receive a handling fee determined by the Government.
2.        The Government will make financial arrangements to enable all state
enterprises borrowing from BAPINDO to repay to BAPINDO their existing arrears
of principal and interest of over three months as at t-h. date of the Loan
Agreement of the proposed Bank Loan.
3.        The Government will compensate BAPIND  feor *ny losses on the out-
standing raw cotton loans made to P.N. INSAN and PINDA SANDANG amounting to
about Rp. 7.5 billion, including the principal and interest accrued. This
amount will be paid to BAPINDO in two installments, the first Rp 3.0 billion
prior to effectiveness of the proposed Loan, the balance by March 31, 1978.
4.        The Government will formulate and communicate to the Bank a specific
plan outlining steps for improving PUPN's operations with a view particularly to
accelerating the collection and/or foreclosure of BAPINDO's delinquent accounts
transferred to PUPN. One such step would be to require PUPN to take immediate
action on BAPINDO's delinquent accounts transferred by BAPINDO to PUPN without
waiting until the final maturity of these loans as has been the practice to date.
5.        BAPI'NDO will undertake a vigorous campaign, based on a comprehensive
program, to -deal with the continuing serious situation of arrears. This program
will include, inter alia: (i) setting annual collection targets for each branch
office or collection unit; (ii) monthly review by Board of Managing Directors
with relevant staff of portfolio situation (e.g. evaluation of arrears;
reschedulings; write-offs; steps taken or contemplated to deal with overdue
accounts; collection performance in relation to targets; status of delinquent
loans transferred to PUPN); (iii) monthly reporting by BAPINDO to the Board
of Supervision on the portfolio situation as detailed above; and (iv) raising
penalty rate on interest in arrears, on a selective basis, to the prevailing
level of time deposit rates.
6.        BAPINDO will submit to the Bank a satisfactory plan, if necessary
to be prepared with the help of an outside consultant, to gradually reduce
over the next few years its administrative costs in relation to total assets.
This plan would include inter alia reducing staff surplus by attrition over the
coming years and closing down some unnecessary branche offices.
Part A of the Program of Action will be implemented prior to effectiveness of the
proposed loan.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
PART B.
1.        BAPIXDO will entrust branch offices with greater responslbility
for follow-up work and delegate more authority to managers in selected
branch offices for making working capital loans up to a specified amount.
2.        BAPINDO will undertake a study (to be completed prior to
October 31, 1977) of the existing network of branch offices with a view
to (i) closing down uneconomical and unnecessary branches; (ii) opening
new branclhes where there is good potential for business development; and
(iii) relating staff size to business volume in each branch office.
3.        BAPINDO will expand the size of the appraisal and supervision
staff by about one-third during 1977 (from the end-1976 level) and by
another one-third during 1978, to the extent possible, by conversion of
its existing support staff into appraisal and supervision staff
4.        BAPINDO will strengthen the Project Promotion Department to
become more effectively involved in project identification, development
and promotion.
5.        BAPINDO will strengthen the Research Department by the appoint-
ment to the post of manager of an experienced economist, and the sub-
sequent assembling of a small group of qualified economists within the
Department, to enable it to undertake extensive economic and industrial
studies. In the initial period, BAPINDO will commission outside
consultants or experts, as needed, to help its staff undertake these
studies.
6.        BAPINDO will create a suitably staffed Market Analysis Unit
withlin the Research Department in order to substantially improve this
particular aspect of BAPINDO's appraisal work.
7.        In order to speed up appraisal, BAPINDO will formulate and
adopt (prior to June 30, 1977) an appropriate '"work flow chart" pre-
cribing a time limit for each stage of loan processing, in order to
complete the full processing cycle for an ordinary project within 150
days (from receipt of loan application to loan approval).
8.        In order to strengthen its appraisal work, BAPINDO will adopt
the following measures: (a) more systematic collection and analysis of
partial economic indicators of projects (e.g. employment generation, value
added, degree of protection, foreign exchange earnings/savings, geographical
dispersal); (b) introduction of a mechanism for comparing the economic/
financial costs and benefits of projects in operational stage with estimates
made during project appraisal; and (c) calculation of the economic rates
of return for projects requiring BAPINDO's financing of $1 rmiillion or more.
9*      It is the intention of the Government to provide BAPINDO with
adequate resources to sustain its financing activities. The Government
will explore for BAPINDO additional sources of foreign exchange other
than IBRD, such as ADB, KfW, and bilateral sources.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
10.       In view of the high level of arrears, BAPINDO (with the
Government's concurrence) will increase the total amount of provisions
for doubtful accounts to at least 5% of total outstanding portfolio by
the end of the 1977 fiscal year.
11.       BAPINDO will seek to finance an increasing number of medium-sized
investment projects (i.e. those requiring BAPINDO's financing not exceeding
$1 million) undertaken by either the public or private sector.
12.       BAPINDO will adopt a statement of "Development Strategy" out-
lining some specific developumental objectives/activities (in addition to
its normal lending activity) on which BAPINDO intends to place special
emphasis, for the two years 1977-78. This shall include studies on
selected industrial activities; increased technical assistance to clients
(for which further development in staff capacity would be necessary);
active project identification, development and promotion; increased
assistance to medium-sized labor intensive industries; input into Govern-
ment policies concerning industrial investments; and assistance to the
regional development banks in upgrading their operational capability and
monitoring the performance of projects financed jointly by BAPINDO and
these banks.
13.       The Government, BAPINDO and the Bank will consult with each other
on specific measures for implementing the above Program of Action, and BAPINDO
shall inform the Bank, on a quarterly basis, of progress, and problems encountered,
toward implementing the said Program.

Financial Position, Operational Performance and Quality of Portfolio
A.        Financial Position
1.        Summarized balance sheets for the period 1972 - 1976 are given in
Appendix 1. As of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO's total assets amounted to
Rp 124.9 billion (US$301.0 million). Over the fiye year period ending
December 31, 1976, total assets increased 3.2 times. The term loan portfolio
accounted for 60% of total assets, current assets for 38%, including 20% on
account of short-term raw cotton loans (see para  11   below), and the equity
investment portfolio for 2%. On the liability side, BAPINDO's capital structure
has been considerably strengthened in the past three years through additional
cash contributions by the Government to its paid-in share capital, of Rp 18.6
billion in 1974, Rp 4.5 billion in 1975 and Rp 10.3 billion during 1976.
BAPINDO's equity now finances 36% of total assets, long-term debt 31% and current
liabilities 33%. The latter include short-term Bank Indonesia loans for
raw cotton financing. Of its total long-term debt of Rp 38.5 billion, 33%
represented borrowings from IDA/IBRD, the remainder from the Government (2%),
Bank Indonesia (48%) and other state banks (17%).
2.        Apart from the continuing unsatisfactory condition of the portfolio
(paras 7-12 below) and the low level of provisions (para 3 below), BAPINDO's
financial condition is sound, with the long-term debt/equity ratio standing at
0.8:1 (as against a contractual limit of 3:1) as of December 31, 1976, the
total debt/equity ratio 1.7:1, the current ratio at 1.3:1, a debt service
coverage of 1.24 and the interest coverage ratio at 2.3 to 1.
3.        Provisions - Between 1972 and 1976, BAPINDO made substantial provisions
for doubtful accounts amounting to Rp 8.3 billion (US$20 million) or 10% of
the term portfolio outstanding at December 31, 1976. However, write-offs
during the same period were  as  high   (Rp 8.3 billion).  Thus at December 31,
1976, provisions for doubtful accounts, represented only 2.7% of the portfolio
including equity investments, raw cotton loans and accrued interest. 1/ In
view of the poor quality of BAPINDO's portfolio (see para 7-12  below) and the
past pattern of write-offs, existing provisions for doubtful accounts are
inadequate and should be further increased in relation to outstanding portfolio.
BAPINDO's management, as agreed during negotiations, intends to increase
these provisions to at least 5% of the outstanding portfolio by year-end 1977,
existing resources and available income permitting.
1/ Excluding raw cotton loans and corresponding accrued interest, provisions
stood at 3.7% of the portfolio.

B.        Financial Performance
4.        Appendix 2 presents BAPINDO's summarized income statements for
the periods 1972 - 1976. BAPINDO's profitability has been very low, with
net profits after taxes averaging only about 1.1% of average total assets
and 2.7% of average net worth between 1972 and 1976. The sharp increase in
gross income from Rp 4.3 billion in 1973 to Rp 6.9 billion in 1974 to Rp 9.2
billion in 1975 and Rp 9.7 billion in 1976, owing primarily to the expansion
of the outstanding loan portfolio (including raw cotton loans), has not been
followed by a concomitant rise in net income, which grew only moderately from
Rp 608 million in 1973 to Rp 918 million in 1974 to decline again to Rp 723
million in 1975 and Rp 260 million in 19761/ The expanded gross income was
absorbed largely by (a) administrative expenses which went up by 34% in 1974,
56% in 1975 and another 20% in 1976; (b) sizeable provisions for doubtful
accounts of Rp 2.3 billion in 1974, Rp 2.6 billion in 1975 and Rp 1.7 billion
in 1976 representing respectively 3.1%, 3.3% and 1.5% of year-end outstanding
portfolio; (c) a rise in the average cost of long-term debts 2/ resulting
in a reduction in the spread for long-term funds from 10.7% in 1973 to 3.9%
in 1976,   and,  (d) finally, a drop in income from raw cotton loans in 1976,
as BAPINDO stopped accruing interest on Bank Indonesia financed raw cotton
loans.
5.        The ratio of BAPINDO's administrative expenses to total assets,
3.8% for 1975 and 1976, (up from 3.4% in 1974) is unusually high. The ratio
for some other DFCs in Asia associated with the Bank Group that are broadly
comparable to BAPINDO (in terms of size, age, etc.) is generally much lower
(for example: 1.0 for KDB in Korea, 1.5 for DBP in the Philippines, 1.2 for
DBS in Singapore). BAPINDO's relatively high administrative cost is largely
attributable to its maintenance of an extensive branch network (para 8 of Annex
2), which in turn is partly responsible for the large size of its staff in
relation to total assets. For a public DFC such as BAPINDO, profitability per
se is not an essential objective. Nevertheless, the foregoing ratios suggest
the desirability of, and the possibility for, trying to keep the future growth
of BAPINDO's administrative cost to a rate lower than that of total assets.
C.        Condition of Portfolio
6.        The situation of arrears of BAPINDO's loan portfolio remains very
unsatisfactory. For the sake of clarity, it is analyzed in the following
paragraphs separately for industrial loans, maritime loans and raw cotton
loans. A tabular summary of the portfolio situation is given in Appendices
3 and 4.
1/ The drop in net income in 1976 was mainly caused by a substantial reduction
in income from raw cotton loans (from Rp 2.5 billion in 1975 to Rp 0.5
billion in 1976) as BAPINDO stopped, during 1976, accruing interest on
outstanding raw cotton loans to two Government textile mills for which
the Government agreed to settle existing arrears (see also para 4.18).
2/ From 5.5% in 1973 to 8.2% in 1976, as a result of increased draw-downs
of IDA credits and the Bank loan, as well as increased time deposits and
loans from State Banks, whose cost is substantially higher than that of
other official funds made available to BAPINDO. At the same time the
income from term loans fell in 1976 due to a higher share of Project Aid
Loans for which BAPINDO only receives a handling fee.



ANNEX 6

7.        Industrial Loan Portfolio.  In spite of some improvements in the
past four years, the situation of BAPINDO's portfolio remains unsatisfactory.
As of February 28, 1977, 46 clients out of 139 (or 33% by number) were in
arrears for over three months, total arrears of principal and interest
amounted to Rp 4.9 billion (US$11.8 million) or 10% of total loans outstanding.
Loans affected by arrears accounted for 42% of total loans outstanding.
For 1976, the collection rate 1/ was 50%. About 30% (Rp 14.8 billion) of
BAPINDO's portfolio are completed projects, about half of which were in arrears.
The majority 2/ of these projects in arrears are on account of loans made prior
to the 1971 reorganization when practically no appraisal was done, and some of
these are expected to have to be written-off. The remaining portion of the
portfolio, Rp 35.5 billion or 70% of loans outstanding, is on account of projects
under construction. An amount of Rp 13.4 billion of these loans (or 26%
of total portfolio) was in arrears, accounting for two-thirds of the affected
portfolio. The incidence of arrears of projects under construction is
usually caused by delays in the completion of projects (see para 12 below)
and does not necessarily reflect on the viability of the projects themselves.
In BAPINDO's own evaluation of its portfolio 7 clients with loans outstanding
totalling Rp 2.7 billion (5 % of total loans outstanding at February 28, 1977)
are considered bad, while 21 clients (Rp 4.8 billion or 10% of loans outstand-
ing) are problem project clients for which BAPINDO undertakes intensified
supervision.
8.        Despite this unsatisfactory picture, BAPINDO has been making some
progress since 1973 in reducing arrears, for instance, total arrears dropped
from Rp 7.1 billion in 1973 to Rp 4.0 billion in 1976, compared to a portfolio
increase from Rp 17.6 billion to Rp 48.1 billion (or from 40% of loans out-
standing to 8% 3/). During the same period the affected portfolio in
relation to outstanding portfolio, dropped from 53% to 37%. (At the end of
1975 the affected portfolio was even lower, 30%, but during 1976 several
large loans fell into arrears because of delays in project completion,
weighing heavily in the average). Also between 1973 and 1976 the loan collection
rate rose from 36% to 50%. The substantial improvements in the above overall
ratios, however, have to be viewed against the massive write-offs and
reschedulings taking place during the same period. Write-offs (of principal
and interest) between 1973 and 1976, all on account of BAPINDO's pre-1971
loans, amounted to Rp 7.0 billion or 37% of the outstanding term-loan
portfolio 4/plus accrued interest at the end of 1972. Reschedulings over
the last three years amounted to Rp 7.2 billion 5/ or 15% of outstanding
loans at December 31, 1976. Such reschedulings (made by BAPINDO following
adequate reappraisal) were by and large justified on project grounds either
1/ Collections as percent of arrears at the beginning of the year plus
billings for the year.
2/ At December 31, 1975 69% of arrears were on account of pre-1971 loans.
3/  If adjusted for write-offs this ratio would decrease from 44% to 22%.
4/ Amounting to 96% of industrial loans
5/  Total principal of loans outstanding (including principal in arrears
and principal not yet due).

because original repayment schedules were unrealistically short or construction
schedules considerably delayed, or market conditions had adversely changed,
or because of undercapitalization of client companies or the severe credit
squeeze in the past few years.
9.        While the above analysis shows that BAPINDO's portfolio, despite
some improvements, remains unsatisfactory, BAPINDO's supervision of its
portfolio has considerably improved. in particular, the creation of the
Follow-up Department has enabled BAPINDO to focus on its arrears situation
and to undertake a detailed account-by-account examination of the portfolio
(something which was not previously done) resulting in a much more adequate
knowledge of problem projects and specific remedial actions.
10.       Maritime Loans.  The present condition of BAPINDO's maritime loan
portfolio is better than that of its industrial loans, but this may be attri-
butable partly to the newness of BAPINDO's maritime loans, 80% of which were
disbursed only in 1975 and 1976. As of February 28, 1977, 14 maritime
borrowers (out of 26) were in arrears for over three months, with principal
and interest in arrears representing 11%, and the principal affected by
arrears 28% of the outstanding maritime loan portfolio. The repayment
performance of maritime loans was better than that for industrial loans,
with a collection rate of 63% in 1976 (compared with 50% for industrial
loans). A single borrower, PELNI, the large state-owned inter-island
shipping company, accounted for 36% of BAPINDO's maritime arrears and 28%
of the affected maritime portfolio.  On April 22, 1977, the Governrent
paid to BAPINDO an amount of Rp 434 million to partially settle PE NI s
arrears (totalling Rp 1,007 million at February 22, 1977), and during
negotiations for the proposed loan the Government agreed to make appropriate
arrangements for PELNI to repay the balance of its arrears.
11.       Raw Cotton Loans.  As of December 31, 1976, all raw cotton loans,
totalling Rp. 35.0 billion were overdue. Of this amount, however, BAPINDO's
own financial exposure is limited to Rp. 8.4 billion (including accrued interest
of Rp. 5.1 billion), with the balance of Rp. 26.6 billion or 76%   being
financed by Bank Indonesia and another state bank (Bank Ekspor-Impor). Two
large state-owned textile mills account for 94% of BAPINDO's financial exposure.
A characteristic feature of BAPINDO's raw cotton financing is that it was done
largely at the Government's orders. BAPINDO did not appraise these short-term
loans; instead, the Government identified borrowers and indicated amounts to
be lent, and BAPINDO acted merely as an agent for opening letters of credit,
handling documents and collecting payments. Further, Bank Indonesia and Bank
Ekspor-Impor together provided 87.5% of the funds, as stated above. Since
BAPINDO's raw cotton financing was undertaken at the Government's behest and
without independent appraisal, the Government in the past has shown willing-
ness to compensate BAPINDO for losses arising from this financing. During
negotiations, the Government agreed to compensate BAPINDO for its outstanding
financial exposure totalling Rp 7.9 billion in the above-mentioned two state-
owned textile mills (para 4.21). The small balance of Rp 0.5 billion (Rp 8.4
billion minus Rp 7.9 billion) representing BAPINDO's raw cotton loans to nine
privately owned textile mills, is expected to be collected by BAPINDO within
a year or so.

12.       Reasons for Arrears.  The unsatisfactory situation of BAPINDO's
portfolio and its poor loan collection performance are attributable, inter
alia, to the following factors: (a) the loan repayment record of borrowers
in Indonesia has generally been unsatisfactory, owing partly to a legal system
favoring borrowers vis-a-vis lenders; (b) a large proportion (above one-half)
of BAPINDO's arrears relate to loans made by it prior to its 1971 reorganiza-
tion, when practically no project appraisal and follow-up were undertaken;
(c) the severe credit restrictions imposed by the Government on the economy
in order to control inflation since 1974, which compounded the liquidity prob-
lems of companies; (d) the Government policy requiring state banks including
BAPINDO to lend only to indigenous (i.e. non-Chinese) enterprises, the majority
of which are financially and managerially weak; (e) BAPINDO's term loans had
unrealistically short amortization schedules (5 years or less) as required by
a Bank Indonesia regulation that was relaxed only in 1973; (f) BAPINDO's own
tendency to set unrealistically short repayment schedules with the objective
of trying to collect its loans as early as possible; (g) BAPINDO's low rate
(9% p.a.) on interest in arrears, which acts as an incentive for some de-
linquent borrowers not to repay; (h) frequent delaysl/ in the completion of
projects (compounded sometimes by the failure of BAPINDO's appraisal staff
to estimate accurately the projects' completion schedules), which in turn
resulted in these projects' inability to service their debt on schedule; and
( i) the slowness and generally inefficient performance of PUPN, the Govern-
ment collection agency through which all loan foreclosure and legal actions
by state banks including BAPINDO must be coursed.
1/ Some of these delays are reportedly attributable, in recent years, to
the congestion at the Jakarta port which prevented the timely clearance
of imported machinery and raw materials.

BANK PEMBANGUNAN INDONESIA (BAPINDO)
Resources
1.        Appendix 1 presents BAPINDO's resource position as of December 31
1976; the terms and conditions of long-term borrowings are summarized in
Appendix 2. As of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO had total resources of Rp 182.9
billion (US$441 million) of which Rp 41.5 billion were short-term resources
consisting mainly of short-term borrowings for raw cotton loans (Rp 22.2
billion), other current liabilities (Rp 11.6 billion) and deposits (Rp 7.6
billion) which BAPINDO accepts only from its clients. For the interest
differential between the various time deposit rates (up to 18% p.a.) and the
lending rates (12% or 15% p.a.) BAPINDO has been receiving full compensation
by the Government. Of the total long-term resources of Rp 141.4 billion, 60%
(Rp 109.8 billion) were from domestic sources while 40% (Rp 31.5 billion) were
from foreign borrowings.
2.        On the domestic currency side, BAPINDO continues, as in the past, to
rely almost exclusively on the Government, including Bank Indonesia and the
other state banks, for its resources. During the last three years BAPINDO's
resource position has been considerably strengthened by an additional share
subscription by the Government of Rp 8.6 billion in 1974 followed by Rp 4.5
billion in 1975 and Rp 10.3 billion during 1976 and borrowings from other
state banks of Rp 12.2 billion. The Government has also given a firm
commitment to increase the share capital by another Rp 6.0 billion during
the first half   of 1977, which BAPINDO is able to utilize now since
against this commitment it can obtain refinancing from Bank Indonesia and
other state banks. As a result, total long-term domestic currency resources
rose to Rp 109.8 billion as of December 31, 1976. Against these resources,
BAPINDO had, as of the same date, outstanding assets of Rp 66.1 billion,
plus undisbursed commitments of Rp 31.3 billion, leaving Rp 12.4 billion of
term resources available for further commitments and after accounting for
Rp 6.4 billion of uncommitted approvals, Rp 6.0 billion for further approvals.
However, part of these funds have been tied up through a shortfall in short-
term resources of Rp 8.8 billion (mainly due to a large amount of accrued
interest of Rp 10.8 billion) so that, as of December 31, 1976, BAPINDO had
net available only Rp 3.6 billion for further commitment and had unfunded
approvals of Rp 2.8 billion. To cover its lending in 1977, BAPINDO expects
additional refinancing from Bank Indonesia both directly under the INVESTASI
scheme and indirectly through consortium financing arrangements with other
state banks. The payment by the Government to BAPINDO of approximately
Rp 7.9 billion for the arrears of raw cotton loans of two Government textile
mills (see para 4.18 ) should further improve BAPINDO's domestic currency
resource position.
3.        BAPINDO's cumulative foreign currency resources amounted to US$76.0
million as of December 31, 1976. Of this amount, US$67.0 million or 88%

represented Bank/IDA funds (two IDA credits, No. 310-IND and 318-IND and
Bank loan No. 1054-IND), with the balance of US$9.0 million or 12% consisting
of a loan from KfW of Germany, which was made through the Government of
Indonesia. As of March 31, 1977, the uncommitted balance of the IDA credit
for maritime financing (No. 318-IND) was US$1.3 million, which is expected
to be fully committed during 1977. As of April 30, 1977 there was an uncom-
mitted balance of US$8.4 million under the last Bank loan for which BAPINDO
has already approved four loans which were being submitted to the Bank.
In fact, BAPIND0's operations have already been slowed down somewhat during
the latter part of 1976 and this year by its shortage of foreign currency
resources. The Government of Indonesia has recently requested a US$30
million loan from ADB for BAPINDO which, if approved, is hoped to become
effective early 1978. No new additional sources are presently in sight.
