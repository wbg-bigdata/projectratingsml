Protect Benefits:   The project will create a more dynamic cocoa
industry with a viable framework of ;ncentives,
institutions and tecbnologies to support its
development, and it will contribute to increasing
farmer incomes.
Proiect Ri*ks:       The risk of Cameroon losing its comparative advantage
in cocoa production due to a decline in international
prices is smalls future prices would have to be
consistently 202 below the Bank's forecast for new
investments to become ur.economic. A small risk is the
possible declining use of fungicides by farmer, due to
lower subsidies. To reduce this risk, the project
provides for more effective chemicals and for the
strengthening of the monitoring system. The zisk of
not improving SODECAO's efficiency has been minimized
through changes *n personnel policy and the
strengthening of the Management Control Unit. The risk
associated with the reorganization of marketing
cooperatives has been reduced by using approaches that
have proven successful in southwestern Cameroon. 'there
is a -isk that the current econumic crisis in Cameroon
will affect Government's ability to provide counterpart
funds. This is not, however, a good reason for
excluding assistance to a resource starved Government.
This risk will be reduced only when the Government
enters into a process of structural adjust ent. The
project itself will also eventually help by generating
Government revenue through increased tax collection
from cocoa.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAT? APPRAISAL REPORT
INTRODUCTION
1.        The Government of Cameroon requested assistance from the Worl4
Bank for a development project in the Center and South Provinces which
cover the main cocoa growing zone and surround the national capital,
Yaounde. Since the region's economic development had been neglected
relative to other regions, a Center-South Regional Development Project was
prepared by the PAO/World Bank Cooperative Program in April 1984. Further
discussions led to the conclusion that a cocoa operation focusing on policy
and institutional reforms was more appropriate than a traditional,
area-based rural development project. Additional preparation included a
study of cooperatives and their supporting agencies, financed and executed
by the German Technical Assistance Agency (GTZ), and a domestic marketing
study financed by UNDP.   The project was appraised in March 1986.  Delays
occurred in processing due firstly to an abrupt decline in Cameroon's
economic performance, leading to a worsening public finance situation.
With a tight public finance constraint, Government reviewed all of its
projects in order to reduce low priority expenditures. The cocoa project
was judged to be high priority. Secondly, more time was -.-uired than
anticipated for Government to meet conditions of Board presentation,
including most importantly providing the Bank with financial information
regarding the public enterprise that regulates and participates in cocoa
marketing.
I. BACKGROUND
2.        The Republic of Ca- roon covers an area of 475,000 km2,
characterized by climates ranging from sahelian in the North to equatorial
in the South. Its population of 10 million inhabitants (1985), growing at
an annual rate of 3.22, consists of many ethnic groups, cultures, and urban
settings. Fer capita GDP, at US$810 in 1985, grew at an annual rate of
2.72 between 1965 and 1985, but is still unevenly distributed between urban
and rural areas. Moreover, 402 of the rural population, which is
concentrated in the extreme North and the Western Highlands, lives in
absolute poverty (annual per capita income about US$105).  Rural poverty
and the urban expansion due to oil exploitation in the late 19709 have
encouraged migration to zities where about 402 of the total population
lives. However, opportunities in the cities are scarce and 252 of urban
dwellers are also classified as absolutely poor.
3.        The economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.7Z during
1960-70, and 5.12 during 1970-78. With the advent of oil production in the



- 2 -
late 19709, the economic rate of growth accelerated significantly to about
10? per annum during 1978-85. Since 1986, the economy has taken a sharp
downturn to an estimated growth rate of about 52. This is due to the
severe drop in oil prices, the decline in oil production, and the depressed
world commodity prices. Growth in 1987 was probably lower.
4.        Before the expansion of oil production began in 1978, agriculture
accounted for 32? of GDP, 852 of export earnings (coffee and cocoa alone
accounted for 65X) and 35? of tax revenue. Although agriculture still
employed about 75t of the labor force in 1985, it accounted for only 21? of
GDP and 272 of exports due to its displacement by the oil sector as the
primary source of foreign exchange. Oil provided 65? of export earnings
and 13? of GDP.
1I. THE AG.RICULTURE SECTOR
Agricultural Performance
5.        Cameroon's agricultural resources are considerably varied:
cotton, rice, millet, sorghum and Alvestock in the North; industrial crops
(coffee, cocoa, oil palm, rubber, sugar) and foodcrops (maize, manioc,
etc.) in the West and South; and large, mainly unexploited forests in the
Southeast. Smallholder farming (both foodcrops for local consumption and
cocoa, coffee and cotton for export) contributes 90? of total agricultural
output, the remaining 10? being produced on plantations. After a period of
reasonable growth of about 4.7? (1960-73), the sector has become more
sluggish with growth averaging about 2? since 1973. The unfavorable
weather during the period 1982-84 partly accounted for this poor
performance, but the slow growth can be largely explained by stagnant or
declining cash crop production.
Government Policy
6.        Prior to the Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (1977-81), the
Government extracted revenues merely from export crops, paying little
attention to foodcrops or the rural population. Although the Plan focused
on agriculture, it did not provide enough resources to ensure its
development, i.e., 15? of total investment (only 10? of realized planned
expenditures). The Fifth Development Plan (1981-86), which coincided with
the surge in oil revenues, also focused on agriculture but with
substantially increased appropriations (23.7Z of planned expenditures).
Its objectives for agriculture aimed at (a) raising smallholder
productivity; (b) improving rural living conditions; (c) ensuring food
self-sufficiency; curtailing migration to the cities; (d) improving the
production, processing and marketing of both food and export crops; (e)
strengthening the management of parastatal enterprises; (f) developing a
sound agricultural pricing policy; and (g) providing better extension



- 3 -
services to farmers. The Sixth Development Plan (1986-90) has raised the
long-term development issue if how to increase export crop production to
compensate for the decline in oil production which has already started.
For tree crops, especially cocoa, new planting and rehabilitation was to be
accelerated.
World Bank Grout Involvement and Strateay
7.        For the past several years, the Bank has helped Cameroon to
implement projects mainly designed to increase agricultural production and
exports. In the 19708 and early 19808, emphasis was plared on the
production of export crops and foodcrops on plantations, and regional
development projects to promote rural development and increase export crops
production in smallholdings. The Bank lending program is gradually
addressing broader agricultural development issues. During recent
discussions with the Government, it was agreed that the Bank will move
toward a sectoral approach emphasizing policy and institutional reforms
coupled with investments in high priority commodities and in the
development of agricultural services. The project is designed to fit this
strategy.
Main Institutions
8.        The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) has eight directoratess
General Administration, Agriculture, Forests, Studies and Projects (DEP),
Cooperation and Mutuality (COOPIMUT), Rural Works, Community Development,
and Agricultural Education. DEP, MINAGRI's planning department, has three
operational divisions: studies, project management and statistics. The
Baik's Second Technical Cooperation Project (TC-II, Cr. 1168-CM) supports
the first two DEP divisions and the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) supports the other. COOP/MUT has special functions in
the cocoa subsector (para 27). The agricultural component of rural
development projects is normally entrusted to semi-autonomous agencies such
as the Cocoa Development Agency, SODECAO. MINAGRI's provincial units
supervise the overall implementation of agricultural policies. DEP's
project management division has external monitoring and evaluation units
attached to MINAGRI's units in the Northern and Western Provinces, which
are supported by Bank-financed projects. Since there is currently no
monitoring and evaluation capacity in the Center and South Provinces, the
project will finance its development (para 39).
9.        The National Rural Development Fund (FONADER) is a public
corporation with financial and administrative autonomy under the general
supervision of MINAGRI. FONADER deals with (a) procurement, storage and
distribution of agricultural inputs; (b) financing and/or management of
special rural development projects and programs; and (c) promotion and
extension of rural credit. In July 1987, Parliament passed a law
authorizing the President of the Republic to dissolve FONADER, with a view
to transferring its agricultural credit activities to a new agriculture



- 4 -
credit bank. However, the actual timing of FONADER's dissolution is not
yet fixed. In the present report, references to FONADER refer also to its
possible successor. Adequate safeguards were agreed upon negotiations
(para 82(a)).
10.       The  Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MINCI) is mainly
responsible for the internal and external marketing of cash crops and
operates mostly through the National Produce Marketing Board (ONCPB). The
Institute for Agronomic Research (IRA), which is part of the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research, is responsible for foodcrop and
tree crop research, of which about 152 is on cocoa.
III. THE COCOA SUBSECTOR
11.       Cocoa is Cameroon's second largest agricultural erport commodity
after coffee. Its production increased steadily until the late 19608 when
it reached about 100,000 tons/year (about 82 of world production). Since
then it has stagnated around that level, although there have been a few
peaks of 120,000 tons (1979-81 and 1984-85). The Cameroonian stock of
cocoa trees is relatively old (average age is about 30 years) because of
insufficient replantings and few new plantings between 1970 and 1985.
Cameroon's share of world production has already fallen to 6.52. If no
action is taken to encourage new plantings, Cameroon's cocoa production
will fall significantly. This would be unfortunate because Cameroon has a
comparative advantage in cocoa production and the special quality of its
cocoa product commands a premium in buying markets. In addition, about
90,000 farm families (about 500,000 people) depend on cocoa. It supplies
about 102 of Cameroon's total exports.
12.       Cocoa is predominantly a smallholder crop disseminated over an
estimated 350,000 ha of natural forest. A typical smallholder tends in
total about 1.7 ha of cocoa and 1 ha of foodcrops. The cocoa belt extends
through the Eastern, Center, Southern, Littoral, Southwestern and Western
Provinces (Map IBRD No. 19726R). The Center and South Provinces, which
constitute most of the SODECAO Region (Map IBRD No. 19725R), account for
652 of national cocoa output. The Southwestern and Western Provinces,
whose production has been expanding over the past decade, account for 252,
and the Eastern Province for 10Z. The stagnation in cocoa output is a
result of (a) an inadequate system of producer incentives for both
production and replanting (paras 16-19); (b) a decline in the efficiency of
the organizations providing production and marketing services to the cocoa
subsector (paras 23-28); and (c) declining yields due to Black Pod disease
and the old age of cocoa trees (paras 29-30). Cameroon's cocoa production
(100,000 tons) at prevailing prices (US$2/kg) represented an annual value
of US$200 million. The importance of cocoa for the national economy
declined because of the expansion of oil exploitation; 102 of export
revenues in 1985. However, with the present decline of both oil



-5-
production and price, cocoa and other agricultural exports are becoming
again increasingly important in terms of exports and revenues. Technical
aspects of cocoa production are detailed in Project File No. 229.602(C8).
The Government's Cocoa Development Strate-ty
13.       Cameroon has a comparative advantage in cocoa production, as
measured by the Domestic Resource Cost (DRC) ratio which for Low investment
using new hybrid varieties is 0.58, using the average FOB Douala prices
projected for 1987-95. (A DRC ratio of less than 1.0 indicates comparative
advantage reflecting 0.58 CFAF in domestic resources necessary to produce 1
CPAF in net foreign exchange earnings.) This comparative advantage is
expected to continue for the remainder of the century, and possibly improve
under the project which emphasizes replanting younger trees and new
varieties to raise productivity. (The DRC analysis for cocoa in Cameroon
is given in Project File No. 229.602(C9).)
14.       The Government has justifiably given cocoa an important role in
its strategy for agricultural development and is determnoLed to overcome the
current stagnation in cocoa output. It has recently started to explore
medium-size cocoa plantations, to be developed by the private sector, as an
alternative to traditional smallholder cocoa production and as a means of
strengthening the dynamic element in the cocoa subsector. The expectation
is that medium-size plantations will provide a profitable opportunity that
will attract both otherwise city-bound young farmers and city-based
entrepreneurs (para 56). The Sixth Plan supports a substantial planting
and infilling program (replanting of trees in gaps of old plantations) with
79,000 ha in new plantings (66,500 ha in smallholdings and 12,500 ha in
medium-size plantations), and 35,000 ha in infilling. Assuming these
taigets are met, Cameroon's cocoa output will range from 160,000 tons to
180,000 tons annually by the year 2000, compared with the current 100,000
tons. This will represent about 7.52 of estimated world production in the
year 2000, compared with about 6.52 at present, i.e., a very limited
increase in Cameroon's share of the world market.
Constraints
15.       Increased cocoa production can be achieved through increased
planting and beiter productivity of both labor and land. This means a
substantial investment in new planting and replacement of old trees. Such
investment will only occur, however, if steps are taken to deal with the
constraints that have led to the present stagnation of the cocoa subsector.
These constraints relate to (a) incentivess policies on prices, subsidies
and taxes have been at times inimical to cocoa production; (b)
institutions: provision of production support and of marketing services to



farmers has been inefficient; and (c) technoloays design and delivery of
affordable agronomic packages with high yielding varieties have been
inadequate. All of these constraints are addressed under the project.
(a) Cocoa Production Incentives
16.       The current policy of producer prices for export crops in
Cameroon is based on a system of pricing ("Bar6mel) including controlled
producer prices, marketing margins, and a fixed export tax of about
CFAF 56/kg. Producer prices are currently CFA? 420/kg, plus a year-end
premium of CPAF 30/kg. In addition, a planting bonus of CFAP 200,000/ha is
available for plantings of 5 ha minimum, and inputs, mainly fungicides, are
heavily subsidized. The role of the marketing parastatal, ONCPB, was
originally that of a stabilization fund. It was to use the surpluses
accumulated in years of high world prices to support producer prices in
years of low world prices. The net effect of ONCPB's intervention was to
be neutral in terms of producer taxation, except for the relatively small
export tax that is levied directly by the Treasury. In practice, however,
ONCPB did not have to support cocoa producer prices; it used some of the
surplus generated in part by the cocoa trade to invest in the agricultural
sector, including the construction of rural roads and support to cotton
production.
17.       Cameroon has a long-established policy of heavy taxation on
traditional export crops, despite evidence of a positive though lagged
supply response to prices. Between 1970 and 1985, farmers received on
average only 52Z of the FOB price less internal marketing costs for their
cocoa. Despite the emergence of oil in 1980 as a rapidly increasing source
of Government revenue and very high prices on the wc.ld market, cocoa
producer prices declined in real terms in all but oue year since 1980.
Thus, at a time when circumstances were favorable, the country lost the
opportunity to give a major impetus to its cocoa industry.
18.       The prevailing price setting mechanism has been a major factor in
the failure to take advantage of favorable circumstances. Prices are fixed
annually at the highest Government level. In general, price increases are
conservative and bear no automatic relationship with either in> Qtion or
movements on the world market. While the system is meant to stabilize
producer prices through ONCPB operations, in practice price stability is
achieved by setting prices low enough to obviate the need for price support
in all years.
19.       A revised cocoa pricing mechanism would be part of a reformed
incentive system established under the project (para 38(a)). In addition
more farmer participation in cocoa plantirigs and replantings calls for a
downward adjustment in the minimum farm size necessary to be eligible for
the planting bonus. the bonus would be paid in three and not two
installments to encourage farmers to take better care of their plantations
until maturity. Finally, subsidies on chemicals would be reduced because



they result in considerable wastage and are a heavy financial burden for
the Government (estimated at CFAF 4.9 billion -- US$15.6 million -- for the
SODECAO Region). The project provides for the reduction of the subsidy.
An analysis of cocoa incentive policies is given in Annex 3-1.
20.       To streamline the cocoa export marketing strategy and take
advantage of many marketing opportunities, ONCPB will carry out an export
marketing study. During negotiations, the terms of reference (Annex 3-.2)
for the study were agreed upon with the Government. Assurances were
obtained that the Government will cause ONCPB to carry out this study and
to complete it before March 31, 1989.   The study recommendations will be
discussed with the Bvnk and, thereafter, implemented as agreed upon
(para 80(a)).
(b) Institutional Provision of Services to Farmers
21.       The institutions supporting the development of the cocoa
subsector can be divided into two groups: (a) production services (MINAGRI
and SODECAO), and (b) marketing services (cooperatives, COOP/MUT and the
National Center for the Development of Cooperatives, CENADEC).  The latter
are described in detail in paras 24-28 and in Project File No. 229.602
(ClO).
(i) Production Services
22.       MINAGRI.  At the provincial level the MINAGRI units supervise the
implementation of agricultural policies. However, MINAGRI's traditional
services overlap with SODECAO's and the division of responsibilities is
unclear. For instance, MINAGRI senior staff organize farmer meetings and
make recommendations that are sometimes contradictory to those given by
SODECAO extensior. agents. The responsibilities of these two entities are
'now clearly defined in the Government's Statement of Policy (para 35).
23.       SODECAO.  Created as a semi-autonomous development agency in
1974, SODECAO is responsible for supporting smallholdsr cotoa production
and rural development in the Center and South Provinces which comprise 11
departments, and in the Sanaga Maritime department of the Littoral Province
(para 42) (Map IBD 19725R). In the SODECAO Region, about 300,000 ha are
planted with cocoa and another 20,000 ha with Robusta coffee. SODECAO's
organization and financial situation are generally satisfactory but would
benefit from streamlining (Project File No. 229.602(Cl1)). Since its
reorganization at the end of the First Cocoa Project in 1980, SODECAO has
developed rapidly into a sound organization providing agricultural
extension, crop protection, and road construction services. However, the
number of staff and its operating costs are significantly greater than
required for these operations. For example, the number of extension agents
per farmer (1*200) is higher than necessary. Financial services are in
need of improvement. Some key management positions have not been filled
largely due to lack of autonomy in personnel selection. Finally, because



the Government's direct contribution to SODECAO's budget is often delayed,
SODECAO must finance its operation through a line of credit with high
interest charges. Under the project, improvement in SODECAO's efficiency
will be achieved by requiring strict ceilings for operating costs,
including wages, and by ensuring autonomy over personnel decisions
(para 39).
(ii) Marketing Services
24.       Internal Cocoa Marketing.  ONCPB controls the main aspects of
cocoa marketing, working through cooperatives and licensed exporters. The
commission and transportation charges of marketing intermediaries are
specified in a Bareme published annually by ONCPB. Theoretically,
cooperatives have local monopolies on cocoa buying and transport to
official collection centers in their areas of operation. Exporters who buy
from cooperatives and provide transportation to the port are licensed under
an annual presidential decree and are allocated quotas and specific buying
areas. In practice, they also buy from farmers and, therefore, both
compete and collaborate with cooperatives, depending on the area.
Financing is largely provided by exporters who advance funds to the
cooperatives for purchasing cocoa, who carry the cocoa purchased directly
from farmers until exported.
25.       The internal marketing system does not allow cooperatives to
carry out all their assigned marketing functions, due in part to a lack of
working capital and to heavy Government interference which contributes to
low efficiency. The controlled marketing charges also constitute a serious
market constraint since they do not vary with collection conditions.
Serving remote areas does not bring a higher marketing commission than
serving accessible regions. Remote regions are therefore neglected. The
system is not sufficiently competitive and there is little incentive to
increase efficiency or to improve services to farmers. Finally, exporters
are constrained by Government's administrative procedures and lack the
long-term security necessary to induce them to invest. A detailed analysis
of the cocoa marketing system is given in Project File No. 229.602(C12).
Further information will be provided by the internal marketing study under
execution. Improvements in cocoa marketing and cooperative policy are
defined in Government's Statement of Policy (para 35).
26.       Marketing Cooperatives.  Marketing cooperatives are supervised by
MINAGRI through cooperative support agencies. MINCI and ONCPB regulations
-- although not always consistent with MINAGRI's -- also apply to
cooperatives, and coordination between these organizations and MINAGRI is
inadequate. In the SODECAO Region, the Lekie Department (the most
important in terms of rural population and cocoa production) has five
marketing cooperatives with about 350 cooperative centers, each with about
150 members. Each of the other 10 departments has one marketing
cooperative (SOCOODER), totalling about 1,600 cooperative centers, each
with 50 members on average. These cooperatives are expected to provide



- 9 -
important services to farmers, such as help with cocoa sales. Although two
cooperative unions have recently been created, one for the Center Province
and one for the South Province, they are not yet operational. Cooperative
performance has been unsatisfactory due to inefficient management, weak
supporting services (especially from COOP/HUT), lack of facilities
(particularly storage), and high operating costs. The marketing system
does not adeauately fill its role of helping cooperative development. Weak
cooperative performance has been exacerbated by inadequate coordination
between MINAGRI and MINCI.
27.       Cooperative Support Agencies.  COOP/MUT and CENADEC provide
support to the cooperatives. COOP/HUT, as a department of MINAGRI, has
extensive statutory obligations (e.g., approval of budgets, appointment of
senior staff) for cooperatives and is supposed to provide support in terms
of management advice, organizational support and training. At present it
is nqt adequately fulfilling its functions because of weak management and
inadequate budget. COOP/MUT's arbitrary intervention in cooperative
activities, especially in staff appointments and assignment of cocoa
traders to marketing areas, has weakened cooperative performance.
28.       CENADEC is a semi-autonomous organization under MINAGRI, with
responsibility for cooperative promotion in "pilot' areas. The first pilot
area was located in the Lekie department where CENADEC laid a good
foundation for cooperative development but was asked to withdraw
prematurely. It also successfully reorganized the cooperatives in the
Southwestern Province. The Government has agreed that CENADEC will play a
key role in strengthening cooperatives under the project. Unfortunately,
CENADEC's management has deteriorated in recent years and, therefore, the
project will include measures to upgrade its performance (para 55).
(c) Technological Agronomic Packages
29.       Cocoa production has followed a low input/output system, with
yields averaging 250 kg/ha. The low actual average yield is due to weak
management and poor planting material; the presence of a wide range of
disease and pests, the most serious being Phytophtora (Black Pod disease),
which destroys on average 30? of the Cameroonian crop annually followed by
Mirid infestation. The old age of the plantations has also been
responsible for a decline in yields. More than 402 of cocoa trees is over
30 years old and productivity is declining at an estimated rate of 32 per
year. Considering the age structure of the plantations, the current yield
average implies yield ranging from 400 kg/ha/year to 500 kg/ha/year for
trees during their main production age (10-30 years). For plantations
established 8-10 years ago with improved planting material, yield ranges
from 750 kg/ha/year to 900 kg/ha/year. Better yields can only be achieved
by planting new areas to lower the average age of cocoa stands, by
introducing new hybrid varieties and a better selection of planting
material, and by improving Black Pod and Mirid control.



- 10 -
30.       Black Pod control is carried out by individual farmers and Mirid
control is done by specialized teams employing mass spraying. Black Pod
control was suboptimal until the early 19809 because copper-based
fungicides were not sufficiently effective and smallholders did not spray
as often as recommended. Cocoa quality was thus inconsistent and often
suffered from moldy off-flavor, insufficient fermentation, high percentage
of Black Pod-damaged beans, and generally poor standard of preparation.
More efficient systemic fungicides are now used in combination with
copper-based ones, allowing a reduction in the number of required
treatments and amount of water. Better control of Black Pod disease has
been achieved, and higher quality standards will permit Cameroon to take
full advantage of two major quality features of its cocoa which are highly
appreciated in specialized markets: high fat yield and the red color of its
powder. However, further research is necessary to develop other fungicides
which would prevent potential resistance build up and reduce the number of
treiatments.
31.       Mirid control is carried out with Gamma-HCH (Lindane) in
alternation with carbamates and organophosphorous products, a mix of low
toxicity insecticides that reduces health hazards.  However, the cost per
hectare is too high and the timeliness of the operation is also a
constraint. Otherwise, Mirid control is satisfactory, especially in the
SODECAO Region where supervision is tighter than in areas where this work
is carried out by MINAGRI's extension services (para 45).
t'he First Cocoa Project
32.       The First Cocoa project (Ln 1039-CM, 1975-81) sought to (a)
rehabilitate 35,000 ha of existing cocoa plantations; (b) establish 15,000
ha of new cocoa plantations; (c) strengthen extension services; (d)
rehabilitate 950 km of rural roads; (e) assist in the formation of farmer
pre-cooperatives; and (f).carry out applied research. Total project costs
were estimated at US$23.8 million (including a Bank loan of US$6.5
million).
33.       The Project, the first in the cocoa subsector, was unsuccessful.
Physical developments were partially executed but at twice the estimated
costs, and the target increase in cocoa yields was not achieved. The
program was ambitious given that SODECAO was a new, relatively untried
agency, and the Government's failure to appoint qualified personnel to
management posts undermined SODECAO's ability to effectively carry out its
mission. In addition, poor policy decision disrupted Government/farmer
relationships. These included the requirement that all farmers belong to
Government-created marketing cooperatives (SOCOODERs), undermining
SODECAO's approach of developing pre-cooperative farmer groups managed by
the farmers themselves. Improvement in producer incentives, either in
terms of higher output prices or replanting assistance, was resisted by the
Government, despite the fact that cocoa world prices reached an historic
high during the period.



- 11 -
34.       The results of the First Cocoa Project showed that further
substantial growth in cocoa production will have to come mainly from
plantlng new areas to lower the average age of the cocoa stands and,
thereby, increase yields. In addition, it indicated that increased
production will have to come from the introduction of hybrid varieties
rather than from intensified production from existing stands. The Project
demonstrated that the objective of achieving high yields was not feasible
under typical smallholder conditions, given the input package available at
the time. Expanded cocoa production will not happen unless producer
incentives are adequate, services to cocoa producers are efficient,
agronomic packages are affordable, and marketing and input aupply systems
are functioning.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives and Main Features
35.       The project's main objectives are to overcome the current
stagnation in cocoa output and expand cocoa export earnings by helping
modernize the cocoa industry. Smallholder incomes and well-being will
improve as a result, as well as Government tax revenue. To achbeve these
objectives, the project will, over a five-year period: (1) improve the
system of producer incentives; (2) increase SODECAO's efficiency and
support its ongoing program; (3) reorganize the cocoa marketing system and
the cocoa marketing cooperatives, and strengthen CENADEC; (4) establish a
private medium-size plantation program; and (5) strengthen MINAGRI's
capability to implement the cocoa development strategy incorporated into
the project, and to monitor its execution. These actions are reflected in
the Government's Statement of Policy (Annex 4-1) agreed upon at
negotiations (para 80(b)).
B. Detailed Features
1.   Incentive Policy Package
36.       The incentive package for cocoa producers (Annexes 3-1 and 4-1)
consists of:
(a) a cocoa pricing policy linked to world prices and an annual
review of domestic producer prices;
(b) a planting bonus, currently CFAP 200,000 per ha, for all farmers
planting one hectare or more and following prescribed cultural
practices; and
(c) a subsidy on Black Pod fungicides which will be reduced in stages
from the present lOOS to 502 by PY5.



- 12 -
37.       The domestic producer price will still consist of two elements:
(a) a floor price announced at the beginning of each cocoa season and
payable at the time of sale; and (b) a premium payable at the end of the
season. The floor price was set at a minimum of CPAF 420/kg in 1986-87,
where it has remained. The premium will be linked to export revenues,
taking into account marketing costs and the available reserves at ONCPB.
The price will be reviewed annually and determined in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank (para 66).
38.       In the longer run, the incentive package will be strengthened by
!mproved efficiency and effectiveness of ONCPB's activities in the cocoa
subsector, with a focus on price stabilization rather than tax collection
and development financing. The export marketing study to be carried out by
ONCPB (para 20) will be an initial step in this direction.
2. Assistance to SODECAO
General Management
39.       The project will increase the efficiency of SODECAO's Financial
and Administrative Departments and the Management Control Unit (MCU). It
will also reorganize the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU). In the
Financial Department, the project will strengthen accounting and reporting,
the integration of management information systems, cost accounting, and
accounting services. The position of management controller will be filled
(para 61) so that an efficient internal auditing system can be developed.
The Administrative Department will strengthen its stock accounting system.
A program for reducing SODECAO excess personnel and operating costs by 10Z
and 15Z respectively by 1992 from 1986-87 levels, and for autonomy over
personnel decisions, was agreed during negotiations (para 80(c) and
Annex 4-2), and implementation targets are presented in (Annex 4-3).
40.        The SODECAO general director will continue to be fully
responsible for coordinating the planning and budgeting of SODECAO's
program, supervising its implementation, monitoring its progress and
presenting quarterly reports. Departmental directors will be responsible
for approving work programs and budgets on the basis of proposals prepared
by service and sector chiefs. Sector chiefs will be in charge of day to
day management in each of the Region's ten administrative departments
covered by the project. The two remaining departments (Nyong and Mfoumou,
and Sanaga in the Center Province) are supported by rural development
projects financed respectively by the Central Agency for Economic
Development (CCCE) and the African Development Bank/African Development
Fund (ADB/AD?).
41.       The project will finance technical assistance, equipment,
vehicles, and operating costs. Due to SODECAO's rapid expansion, the
project will provide for the review of its activities and performance to
assist in identifying methods of reducing personnel and operating costs.



- 13 -
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the review will be completed
before September 30, 1988, and that its recommendations will be discussed
with the Bank and subsequently implemented as agreed upon (para 80(d)).
.42.      The SODECAO program will continue to be monitored by a small
internal unit headed by a recently appointed Cameroonian agro-economist who
will report to the general director. The Unit will be reoriented toward
specific issues related to project implementation, such as monitoring
farmer planting activities, the comparisur. of cocoa marketing systems in
the SODECAO and Southwestern Regions, and the assessuent of farmer
responses to the reduction of the fungicide subsidy. The project will
finance the development of external evaluation units in the Center and
South Provinces, which will fall under the aegis of MINAGRI. (More details
on the Unit are given in Annex 4-4.)
ARricultural Operations
43.       The project will support SODECAO's ongoing activities related to
its smallholder replanting and infilling program which consists of:
(a) the planting of 45,000 ha with new cocoa;
(b) the further development of 17,000 ha of immature cocoa
plantations;
(c) the infilling of 35,000 ha of cocoa (both in young and mature
plantations),; and
(d) the planting of 1,400 ha and the rehabilitation of 1,200 ha of
Robusta coffee.
SODECAO's cocoa plantation program represents about 802 of the Sixth Plan
targets for inf..lling and new plantings in smallholdings. The Soutbwestern
Province, whose agricultural development is supported by an ADB-financed
rural development project, and the Eastern Province will account for the
balance of the Plan targets.
44.       Cocoa planting material sufficient to supply SODECAO's program
and also the remainder of the cocoa subsector will be provided by both
SODECAO's seed farms and by the Government seed farm at Ebolowa.
Assurances that the government seed farms will supply SODECAO with
sufficient planting material from its annual planting program were obtained
at negotiations (para 80(e)). The project will also support foodcrop
cultivation which was neglected in the past but is now part of SODECAO's
agricultural program aimed at developing the farming system. Foodcrop
planting materials will be sold by SODECAO to farmers at full cost.
Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiaticns (para 80(f)).
Linkages between research and extension will be reinforced by the Testing
and Liaison Unit of the USAID-financed National Cereals Research and
Extension project to be established in the SODECAO Region. (More details
on agricultural operations are given in Annex 4-5.)



_ 14 -
Extension Services
45.       The project will support the existing extension services which
will be progressively reorganized to increase efficiency and reduce
excessive operating costs. The reorganization will mainly involve:
(a) the adoption of a systematic work schedule for extension services
based on fortnightly visits to farmer groups of 8-10 farmers,
increasing to about 25 farmers per group by the fifth year;
(b) the transfer of input distribution from extension agents to
farmer groups;
(c) the implementation of field demonst-ations by farmer groups; and
(d)  the strengthening of the in-service training program for all
extension staff and better linkage between extension and
research.
46.       This approach will be applied in five pilot areas covering 200
cooperative centers annually, reaching about 50Z of total by the end of the
project. Three pilot lreas will be located in the Center Province (Lekie,
Nyong, and Kelle and Mefou Mfoundi Departments) and two in the South
Province (Ntem, and Dja and Lobo Departments). Their selection will be
based on criteria such as suitability for cocoa, accessibility, age of
trees, density of planting, and farmers' willingness to replant cocoa and
to adopt technical recommendations. To strengthen the in-service training
program and improve linkage with research, SODECAO will draw on existing
resources to designate a subject-matter specialist for each province and
pilot area. The pilot extension program will be headed by an experienced
agriculturalist who will report to SODECAO's technical director. Over the
project period, this extension approach will be expanded at a rate
consistent with the availability of retrained manpower. The project will
make specific provisions to use women extension agents because of the
predominance of female labor in subsistence foodcrop production.
Pest Control Services
47.       The project will support cocoa Black Pod control and anti-Mirid
treatment.   Cocoa Black Pod control will continue to be carried out by
individual farmers who will be charged for part of the fungicide cost in
increasing amounts during the project period (para 36(c)). Specific
targets for implementing these reductions are presented in Annex 4-3. The
introduction of a charge will alleviate the fiscal drain on the Government,
reduce product wastage and misuse, and protect the environment. The
specialized SODECAO teams will continue to blanket-spray cocoa againot
Mirid every year, followed by spot spraying of 20? of the total cocoa area.
To increase efficiency and reduce costs, a pilot anti-Mirid. program will
start in the five areas selected for pilot extension activities (para 47).



- 15 -
The main purpose of this program is to involve farmers in Mirid control and
eventually give farmer groups responsibility for machinery operation and
maintenance, chemical mixing, and pre- and post-spray surveys.
Participation of farmers will ensure the timeliness of the operation and
reduce operating costs by an estimated 252 in the pilot areas. Costs might
also be reduced by about 202 in pesticides used, through more efficient
supervision of the operation. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that SODECAO will directly procure ll crop protection chemicals for its
program (para 80(g)) in order to ensure adequate amounts and timely
delivery.
Adaptive Research
48.       The project will support a joint SODECAO-IRA adaptive research
program for Black Pod and Mirid control, starting in 1988 (Annex 4-6).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that a convention regarding
project operations between SODECAO and IRA will be prepared before
June 30, 1988 and transmitted to the Bank for review (para 80(h)). In
addition, the Testing and Liaison Unit of the USAID-financed project will
address the communication problem prevailing among research, extension and
the farmers. It will also focus on foodcrops.
Trainina
49.       The program of the training unit will be expanded under the
project and bimonthly training of extension agents will be instituted. The
content of the in-service and young farmer training program will be
improved by increasing the number of subject-matter specialists in the
extension service and by ensuring their systematic participation in
training (para 46). The training unit will develop specific programs for
farm women in collaboration with the extension staff, and for SODECAO staff
in management positions or likely to occupy such positions.
Feeder Roads
50.       Roads will be constructed at the rate of 400 km/year (six
construction brigades) for the first two years of the project, declining
over the next three years, as emp:..sis will shift to maintenance and the
construction force will be reduced from six to four brigades. Over the
project period, a total of 1,350 km will be constructed and maintenance
will involve (a) 2,400 kmiyear (f regrading against 500 km/year at present;
(b) 300 kmiyear of resurfacing; and (c) 3,000 km/year of manual
maintenance. To lower the cost of road rehabilitation, the width of the
running surface will be reduced from 6.0 to 4.5 meters and its thickness
from 15 to 10 centimeters.
51.       The roads included in the annual work program will be selected by
$ODBCAO according to a list of roads for which economic viability has been
established. (More details are given in Project File No. 229.602(C2)). To
spread the work evenly among the brigades, work control will be
decentralized to three administrative centers during PYls Bafia in the



_ 16 -
North, Yaounde in the Center, and Ebolowa in the South (Map IBRD No.
19726R). The director of the Roads Department will be responsible for
overall supervision and will be assisted by one deputy director in charge
of the three main workshops and the engineering design office, plus a
senior engineer for each of the three centers. The changes aim at
eliminating one deputy director and at adding two junior engineers to the
1985 level of staffing. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
regarding reorganization of the feeder road unit (para 80(i)).
3. Marketina Systems. CooDeratives and CENADEC
52.       The Statement of Policy (Annex 4-1) provides the basis for
improving cocoa marketing operations, including changes in the marketing
system, and the reorganization of marketing cooperatives and their
supporting agency (CENADEC). It also clarifies the responsibilities of the
two ministries (MINAGRI and MINCI) involved in overseeing cooperative
development and crop marketing.
53.       The reorganization of the marketing cooperatives in the Center
and South Provinces and in the Sanaga Maritime Department of the Littoral
Province will be undertaken during the project period. An ongoing audit of
cooperative accounts will assist CENADEC in determining the order in which
cooperatives are to be reorganized. Reorganization entails first the
replacement of Government-seconded staff by staff recruited by the
cooperatives themselves and a reduction in personnel. Second, the
SOCOODERs problem of an excessively large area of operation will be tackled
by decentralizing their services to cooperative branches. Only small
coordination units will remain at SOCOODER headquarters.
54.       The project will finance (a) storage facilities and offices, and
vehicles and equipment for cooperative offices and centers; (b) the
salaries and related expenditures of the cooperatives' senior staff during
the three years following reorganization, after which the cooperatives are
expected to be self-supporting; and (c) the costs of training and studies.
The efficiency of the cooperatives will be improved through better
management, better employment and investment policies, and concentration of
efforts on cocoa marketing. The performance of the reorganized
cooperatives will be evaluated annually through analytical audits conducted
by CENADEC.
55.       To improve CENADEC management support to cooperatives, the
project will finance (a) salaries of key management staff; (b) vehicles ard
operating costs; (c) training costs; an', (d) costs of technical assistance
and consultancy services. (CENADEC accol2nts are being audited under the
Second Technical Cooperation Project.) CENADEC will provide management
support, staff training and supervision -o marketing cooperatives during
and after their reorganization and conduct regular audits on behalf of
COOP/MUT. CENADEC's operations will improve with decentralization
(creation of mobile teams), and better management procedures and staff



- 17 -
performance (para 28). CENADEC's director and heads of departments are in
place and management upgrading is underway. However, management
improvement, including the performance of senior staff, will be reviewed
annually.
4.  Private Medium-Size Plantation Proaram
56.       A medium-size plantation prograu. nas been included in the project
to define the best approach to plantatiot and test it on a significant
scale. The project will provide US$22.1 million, or 7.7Z of project costs,
to FONADER to finance the developmenc of about 4,000 ha of private,
medium-size plantations in the SODECAO Region, equivalent to 30? of the
Sixth Plan's target. The program includes both individual plantations from
10 to 50 ha and individual plantings grouped into blocks not exceeding 200
ha. The program will be prepared by MINAGRI during PY1 and will draw upon
a SODECAO study on medium-size plantations completed in May 1987. It will
focus on organization and management of the program, includings
(a) institutional arrangements;
(b) criteria for farmer selection (experience, income and land
ownership status);
(c) land issues (location, acquisition, compensation and
allocations);
(d) potential existence of labor constraints;
(e) extent of farmer training;
(f) financing issues (methods, conditions and rate of interest);
(g)  level of financial participation by farmers and guarantors;
(h) amount of state subsidies; and
(i) design of a credit recovery system.
57.       The program will be incorporated into the  agreement between the
Government and FONADER/SODECAO. Signature of this agreement is a condition
for loan disbursement (para 82(a)). Separate plantation subprojects will
then be appraised by DEP-MINAGRI with SODECAO's assistance for each
plantation or block plantation, and implemented by farmers and city
entrepreneurs.                 i
58.       To speed up processing, all individual and block plantation
subprojects appraised at US$150,000 or less will be submitted for approval
to FONADER's Credit Committee and reviewed by the Bank ex-post; those over
US$150,000 will be submitted to the Bank for approval ex-ante. The maximum
cost per plantation subproject will be US$250,000 equivalent for
individual plantations and US$900,000 equivalent for block plantations. A



- 18 -
key selection criterion will be that the economic rate of return for each
subproject is at least 152. All subprojects appraised by DEP-MINAGRI
will then be handed to FONADER for financing. The planting program will
start in PY2 with 700 ha, increasing to 1,100 ha/year over the three
following years.
S. Assistance to MINAGRI
59.       To improve MINAGRI agricultural policy planning and monitoring
and evaluation, the project will finance consultancy services, vehicles,
office, and field equipment to (a) help prepare the country's long-term
cocoa development strategy (including pricing policies); (b) assist in
strengthening the MEU; (c) develop an appropriate analytical capability to
monitor the impact of price changes on cocoa and competing crops, and on
farmer incomes; and (d) carry-out an organization and management study of
SODECAO.
C. Technical Assistance and Consultancy Services
60.       Experts at SODECAO are already in post and performing
satisfactorily.  The positions of directors of Agricultural Operations,
Procurement and Roads are financed by the French bilateral assistance fund
(FAC). The Government will make arrangements to ensure that the existing
level of technical assistance at SODECAO is maintained over the project
period and that GTZ will directly finance the 15 man-years of technical
assistance required for the cooperative component. A condition for loan
effectiveness is the signature of the agreement relevant to this assistance
between Government and GTZ (para 81(a)).  The Bank will directly finance 5
man-years of technical assistance, 207 man-months of international
consultants and 30 man-months of local consultants (Annex 4-7).
D. Oraanization and Nanaaement
61.       The project will be implemented through existing agricultural
institutions. Overall responsibility for project management will rest with
MINAGRI and major components will be implemented by SODECAO (operational
program), CENADEC (activities related to cooperatives), DEP-MINAGRI (policy
formulation and monitoring and evaluation activities), and FONADER (medium-
size plantation program). Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that SODECAO will at all times employ a general director, a deputy general
director, a financial director, a management controller, an agricultural
production director, a feeder roads director, and a workshop manager with
qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank (para 80(j)). A
condition for loan effectiveness is that the general director, deputy
general director and management controller will be in post (para 81(b)) and
that the financing agreement between Government and SODECAO has been signed
(para 81(c)).



-19 -
62.       The marketing cooperative component will be implemented by
CENADEC which will enter into an agreement with the Government for
executing the project on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
The signature of this agreement is a condition for loan effectiveness
(para 81(c)). Policy formulation and the monitoring and evaluation
component will be implemented through MINAGRI. (Details on monitoring and
evaluation are given in Annex 4-4.)
E. Proiect Costs and Financins Plan
Proiect Costs
63.       Total project costs over the five-year implementation period are
estimated at CPA? 89,609 million (US$285.4 million), inclusive of CFAF
9,313 million (US$29.7 million) of identifiable custom duties and taxes
(the latter primarily on supplies and locally purchased equipment).
Directly imported vehicles and equipment will be exempted from taxes and
duties. The foreign exchange component is CPAF 33,380 million (US$106.3
million), or 37? of total project costs and 42Z of project costs net of
taxes.
64.       Base cost estimates are based on an exchange rate of CFAF 314 to
one U.S. dollar (May 1987) and on June 1987 prices. The exchange rate to
the U.S. dollar has since appreciated.  However, the fore.gn exchange costs
denominated in dollars and the local costs denominated in CPAF have
increased within the margins estimated by price contingencies. Total cost
estimates include contingency allowances for (a) physical contingencies (at
10? for civil works, vehicles, equipment and operating expense, and 5? for
supplies and consultancy services); and (b) price contingencies. For (b),
price. contingencies on foreign costs have been calculated according to Bank
guidelines and have been estimated at 31S for 1987, 1? for 1988-1990, and
3.5? for 1991. Price contingencies on local costs have been estimated at
9? throughout the project life. Total contingencies amount to CPA? 17,531
million (US$55.8 million), or 242 of the baseline project cost estimate and
20? of total costs. Detailed cost estimates are in Project File No.
229.602(C4). Annex 4-8 gives summaries of total project costs (Table 1),
by year (Table 2), and by component (Table 3).
Financing Plan
65.       The loan of US$103 million covers 45? of project costs net of tax
and farmer contributions, or 36? of total project costs.  (Z will finance
the technical assistance costs for the cooperative component (US$3
million). The Government will finance US$150.6 million (inclusive of tax
of US$29.7 million) andt the project beneficiaries will finance the
remaining US$28.8 million to cover part of the fungicide treatment (US$12.5
million), and small equipment and other farm inputs not financed by the
Government (US$16.3 million). The financing plan is given in
Annex 4-9.



- 20 -
66.       The loan of US$103 million will be made to the Government at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 20-year period, including a
5-year grace period. Together with the Government's contribution to the
project, the total amount of US$285.4 million will be made available to
executing agencies as grants. The distribution of funds by agency will be
as follows: SODECAO (US$252 million), MINAGRI (US$1.2 million), CENADEC
(US$10.1 million) and FONADER (US$22.1 million). Annual work programs and
budgets will be prepared separately by each executing agency and submitted
to the Bank for approval ;o later than March 31 of each year.  Assurances
to this effect weie obtained during negotiations (para 80(k)). SODECAO's
budget will be reviewed in conjunction with its achievement of specific
annual targets (Annex 4-3). Conditions for loan disbursement are that by
October 15 of each year (a) SODECAO will have met the personnel and
operating cost reduction targets for the preceding fiscal year; and
(b) the cocoa producer prices and prices for fungicide treatment
corresponding to the following 12-month period will have been determined in
a manner satisfactory to the Bank and formally announced (para 82(b)).
67.       To assure the smooth start-up of the project, the Government will
deposit an advance corresponding to about three months of project
expenditures into a SODECAO account (US$6.3 million equivalent) and a
CENADEC account (US$0.2 million equivalent). The opening of these accounts
and these initial deposits is a condition for loan effectiveness (para
81(d)). Thereafter, SODECAO and CENADEC accounts will be replenished by
the Government before the end of each quarter to the level of three months
of estimated expenditures. To expedite disbursements, a revolving fund of
US$1.3 million will be established in a special account to be opened in a
commercial bank. Agreements on the replenishment of SODECAO and CENADEC
accounts and on procedures for payments out of the special account were
obtained during negotiations (para 80(1)).
F. Accounts and Audit
68.       The SODECAO financial director (under the supervision of the
general director) will be responsible for administering the financial and
accounting aspects of the project. The Financial Department will be
controlled by the MCU through internal audits. The general director, in
cooperation with the department directors, is already responsible for
preparing the SODECAO budget to be submitted to the Government for
approval. SODECAO and CENADEC will improve their current accounting
practices. Furthermore, SODECAO, CENADEC and FONADER will (a) have their
accounts audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank;
and (b) submit certified copies of the audited accounts and the auditors'
report to the Bank within six months of the end of each project year.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations regarding these arrangements
(para 80(m)).



- 21 -
G. Procurement and Disbursement
69.       The SODECAO Procurement Unit is responsible for all procurement,
and controls stores at SODECAO headquarters and in the field. The Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures used by SODECAO have been reviewed and
found acceptable to the Bank. All goods, works and services financed by
IBRD will be procured following Bank guidelines. Contracts for US$100,000
equivalent or more will be awarded through International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in accordance with IBRD guidelines. Contracts below
US$100,000 equivalent will be awarded through LCB according to local
procedures. Bidding documents with respect to all contracts for works and
goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$150,000 or more will be
subject to prior review by the Bank; they will cover about BOX of total
contract value. Procurement arrangements are given in Annex 4-10; amounts
to be financed by the IBRD loan are shown in parentheses.
70.       The IBRD loan will be disbursed as follows.

71.       The loan of US$103 million is expected to be disbursed over a
seven-year period (Annex 4-11). The disbursement schedule follows that of
the Bank standard profile for agricultural projects in Cameroon, which
reflects the schedule of project inputs more accurately than the Western
Africa regional profile for perennial crops. Disbursement against vehicles
and equipment, farm equipment, chemical inputs, and salaries and allowances
of internationally recruited staff will be fully documented. Disbursements
for training and studies will be against certified statements of
expenditures certified by the directors of the executing agencies. Full
supporting documentation, showing costs incurred and work completed, will
be retained for review by independent auditors and Bank supervision
missions.
H.   Production. Markets and Prices
72.       Incremental cocoa production resulting from SODECAO programs
supporting smallholder replant.ng (45,000 ha), infilling (35,000 ha), and
further development of immature plantations (17,000 ha), and from the
plantation program (4,000 ha), will peak at approximately 38,000 tons in
year 2000 and will represent 382 of the country average 1983-85 production
(Annex 4-5). Because of its relatively small size, incremental production
will not materially affect world market prices. No problems are
anticipated in finding outlets for the increased production since
Cameroon's cocoa is marketed through established channels, in the
Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. Future prices and revenue, however,
will depend on world market conditions. The Bank forecasts an increase in
world supply of 1.72 p.a. and in world demand of 1.92 p.a. from 1985 to
2000. In constant 1987 centslkg, the world price is expected to drop from
204 in 1987 to 185 in 1990 and then rise to 207 in 1995. This price was
the basis for valuing benefits in the economic analysis. The producer
price used in the farm budget analysis is the price currently received by
farmers (CPAF 420/kg).
I. Financial Results. Benefits and Proiect Risks
Financial Results
73.       The impact of the project on producer income is discussed in
Annex 3-2. The farm budget analysis shows that with constant real producer
prices, the return per man-day for new plantings of hybrid varieties is 352
greater than for new plantings of traditional varieties. A sensitivity
analysis has been carried out under the more favorable assumption of a 15S
real producer price increase. Under this assumption hybrid varieties have
an even greater advantage than traditional varieties. In this case the
return per man-day for hybrid trees is 712 greater than that for
traditional ones. With a 152 decline in real producer prices, hybrid
varieties still have an advantage over traditional varieties, but it is
limited. Farm budget details are given in Project File No. 229.602(C6).

Economic Benefits
74.       The major benefit expected from project activities is a more
dynamic cocoa industry with a viable framework of incentives and
institutions and technologies to support its development. This will
overcome the current stagnation in the cocoa subsector and lead to an
increase in production (of 38,000 t/year by the year 2000), improve the
balance of payment, and raise the standards of living of participating farm
families. SODECAO's planting program is economically profitable, at an
economic rate of return (ERR) of 18?, with very small sensitivity to
changes in. variables such as costs and prices. (The major assumptions in
the economic analysis are shown in Annex 4-12 and details are given in
Project Pile No. 229.602(C7).) If extension costs were evaluated at the
lower levels resulting from changes under the project and if SODECAO's
increased efficiency were to bring a cost reduction of 10?, the ERR would
increase from 182 to 202.   Even with a 10  greater fall in world prices
during the next five years than is currently projected, the ERR would
remain above 10?.
75.       The project will also benefi: the country as followst
(a) the pricing system and planting bonus to be Implemented under the
project will improve farmer incentives over the long-term (para
36(a) and (b))s
(b) the increased effectiveness of a major government development
agency (SODECAO) will result in substantial budgetary savings and
in an improved capacity for planning and management (para 39);
(c) externalities from the project road programs will lower transport
costs of crops other than cocoa and will have other social and
economic benefits (para 50). Foodcrops and coffee production
will improve;
(d) the strengthening of marketing cooperatives will result in lower
marketing costs and higher farmer participation (para 53); and
(e) the impact on the environment will be positive (para 79).
76.       The project will also have a significant impact on national
income distribution. About 90,000 farm families, most of them with incomes
below the poverty line, will benefit from the project and their income per
man-day on new plantations will increase by 50-75Z, depending on the
region. In addition, the plantation program will have the positive effect
of attracting young farmers and investors.

Risks
77.       The project will build upon the lessons learned from the First
Cocoa Project so that normal iisks associated with projects of this nature
are minimized. Everything possible has been done to guard against
technical risks. Although relatively effective, SODECAO extension services
and performance will be further improved undor the project (para 46). The
technical package, unsuccessfully extended under the First Project, has
been modified. Black Pod control is now more efficient, less labor
intensive, and further improvements are expected during the project. Mass
spraying to control Mirids has been proven in the SODECAO Region and will
be improved in terms of timeliness of the operation and costiha (para 47).
There is a small risk that some farmers may use quantities of fungicides
too small for effective treatment due to the phasing out of subsidies.
This risk has been minimized by the provision of a more effective chemical
on (para 29), better producer incentives (para 36) and monitoring systems
(para 40). The replanting program is prudent; it barely exceeds SODECAO's
current program and will be carried out more efficiently under the project.
78.       The risk of the country losing its comparative advantage in cocoa
production due to lower initernational prices is smalls future annual prices
would have to be consistently 202 below the Bank's forecast before new
investments in cocoa become uneconomic. The risk of not improving
SODECAO's efficiency is minimized by (a) a personnel policy reform causing
staff remuneration to be linked to performance, and (b) the strengthening
of MCU (para 39).  The risk associated with marketing cooperatives has been
ndnimized by using approaches and an organization (CENADEC) that have
proven successful in reorganizing marketing cooperatives in southwestern
Camqroon.
J. Environmental Impact
79.       The project will have a positive impact on the environment.  The
soils planted with cocoa being subject to erosion, dense cocoa plantings on
the contour and under light shade -- and the underlying mulch created by
decaying leaves -- offer excellent protection against this risk. Through
increased supervision the project will also seek to reduce the quantity of
insecticides used. Also, the farmers' progressive financial contribution
to fungicide costs will sharpen their awareness of the need to reduce
wastage and misuse of fungicides for Black Pod control. Finally, all
pesticides will be made available in low toxicity formulations (para 31).

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
ANALYSIS OF COCOA INCENTIVE POLICIES
Current Policies
Output pricintRnolic.es. The producer price situation in
Cameroon is similar to that in other Western Africa countries. Pricing
policy is based on the "Bareme' system of controlled producer prices and
marketing margins, which keeps prices low so that net taxation is positive
every year. On average since 1970 cocoa farmers have received only 49? of
the farmgate value for their cocoa (Table 1). While in 1984/85 the
Cameroon producer price was 482 of the export price, in C6te d'Ivoire and
Togo it was 471 and 442 respectively (Table 2).
These low prodticer prices have had a significantly negative
impact on production and investment. There is evidence of positive, though
lagged supply response to prices (Table 3). It is probable that the
depressing impact of low producer prices on production has been more marked
in Cameroon than in other Western Africa countries because, with the advent
of oil revenue, the price of labor and competing foodcrops has grown more
rapidly in Cameroon.
The replanting bonus was introduced by Governmental Decree in
1977 to induce farmers to plant cocoa, using advanced hybrid seedlings.
The program had several dimensions and involved a number of interventions
aud subsidies. The Government provided extension assistance, free
seedlings and a bonus to farmers. This program had a limited impact partly
because the bonus did not adequately compensate farmers for income loss due
to the destruction of old trees. In 1985 a more substantial bonus (CPAP
200,000/ha in two installments) was introduced, but only for farmers
willing to plant more than five hectares. If the bonus were extendee to a
larger group of farmers, it would considerably improve farmers incentives
to plant cocoa.
Input subsidies are large because the Government distributes
pesticides free of charge to farmers. These subsidies are financed from
ONCPB revenues.        t
Cocoa requires chemical plant protection against the Mirid pest
and Black Pod fungus. Tne subsidization of capsid control is justified by
the need to treat the entire cocoa area. Since there are no such
externalities in the treatment of Black Pod fungus, there is no reason to



- 28 -
Annex 3-1
Page 2 of7 7
fully subsidize Black Pod treatment. To avoid wastage and inefficiency
associated with free distribution of chemicals, individual farmers should
be required to pay at least part of them. The Government's intention is to
progressively reduce input subsidies over the Sixth Plan period.
Directions for the Reform of Cocoa Incentive Policy
Producer Price. The existing price setting mechanism has been a
major factor in the country failing to boost cocoa plantings at a time
(1980 to 1985) when conditions were favorab'e (i.e., a combination of high
world prices and oil revenues as a substitute for the cocoa tax). A new
price setting mechanism is called for.
Revisions to the existing pricing system should have the
following objectivest
(a) sharing surplus export revenues in times of high world
prices between the Government and farmers as a means to
boost cocoa plantings when world conditions warrant it;
(b) ensuring a minimum producer price that would provide an incentive
in maintenance, harvesting and replanting activities at least at
historic rates;
(c) establishing a closer relationship between world market
prices and domestic prices;
(d) dampening extreme price movements; and
(e) providing minimum Government revenues to finance direct
public sector support to the cocoa industry.
At present the price paid to farmers has two elements:
(a) a base 'price paid at the time of delivery of the beans by the
farmerj and
(b) a bonus paid after the end of the marketing season.
These prices are both announced by ONCPB before the start of the
harvesting season. The base price should be maintained in real terms from
year to year except in years of low world prices when the adjustment would
be postponed. In order to permit the bonus to reflect changing market
conditions it should be announced at the end of the marketing season and
based upon export revenues and the status of stabilization funds.

Annex 3-1
Page 3 of 7
The farm budget analysis sumnarized in Table 4 shows that with a
basic price of CFAP 420/kg and typical yields of existing material the
returns to labor in cocoa production are only equivalent to the opportunity
cost of labor. Some improvement is achieved by use of improved planting
material and techniques as under the project. Adoption of the pricing
policy outlined above which should result in an increase of about 15? in
producer prices and even with introduction of charges for inputs, would
result in returns to labor at least 50X above the opportunity cost.
Planting Bonus.   The recommended minimum producer  price  takes
into account  the  existence of  a  CPA? 200,000/ha  planting  bonus.   The
Government would lower the eligibility criteria from 5 hectares to 1
hectare.
Funticide Subsidy. The subsidy on fungicides would be reduced
from 1002 at present to 502 in PY5. SODECAO would sell the fungicides when
farmers sell their cocoa.
Domestic and  Export  Trade Regulation.   The  Cameroonian  cocoa
trade is rigidly controlled by'ONCPB regulations. At present, entry by new
traders is restricted, l*censed traders are given quotas, and transport
allowances are unrelated to actual cost. Under the project the Government
would rationalize the regulations (Annex 4-1) and would assist the
reorganization of the internal marketing system to liberalize cocoa
purchasing practices  and to  increase  competition among  exporters.   The
prices specified in the Bareme would be reviewed to ensure adequate
fairness to all parties. The ongoing internal market study would provide
specific recommendations.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE COCOA EXPORT MARXETING STUDY
The purpose of this study is to assist ONCPB management in
improving cocoa export marketin8. This work will draw on the previous
analysis of domestic cocoa marketing (which included a survey of consumer
attitudes toward Cameroon exports). The emphasis will be on practical
measures to improve net export earnings, financing and payment arrangements
and competitiveness in world markets. Recommendations would include
actions that could be taken in the short-term (within one campaign) as well
as options for longer term adjustments.
The study will identify and, to the extent possible, quantify
current and prospective losses due to current export marketing
arrangements. More importantly, specific actions to eliminate such losses
will be presented. The consultants will base their assessment on surveys
of the international cocoa trade shippers in Cameroon, ONCPB, the banks
involved, freight companies and available data. The following major topics
will be considered:
(a) Demand for Cameroon cocoa and cocoa products (building on earlier
study): (i) current market niche; (ii) scope for increased
demand among traditional buyers; (iii) scope for new demand; and
(iv) alternative suppliers.
ib)  Competitive position as viewed by importers:  (i) price; (ii)
reliability (in terms of delivery and grade); (iii) impact of
administrative controls and documentation requirements (paper
work); and (iv) other factors.
(c)  thipping arrangements includings  (i) terms of current contracts
(FOB vs CIF); (ii) efficiency of current liner conferences
(including all discounts or premia); and (iii) alternative to
liner conferences.
(d)  Mechanics of export saless (i) overview of recent pricing perfor-
mance (relative to market average and competitors); (ii)
,comparison of prices received by ONCPB with those prevailing in
dealer cash market, consumer market, and terminal market; (iii)
current decision rules as to forward pricing and stockholding;
(iv) prices received from non ONCPB sales; and (v) possible
alternatives for ONCPB detaining best possible price, including
decisions as to when to sell, how much to sell, and rules for the
sales auction.

Annex 3-2
Page 2 of 2
(e) Financial managementt (i) managing foreign exchange risks; (ii)
returns from current ONCPB cash balances; (iii) possible applica-
tion of short-term trade credit for commercialization pre-export
credit requirements; (iv) risk management to preserve purchasing
power of cocoa exports (forward sales, futures and options) under
different market circumstances; and (v) regularized system to
evaluate trading performance.
(f) Long-term strategys (i) proportional efforts; (ii) better
integration with world markets and scope for increased
competition; and (iii) easier direct foreign investment by cocoa
consumers and traders.
This study would also identify specific areas for follow-up
technical assistance for ONCPB. This could include temporary postings of
outside experts to assist in implementing recommendations in the area of
trading and financial management. In addition, overseas training opportu-
nities for ONCPB staff and others should also be identified by the study
and funded through the technical assistance component of the project.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
STATEMENT OF POLICY
Increased cocoa production is an important goal of Cameroon's
agriculture strategy. To reach the Sixth Plan objective of producing
180,000 tons of cocoa annually by the year 2000, the Government included in
its strategy increased production incentives, more efficient marketing
systems, improved support services for the delivery of technical advice and
inputs, and rerAoval of constraints to the expansion of new plantations.
Over the period of the project, which broadly coincides with the Sixth
Plan, the Government vill make a number of policy reforms in these areas.
1.   Producer Incentive Policy
Although Cameroon has a definite comparative advantage in cocoa,
production has been stagnant for the last decade despite the existence of
various support programs. In order to provide increased incentives to
farmers, the Government plans to strengthen the link between the national
price of cocoa and its world price, while dampening extreme price
fluctuations and guaranteeing a basic minimum price to the producer.
In implementing such a policy the present system provides for
yearly adjustments of producer prices, which consist of two partst (a) a
base producer price to be announced annually before the harvest; and (b) a
premiihm to be distributed by ONCPB after the marketing season. The base
price for grade I and II cocoa will be fixed at no less than CFAF 420/kg
an!d at least maintained in real terms (1986187 constant prices). It will
be adjusted annually to the extent possible for inflation according to the
cost of living index in Cameroon. The level of the premium will be set so
as to ensure that the producer receives a substantial share of the export
value of the crop, after taking into account the guaranteed minimum price
and marketing costs, and the reserves available in ONCPB. Added to this
system for increasing farmer revenues, the marketing of cocoa by-products
started in 1986/87 will continue.
Finally, the Government presently offers a planting bonus fixed
at CFAF 200,000 per hectare for all producers who plant a minimum of five
hectares.' To further improve producer incentives, the Government will
lower this eligibility criterion from five to one hectare.
Furthermore, to reduce input wastage and misuse by farmers, the
Government will introduce a charge on pesticides for Black Pod treatment.
This charge will increase from 25 cf product cost in the 1989/90
harvesting season starting in August 1989 to at least 50Z by the end of the
project, subject to an annual review of the effect of earlier price
increases on pesticides demand.

2.   Cocoa Marketina and Cooperative Policy
To increase the efficiency of cocoa marketiag in SODECAO's area
of operation, the Government vill reform its marketing and cooperative
policy before August 31, 1988 providing, among other things, for a close
coordination between the two ministries (MINAGRI and MINCI) involved in
overseeing crop marketing and cooperative development. To that effect the
Government will establish an appropriate institutional framework. Changes
in the cocoa marketing system will aim ats
(a) improving the quality of cocoa and thus increase cocoa revenues;
(b) reducing the internal and external marketing costs of cocoa,
including ONCPB costs related to cocoa;
(c) ensuring through an improved system of farmer participation in
internal cocoa marketing via reorganized cooperatives that cocoa
is bought from farmers on time and paid for at the set rate; and
(d) liberalizing the marketing operations of private exporters.
The new marketing system will be designed on the basis of the proposals of
the internal cocoa marketing study and its implementation agreed upon
before March 31, 1988 a'fter consultation with the Bank.
To develop marketing cooperatives functionning on sound
cooperative and business principles, the Government will assure that.:
(a) cooperatives will be fully responsible for the staff they
utilize;
(b) cooperative activities will be rationalized and remunerated
adequately; and
(c) the number of staff will be brought down to an appro-riate level
within a reasonable time.
The reorganization of cooperatives will apply to CENADEC and to
all cocoa marketing cooperatives in the SODECAO Region. The recently
created two cooperative unions will be rendered operational so that they
can provide the services required to help reorganize cooperatives and
assist them in reaching a level of self-sustained development.
The final report of the cooperative study to be presented after
the finalization of the ongoing cooperative and CENADEC audit will be the
basis for a comprehensive reorganization of CENADEC and the cocoa marketing
cooperatives in the SODECAO Region and for the organization of the
cooperative unions. Its implementation will be agreed upon by the
Government after consultation with the Bank, before March 31, 1988.

3.   Institutional SuDDort to Cocoa Production
To eliminate overlaps and duplication of activities between
MINAGRI's provincial delegations and SODECAO, the Governmeut has clarified
their respective area of responsibilities through a new regulation and will
assure that it is implemented.
MIMAGRI's grovincial delegations are responsible for the
Iformulation and implementation of production support and crop protection
activities outside the SODECAO area (Center Province, South Province and
Ndom and Ngambd Departments of Sanaga Maritime, Littoral Province). In the
SODECAO Region, each delegation is in charge of (a) evaluating SODECAO
activities and progress in the field; reports -- including achievements,
problems and recoimendations -- will be transmitted to the Minister of
Agriculture; and (b) collecting statistical data and measuring the impact
of SODECAO's activities.
SODECAO is directly responsible for the formulation and
implementation of all production support activities in its area of
operations (a) extension and experimentation activities; (b) training of
farmers and extension agents; and (c) production and distribution of
inputs. SODECAO will also be in charge of crop protection, i.e. (i) the
formulation of pe;!t control programs, and the implementation of pest
control activities in the field, and (ii) the monitoring and reporting of
results to MIMAGRI.,

COCOA REABILITATION PROJECT
SODECAO COST REDUCTION
Cost reductions would be pursued under the project to improve
SODECAO's efficiency. Personnel cost is the main area where savings can be
achieved, but some savings can also be made in other operating costs and
input subsidies. Personnel cost reductions would result from streamlining
SODECAO's plans for personnel organization and policy. After developing
departmental objectives and work plans, appropriate SODECAO staffing needs
would be defined for each unit in terms of number and qualifications of
personnel. Current staffing would be reviewed against these requirements,
leading to proposals of where and how unjustified positions could be
eliminated or downgraded.
The system of determining remuneration would also be reviewed.
In many cases, SODECAO staff in each functional category appear to receive
unreasonably high basic salaries and allowances in comparison to equivalent
personnel in similar organizations. The revised system of remuneration
should be based less on formal criteria (e.g., formal education, seniority,
etc.), and more on relevant experience and other job-related criteria. It
would provide for annual salary adjustments according to performance, which
would be reviewed during periodic staff evaluations.
T4ese recommendations mean that SODECAO personnel cost (basic
salaries plus allowance) would be reduced by 2? per year in real terms,
with 1986/87 as the benchmark, and other operating costs would be reduced
by 32. (Table 1) Cost reduction from these two sources would amount to
US$15.4 million US$5.2 for personnel cost reduction and US$10.2 million for
operating cost reduction (including agricultural inputs).   Details are
givenin Table 2. Savings from cost reduction would be supplemented by
savings from strengthened management control and more efficient cost
accounting and budget control procedures.
A third type of cost reduction would be achieved by charging for
part of the cost of Black Pod control chemicals, which are now fully
subsidized. Under the project, farmers would pay 25X of the cost in PY3,
increasing to 5OX in PY5. Assuming constant quantity and real prices, the
total SODECAO chemical savings would amount to US$12.1 million.
Total savings from the three indicated sources (except improved
management and control procedures) would amount to US$27.5 million in
constant terms. After price contingencies, they would reach US$34.6
million.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
MONITORING AND EVALUATION UNIT
The importance of establishing a dynamic cocoa industry in
Cameroon creates a particular need for effective project evaluation. The
project would extend work carried out under the Second Technical
Cooperation (TC-II) Project in the Western and Northern Provinces by
strengthening institutional development of TINAGRI, who would be in charge
of strengthening MINAGRI's MEU in the Center and South Provinces.  The bulk
of the existing SODECAO monitoring and evaluation staff would be
transferred to the new unit, which would perform a dual function for
SODECAO managements (a) data collection and analysis, and (b) advice. It
would also give the Government, especially MINAGRI, and the cofinanciers a
source of external information for effective project supervision and
assessment of performance. The internal monitoring of the SODECAO program
would still be done by a small unit of 20 (of which 15 would be
enumerators) headed by the experienced, recently appointed Cameroonian
agro-economist, who will report to SODECAO's general manager.
Besides the technical assistance provided by the TC-II Project,
some technical assistance would be needed to detail the design of the
monitoring system, train staff, develop a work program at the beginning of
each project year, assist in data analysis, and design short, specialized
studies on key issues which could be implemented in PY2-5. An appropriate
consulting firm would be contracted to provide these services based on a
series of 1-2 week missions totalling 4 months during the life of the
project. The first mission should take place within three months of loan
effectiveness and a detailed program should be ready for Bank review and
comments within three months after the mission. The consulting firm would
also arrange for other tra1inig needs of the Center-South MEU's staff,
including outside seminarsland study visits to projects with successful
monitoring and evaluation programs.
The MEU would have two main concernst (a) monitoring key project
activities for crop development with emphasis on cocoa, and (b) monitoring
the cocoa marketing situation both in the SODECAO Region and in the
Southwest. One monitoring survey based on small samples would be carried
out twice a year. Simple indicators, such as farmer reaction to production
incentives and marketing reforms, attendance at demonstrations, adoption of
practices suggested by technical messages, and purchase of fungicides
during the phasing out of subsidies would be used to detect problems in
project implementation. The MEU wvuuld have to be flexible so that, once a
problem has been identified, it could quickly gain additional relevant
information by using informal, non-survey techniques such as group
interviews and case studies.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS
For cocoa, SODECAO would provide free of charge, to the farmer, a
pre-selected blend of hybrid seeds, plastic bags and insecticides to
establish their own nurseries. The required planting material was
estimated at 1.4 million pods nationwide for 1986/87 (1.8 million in 1991).
This quantity would be aufficient to implement the SODECAO planting program
and to cover the needs of the rest of the cocoa subsector. Planting
density would be 2.5 m x 2.5 m or 1,600 plants/ha. The blend of hybrids
would minimize risks of sterility from auto-incompatibility and would
prevent an excessive uniformity that could adversely affect pollination and
increase the danger of pest damage. The basis for cocoa yield projections
and projected incremental production is shown in Tables 1. 2 and 3. The
extension service would promote the use of plantains or old cocoa trees to
provide temporary shade for cocoa seedlings and to generate some income
during the first three years after planting.
Plantain plants would be grown by the farmers or sold by SODECAO.
Controlled intercropping with other foodcrops would also be permitted
during the first two years after cocoa establishment. Maintenance will
also receive more attention than in the past with emphasis on (a) treatment
against Black Pod and M4irids; (b) crown pruning and sucker removal; and (c)
weeding and shade adjustment.
For coffee, a minor crop in the region, SODECAO would provide
free of charge, to the farmers, clonal planting material (1,300 rooted
cuttings per ha produced in SODECAO's nurseries). SODECAO's assistance
would also include crop protection services against scolytes.
For foodcroDs, limited technical packages are available.
Plantain production would be promoted and insecticide would be provided to
control plantain weevil infestation. For maize and groundnuts, emphasis
would be on seed dressing to prevent attack by bacteria, fungi and soil
insects, and on the distribution of limited quantities of improved maize
(TZB, TZSW and TZPB composite varieties) and groundnuts (Bertoua white and
red varieties). Foodcrops improved varieties and pesticides would be sold
at full cost.

COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
ADAPTIVE RESEARCH
The projett adaptive research program is designed to adjust
technology to the specific needs of a particular environment. Major goals
would be (a) to improve Black Pod and Mirid control, and (b) to test
foodcrop research findings under smallholder conditions.
For Black Pod control, the adaptive research program would aim
tot
(a) verify research results of new low-toxicity formulation of
systemic fungicides on farmers' plots on a large scale basis (100
plots of  1 ha).   Anteor Plus,  which is  a Cymoxanil  (82)  and
Copper Oxide (33X) combination, would be tested first and their
economic feasibility would be assessed;
(b) test whether one application of systemic fungicides used at twice
the recommended concentration and applied at the onset of the
Black Pod infestation would protect the pods 6 weeks instead of 3
weeks.   This  method was  successfully  tried  in  Brazil   for
Phytonhthora caDsici and Palmivora, but its efficiency was never
assessed on PhvtoDhthora menakarva. the most virulent species in
Cameroon;
tc) test new spraying technology in the cocoa canopy by using ul-
tra-low volume and electrostatic charging machines; and
(d)  determine  the  optimum  frequency  of phytosanitary  harvesting
(removal of diseased pods).
For Mirid control, the adaptive program would concentrate on the
followingt
(a) survey of the current status of MLrid resistance to Lindane
(Gamma-U(H) and other insecticides, and assessment of potential
increaselof non-target species5
(b) improvement of spray techniques to widen the possible choice of
insecticides by permitting the use of some less volatile chemi-
cals; and
(c) evaluation of the impact of mass-spraying.

A program of adaptive research on foodcrops would be undertaken
through the TLU. This concept has been introduced under the USAID-financed
NCRE project with support from the International Institute for Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) which provides high level researchers. The new TLU
concept aims at improving liaison between farmers and extension agents on
one hand and researchers on the other, in order to prepare better adapted
technologies and  facilitate  their  transfer to  farmers.   The  TLUs  are
attached to IRA and use IRA facilities. Each TLU is staffed with 2
expatriates (an agro-economist and an extension specialist) and 2 or 3
Cameroonian counterparts.
The TLU, within a particular homogeneous ecological area, is in
charge of:   (a)  agro-socio-economic  surveys;  (b)  on-farm  trials;  (c)
on-farm demonstrations of improved varieties and agronomic practices; (d)
training of extensioA workers; and (e) formulation of crop recommendations.
The TLU located ip Bambui is already in operation in the North-
west Province. Three additional TLUs would be established in the Littoral,
Western and Central Provinces.   The TLU in the  Central Province would  be
established in 1987 and would be particularly relevant to the SODECAO

ECONOMIC AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
Bconomic Analysis
In calculating economic costs, the investment was assumed to have
a 35-year life. Costs (in constant 1987 terms) include (a) investment cost
(labor, inputs, seedlings, etc.) of developing and maintaining the planting
prior to prpduction; (b) production costs (labor and other inputs,
including fungicides and pesticides) during the productive period; and (c)
the cost of SODECAO extension services evaluated at current full costs.
The cost df. family labor was valued at the opportunity cost of unskilled
labor in the project area (CFAF 1,000 per day). Costs were adjusted to
exclude Identifiable taxes and include physical contingencies.  Benefits
were calcula;tel  from  the  yield profile  of  each  region  evaluated  at
projected farmgate prices, which are based on the IBRD world cocoa price
projection. Based on these projections, and at an exchange rate of CFAF
314-US$1.0 FOB Douala cocoa prices in constant 1987 terms (net of insurance
and freight) are estimated to be CFAF 588, 531 and 663 per kg, for 1987,
1990 and 1995 respectively. Faragate prices, after deducting marketing and
transport costs, are correspondingly projected at CFAF 505, 448 and 514
respectively for 1986, 1990 and 1995. Under these assumptions, cocoa plRnting
has an ERR of 18%. The results are summarized below.
SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Switching Values at 122
ERR%               I Change         - I Change
In Costs            In Benefits
Point Estimate
Center                  20.8               47.2                 -32.0
South                   14.6               11.7                 -10.5
Average                 17.9                29.9                -23.0
The above ERRs would be improved if non-quantifiable benefits,
such as institutional and cooperative development, had been included, since
all costs-are included. If extension costs were evaluated at the future
lower levels resulting from the expected increased efficiency of SODECAO,
i.e., cost reduction of 102, the ERR would increase from 182 to 20%. If
costs were further reduced by another 10Z due to competition among traders
and improved marketing efficiency, the ERR would increase to 23%.

Sensit.ivity Analysis
ERRs are only slightly sensitive to changes in costs or benefits.
The sensitivity analysis of the ERR to changes in costs and benefits,
expressed in terms of switching values at the estimated cost of capital
(122), shows that a shortfall in benefits of 29X, or a rise in costs of
33Z, would be required to bring the ERR to 121. Sensitivity analyses were
also done for the two regions separately. In the South, which has a lower
rate of retun than the Center, a 10% increase in costs would reduce the
rate of return to 131, while in the Center the ERR would only be reduced to
19X. Other variables, which might have substantial impact on the ERR, are
cocoa,pricd and labor and input cost. The analysis shows that, if other
costs remain constant, cocoa price could drop more than 201 before any of
the ERRs became unacceptable. A 20% increase in the shadow wage rate from
1,250 to 1,500 CFAF per man-day would cause investment in cocoa in the
South and in the project as a whole to yield a return somewhat lower than
the opportunity cost of capital, but the Center would remain economically
viable. A 302 increase in input costs, mainly chemicals, would result in
the ERRs dropping just to 20, 15 and 181 for the Center, South, and
Project, respectively. With a combined 201 incrase in labor cost and a 30%
increase in input cost, investment in the Center would continue to be
viable, but not in the South. Overall, the analysis shows a robust return
for coco0 investment. Details are summarized below.
SUMMARY OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
ERR (%)
Center   South   Project
Total Costs Increase by 10%                          18.6     12.3    15.8
Total Benefits Increase by 101                       22.9     10.7    20.1
Cocoa Price Decreases by 102                         18.4     12.1    15.6
Cocoa Price Decreases by 131                         17.1     10.8    14.3
Shadow Wage Rate Increases to CFAF 1,500             14.0      7.8    11.3
Inputs Cost Increase by 302                          19.6     13.2    16.7
Both Labor and Input Costs Increase by 20 & 30%    13.1        6.6    10.3
Deterioration in the world market price of cocoa might be another
significant risk to the project.  A very depressed world market price, if
it dropped far enough, could make investment in cocoa uneconomic and/or
less attractive than competitive crops. Such a price disaster is not
anticipated. The long-term price prospects estimated by IBRD and
incorporated in the above ERRs, already provide for a significant drop in
prices below the current level prior to price recovery after 1990. But
since Cameroon has a substantial comparative advantage in cocoa production,
it can withstand a further 201 drop in price (below the IBRD year-to-year
projected values) before new investment in the Center Region, where most of
the coca is grown, beconmes uneconomic. In any case, world demand continues
to grow steadily and has the potential to work off sooner or later an
eventual excess supply situation.
