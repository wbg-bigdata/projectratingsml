MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A COCOA REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Republic of Cameroon for US$103 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD
terms and would assist the Government of Cameroon in financing a project to
help modernize the cocoa industry through reforms in the incentive and
institutional systems.
2.        Background.  Cameroon is relatively well endowed with natural
resources evenly distributed across the country. The growth of the economy
in the 1960s and 1970s (about 5? per annum) was fostered mainly by the
agriculture sector. With the advent of oil production in the late 1970s,
the rate of growth accelerated significantly to about 102 per annum from
1978 to 1985.   The economy has taken a sharp downturn since 1986 due to
the severe drop in oil prices, the decline in oil production, depressed
world agricultural commodity prices, and real appreciation of the exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar. Although Cameroon has been exemplary in
insulating the economy from the adverse impact of windfall profits from
oil, internal demand and imports have adjusted upward to oil revenues, and
significant structural imbalances have been built into the economy. The
main challenge for the Government in the short term will be to adopt the
austerity measures to offset the revenue losses from oil. In the longer
term, it will have to adjust the economy to lay foundations for a sustained
growth in the advent of declining importance of oil; the reserves are
projected to be exhausted by the mid-1990s. This will require a
medium-term strategy of accelerating the developrint of other sectors, of
which agriculture is considered the cornerstonae for promoting economic
growth.
3.        Agriculture has been the backbone of the economy in the past.
Before the expansion of oil production since the late 1970s, agriculture
accounted for 322 of GDP, 852 of export receipts (coffee and cocoa alone
accounted for 652), and 351 of tax revenue. Although agriculture still
employed about 751 of the labor force in 1985, it accounted for only 211 of
GDP and 27? of export earnings. After a period of reasonable growth of
4.72 (1960-73), the sector has become more sluggish with growth averaging
about 21 in recent years. The unfavorable weather during the period
1982-84 partly accounted for this poor performance, but the slow growth can
largely be explained by stagnant or declining cash crop production. The
sector is dominated by smallholder farming, producing much of the country's
two main cash crops, coffee and cocoa, and most of the food crops. The
Government's policy has been to raise smallholders' productivity and to
promote the modernization of the private sector.
4.        Cocoa, Cameroon's second largest agricultural export commodity
after coffee, accounted f,r 10? of value of total exports in 1985.  Its
production increased steadily until the late 1960s when it reached about



-2-
100,000 tons a year (about 82 of world production). Since then it has
stagnated around that level, although there have been a few peaks of
120,000 tons. Cameroon's share of world production is now only 6.52. The
Cameroonian stock of cocoa trees is relatively old (average age is about 30
years) because of insufficient replantings and few new plantings between
1970 and 1985.  The stagnation in cocoa output is a result of inadequate
producer incentives for both production and replanting; ineffectual
organization for providing production support and marketing services to
farmers; and declining yields (about 250 kg per ha) resulting from black
pod disease and old cocoa trees. Given the comparative advantage of
Cameroon in producing cocoa, the special quality of its cocoa products
which commands a premium in buying markets (France and the Netherlands),
and the importance of the commodity to the economy, the Government has
decided to step up its efforts to overcome constraints to higher cocoa
production. The measures to be taken include provision of adequate
producer incentives, increased efficiency in institutional support to the
cocoa subsector, and delivery of affordable agronomic packages with high
yielding 3rieties. These measures are addressed under the proposed
project.
5.        Project Objectives.  The project's main objective is to overcome
the current stagnation in cocoa output by helping modernize the cocoa
industry so that it becomes once again an important source of foreign
exchange which could be used to offset fast declining oil revenues.
This objective can be reached through policy/institutional changes and
measures aimed at alleviating production constraints and at strengthening
the main cocoa development agency, SODECAO.
6.        Proiect Description.  Over a five-year period (1989-93), the
project will contribute to: (a) improving the producer incentive system;
(b) increasing SODECAO efficiency and supporting its ongoing cocoa
development program; (c) reorganizing the cocoa marketing system and
strengthening the National Center for the Development of Cooperatives,
CENADEC; (d) establishing a private, medium-size cocoa plantation program;
and (e) strengthening the Ministry of Agriculture's capacity for
implementing the cocoa development strategy and monitoring its execution.
Reforms related to producer incentive policy, cocoa marketing and
cooperative policy, and institutional support to cocoa production are
described in the Government's Statement of Policy for the cocoa subsector,
agreed upon by the Government and presented in Annex 4-1 of the Staff
Appraisal Report. The Government has agreed to a pricing formula which
links domestic producer prices to world market prices and a system to pass
on surplus of export revenues to farmers. In addition, planting bonus will
be given to farmers to encourage new plantings, and subsidy on black pod
fungicides will be gradually removed. The Government will reform its
marketing and cooperative policy by reducing its parastatal marketing cost
and increasing the efficiency of cooperatives in marketing cocoa for their
members. The role of the various institutions providing production
support, and implementing and monitoring the cocoa development strategy is
also clarified. In addition, SODECAO's efficiency will be enhanced through
the strengthening of its Administrative and Financial Department and a
reduction in personnel and operating costs by respectively two and three
percent per annum in real terms.



7.        The total cost of the project over the five-year period has been
estimated at US$285.4 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$106.3 million (372). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
presented in Schedule A. Procurement methods and disbursements are given
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Cameroon are given respectively in Schedule C
and Schedule D. Two maps showing the SODECAO Region and the project
*        location are also attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6293-CM dated
January 25, 1988, is being distributed separately.
8.        Rationale for TDA Involvement.  The major rationale for Bank
support is that the project would revitalize Cameroon's most important
agricultural subsector, vital to stimulating ecor.omic growth, exports and
employment, offsetting to some extent the decline in oil production.
Because the cocoa development strategy involves a combination of policy
reform, investment, and institutional development in the cocoa subsector,
the Bank is in a position to contribute. Without the project, it is likely
that cocoa replantings and new plantings will come tc a halt. This will
further reduce Cameroon's share in the world market, despite its
considerable comparative advantage in cocoa production.
9.        Actions Agreed Upon.  Besides the Statement of Policy for the
cocoa subsector, the Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) the signature of an agreement with GTZ, SODECAO and CENADEC and
the employment of SODECAO's general director, deputy general
director and financial controller as conditions of effectiveness;
(b) the opening of bank accounts held by SODECAO and CENADEC in which
the Government will deposit an advance corresponding to three
months of estimated expenditures as a condition of effectiveness;
'c) the preparation of an agreement between SODECAO and the
Agricultural Research Institute, IRA, for adaptive research
before 30-June 1988, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank;
(d)  the adequate supply to SODECAO of planting materials from the
government seed farms; and
(e) the procurement of required crop protection chemicais by SODECAO.
i0.       Conditions for Loan Disbursement are that:
(a) the agreement will be signed between the Government, credit
agency (to replace FONADER), and SODECAO specifying the role of
each in implementing the medium-size plantation program;
(b) by October 15 of each year SODECAO will have achieved agreed
personnel and operating cost reduction targets; and



-4-
(c) the cocoa price and prices for fungicide treatment corresponding
to the following 12-month period will have been determined in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank. and formally announced.
11.       Benefits.  A more dynamic cocoa industry will translate into
increased production, estimated at 38,000 tons per year incrementally by
the year 2000, an improved balance of payments, and curtailed migration due
to a 502 to 75Z increase in the manday incomes of participating families.
The pilot plantation program will attract inrestors and young farmers. The
new pricing system will improve farmer incentives, and SODECAO's increased
efficiency will result in budgetary savings and improved planning and
management. The impact on the environment will be positive because
plantings of cocoa on the contour will reduce scil erosion. Insecticides
will be quantitatively controlled, and only low-toxicity pesticides will be
used. The reduction in fungicide subsidies will sharpen farmer awareness
of the need to reduce waste of such chemicals.
12.       Risks.  The project will take into account the lessons learned
during the First Cocoa Project. Risks associated with the technical
packages extended under the First Project have been reduced through
improvement and field testing; the strengthening of SODECAO's extension
services will enhance their efficiency and performance; the replanting
program is prudent in that it barely exceeds SODECAO's current program and
is financially viable. The risk of the country losing its comparative
advantage in cocoa production due to a drop in international prices is
minimal; future prices will have to be consistently 20? below Bank forecast
for new investment in cocoa to become uneconomic. Cameroon's cocoa growing
conditions ire excellent; the fundamentals of cocoa production permit
Cameroon to compete with any other producer in the world. The risk of
SODECAO not improving its efficiency has been minimized by including
personnel policy reforms linking remuneration to performance. The risk
associated with the posLibility of weak marketing cooperatives has been
reduced by using an organization, CENADEC, which has proved successful in
reorganizing marketing cooperatives in other parts of Cameroon.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.
