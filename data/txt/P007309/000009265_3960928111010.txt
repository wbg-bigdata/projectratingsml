intermediaries (FIs) at 8Z for onlending to the final
beneficiaries. For loans financing small-scale enterprises
(below US$100,000 equivalent), FIs would be charged 7Z, to
allow a larger spread as an incentive to support small-
_.cale industry. All subloans would be denominated ln
Gourdes. FIs would determine the lending rate to the final
beneficiary within the broad interest range authorized by
the Centzal Bank. The FIs would retain an adequate spread
in both cases, to cover administrative costs and credit
risks and provide them with a reasonable return. The
nominal foreign exchange risk would be borne by the
Government. However, given that interest rates are
determined within a broad range and ait the Haitian capital
market is open, a foreign exchange risk premium reflected
in the interest rate would be borne by the final borrower.

MEMORANDUM4 AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TEE
REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed Credit for
SDR 9.1 million (US$11.4 million equivalent) to the Republic of Haiti Is sub-
mitted for approval. The Credit would be for 40 years, including 10 years
4 4    grace, on standard IDA terms and would finance an Industrial Restructuring and
Development Project.
2.       BackRround.  Haiti's macroeconomic policies and performance have
improved substantially since early 1986, following a charnge in the country's
political regime. The economic distortions and the financial drain inherent in
Haiti's policies during 1980-85 resulted in significant erosions of the
country's living standards and finances. To alter the situation, Haiti's
economic policies from March 1986 to November 1987 focused on macroeconomic
stabilization and improvement of resource allocation and growth prospects.
This was accomplished through reforms of taxes, public expenditures, public
enterprises, industrial and trade policies, and agricultural pricing. The
reforms were extensive and swift, began to stabilize and restructure the
economy, and drew significant international support.
3.       The pace of economic reforms suffered, however, when, beginning in the
last quarter of FY1987, a series of constitutional crises compounded the
country's economic and financial difficulties. Historically, Haiti's desire to
keep the Gourde stable vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar has disciplined successive
Governments to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The shortfalls in
budget support grants and in gross aid disbursemenls that followed the 1987
crisis proved too big for the country to deal with during FYsl988-89. Although
the overall public sector deficit remained at around 6X of GDP, at the end of
FYs1988 and 1989 there were fiscal gaps of over G150 million (nearly 2? of
GDP), financed by monetary expansion, and the nation incurred external payments
arrears of about US$20 million. The parallel foreign exchange market premium
increased, from 52 in the early 1980s to 25X in 1988-89. Notwithstanding the
political, economic, and financial difficulties of FYsl988-89, thus far Haiti
has kept in place the basic fiscal and trade reforms th't were implemented in
1986-87. In FY1990, moreover, Haiti has undertaken to implement a financial
stabilization program, to be supported with an IMF Stand-by arrangement. It is
expected that provision of IMF resources would relieve budget pressures, as
well as pressures on the parallel market premium.
4.       As part of the Economic Recovery Program, supported by IDA Credit
1766-HA approved in March 1987, the Government of Haiti implemented major trade
liberalization reforms. All specific tariffs were replaced by ad valorem tar-
iffs, the tariff level was reduced to a maximum of 40?, from as high as 200?,
and import licensing for all industrial products was eliminated. Trade monopo-
lies, both public and private, were dismantled. Of the five public industrial
firms, two which were uneconomic were closed, and the remainder are currently
undergoing restructuring.
5.       Haiti's industrial sector consists mainly of import-substitution
industries, serving the local market and until recently highly-protected from
external competition, and the export assembly sector. It experienced its most



dynamic growth in the 1970's, at a rapid growth of 102 per annum in real terms,
due primarily to the establishment and expansion of the export assembly sector.
However, this growth has not been sustained, and, with the exception of a brief
surge of activity in 1982183, industry has stagnated since 1981. The indus-
trial sector contributes 16? to GDP and accounts for 7? of the labor force.
6.       Trade liberalization, illegal importation, and the prevailing poli-
tical uncertainty have changed significantly the operating environment for
local industry during the last two years.  Domestic industry, already under
expected stress from the trade liberalization reforms, had to endure added
competition from an upsurge of contraband imports, which intensified when
provincial ports, formerly closed, were opened up to international traffic in
1987. Industrialists who have been affected by contraband and/or trade
liberalization have by now internalized the market signals and begun to
formulate investment plans to adjust to the new competitive environment. The
scarcity of term credit is currently the main obstacle to materializing these
plans. Complex and lengthy incentive approval procedures, and inefficiency in
customs administration are additional constraints affecting the industrial
sector.
7.       To ease the cost of adjustment, the Government assigned to the Indus-
trial Development Fund (FDI) responsibility for providing technical and finan-
cial assistance to private industrial enterprises that wish to take appropriate
measures to restructure. The IDA Technical Assistance Credit (1786-HA), ap-
proved in May 1987, included, inter alia, an industrial restructuring component
aimed at advising private industrial enterprises on restructuring options. The
first phase of this component, designed to assess the industrial enterprises'
strengths and weaknesses and to indicate functional areas where an in-depth
study would be warranted, was completed in July 1987. The restructuring pro-
posals, completed under the second phase in May 1989 and partially financed by
the participating enterprises, include specific restructuring actions and
investments.
8.       FDI was established by the Government with IDA assistance in 1981 as a
second-tier institution, to finance medium- and long-term operations through
eligible financial intermediaries, mainly commercial banks. It is currently
the only source of term credit in Haiti. FDI was the beneficiary of the first
IDA Industrial Credit to Haiti, which was successfully completed in February
1987.
9.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's current lending strategy is to
support the Government's economic recovery program by focusing on the social
sectors, as well as maintaining and/or improving the economy's productive capa-
city. The proposed operation would assist industrial enterprises to restruc-
ture and adjust to a newly competitive environment. This would also strengthen
the Government's ability to continue implementation of trade liberalization
reforms. IDA's involvement is especially critical at this time, to ensure that
the trade reform's potential benefits result in a more dynamic, competitive,
and export-oriented industrial sector. In addition, through this operation,
IDA would be complementing the Government's parallel parastatal restructuring
efforts.
10.      Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would aim at providing tech-
nical and financial assistance to private industrial enterprises that need to
restructure in order to adjust to the new environment resulting from the trade
reform and to those enterprises (primarily small- and medium-sized firms) that



- 3 -
need financial assistance but no restructuring. Specifically, the project
would seek to assist firms to improve productivity and maintain or increase
employment, through financial restructuring, including divestiture of non-pro-
fitable activities, changes in or expansions of products and/or activities,
product quality improvements, reorganization of production processes, changes
in management structures, and in marketing strategies. In addition, the pro-
posed project would strengthen: (i) FDI's institutional capability to play a
more active role in industrial promotion; (ii) the Central Bank's supervisory
and regulatory functions; and (iii) the industrial regulatory framework.
11.      Proiect Descrintion.  The total project cost is estimated at US$24.6
million and would include: (i) an investment component (US$23.2 million), and
(ii) a technical assistance component (US$1.4 million). The investment compo-
nent would finance restructuring of private industrial enterprises and inves:-
ments by small and medium enterprises. New export-oriented and efficient
import-substitution investments, including the export assembly sector, also
will be eligible for financing. Of the investment component (US$23.2 million
equivalent), 43Z would be financed by IDA, 23Z by FDI, 10? by financial inter-
mediaries, and 242 by final beneficiaries. FDI would onlend the funds to final
beneficiaries at market interest rates, through financial intermediaries. FIs
would retain an adequate spread to cover administrative costs and credit risk
and provide them with a reasonable return. FIs would cover the credit risk for
subloans rediscounted by FDI, except for those portions covered by FDI guaran-
tees. The nominal foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government.
However, given that interest rates to final beneficiaries are freely determined
within a broad range and that the capital market is open, interest rates are
considered to reflect investors' perception of the relative return to assets
denominated in foreign and domestic currencies. As a result, the foreign
exchange risk premium reflected in the interest rate, would be borne by the
final beneficiary.
12.      The technical assistance component (US$1.4 million) comprises the
following: (a) US$0.8 million to finance consultant services to assist FDI in
implementing the project, explore broadening FDI's scope of operation,
strengthen its project preparation and extension service facility, and finance
training for FDI and selected financial intermediaries' staff in project
preparation, evaluation, and supervision; (b) technical assistance for the
Central Bank (US$0.1 million) to strengthen the Supervision Department's
internal procedures and the control and inspection of banks; (c) technical
assistance to customs administration (US$350,000) to finance staff training to
effectively utilize the new trade data system designed under the Trchnical
Assistance Credit (Cr. 1786-HA) and to set up an export verification system to
reduce the underinvoicing by exporters; and (d) assistance to the Ministry of
Finance (US$100,000) to finance studies to: review existing banking
legislation and regulations, particularly in the areas of risk classification
and capital requirements, and reform them to the Haitian context; review the
non-banking financial sector and the informal credit market, with the objective
of assessing their size and importance to the economy and the need for
regulation; and review the development banking sector, with the objective of
assessing the need for restructuring, consolidation, or closing of existing
institutions. A breakdown of the costs and financing are shown in Schedule A,
with procurement methods and disbursement amounts indicated in Schedule B. A
timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Haiti are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map of the country is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8013-HA, is also attached.

Aareements Reached
13.      The appraisal mission received from the Government a policy letter
assuring IDA that it would continue implementation of the trade policy
liberalization reforms and maintain a stable fiscd.l and monetary stance, in
consultation with the Bank and the DMP.  This policy letter would form part of
the processing package, including this operation and the proposed Economic and
Social Fund Project (FY91).
14.      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the followings
(a)      With the Government of Haiti on:  (i) continued implementation of
the trade reforms; (ii) taking the necessary actions, based on
studies completed under the Technical Assistance Credit (1786-HA)
and in agreement with IDA, to strengthen customs administration
and streamline customs procedures; and (iii) carrying out finance
studies including the country's banking legislation and
regulations, development banking sector and the non-banking
financial sector, exchanging views with IDA on actions to be taken
to implement the recommendations of the studies. Dated covenants
are included in the legal documents;
(b)      With the Government of Haiti and the Central Bank on:  (i) terms
and conditions for making available the proceeds of the IDA Credit
to FDI; (ii) interest rates to final beneficiaries and spreads to
FDI and financial intermediaries; (iii) retention of the foreign
exchange risk by the Government; (iv) capitalizing the proportion
of the cost of in-depth studies paid by FDI as part of the
restructuring subloans; and (v) taking the necessary actions to
improve the Central Bank's capabilities with respect to its
regulatory and supervisory role over the banking sector; and
(c)      With the Central Bank on:  (i) proper organization and FDI staff-
ing, including revival of the Project Advisory Comittee;
.ii) content of FDI's Statement of Policies and its Operations
Manual; (iii) eligibility criteria for participating financial
intermediaries; (iv) the basic content of the agreement between
the Central Bank and the participating financial intermediaries;
(v) maximum subloan size, subproject approval requirements, and
maximum guarantee coverage; (vi) replenishment of FDI's foreign
exchange resources; (vii) a free limit for IDA review to be set at
US$300,000 equivalent, and all restructuring subloans to have
IDA's prior review; (viii) semiannual review of the interest rate
to the final beneficiaries and the intermediation margin; and
(ix) FDI disbursements to be linked to compliance by the
enterprises to implementing reccommendations in the respective
restructuring plan.
15.      The signing of participation agreements, in form and substance satis-
factory to IDA, by the Central Bank/FDI and at least three participating
financial intermediaries, the signing of a subsidiary agreement with the
Government of Haiti and the Central Bank for the transfer of proceeds of the
IDA credit to FDI, and the amendment of FDI's Statement of Policy to incor-
porate the new conditions agreed under the proposed operation are conditions
of effectiveness.



16.      Benefits.  The proposed project would facilitate the industrial sec-
tor's transition from a highly protected environment, to one in which market
forces prevail. By providing foreign exchange financing and technical assist-
ance, it would sustain modernization efforts of export-oriented or efficient
import-substitution enterprises and reduce urban unemployment. Purthermore,
it would assist the Government to simplify the industrial regulatory environ-
ment and provide institutional strengthening to FDI and to the Central Bank.
17.      Risks.  If recent political instability were to persist, project
implementation could be adversely affected. Investment credit demand is high-
ly sensitive to the current unstable political environment, and restructuring,
as well as new investments, may be slow to materialize. Influential long-
protected industrialists might put pressure on the Government to reverse the
trade liberalization reforms. The above risks would be mitigated by the
strong pipeline of industrial restructuring proposals and the Government's
efforts to: (i) broaden the basis for an internal dialogue, through revival
of a public/private consultative committee; and (ii) provide adequate
financial resources to FDI to support the restructuring efforts. In addition,
the Government has committed itself, in a policy letter submitted to IDA, to
continue implementation of trade policy reforms.
18.      Another risk is that the banking system may be reluctant to increase
its financial exposure to the industrial sector--perceived more risky for the
provision of term financing--which in turn might slow down disbursements. The
project, however, is designed in such a way as to encourage participation by
the banks, by including an adequate spread and, in the case of the restruc-
turing component, by participation of the commercial banks in the drawing up
of the restructuring plans for some important clients. In addition, the banks
have gained experience in second-tier lending under the first operation.
19.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of IDA and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.
