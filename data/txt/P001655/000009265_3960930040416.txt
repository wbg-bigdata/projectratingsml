Terms:                     RBM would through an Apex Unit onlend US$27.4 million
equivalent of the IDA Credit to eligible PFIs in local
currency  at a  pre-determined  reference  rate.    The
reference rate would be determined by RBM as the
prevailing  average  cost  of  term  borrowing  in  the
financial system (about 13.625 percent in December 1990,
calculated as a simple average of all prevailing interest
rates on term deposits in Malawi).  PFIs would relend
the funds at market rates to finance viable subprojects
in the productive  sectors.   RBM would  pass  to the
Government the interest received from PFIs, less a 0.5
percentage point fee to cover RBM's administrative costs
for operating the Apex Unit. The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk out of the interest received
from PFIs.  The Government would provide US$4.6 million
equivalent  through  RBM  for  institutional  capacity
development to beneficiaries on a grant basis.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
FOR A FINANCIAL SECTOR AND ENTERPRISE DEVELOPPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendations on the proposed IDA
Credit  to  the  Republic  of Malawi  for  SDR  22.3  million  (S32  millicni
equivalent) are submitted for approval. The proposed Credit would provide,
through a combination of investment credit and technical assistance, term
resources through the country's financial intermediaries for investment 4n
all productive sectors.
2.       Background. Malawi's economic record has been mixed because of a
narrow resource base and small domestic market, both of which make the
country very vulnerable to external shocks. Stable growth between 1964 and
1978, with an average annual growth rate of over 5 percent, was followed by
stagnation between 1979 and 1981 and limited recovery between 1982 and 1985.
In the late 1970s, the economy faced a series of exogenous shocks and
domestic policy weaknesses that substantially reduced per capita income
growth. The shocks included adverse -erms of trade, high oil prices, and a
civil war in Mozambique that disrupted external transport routes and led to
higher transport costs. A prolonged drought in the early 1980s, an influx
of 800,000 displaced persons from Mozambique, rising fiscal deficits and
introduction of controls on imports and the rationing of foreign exchange
further exacerbated the problems.   Since 1987, the Government has been
implementing a new economic strategy, with the support of the IMF under the
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the World Bank's
Industrial and Trade Adjustment Credit and the Agricultural Sector Adjustment
Credit (ASAC). The macroeconomic objective of the strategy is the resumption
of higher levels of economic growth on a sustainable basis. Under this
strategy, Government is committed to the maintenance of an appropriate
framework in: (i) fiscal policy; (ii) the external sector; (iii) pricing,
especially agricultural pricing and in smallholder agriculture; (iv) the
financial sector; (v) the public sector, with emphasis on the parastatal
reform; and (vi) the exchange rate regime. The economy has begun to respond
positively to these policy measures. Real GDP grew by 2.9 percent in 1988,
is estimated to have grown by 4.3 percent in 1989, and is projected to grow
by 4.8 percent in 1990. Despite the breadth of the reforms, Malawi's future
growth faces some uncertainties because of several structural weaknesses,
especially in the industrial sector, that impede development of a sustainable
response.
3.       The  Government's  objectives  for  the  industrial  sector  are  to
increase and diversify industrial output, especially in the small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) sector, and maintain efficiency of industrial production,
while protecting the environment. These objectives are being pursued through
general macroeconomic and sectoral reforms, that have been supported by IDA
through ITPAC, which was approved by the Bank in June 1988 and has so far
been  successfully  implemented.       Reforms  under  ITPAC  have  included
deregulation of pricing, liberalization of trade and of foreign exchange
allocation, and a reduction in industrial licensing. The industrial sector,
which accounts for 12 percent of GDP, still faces several constraints in
maximizing its contribution to economic development. Government with support



from the Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS/IFC), has reviewed the
investment climate and identified several necessary reforms, which include:
(i) streamlining the regulatory and administrative procedures for business
incorporation and licensing; (ii) providing the institutional and incentives
framework  for  promoting  private   foreign  and  domestic   investment;
(iii) improving access to credit, especially for SMEs; (iv) promoting exports
by encouraging dtversification into non-traditional exports, and providing
adequate export finance; and (v) streamlining the allocation of industrial
lar.d leases, and involving the private sector in the development of
industrial sites and factory shells.   The proposed project will support
initiatives in these areas. The Government, with FIAS support, has already
drafted an Investment Policy Statement that clearly articulates its policy
on private investment in Malawi   Establishment of an investment promotion
agency will be supported under the proposed IDA Credit. The Bank has also
coordinated significant donor assistance and external resources for Malawi.
In industry, several donors are already involved (UNDP, USAID, UNCDF, KFW,
FMO, IFAD and the EEC), most visibly in the SME sector.
4.       The major issue in Malawi's financial sector, which is small and
fairly unsophisticated but with few distortions, has been its inability to
respond with flexibility to investor financing needs.  The Government with
IDA support reviewed the financial sector and identified necessary policy
reforms to deepen financial markets, improve efficiency in resource
mobilization and allocation.   Several of the reforms have already been
implemented including interest rate deregulation (rates are now positive in
real terms), and a revision of the regulatory and prudential supervisory
framework.   To further improve the performance of the sector, Government
proposes to:   (i) remove credit ceilings;  (ii) encourage competition by
allowing entry of new financial institutions and diversification of existing
financial institutions; (iii) rationalize tax incentives on financial
instruments; (iv) provide adequate financing and ease access to credit for
private sector investment; (v) encourage the development of money and capital
markets; and (vi) establish market mechanisms for monetary policy management.
These policy reforms have been agreed letween the Government, IDA and the IMF
and are reflected in the Third-Year Policy Framework Paper.  The proposed
project would support implementation of these reforms. The IMF has provided
technical assistance to the RBM to strengthen its regulatory and supervisory
capabilities and to help introduce a Capital Market Development Act (enacted
in 1990).
5.       Previous Bank Operations.  In industry the Bank has approved three
projects for Malawi (totalling US$81 million):   (a) ITPAC (US$70 million
equivalent) to support policy reforms; (b) the INDEBANK Loan No. 1610-MAI
(US$2.76 million) to support investment; and (c) the Industrial and
Agriculture Credit No. 2646-MAI (US$7.8 million) also for investment. The
credits in industry have all been successfully implemented and are either
closed or nearing completion, with a minimum of cancellations. A Project
Completion Report (PCR), No. 6334-MAI of June 27, 1986, was prepared for the
INDEBANK loan.   One of the most important lessons learnt from previous
operations is to avoid separate treatment of financial institutions in Malawi
through different onlending terms and conditions.   Experience from the
Industrial and Agricultural Credit (Loan 2646-MAI) found that INDEBANK's
borrowers were reluctant to assume the foreign exchange risk in an



3-
environment of major currency depreciations and no mechanism f.r c1.':ng
against such risks.  Lessons learnt have been incorporated in t1ii, prcjti't
through the equitable treatment of DFIs and by Covernment  ascumran   thle
foreign exchange risk.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed Project is defsig%t'd
to support Malawi's ongoing refoL.n program that seeks to diversify the
economy, generate employment, and alleviate poverty.  IDA has playcd a We)
role in assisting Government to restructure the economy, formulate strategiec
in the industrial and financial sectors, and in mobilizing significant
external resources.  The support has been underpinned by substantive economic
and sector work - an Industrial Sector Memorandum and a Country Economic
Memorandum were prepared by the Bank in 1989, and a Green Cover Frriancial
Sector Report was issued in February 1991. The impact of the policy changes
on the industrial and financial sectors have been impressive during the
period  1987-1990.   The proposed project will enable IDA to assist  the
Government in further improving the investment environment and strengthening
institutions engaged in term finance and promoting investment. The Project
would be complementary to a proposed IDA-supported Entrepreneurship and
Capital Market Adjustment Credit (ECMAC), which would focus on policy issues
in both sectors, and the activities of other donors in providing support for
economically viable production activities.
7.       Proiect Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to support
Government efforts to expand exports and improie the policy and institutional
framework relevant to private sector investment. These objectives would be
achieved  by:    (i) encouraging  commercial  banks  and  non-bank  finance
intermediaries to engage in term financing of viable enterprises in the
productive sectors, including SMEs and enterprises owned by women;
(ii) improving the institutional framework for export finance and investment
promotion, including support for a proposed investment promotion agency and
an industrial land and factory shell development program; (iii) supporting
the strengthening and operational diversification of financial institutions;
and (iv) improving monetary policy management.
8.       Prolect Description.  The  IDA  Credit   amount   (US$32  million
equivalent) would provide resources to finance investment and institutional
capacity development in key institutions.   The project would have three
components. The investment finance component (US$20.4 million equivalent)
would be onlent to eligible participating finance intermediaries (PFIs)
through an apex arrangement at the RBM to finance projects in the productive
sectors promoted by foreign and indigenous entrepreneurs. PFIs would provide
term financing through mechanisms such as leasing, equity finance and term
loans. To qualify as PFIs under these two components, financial institutions
would have to be in compliance with the provisions of the revised Banking Act
and meet additional eligibility criteria acceptable to IDA. The industrial
sites component (US$7 million equivalent), would ensure timely availability
of industrial infrastructure to industrial sites and factory shells to
facilitate investment by indigenous and foreign investors, especially those
investing  in  export-oriented  activities.    The  institutional  capacity
development component (US$4.6 million equivalent) would provide technical
assistance and training to: (i) strengthen RBM's monetary policy management
capability; (ii) assist Government develop the institutional framework for



-4  -
the promotion of foreign and domestic investment; (iii) support programs for
reorientation of the Malawi Development Corporation (MDC), and INDEBANK's
diversification into merchawnt banking and; (iv) restructure the Post Office
Savings Bank (POSB) into an autonomous and efficient financial institution;
and (v) train local financial institutions' staff in project appraisal-
related issues, especially the institutions that support SMEs and women
entrepreneurs.
8.       A breakdown of costs and financing is shown in Schedule A, Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and disbursement schedules are
shown in Schedule B. Parallel co-financing by other donors (EIB, USAID, and
EEC) is estimated at US$35 equivalent. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Malawi are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9096-MAI,
dated February 25, 1991, is also attached.
9.       Environmental Assessment.  The Malawi Government has established a
special unit to integrate assessment of environmental issues into ics
planning process.   The proposed project would use the unit to assess the
potential environmental impact of subprojects to be financed. The unit would
provide to PFIs and investors guidelines outlining the investments that would
require its endorsement before a licence to operate is issued.
10.      Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the
following: (i) implementation arrangements, onlending interest rates to be
market determined and exchange rate risk to be covered by Government for a
fee implicit in the onlending market interest rate; (ii) mechanisms for
assessing  the  impact  on  the  environment  of  subprojects  financed;
(iii) management of the institutional capacity development component;
(iv) terms of reference for the establishment of an investment promotion
agency; (v) a draft Investment Policy Statement; (vi) a letter of Government
commitment to reforms in the financial sector; and (vii) a draft statement
on the future development program for MDC.   To avoid gaps in financial
intermediary onlending operations and to maintain the momentum achieved
during project preparation, an allocation was made for US$1 million
equivalent for retroactive financing of expenditures incurred up to 90 days
before credit signing.   Reimbursement would be restricted to expenditures
incurred  under  the  investment  finance  component.           Conditions  of
Effectiveness would be: (i) adequate staffing of an apex unit in the RBM for
the management of Credit funds; and (ii) appointment of a committee to be
chaired by the Principal Secretary to the Department of Economic Planning and
Development to oversee the setting up of an investment promotion agency.
Conditions of Disbursement would be:  (i) that disbursements to each PFI,
under the investment finance and industrial sites components would require
the signing of a participation agreement between the RBM and that PFI; and
(ii) that disbursements for investment promotion activities would require
the establishment and full staffing of an investment promotion agency. Dated
Covenants would  include:    (i) development  of an action plan  for POSB
restructuring by September 30, 1991; and (ii) establishment of a steering
committee by September 30, 1991, to coordinate the development of capital
markets.

11.      Benefits.  The proposed IDA Credit would fill a major gap in term
financing for the productive sectors in Malawi. Using the existing
intermediaries, including the commercial banks and NBFIs, the project would
help strengthen institutional capabilities to promote, appraise and supervise
viable projects.   By increasing competition and the range of financial
instruments, the project would enhance efficiency in term resource
mobilization and allocation. Broader access to credit for investment will
encourage real sector supply response and contribute significantly to the
Government's growth and adjustment strategy. Investment promotion would help
diversify Malawi's base for foreign exchange earnings by encouraging
investments in export oriented activities. Initial investments are likely
to be in labor intensive productive activities that would help alleviate the
unemployment problem.   Support for SMEs will also benefit women,  three
quarters of whom engage in some form of off-farm income generating
activities.
12.      Risks.     The major risks are the possibility of an economic
slowdown, (which would discourage new investment), the conservative attitude
of banks and large enterprises, and Government slackening on reforms. Malawi
has in the past achieved high rates of growth, primarily through a steady
expansion in agriculture. Government's continued emphasis on the development
of agriculture as the mainstay of the economy, recent adjustment measures,
and its strong commitment to implementing the reform program should help
alleviate the risk of economic slowdown.  Recent industrial and financial
sector reforms have introduced competition in both sectors, which is changing
conservative attitudes and making banks and enterprises more responsive to
market forces. Another risk is the possibility of low investor response.
This risk is mitigated by the favorable investment climate which is being
created by the Government and the increased emphasis being placed on
investment promotion.
13.      Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the credit.
