1.     Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.     The energy sector was regarded as a key driver for economic growth and a contributor to
poverty reduction in Vietnam. The sector contributed to over a quarter of total foreign exchange
earnings from oil and coal exports. Energy demand had been growing 13 percent per year, faster
than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the five years prior to the project appraisal in 2002. The
energy sector expansion was deemed to help alleviate poverty by providing energy access to the
poor and mitigate environmental degradation by encouraging the shift from traditional to
commercial energy and making appropriate fuel choices.

2.      The major sector issues at time of appraisal included: (i) needs for large sector investments
and improvement in overall system efficiency, (ii) a low rate of rural access to electricity, (iii) weak
management of institutions, (iv) limited capacity to utilize renewable energy, (v) financial
sustainability of the power sector, (vi) environmental management, and (vii) lack of a
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework. The Government of Vietnam (GOV) had been
addressing these challenges with development partners including the World Bank. The System
Efficiency Improvement, Equitization and Renewables Project (SEIER) was part of a broader
program of investments agreed to between the GOV and the Bank, to address the above sector
issues. Within this framework, the GOV preferred to bundle cross-cutting investments to address
different aspects of the sector reform program into a specific investment loan (SIL) to be completed
in the same time frame, rather than through a more sequenced adaptable approach, such as one that
could be supported by an adaptable program loan (APL).

3.      The Project was in line with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 1999-
2002, which saw the International Development Association's (IDA) role for the power sector as
filling a niche not covered by other players and assisting the GOV in its poverty alleviation efforts.
The Project was consistent with the CAS focus on reducing poverty, promoting equitable growth
and raising productivity through provision of infrastructure. The Project was designed to support the
objectives of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for 2001-2002. The renewable energy
subcomponents of SEIER addressed the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Operational Program 6
on Climate Change: promotion of the adoption of renewable energy by removing barriers and
reducing implementation costs. The Project was designed to support a long-term programmatic
approach to strategically develop Vietnam's renewable energy sources based on the Vietnam
Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP) published in 2002.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

4.      The objective of the Project, as defined in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), was to
assist the Borrower to: (i) enhance electricity system efficiency in Vietnam; (ii) provide electric
power in selected rural areas of Vietnam; and (iii) sustain reform and institutional development of
the Borrower’s energy sector. The ICR chooses to use the DCA version because it is more
measurable and attributable to the Project interventions. The original Project Appraisal Document
(PAD) included a longer term objective that linked project results to poverty alleviation. As such,
the PAD included the following key performance indicators (KPIs): (i) number of additional rural
households with electricity (conventional and renewable), as well as indicators on social benefits
and income generating impacts; (ii) additional renewable electricity used to supply isolated
communes; (iii) increased efficiency, reliability and quality of overall power system services; (iv)

                                                   1
progress in implementation of reforms and maintenance of financial soundness of Vietnam
Electricity (EVN) and affiliated power distribution companies; and (v) development of a program
for creation of a creditworthy distribution sector. Annex 1 of the PAD provided more specific KPIs,
which did not set baselines and specific targets or include indicators on social benefits and income
generating impacts (see Annex 2 for details).

1.3   Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

5.     The global environment objective of the renewable energy components was to contribute to
reduced greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of electricity production using renewable
resources. The key indicator was carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduced.

1.4    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

6.      No change was made to the PDOs. The key performance indicators (KPIs) were revised and
adjusted during the first project restructuring in 2005. Some KPIs in the result framework were
modified to be more measurable and baseline and target values were set (see Annex 2 for details).
During the second restructuring in 2007, additional KPIs were added to the results framework,
especially for an additional implementing agency of a newly created Electricity Regulatory
Authority of Vietnam (ERAV), and were made more specific in the arrangements for results
monitoring. The June 2010 restructuring further adjusted the KPIs as part of the additional financing
to include modification of the ERAV related KPIs as well as new KPIs on the gas market reform
plan and financing capacity of EVN and the National Power Transmission Corporation (NPT) (the
final result framework, which incorporated all revisions is in Annex 2).

1.5    Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

7.     The Global Environment Objective (GEO) and key indicators were not revised.

1.6    Main Beneficiaries

8.      The Project’s investments in the improvement of transmission and distribution system
efficiency benefitted consumers of electricity across the country. The Project also expanded reliable
power supply to industrial zones, as well as to the rural poor and agricultural areas. The Northern
Power Corporation (NPC), Central Power Corporation (CPC), and Dong Nai Power Company
(DNPC) together benefited more than 5.9 million consumers with improved power supply, which
included rural consumers; the other implementing agencies also increased their numbers of
consumers and improved the quality of power supply.

9.     The rehabilitation of small hydropower provided power for rural areas and the Remote Areas
Renewable Electricity (RARE) subcomponent provided access to electricity for 460 new rural poor
households, and benefited an additional 1,176 households through rehabilitation of off-grid micro
hydropower. Nearly 600 ERAV staff and other stakeholders (EVN, National Load Dispatch Center
(NLDC), Ministry of Industry and Trade [MoIT], etc.) received training on power market, pricing
and other courses, and participated in study. The relevant policy framework and simplification of
the approval procedures for the promotion of renewable energy (e.g., development of Standard
Power Purchase Agreement [SPPA], Avoided Cost Tariff [ACT], etc.) benefited small power
producers (SPPs) using renewable energy.

1.7       Original Components (as approved)

10.       The Project components are listed below.

      •   Component A (US$183.6 million, of which US$115 million was IDA financed ). System
          efficiency improvement, focusing on upgrades of 500kV and 220kV transmission systems
          and demand side management (DSM). This component was also supported by a separate
          DSM and Energy Efficiency (EE) Project (P071019), financed by the GEF and the private
          sector, and closed on June 30, 2010, for which a separate ICR had already been prepared
          with a satisfactory rating for the overall outcome.

      •   Component B (US$151.2 million of which US$82.7 million was IDA financed and US$1.5
          million funded by the GEF). Improving rural access, including upgrading of 110kV sub-
          transmission systems, rehabilitation of small hydro and development of off-grid or mini- grid
          power supply using renewable energy.

      •   Component C (US$31.4 million, of which US$27.3 million was IDA financed and US$3
          million funded by the GEF). Institution building, including capacity building, support to
          equitization and improvement of EVN's management information system.

1.8       Revised Components

11.      The three core Project components were not revised but some sub-components and activities
were either revised or cancelled as a result of implementation progress and agreements reached
during supervision missions. The smaller changes were documented in mission aide memoires,
while others were covered through project restructurings and the additional financing. The detailed
list of changes to project sub-components is presented in Annex 2.

12.      The key changes to the Project at the 2005 restructuring were to make Components A and B
more programmatic in the selection of sub-projects to be financed. For Component A, additional
subprojects included 220 kV level 423 kilometers (km) of single and double circuits and 13
substations with capacity totaling 2,125 MVA (further sub-projects were to be identified); and an
additional sub-component of commercial metering at the transmission system interface with
generation and distribution was introduced. Component B included further investments of 122 km
of single and double circuit 110kV lines and 18 substations totaling about 560 MVA capacity. The
range of eligible subprojects to be financed under the RARE program under Component B was
expanded to include other modalities beyond hybrid renewable energy grid, and also allowed for
plants to cover privately-owned, village and province levels (in addition to commune level). Also,
during 2007-2010, Component 3 added more activities, including capacity building of ERAV,
institutional development of the gas sector, establishment of corporate financing units in EVN and
NPT and associated training. During the 2007 restructuring, the additional support to ERAV was
made possible through US$2.89 million that became available from the SDR appreciation and from
the reduction of RARE grants under the IDA Credit.

13.     Aide memoires recorded the following cancellations: (i) the Wind-Diesel Project as the
feasibility study found low potential of wind resource. The remaining funds were transferred to
MoIT to revise the Strategy and Master plan on Renewable Energy Development; and (ii) technical
assistance (TA) for Improved Maintenance Management at the EVN corporate structure was
changed. The funds were allocated to finance a Feasibility Study for the Interconnection between
EVN and China Southern Grid. Some activities that were not (fully) implemented and were not
recorded as cancelled in aide memoires were as follows: (i) Establishment of corporate financing
                                                     3
units in EVN and NPT and associated training; (ii) Strengthening of Project financial management
and (iii) Institutional development of the gas sector.

14.     Incomplete activities resulted mainly from implementation delays and evolving sector
needs. For example, contractual problems delayed implementation of the Financial Management
Information System and Material Management Information System (FMIS/MMIS). Some activities
were carried out by the implementing agencies with their own funding (e.g., FMIS/MMIS) or by
other Bank supported projects or TA. The installation and upgrades of a commercial metering
system were moved to be financed under the Second Transmission and Distribution Project (TD2)
due to the need to align with the power sector reform schedule. The equitization program was partly
revised during the 2005 restructuring to provide training to EVN and newly established power
distribution joint stock companies because it was decided there was no longer a need to create joint
stock companies and equitization at the commune or district level due to the lack of economies of
scale and capacity. After the equalization study was completed in 2006 and distribution systems
were upgraded, the Bank continued to monitor the equitization process. Most of these activities
were dropped as a joint GOV and Bank response to changing needs and environment, while
maintaining consistency with the PDO.

1.9     Other Significant Changes

15.     The Project was restructured three times, as Level Two restructurings according to the
current definition, and obtained additional financing (AF). The first restructuring occurred June 29,
2005, and was approved by the Board on a non-objection basis to adapt to changes and introduce a
more programmatic approach. During the second restructuring on November 13, 2007, two
implementing agencies were added and approved by the Regional Vice President (RVP). The third
restructuring of May 21, 2009, also approved by the RVP, was required to prepare for the AF,
support preparation of the Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP, Cr. 4564 VN), and
simplify the disbursement categories. The AF was approved by the Board on June 23, 2010 to meet
a financing gap resulting from cost overruns and to scale up support to other aspects of the power
sector reform.

16.    The Project’s closing date was extended three times. The first two extensions totaled three
years up to December 31, 2010 and were required to complete existing activities and prepare the AF.
On June 23, 2010, the third closing date extension to December 31, 2012 was approved by the
Board, along with the AF.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the Background Analysis

17.      The Project was designed based on recommendations of the underpinning major sector
study "Fueling Vietnam's Development: New Challenges for the Energy Sector" (December 1998,
Report No. 19037-VN), which served as a rationale of the Bank intervention. This report identified
the key issues and laid out a strategy for the sector. First, IDA lending would shift toward extending
access to electricity in rural areas. Second, IDA would increase the efficiency in the entire energy
chain and create creditworthy institutions, as well as improve corporate governance and rationalize
sector management. Third, the focus would shift toward mobilization of external financial resources
for the sector to ensure the country would meet its energy demands, providing services that would
facilitate private participation in the energy sector. This would include advisory services for putting

                                                  4
in place a transparent and independent regulatory framework and for promoting private participation
in distribution and renewable energy power plants.

18.     The investment components of the Project were developed to support the GOV with the
Vietnam Power Development Master Plan V for 2001-2010 and the Rural Electrification Master
Plan. For the technical assistance (TA) component, the key areas to ensure success of the power
sector reform were supported. Lessons learned from the relevant projects supported by the Bank and
other agencies were incorporated into the Project design. However, early lessons from the
Transmission, Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction Project (TD1) in the country on slow
implementation and disbursement did not appear to have been reflected in the project design.

Assessment of the Project Design

19.     The Project design included, for the first time in a Vietnam energy sector project, significant
IDA financing for institutional development, staff training and TA. This was appropriate, given the
sectoral needs in the context of the country’s growing power sector. Also for the first time the
Project sought to mainstream renewable energy. The economic and financial analyses were
conducted to select least cost options.

20.     The PDO as specified in the PAD entailed poverty alleviation, included as a higher level
objective to which the Project would contribute. However, this proved to be overly ambitious and
difficult to measure and attribute to the Project. In addition, the choice of the KPIs posed challenges
for evaluating project outcomes as explained in Section 2.3 (Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
Design, Implementation and Utilization).

21.      The Project design adequately addressed the expected challenges in improving efficiency,
extending access and implementing reform in a simultaneous manner, during a period of fast growth
of power demand by including consultant support to all of the implementing agencies. However, the
capacity of implementing agencies especially at local levels (e.g., province, district and commune)
was not comprehensively analyzed during project preparation. Since the Project components
included a range of sub-sectoral issues (transmission, distribution, renewable energy, rural
electricity access, equitization, community-based approach to electricity supply, power sector
reform, etc.), it ended up being very complex, involving a large number of implementing agencies,
including those at the provincial level, dispersed across the country. This approach was more
complex than what was adopted for other power projects in Vietnam. In addition, as the power
sector was undergoing reform, the institutional structure was also continuously evolving, and had an
impact on the Project as the number of implementing agencies had to be increased and were also
submitted to organizational changes. The Project preparation could have better assessed this context.

22.     In addition, community-based approaches to power supply operation and commune and
district level equitizations of power companies were relatively new concepts in the country, and yet
the Project was designed to mainstream this approach based on very few success cases in the
country. There was a lack of realism regarding the capacity of these local level organizations to
achieve a large scale up.

23.     Overall, the social and environmental safeguard issues were addressed adequately in the
Project design to minimize social and environmental impact and ensure compliance with the
relevant World Bank safeguard policies.

Adequacy of Government’s Commitment and Stakeholder Involvement



                                                  5
24.     Stakeholder involvement was adequate. Consultations among the central GOV and local
government agencies and people were held. Sites for commune based mini grids were planned to be
selected by direct participation of local people and authorities. A number of consultation and
workshops were also held with major international donors, civil society organizations and other
stakeholders. The GOV’s strong commitment could be seen from (i) the counterpart fund allocation
of about half of the IDA Credit amount at appraisal, (ii) their engagement in the preparation of
safeguard documents, and (iii) their approval of The Master Plan of Power Sector Development for
the 2001-2010 period in June 2001. The Project supported the investment priorities identified in the
Plan.

Assessment of Risks and Mitigation Measures

25.     In general, the risks associated with the project and measures to mitigate them were
adequately identified at the Project appraisal although there were some shortcomings. An overall
project risk rating was modest risk (M). Modest risks were rated for (i) low management capacity of
MoI, Provincial People's Committee (PPC) and EVN in rural areas; (ii) equitization program
implementation capacity; and (iii) schedule and cost overruns. These three ratings appeared
optimistic. The lessons learned from the IDA operations in the country highlighted the various
delays caused by approval procedures, foreign exchange shortfalls, financial difficulties of suppliers
and contractors, and insufficient on-time information and guidelines. The scale of business and
limited management capability and human resources in many districts and communes should have
been more realistically assessed.

26.      The risk rating for tariff increases and changing tariff structure was determined to be
substantial. This risk was mitigated by agreement of the GOV to increase average power tariff to
maintain IDA-agreed financial ratios. This tariff increase covenant was applied to all power sector
projects supported by the Bank and not specifically to SEIER, and was later removed from all
power sector projects as considered inappropriate. The PAD noted the rapid load growth and
economic growth and included a lesson learned on the need for good load forecasting to predict the
loading levels of transmission and distribution lines and substations. Accordingly, the risk of over-
estimating or under-estimating these growths could have been included, because it could change the
priority of energy investments and the need for project activities. In general, key factors
(institutional, financial, technical, environmental and social, and market) critical for Project
sustainability was adequately identified, which should have been fully reflected in the risks and
mitigation measures. There was no Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review of the project’s quality
at entry.

2.2     Implementation

Rapid Growth and Evolution of the Power Sector

27.     Soon after the Project became effective in February 2003, transmission and distribution
systems needed to keep up with rapid growth and change in patterns of electricity demand.
Implementing agencies responded to this by periodically reviewing and reassigning priorities of the
sub-project investments. Some sub-projects had been overtaken by events that made them of lower
priority, while other investments not included for financing under the Project had become more
pressing. Due to the time required for the Bank financing to become available (e.g. procurement
process, etc.), the implementing agencies financed some of the sub-projects that were included in
SEIER with other financing sources. For example, EVN financed the planned 260 km 500kV line
between Pleiku-Da Nang, which was worth US$ 45 million in IDA funding, with other financing
sources, and requested reallocating the IDA funding for other 220 kV investments (including lines,

                                                  6
substation, and upgrading). As the Project design was quite rigid, implementation progress suffered
until the programmatic approach was introduced.

28.    A programmatic approach was formalized through the 2005 restructuring so that additional
investments could be selected based on evolving demand. This was a pragmatic response to the
evolving situation in the transmission and distribution subsector and was seen as a first step towards
greater reliance on country systems and sector-wide approaches by increasing reliance on the GOV
and EVN and its subsidiaries' investment planning and prioritization. Consequently, while the
EVN/IDA procedures were made easier, implementing agencies still were required to follow the
complex and extended GOV approval process for each subproject. Subprojects still required a
process of feasibility study and detailed design and preparation of procurement documents which
required separate, sequential approvals. Yet, as a result of the adoption of the programmatic
approach, the MoI was delegated to approve EVN subprojects and EVN was delegated to approve
power corporation and power company (PC) subprojects while all procurement could be approved
by EVN. This was a significant improvement compared with project preparation when approval by
the Prime Minister was required at several stages.

29.    While this change in approach was a commendable achievement, it overlooked the longer
time required to prepare and implement additional subprojects, resulting in implementation delay.
The cause of these delays included (i) the long time needed to prepare feasibility studies, technical
designs and procurement documents for new sub-projects as most power-engineering consulting
companies in Vietnam were overloaded with projects financed by other sources to meet power
demand growth of 15 per cent per year; (ii) changes in some subproject sites due to changes in local
planning priority or difficulties with resettlement and compensation; and (iii) the need for new GOV
procurement approval in case actual costs after competitive procurement were higher than the
approved studies, as the market prices of goods had become increasingly volatile.

30.    The changing sector environment also affected the implementation of renewable energy
subcomponents. The rapid expansion of the grid and network resulting from the successful national
rural electrification program substantively reduced the scope of off-grid renewable energy
development that could be supported under the RARE component. Following recommendations of
the 2006 Mid-Term Review (MTR), the RARE program was rationalized while new activities were
introduced for the development of a sound regulatory framework for grid connected renewable
energy.

31.     The decision to scale down the original scope of RARE (from20 subprojects to 7) was the
best decision the MoIT could have made under in the circumstances the Project was facing during
the 2006 MTR. Whether the project could have foreseen the rapid pace of grid expansion and the
resulting decline in the need for mini-grid or off-grid energy services is unclear. By the end of 2000,
69.7 percent of households in Vietnam had an electricity connection, which itself is a high ratio
compared to many other countries in the region with a comparable development status. About 2,000
communes did not have access to the grid at that time, and the RARE program planned to provide
mini-hydro based mini-grids to 1 percent of these communes, with a forecast that it could be scaled
up to reach 200 communes. The GoV’s rural electrification plans expected to raise the
electrification level to 90 percent by the year 2010, with assistance provided by all the partner
agencies including the Bank. This 90 percent target has been exceeded, with much less off-grid
solutions than anticipated, and has now reached more than 97 percent coverage.

32.    To a certain degree, the MoIT’s assessment of the upcoming rapid grid extensions over the
period 2002-2005, which reduced the demand for off-grid or mini-grid services, was inadequate. As
reported by stakeholders, despite extensive consultations with NPC prior to Project implementation,
NPC expedited the grid extension programs, particularly since 2004. The multitude of funding
                                                  7
sources and the higher degree of autonomy to the provinces and to the PCs may account, in part for
the inability of the MoIT to monitor demand for off-grid services and make early corrections to the
RARE program, particularly before and during the Screening Study (2004). The corrections were
finally made in 2006.

33.    Regulatory changes also affected Project implementation. For example, additional work
required for land compensation and new clearance requirements for high voltage transmission lines
(Decree 69/2009/ND-CP and 81/2009/ND-CP) contributed to implementation delays.

34.   For the TA, particularly for the FMIS/MMIS subcomponent, uncertainty over changes to
EVN’s corporate structure contributed to implementation delays, although contractual problems
were also a contributing factor. Also, changes in EVN’s corporate structure led to cancellation of
the TA for Improved Maintenance Management.

35.    This rapid evolution of the power sector and the sector reform resulted in several
cancellations and rationalization or delay of subprojects. Since the associated KPIs and intermediate
indicators were not changed accordingly, these changes ultimately affected the achievement of
related Project indicators. However, the Bank’s positive responses to the changing needs and
circumstances in the power sector, allowed it to embrace new opportunities. For example, the
Bank’s refocus on promoting grid-connected renewable energy by helping develop and implement
key laws and regulations, such as ACT and SPPA, had major impacts on promoting renewable
energy.

Addition of Implementing Agency of Newly Established ERAV

36.    The Project played a key role and made solid and significant contributions to the regulatory
reform and institutional development by adding the newly established ERAV as a project
implementing agency. This was the Project’s response to a range of structural changes of the power
sector and enabled the Project to focus more on the sector reform and institutional development
component.

37.    The activities implemented by ERAV focused on three main technical areas: (i)
strengthening ERAV’s organization and systems; (ii) design of a regime of tariffs, transmission
charges, subsidies and market fees for participants in a competitive power market; and (iii)
development and enforcement of a comprehensive and efficient framework for a competitive power
market. The TA support to ERAV was later scaled up under the AF to ensure the following: (i)
successful introduction of the Vietnam competitive generation market (VCGM), (ii) implementation
of a major tariff reform, (iii) transition to the wholesale market phase of the reform and (iv) capacity
of the sector players to operate in the new environment. The Project also supported capacity
building of ERAV, including the development of expertise in relevant areas, resulting in a number
of important laws and regulations being developed and implemented (grid and distribution codes,
market rules, pricing and tariff methodologies and SPPA).

Limited Capacity

38.     Lack of technical and management capacity of some of the implementing agencies caused
implementation delays or cancellation of several subprojects, especially during the early years of
Project implementation. For transmission and distribution system improvement subprojects, there
existed inexperience in control systems for substations, poor coordination between equipment
suppliers and civil contractors, delays in compensation of affected persons, and prolonged
contracting processes. For RARE, especially in the early years, the lack of capacity and enthusiasm
or diligent follow-up by the MoIT and its Project Management Board (PMB) slowed the
                                                   8
implementation process. Overall, the drive required to steer a complex project of this nature seemed
lacking at the MoIT/PMB, especially during the early years. Although the RARE component
attempted to decentralize project implementation responsibilities to provincial and district
committees, the results were mixed. Site visits pointed to deficient financial aspects of the district
operation and maintenance (O&M) and very poor conditions of the power plants. The communes,
who were direct beneficiaries, seemed to lack enthusiasm to assume any responsibilities for the sub-
projects. The Project noted this deficiency and switched from the community approach to a district
approach during the early stages. However, the district approach, particularly the O&M company
was still not performing as expected.

39.     For the TA component, it became clear that the subcomponent of creating a joint stock
company and equitization at the commune or district level was not practicable because of the lack of
economies of scale and capacity in terms of management, commercial and technical skills. In 2003,
EVN requested that the 15 communes under this subcomponent be deleted from the Project
completely and the single district retained only for rehabilitation. As a result, the 2005 restructuring
revised one of two activities under Component C 2. Support EVN’s equitization program in the
generation and distribution sub-sectors, as “Provision of technical assistance for equitization
transactions, and provision of training for staff of EVN and of newly established power distribution
joint stock companies including in corporate governance and operation of securities markets?. In
addition, EVN’s limited capability to handle large and complex information and telecommunication
(IT) investment also affected implementation of the TA component.

Overestimates of Project Costs

40.     The feasibility studies of energy projects tended to overestimate the project costs by 30
percent more than the actual costs during early 2000’s in Vietnam. This overestimate was due to (i)
implementing agencies’ newly gained ability to use competitive procurement (ii) the GOV’s
requirement to estimate costs based on standard price lists, and (iii) avoidance of resubmitting
feasibility studies as it would take a long time to obtain approvals. As a result, by 2005, the Project
saved about US$24 million on sub-projects implemented at the time. Similarly, the associated TD1
had substantial savings of about US$87.5 million out of an original loan amount of US$199 million.
This partly contributed to the adoption of programmatic approaches in 2005 to enable transmission
subprojects prepared under SEIER to be financed under TD1.

Prolonged Approval Process of Development Assistance Fund/Vietnam Development Bank

41.    The Development Assistance Fund, later renamed Vietnam Development Bank (VDB),
required prolonged, complicated and sometimes duplicative processes, which seriously affected the
disbursement after the 2005 restructuring and lasted at least 2-3 years. By January 2007, across the
whole portfolio of energy projects, some US$32 million was held up. Several implementing
agencies expressed difficulty in meeting the VDB’s requirements for supporting evidence. The
documentary requirements of different branches of the VDB also varied. The VDB explained that it
was overwhelmed with disbursement applications. This was a wider issue than any single project or
even the power sector as a whole could resolve. At the same time, there was scope to improve
information flow between project entities to ensure that the VDB received required documents in a
timely manner. The Bank recommended that continued improvements to communications be sought,
including those through the introduction of FMIS/MMIS and through the use of email rather than
the postal system. This issue was later resolved through the Bank team’s intensive discussions with
the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the VDB and implementing agencies. By May 2008, disbursements
were again back on track.

Cost Overruns
                                                   9
42.    At a later stage of the Project, unanticipated macroeconomic circumstances (i.e., rising
construction costs and interest rates brought many domestic construction companies to standstill or
severely reduced activities, resulted in terminating and rebidding many contracts) caused cost
overrun and delayed implementation. As a result, an AF was prepared in part to meet this financing
gap.

Mid-term Review

43.     A Mid-term Review (MTR) for the Project was originally planned on July 1, 2005. Since a
more comprehensive review, analysis and due diligence had already been conducted for the
restructuring in May 2005, it was decided that the MTR would be incorporated into the restructuring
process. In addition, a more detailed MTR focused on RARE and Renewable Energy for Small
Power Producers (RESSP) sub-components was conducted in 2006. As a result of MTR, the wind
diesel plant on Phu Quoc was cancelled as wind resources were found to be insufficient. Moreover,
due to faster than expected extension of the grid, the number of communes with potential to be
electrified with small-grid renewables was reduced to 44 (compared to 1,100 at appraisal).
Subsequently, the subcomponent was restructured to focus on a district-level approach where
economies of scale made operations and maintenance more attractive. In addition, the sub-projects
that would be supported were such that they would be economically and financially robust should
the area become connected to the grid.

44.     For Development of Grid-Connected Electrification sub-component, at the time of the MTR,
only 12.4 percent of the budget of the sub-component to strengthen regulations, planning and
implementation capacity had been committed. The limited progress was attributed mainly to poor
management. The main recommendation of the MTR was that the objective of this sub-component
should be modified to focus on development of a program for grid-connected renewable electricity
development. The subcomponent was substantially restructured to refocus on enabling the
connection of small renewables to the grid. This restructuring has taken place in the context of
reform of the power sector which made the restructured component more relevant and timely. Under
the restructured power sector, ERAV was created and has been developing the regulations required
to connect small generators. In addition, renewables and particularly small hydro projects below 30
MW for which studies financed by this subcomponent had shown there are many are not obligated
to participate in the market and thus must have special provision made for them. This work helped
to create the conditions for the Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP), a follow on IDA
Credit whose preparation was supported by SEIER.

45.     The MTR identified weak management by MoIT's Project Management Board (PMB) for
power projects, which included responsibilities for rural and renewable energy projects. It also
found that the Bank's supervision of the projects needed to be strengthened. The main remedy
adopted by MoIT was to split the PMB for power projects into two, with one PMB retaining
responsibility for Rural and Renewable Energy. The new PMB was placed under the supervision of
a newly recruited Deputy Director of the Energy and Petroleum Department. Supervision by the
Bank was intensified. Following the unsatisfactory progress of these sub-components, they were
restructured and the project was extended in December 2007 to close on December 31, 2009.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

46.    The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system in Annex 1 of the PAD included CAS level
indicators that were not directly attributable to SEIER. In addition, there were too many indicators,
                                                 10
and only the indicators of the DSM programs had target values. Indicators for the transmission and
distribution systems were set for the entire EVN system, rather than for the parts benefiting from
SEIER. Given the small contribution of SEIER to the national system, this makes it difficult to
assess project outcomes (detailed percentage share of SEIER contribution to the country system is
presented in the Arrangements for Results Monitoring section of Annex 2). In retrospect, the project
should have selected indictors that could be directly attributable to project interventions. M&E
design did not examine data sources, reliability and collection carefully; instead relying on reports
by national and local level government agencies.

M&E Implementation

47.     During the restructurings and the AF, the M&E indicators were significantly revised; CAS
level indicators were dropped; indicators for power-sector reform were almost entirely revised; and
indicators for the system efficiency improvement and rural electricity access components were also
revised to some extent. Outcome level indicators were designed to be reported at the end of the
Project, except for improvement in efficiency of the system, which required annual reporting.
Annual or biannual reporting would have been more appropriate. All intermediate and component
level indicators were designed to be reported quarterly, which placed a burden on government
agencies.

48.     Data on transmission and distribution systems relied on EVN and PCs’ own performance
management data. However, since these data cover EVN’s entire system, it has been difficult to
measure the specific attribution of SEIER. Use of the system-level KPIs were not specific to SEIER
but also were used in other transmission and distribution projects supported by the Bank such as
Transmission, Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction Project (TD1) and Second Transmission
and Distribution Project (TD2). Data reported by the implementing agencies for subprojects was
also believed to be unreliable. The Bank should have made more efforts during the various project
restructurings and AF to replace the PDO level indicators for the whole country system by relevant
project level indicators. This was a major shortcoming that has affected the measurement of PDO
achievement. The M&E arrangements and indicators specific to social and environmental
safeguards were adequate.

49.     Appropriate data agreed on at the project appraisal and project restructurings only started to
be collected in 2007 when the Bank team addressed this matter; even then, only some indicators in
the arrangements for results monitoring were collected. Many progress reports were initially of poor
quality and M&E reports on safeguards issues were delayed; but performance of implementing
agencies on these issues improved over time.

M&E Utilization

50.     M&E data on physical progress were utilized to propose the 2007 restructuring and the 2010
AF. The data was used to inform decisions and reallocate resources. Appropriate adjustments were
made to adapt to the changing environment to achieve better results. M&E data on transmission and
distribution system are still being routinely collected after the closing of the Project since these data
have been integrated into the EVN and PCs’ own performance management.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental Safeguards

51.    The Project’s environmental safeguard category was B. Safeguards triggered in the project
included Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01); and Natural habitats (OP 4.04,
                                                   11
BP 4.04, GP 4.04); Forestry (OP/GP 4.36). Independent external monitors oversaw the environment
management plan. At a later stage of the Project, it was found that insufficient environmental
measures in micro hydropower sites under the RARE program and the transmissions and
distribution system improvement components resulted in environmental safeguard performance
being marginally satisfactory; however these issues were resolved by the end of the Project.

52.    All implementing agencies have undergone a learning process. They improved the
Monitoring of Environmental Management plan (EMP), and the Quarterly Progress Reports.
Submissions of required reports had been delayed frequently. In a few cases, the independent
monitoring agencies were not mobilized in a timely manner. Information and safeguard policy
disclosures were also improved. All implementing agencies needed to improve communication and
dissemination practices. As implementation of many subprojects was delayed from several months
to a year, some contracts with Independent Monitoring Consultants (IMC) for EMP implementation
had to be adjusted to the new subproject timetable.

Social Safeguards

53.     Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20, later converted into OP 4.10 in 2005); and Involuntary
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) were triggered. A resettlement policy and ethnic minority framework
were developed. Adequate institutional and financial arrangements for Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) and Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP) implementation were made. Independent
external monitors oversaw the RAP and IPDP implementation and provided a quarterly report to the
Bank. At a later stage of the Project, there were delays in compensation and completion of a
resettlement plan (RP) under the RARE program but these were resolved by the end of the Project.

54.    As with the environmental safeguards, all implementing agencies have undergone learning
processes, and over time, they improved the monitoring of RAP and the Quarterly Progress Reports.
There were some delays in report submissions and mobilization of the independent monitoring
agencies. In many subprojects, the compensation process ended up being much more prolonged than
planned and resulted in delayed construction. As implementation of many subprojects was delayed
from several months to a year, some contracts with Independent Monitoring Consultants (IMC) for
RAP and EMP implementation had to be adjusted to the new subproject timetable.

Financial Management

55.    The Project had an adequate financial management (FM) system in place to meet the Bank’s
fiduciary requirements. For EVN implemented projects, the Bank fully utilizes the systems of the
recipients. Therefore, the FM arrangements of the project were fully integrated into the financial
management system of EVN, which made the project FM more efficient and effective. The
budgeting, fund flows, staffing, accounting and financial reporting, internal control systems and
external audit, and maintenance of supporting documents at the Project’s implementing agencies
were generally adequate. With the exception of non-compliance with some financial covenants1
which has been a sector/corporate issue rather than being specific to the Project, the implementing
agencies were proactive in dealing with the recommendations from the task team’s missions. The
audited financial statements (for both the Project and entities) were submitted later than the
deadlines several times during the project life, mainly due to poor coordination with the external
auditors.



1
 Examples are tariff increases, financial performance ratio, carrying out time bound action, and EVN to
complete and incorporate a current valuation of all fixed assets.
                                                     12
56.     There was only one designated account (DA) established for the NPT. Under the NPT, the
power project management boards (PPMBs) were responsible for FM. Instances of delays in
payments were noted, either due to insufficient available funding in the DA for all PPMBs or due to
several approval levels from the PPMBs to the NPT. Poor coordination between the PPMBs and the
NPT were also noted sometimes when the PPMBs were not kept informed of payments which
caused difficulties in timely recording and contract management. Therefore, the implementation
arrangements between the NPT and the PPMBs need to be simplified in future projects.

57.     Audits have been qualified since 2007. The audit opinions in the EVN Corporation
consolidated financial statements and all PC Entity 2010 and 2011 financial statements were
qualified due to non-compliance with a number of IFRS standards. However, the qualifications were
not regarded to have a substantial impact on the capacity of the implementation agencies since the
qualification points were on technical accounting treatments and disclosures pertaining to some
standards of IFRSs. The audit opinion on the ERAV component of the Project for 2010 was
qualified because the Project had not determined, calculated and declared the personal income tax
for foreign individual consultants since the beginning of the Project. This has long been an
outstanding issue and ERAV hired a special tax consultant to look into tax matters of SEIER at
ERAV. This qualification however does not mean the Bank’s funds were not used for the intended
purposes.

58.     The Project management still needs to submit audited financial statements for the period
from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 plus the four-month grace period (i.e. through April 30,
2013) to the Bank as required by the Financial Covenants. The audited Financial Statements for
such period shall be furnished to the Association not later than six (6) months after the end of such
period.

Procurement

59.     The project procurement packages covered civil works, electrical and mechanical equipment,
erection and installation, and consulting services. These activities were effectively organized and
carried out in accordance with the Bank’s guidelines. The implementing agencies were effective in
following the procurement process to overcome such issues as delays in the procurement and
delivery of the main equipment and lag between the delivery of material/equipment and
construction work. At early stages in the Project, some implementing agencies delayed the
procurement process in large part due to their unfamiliarity with the Bank’s procurement process,
such as training packages, but also due to uncertainty related to the power reform, such as
FMIS/MMIS. Other reasons for delays in procurement were complex approval processes, but this
was not specific to the Project or the power sector. However, this situation improved as the
implementing agencies learned from experience and with the Bank’s support. The Bank’s oversight
and close involvement in all phases helped to ensure the transparency and effectiveness of all
procurement, and contributed to the implementing agencies’ ability to procure quality goods and
services at competitive prices.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

60.    All project activities have been institutionalized in the power sector and will be continued by
implementing agencies. Furthermore, most project activities have been replicated and/or scaled up
through other Bank supported projects, which SEIER directly or indirectly supported through
preparation and/or implementation including, Renewable Energy Development Project (REDP),
TD2, Rural Distribution Project, Power Sector Reform Development Policy Operation (DPO) series,
etc. Almost all activities that were not fully completed under SEIER are being continued by
implementing agencies with or without Bank support as discussed elsewhere in this ICR.
                                                 13
61.      For off-grid micro hydropower plants subprojects, additional investment is still required for
worker houses, a range of equipment and bridges. The operators’ capacity has been seen to be weak,
and improper operations may damage the plants, shorten the plants’ life, and increase the life cycle
cost. These micro hydropower plants serve some of the poorest households, whose ability to pay for
electricity may be quite limited. Insufficient revenue collection and working capital, and unrealistic
assumptions about the cost and stocks of spare parts affect the sustainability of these plants. It was
agreed that the MoIT and Lai Chau province will continue providing support to the operation of the
company (Muong Te HPco), and will amend the power purchasing agreement between Muong Te
HPco and NPC. The amendment is expected to increase the purchasing tariff thereby improving the
financial situation of the company. The support will also include providing office, equipment,
variable capital and capacity building to the company.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

62.     The Project’s objectives, design, and implementation are relevant to the Bank’s Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Vietnam for FY2012-2016. Under the CPS, the Bank will continue
to support policy dialogue, investment, and advisory services regarding transmission and
distribution system, energy efficiency, renewable energy, regulatory environment, low-carbon
growth, and rural households’ access to electricity. Relevant strategic energy priorities in the
Vietnam Sustainable Development Engagement Strategy for FY2014-16 (draft April 16, 2013)
include (i) increased supply-side energy efficiency by upgrading and rehabilitating transmission and
distribution networks and introducing smart grids, (ii) expansions of renewable energy, and (iii)
successful implementation of power market reform.

63.     The Project’s objectives, design and implementation are also relevant to the GOV’s priorities
in the power sector and the Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) for 2011-2020. The six
priorities in the power sector are to (i) Integrate power sector development with socio-economic
development, (ii) Combine efficient use of domestic energy with import of energy and diversify
power generation, (iii) Improve quality of service and promote efficient use of electricity, (iv)
Create competitive power market, (v) Ensure sustainable development of energy sector, and (vi)
Continue promotion of rural electrification. SEDS aims at developing power sources quickly and
sustainably (including hydropower), improving the electrical grid, and using energy-saving
technologies to guarantee sufficient power supply for development.

64.   The Project’s GEO, designs and implementation are relevant to the current global priorities
for GEF projects. One of the six objectives of the Climate Change Mitigation Strategy for GEF-5
(2010-2014) is to promote investment in renewable energy technologies.

65.     The Project was implemented during a period of rapid economic growth, power-sector
reform and increasing energy demand. Although the Project objectives remained the same, such
dynamic growth and the reform process required the Project flexibility to adjust to changing
priorities and new physical and institutional developments through project restructurings including
taking a programmatic approach to ensure that the Project meets the PDOs.

3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives



                                                 14
66.      The first objective to enhance electricity system efficiency in Vietnam was achieved by
reducing transmission system loss and interruptions and outage rates. All three KPIs at PDO level
(number and average duration of interruption and faults at 500 kV and 220 kV level and
transmission system loss) achieved targets defined at the whole-system levels, although these cannot
be directly attributed to the project. At the level of intermediate indicators, three out of the total six
KPIs’ targets were achieved. KPI for Length of 500 kV transmission line installed did not have an
initial target and no investment was made. The reason is that when the target was set for all other
KPIs at the 2005 restructuring, at EVN’s request, the originally planned 260 km of 500 kV line
between Pleiku-Da Nang had already been withdrawn as it had been financed by other sources, and
funds allocated for the 500 kV line were used for 220 kV investment. When the programmatic
approach was adopted at the 2005 restructuring, there were no identified 500 kV line sub-projects,
but the KPI was not omitted because of the desire to maintain a flexible programmatic approach in
case new 500 kV lines would further be identified. This did not affect the Project’s performance in
achieving the PDO because the GOV’s priorities for IDA financing was changed to 220 kV level
and other sub-components. For the other two KPIs that did not achieve the targets, one (220kV/110
kV substation capacity installation) came close to meeting the target (98 percent) while the other
(110 kV capacitor installation) did not (61 percent). However these were not failures; rather, they
were a result of a priority shift to other subprojects which significantly exceeded the target by 100
percent and 98 percent (500/220 kV and 220/110 kV capacity substations). This is a result of the
programmatic approach that the Project adopted to allow flexibility to invest in priority sub-projects
which constantly changed during the period of a rapidly growing power sector.

67.    Project performance is based on the intermediate KPIs. The system loss and outage and
interruption data of 138 sub-projects was provided by the implementing agencies based on
engineering estimates and used to perform individual subproject economic analyses. Based on the
data provided, the analysis shows improvement in system loss and outage and interruption rates. It
can reasonably be assumed that the upgrading, new additions and expansion and some rehabilitation
of the power system financed by SEIER improved the system efficiency. As mentioned, the
programmatic approach adopted by the project contributed to the higher impacts because the Project
did not need to invest in sub-projects that became lower priority. The economic analysis of
500kV/220kV level sub-projects had an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 45
percent.

68.     The second objective of providing electric power in selected rural areas of Vietnam was
achieved by (i) expanding or upgrading transmission and distribution lines in selected rural areas
and (ii) providing off-grid power supply through rehabilitating and building new hydropower plants
in selected remote rural areas. There were a total of five PDO level KPIs. However, three of them
(number and average duration of interruption and faults at 110kV level and distribution system),
while exceeding their targets, were measured at the whole system level, and thus cannot be solely
attributable to the Project interventions. The other two intermediate KPIs (number of new
households electrified from off grid or mini grid and increase in small hydro and biomass capacity
on line) did not fully achieve the targets (5 percent and 68 percent, respectively) because the
investments were no longer needed since the households were electrified through national grid
connections. The Project therefore decided to focus on promoting electrification by grid connection
using renewable energy – a better decision that responds to the changing circumstances and new
opportunities that can further benefit rural people with more reliable on-grid power than off-grid
power.

69.    Regarding the intermediate outcome indicators related to the second objective two out of
three achieved their targets. KPI for length of 110 kV lines installed exceeded the target by 6 percent.
KPI for capacity of 110/22kV and 110/35kV substations installed exceeded the target by 89 percent.
KPI for number of additional communes connected to mini-grid achieved only 30 percent of the
                                                   15
target due to the same reason above on the rapid grid connection and thus became no longer relevant
to provide power to rural areas. The expansion and upgrades of transmission and distribution lines
had by far the biggest impacts on providing power to rural areas; for example, SPC, CPC, NPC and
DNPC alone benefited 5,884,174 consumers, which included many rural consumers, and provided
more reliable power than the off-grid or mini-grid renewable power with limited capacity. At the
110 kV level, EIRR was 35 percent.

70.     Similar to the first objective, the intermediate outcome indicators for the 110kV system were
used to assess the impacts in achieving the second objective. For the same reasons discussed in the
first objective, we could reasonably assume that the Project’s upgrading, new additions and some
rehabilitation of the 110 kV/35 kV/25 kV system contributed to the achievement of the second
objective. Although the PDO and intermediate KPIs for off-grid or mini-grid micro-hydropower did
not meet the targets, this should not be considered as a failure. Similar to the reasons under the first
objective, this was a positive response of the Project to quickly adapt to emerging trends and shift to
promoting even better power supply to much broader populations (off-grid target was 10,000 new
consumers and on-grid power benefited over 5.6 million consumers though this includes both
existing and new consumers). The Project also ensured that this grid-based power supply would be
able to integrate renewable energy by supporting the development of renewable energy related laws
and regulations (e.g., SPPA, ACT, etc.), which are discussed below under the third objective.

71.    The third objective to sustain reform and institutional development of the Borrower’s energy
sector was achieved by (i) developing a number of policy and regulatory documents to implement
the Electricity Law, many of which were finalized and implemented and (ii) building capacity of
EVN, MoIT, NLDC, ERAV and other stakeholders. Three out of the five PDO level KPIs were
achieved. KPI for evaluation of accounts of newly formed joint stock and equitized companies did
not achieve the target as the activity was not fully implemented. However, the Report “Advisory
Assistance and Development of an Implementation Program for Power Sector Equitization in
Vietnam: Recommendations for Definition and Implementation of a Strategy for Equitization of
Electricity Distribution Companies, was prepared in September 2006. The Bank continued to
monitor the equitization program (see also section 1.8 Revised Components above for more details).
Since there were other Government priorities for IDA funding support to build capacity of the
nascent ERAV to become fully operational and effective, this did not have any impacts on the
Project in achieving this third objective. KPI for reduction of time and complexity for SPPs to get
approved did not fully achieve the target but there was limited data to properly assess this
achievement. Two quotations from the report entitled “SEIER Project, RARE Program and RESPP
Program, Report on Lessons Learned? (Siyambalapitiya and Dang, 2010) were the only relevant
source of data: one bank expected the government’s approval procedures to be shortened and
another bank thought that the approval process for projects for refinancing was too long. However,
the Project support to designing, issuing and implementing SPPA, ACT and other regulations and
methodologies should contribute to streamlining the approval process as they promoted consistency.

72.     The KPI for financial management/material management system improved did not achieve
its target because funding from IDA for FMIS/MMIS was cancelled due to contractual problems
with consultants. EVN has been continuing the work using its own funds with a plan to complete
Phase 1 by the end of 2013, followed by piloting in eight subsidiaries and eventually applying
FMIS/MMIS widely. Therefore, this does not really affect the Project’s performance in achieving
the PDO as EVN is carrying out to achieve the target with its own funding using the same
consultants. KPI for sound procedures for the effective implementation of tariff and market
regulations achieved the target since, for example, procedures of market rules, Prime Minister’s
Decisions on tariff setting methodology and on market-based electricity tariff mechanism were
issued. KPI for ability to assess effectiveness and improve regulations and implementation


                                                  16
procedures was achieved because as a result of training and capacity building, ERAV staff has
significantly improved its ability.

73.     Two and one-half out of seven intermediate-level KPIs achieved the targets. The KPI for
effective equitization program in place did not achieve the target as discussed earlier and did not
significantly affect the Project in achieving the third objective. The KPI for number of companies in
which management system installed and operating did not achieve the target because IDA funding
of FMIS/MMIS as discussed above and thus did not really affect the Project performance in
achieving the PDO. The KPI for regulations for small power producers issued and enforced
achieved the target. Examples of these regulations include SPPA, ACT, Updated the guideline
No.2014 of MoIT for economic and financial analysis of renewable energy projects, Permitting and
licensing procedures, and Development of encouragement mechanism for Renewable Energy
Projects, while some improvements are still required. The KPI for 30 additional formal training
received by ERAV staff and effective processes for information collection and monitoring partially
achieved the target because, although 97 additional ERAV staff received training, procurement of
the regulatory/market monitoring IT system was cancelled because ERAV needed more time to
review and decide on the software. This was a rather wiser decision to avoid rushing to purchase
inappropriate software simply because of the Project closing date.

74.     KPI for all tariff, market and technical codes regulations issued and five market procedures
and five technical procedures effective achieved the target as 21 regulations and 14 procedures were
issued. The KPI for road map for reform of gas market in place and 10 MoIT staff received training
did not achieve the target because these activities were not fully implemented. The Bank organized
a workshop on Issues and Options for Market based Gas Development in 2011 financed by the
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP). Also, under a study on Key Trends in
East Asia's Natural Gas Market (P124916), the Bank has been supporting the MoIT through
technical advice and training on key gas policy issues including (i) identifying suitable locations for
potential LNG regasification terminals, (ii) developing a suitable gas pricing regime for pipeline gas
and LNG, and (iii) supporting the development of the Gas Master Plan in 2011. The MoIT has
requested continued Bank TA in the gas sector beyond the project. KPI for EVN capacity to plan
and finance investments improved and 20 EVN and NPT staff received training did not achieve the
target as both the Bank and the implementing agencies did not follow up on the activities. However,
the additional financing of TD2, approved March 29, 2011, is providing TA for capacity building to
enhance NPT’s capabilities in the critical areas of investment planning and financing, debt
management, and the management of regulatory affairs through staff training and technical
assistance from specialized consultants. It is being further strengthened by a Bank’s TA on Strategic
Options for Financial Recovery of Vietnam’s Power Companies.

75.     The Project supported institutional capacity building and development and issuances of laws
and regulations that had significant impacts, such as, new tariff policies and regulations followed by
a series of tariff increases, VCGM, and grid and distribution codes. Outcomes of Project support to
ERAV include development and completion of (i) an electricity pricing mechanism, whereby a cost-
reflective pricing mechanism has been built up step by step, including generation pricing,
transmission and distribution charges, some governing and management fees and retail tariff; (ii)
technical codes and regulations to support the standardization of power system operation and the
effective operation of the power system; and (iii) VCGM design, including market rules, procedures
under market rules, and procedures for market surveillance and monitoring. The pilot VCGM has
become operational in July 2011 and the full VCGM was launched in July 2012. ERAV staff gained
a significant amount of knowledge and experiences in regulatory work. ERAV staff members have
significantly improved their capability; some have become senior experts in electricity price setting,
power market design and regulation, and power system development and monitoring.


                                                  17
76.    As a result of Project support to ERAV, the GOV implemented a series of tariff increases
after approving and issuing new tariff policies and regulations. This was a significant step toward
resolving the continuing tariff issues affecting the power sector and power projects supported by the
Bank.

77.    Although there were some shortcoming in achieving PDO and intermediate level KPIs, most
of them were due to changes in the GOV’s priorities related to the best use of IDA funding and lack
of data to properly assess performance. The Project support to ERAV offset these shortcomings and
had significant and far- reaching impacts.

78.     The GEO to contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions by promoting the use of
electricity production using renewable resources was achieved by rehabilitating grid-connected
small hydropower plants and rehabilitating and newly constructing off-grid micro hydropower
plants. The KPI target of CO2 mitigation of 208,350-219,140 tons was achieved as the Project’s
mitigated CO2 was estimated at 278,164 tons. In addition, the Project supported the preparation of
REDP and the Renewable Energy Master Plan, promoted the Renewable Energy Partnership and
attracted other donor-funded renewable energy projects. The Project supported development and
issuances of laws and regulations that had significant impacts on promoting renewable energy; for
example, the avoided cost tariff law and regulations were a substantial step forward for the
country’s power sector.

3.3     Efficiency

A. Economic Analysis

79.     The same methodology, assumptions and constant US$ 2001 prices, which were used in the
project appraisal, were used to compare the results. However, some modifications were made: (i)
many subprojects that were actually implemented and the Project timeframe were different from
those envisaged at the appraisals due to the restructuring and extension of closing date of the Project,
(ii) under this ICR, economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK) and shadow exchange rate (SER)
were estimated, (iii) nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission mitigation was estimated, (iv) distribution
analyses were conducted (v) economic analyses of off-grid micro hydropower plants were
conducted, and (vi) TA on capacity building is partially assessed by training cost per person.

80.     Economic analysis was conducted by comparing two scenarios: (a) "with" the Bank project
and (b) "without" the Bank project. Available data and information were at each subproject level.
Therefore, it was necessary to conduct many economic analyses for all these subprojects to arrive at
each agency level, totaling 138 economic analyses. Detailed methodology, assumptions, distribution
analyses, and sensitivity analyses, which include switching values (SV) and sensitivity indicators
(SI), are presented in Annex 3.

81.    The economic analysis at appraisal covered 74 percent of the total project cost. The
economic analyses at completion covered 89 percent of the total project cost. An estimated EIRR at
completion was 36 percent, which was slightly higher than the EIRR of 31 percent in the main text
and 28 percent in Annex 4 in the PAD at appraisal. An estimated net present value (NPV) at
completion was US$ 408 million, which is lower than the NPV of 460 million in the main text and
US$ 435 million in Annex 4 in the PAD at appraisal. An estimated mitigation of CO2 emission at
completion was higher than that at appraisal. The lower NPV at completion than that of the
appraisal is because of the delays in completion, which in some cases were about 10 years longer
than the original implementation schedule. Consequently, the benefits were reduced by more than
that could be made up from the reduced costs. Also, there are slight slowdown of annual electricity
production growth at 11 percent in 2007 and 10 percent 2008, compared to higher growth during
                                                  18
2000-2006 at average 14 percent. Afterword, this growth increased again, at 13 percent in 2009 and
                   2
14 percent in 2010. Details are presented in Annex 3.

82.     EVN staff training program has spent US$ 3.0 million (about 0.7 percent of the total project
cost) to train about 360 EVN staff members, which on average about US$8,300 was spent per staff.
In addition, a total of 227 people received training, including 132 ERAV staff and 95 from other
stakeholders (EVN, NLDC, MoIT, etc.) received training, on an average of US$ 2,692 per person.
These training programs covered, among others, power market and pricing, power system
optimization and safety, human resources, and master of business administration (MBA), including
study tours.

B. Financial Analysis
83.     Financial analysis for each component at both appraisal and completion stage used the same
methodology which considers the cash flow for the operation period of 20 years. Financial internal
rate of return (FIRR) and NPVs at 6.5 percent discount rate are calculated for both appraisal and
completion stages. The financial analysis at appraisal covered 74 percent of the total project cost.
The financial analyses at completion covered 89 percent of the total project cost. An estimated
FIRR at completion was 25.5 percent, which was higher than the FIRR of 15 percent at appraisal.
An estimated NPV at completion was US$ 628 million, which is higher than the NPV of 274
million at appraisal. Financial indicators have been generally improved since electricity prices,
which are one of the most influential factors for financial performance, have been substantially
raised during the project period compared to the assumption set out in PAD. In particular, the
financial performance of distribution projects has been significantly improved because of the wider
gap between power purchase costs and sales prices. On the other hand, several factors including
delay of investment, change in sub-project portfolio, and increase in construction cost caused lower
NPV on several sub-projects, mainly 220kV transmission projects and hydropower rehabilitation
projects. Details are found in Annex 3.

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

84.     Considering the Project’s relevance and achievements of PDO and GEO and efficiency,
overall outcome and global environment outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. In terms of the
volume of investment, the dropped activities and those that did not achieve the KPI targets had less
significant investment volumes and those that largely met the KPIs were transmission and
distribution system with rehabilitation of grid connected hydropower plants, which consisted 88
percent of the total project cost. Furthermore, most of the dropped activities were Bank’s positive
response to the changing needs and priorities in the power sector by reallocating the funding to
those activities that yielded much better development impacts. A small percentage- (2 percent) of
the investment on the capacity building of ERAV and TA contributed to significantly advancing
power market regulatory reform and helped develop other Bank supported and non-Bank supported
projects. Many of the cancelled activities were either carried out by other Bank supported TA or
projects or by the implementing agencies.

transmission and distribution network expansions and upgrades have provided increased and
reliable electricity access to the rural areas where relatively poorer people reside. The impact
assessment surveys of REP (ASTAE 2001) showed that there were multiple benefits from the REP
and the broader rural electrification effort for rural households in Vietnam. Access to electricity
created conditions for economic development, particularly in the south, job opportunities for local
people, and increased household income. Access also helped improve social and cultural life,
reduced the burden of household chores for women and children, improved public primary health
care, and improved children’s education. The findings of these surveys were consistent with results
from studies by other researchers and international development agencies. Increased access to
electricity will in general benefit both men and women, however regional and global evidence
                                                                   3
suggests that women in particular benefit (World Bank 2012). Furthermore, having access to
electricity extends the hours available for both productive and leisure activities, particularly for
women and girls (World Bank, 2012). The Project provided increased and reliable electricity to
households, business and industry. Economic analysis in Annex 3 illustrates poverty and social
impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

86.      The project has achieved high impacts on institutional change and strengthening of the
power sector, especially by helping ERAV develop and implement the laws and regulations to
promote a competitive environment in the power sector and integration of renewable energy and by
building capacity of implementing agencies. About 600 staff of ERAV, MoIT and EVN were
provided a variety of training, to help them better run the business of the power sector. In addition,
the Bank team provided extensive training on Bank’s procurement rules, procedures, contracts, and
financial management. The PCs and PPMBs became more familiar with the competitive
procurement process to gain the maximum benefits. The GOV’s acceptance of using programmatic
approach, decentralization and streamlining of subproject approval process (e.g., delegation of
approvals to EVN and PCs, streamlining VDB approval process, etc.) were significant institutional
changes to which the Project contributed. The Project fell short in strengthening corporate financing
aspects as corporate financing units in EVN and NPT and associated training were not implemented
and FMIS/MMIS was not completed. However, these were followed up by EVN and NPT with
other Bank supported projects and TA. The Project also met little progress in supporting the
development of the gas market but this was added at the additional financing and appeared to be a
little overstretching of the Project scope. The Bank’s TA has been following up on this gas market.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

87.    No other unintended outcomes and impacts were identified.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

88.    No beneficiary survey and stakeholder workshops were carried out.

  According to World Bank. 2012. Toward Gender Equality in East Asia and the Pacific: A Companion to the
World Development Report. Washington, DC: World Bank, , while lack of electricity affect both female- and
male-led enterprises, evidence suggests that such constraints may be more onerous among small and informal
firms than among larger firms and, therefore, may constrain female-led enterprises disproportionately.

4.   Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment
Outcome

Rating: Moderate

89.     There is modest financial risk as the current financial problems of EVN affects its
subsidiaries but currently Bank is providing TA to improve this situation. As discussed above
section 2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase, the off-grid micro hydropower plants
subcomponent have high financial and operational risks due to the needs for more investment and
lack of capacity of operators and revenue. However, it was agreed that MoIT and Lai Chau province
would continue to provide support to the operation of the company (Muong Te HPco), particularly
in amendment of the PPA between Muong Te HPco and NPC, which will increase the purchasing
tariff. The support will also include providing office, equipment, variable capital and capacity
building to the company. Furthermore, this subcomponent is less than one percent of the total
project cost. The institutional and reform risk is low because the GOV is continuing to pursue this
direction although the progress is slow but this is a nature of this kind of reform process.

90.    The environmental risk, especially regarding promoting renewable energy and mitigation of
greenhouse gas emissions, is modest. The grid-connected renewable energy sub-projects will
continue operations. The Project helped prepare REDP, attracted other donors to fund renewable
energy projects (e.g., the Vietnam Sweden Rural Energy Program (US$ 4 million) and the Solar
Energy Application for Mountainous and Ethnic Minority area in Vietnam (EURO 6.3 million)),
and supported the preparation of the Renewable Energy Master Plan and the Renewable Energy
Partnership. Environmental safeguards issues have been resolved and no specific follow up is
necessary except the potential future needs for the small sub-component of off-grid micro
hydropower plants whose sustainability is at high risk, but these issues are taken care of by the
MoIT and Lai Chau province.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.   The investment components of the Project were developed following technical, economic
and financial studies that have taken into consideration environmental and social aspects as
appropriate. While the Project designs had some shortcomings (Please see Section 2.1), overall, the
Bank preparation was relatively of high quality, thorough and speedy.

Improvement of Overall System Efficiency

92.    A consortium of international consultants was selected to assist EVN to identify and
implement cost-effective improvement in system efficiency and technical performance of the power
system. High-priority projects were included in the Project based on detailed feasibilities studies
that take into account all technical, economic, financial, environmental and social aspects of
investment. However, the following shortcomings are identified. First, the Project duration of five
years was overly optimistic. Given the rapid growth of the power sector and economy, the change
in investment priority and the related delay should have been anticipated. Secondly, an appropriate
measurement of the project performance should have been carefully considered. Third, the
economic analysis should have provided more explanation on the methodology.

                                                21
Improving Rural Access

93.      The Project was designed based on the Rural Electrification Master Plan which considered
various alternatives for extending rural electrification.. Grid extension was selected as the most
attractive alternative in communes where it constitutes the least-cost solution and generates
adequate economic returns. But the sub-transmission systems supplying power to the rural areas
were overloaded and needed to be upgraded to reduce losses and improve the quality of power
supply. The upgrading of the 110kV sub-transmission systems were verified by the detailed
feasibility studies and were also designed to have minimum environmental and social impacts. The
shortcomings were the same as above.

Providing Electricity for the Poorest, Remote-area Communes

94.     The rehabilitation efforts of five existing mini-hydro stations in remote areas were
developed based on detailed feasibility studies, economic viability and least cost option. Given the
nascent state of private sector activity in these areas, the communes and districts were selected to
develop and manage the utilities under the overall supervision of the Provincial authorities, with the
use of a pilot institutional mechanism under the REP. More due diligence on the feasibility of this
community or district level management should have been carried out, such as financial and
operational capacity, the potential of higher than expected expansion of grid–connections, as well as
Bank’s supervision challenges in these remote areas.

Institutional Development of EVN

95.    EVN's corporate business management information system, based on a coherent IT strategy,
was designed to link EVN and all its affiliated offices and agencies into an integrated management
information system. EVN's IT Strategic Plan for implementing computer systems called for the
purchase of integrated, packaged software-based solutions. The Bank should have recognized the
complexity and high volume of procurement package, potential duplications of work by many
consultants involved, and the limited capacity of the EVN staff on IT system, as well as potential
changes required as a result of ongoing power-sector reform and restructuring.

Promoting Equitization of Distribution in Districts and Communes

96.     Promoting equitization of distribution in districts and communes was included in the Project
provide experience in the development of a program for the creation of a creditworthy distribution
sector and in the more effective separation of generation, transmission and distribution elements of
the power sector. This would also promote the entry of the private sector. The pilot programs under
the Project were expected to provide the necessary experience for an enlarged program as soon as
the Electricity Law is passed by the Government. The Bank should have carefully assessed the
feasibility of commune and district level privatizations given the potential lack of capacity and
economy of scale.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

97.     The Bank team has continuously focused on maximizing the development impact by
adjusting project activities to changing needs and circumstances. The Bank team paid sufficient
attention to fiduciary issues, including the resolutions of the use of fund unintended and the slow
approval process of the VDB. Safeguards aspects were also well taken care of, providing adequate
                                                 22
guidance in reporting and management. Although the Bank team discovered some problems with
compensation at the later stage of the project, they were resolved before the closing date of the
Project. The Bank team’s supervision, inputs and process were adequate and timely from the outset,
providing training for implementing agencies on project management and on preparation of their
own ICRs at the end of the Project. The Bank team has been consistently addressing reporting
delays by implementing agencies from the early stage of the Project and these delayed situations
were improved later. The MTR identified weakness in supervision in isolated remote areas, which
was properly addressed, and overall the MTR was conducted with good quality.

98.     The Bank team continued to address the need for improvement of the economic and financial
analyses of feasibility studies of subprojects by hiring a consultant to assess the problems and
develop guidelines and training for the implementing agencies. However, the problem still remained
and the Bank ended up approving some subprojects with incorrect economic and financial analyses.
Candor and quality of performance reporting could also be improved, especially during the early
stage of the Project regarding implementation delays and achievements. Also, there was a lack of
attention to the need to follow up on activities for which KPIs and intermediate indicators were set
(e.g., capacitor, corporate financing unit and gas market reform) partly due to too many indicators
and activities, which were changed frequently.

99.    Since the Project was restructured three times, indicators for cancelled activities (e.g.,
FMIS/MMIS) and activities with reduced relevance (e.g., off-grid mini hydropower, etc.) should
have cancelled or revised accordingly. PDO level indicators that measured the whole system level
should also have been revised during the restructuring.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. Although there were some shortcomings, the Bank’s commitment to supporting the
implementing agencies, timely responding to the changing needs and situations and seeing the
Project through to a successful completion are highly commendable. Therefore, the Bank’s overall
performance is moderately satisfactory.

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

101. The GOV’s ownership and commitment to achieving development objectives was in general
high. The GOV was strongly committed to improving the efficiency of operations of EVN and the
PCs and increasing rural electrification. The GOV approved the Project and provided an enabling
environment including supportive sectoral and institutional policies. During project implementation,
GOV streamlined the excessive centralization and control, and adopted more flexible approaches to
project implementation, including delegation of investment decisions and day-to-day investment
management to EVN and the PCs, and acceptance of the phased approach to project implementation.

102. Provision of counterpart funding was adequate. The GOV’s difficulty in reforming tariff
resulted in removing the covenant on tariff increase. However, as noted earlier, this financial
covenant had been applied to all Bank-supported power sector projects and was later removed from
all projects. In fact, the GOV implemented a series of tariff increases after approving and issuing
new tariff policies and regulations as a result of SEIER support through the ERAV component. The
                                                23
Government demonstrated its continuing commitment by approving the additional financing to
SEIER and follow up projects such as REDP and TD2.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

103. Implementing agencies’ commitment to achieving development objectives has been
consistently strong, except the lack of interest in off-grid micro hydropower plant scheme in remote
areas due to the increasing grid expansion. Beneficiary and stakeholder consultations and
involvement during the project preparation were adequate, with implementing agencies’ outreach to
local communities, civil society organizations and other international development communities.
The adequacies in terms of (i) readiness for implementation, (ii) implementation arrangements, and
(iii) implementation capacity (including sufficient appointments of key staff) were mixed, especially
for the sub-components on (a) FMIS/MMIS, (b) RARE community based power plants operations
and (c) equitization of community or district based power utilities. However, these sub-components
were relatively small investment.

104. Thanks to the close working relationship between the implementing agencies and the Bank
team, most of the implementation issues were openly discussed. Many implementing agencies and
local governments were still learning project implementation and management, in order to be
compliant with Bank policies. Some implementing agencies used the Bank funding for unintended
purpose but this was not significant and was successfully resolved.

105. Actual M&E arrangements were inadequate and difficult to implement due to hundreds of
subprojects implemented by multiple implementing agencies which had not yet had the competency.
However, some implementing agencies demonstrated their commitment to improving M&E and to
providing requested data, especially during the preparation of ICR and compensated their capacity
gap by allocating their own resources to hire consultants to help with the data collection and
analyses. Transitional arrangements for regular operation of project supported activities after the
closing of the Project were adequate, as implementing agencies will continue to operate the
transmission, distribution and hydropower plant stations and to carry out the ongoing power sector
reform.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

106. Based on the above ratings of the performance of Government and implementing agencies,
the rating of overall borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

6.     Lessons Learned

107. The Project took a big risk by including such a wide ranging institutional development
component, and in many ways provided GOV with the analytical support to undertake the broader
set of reforms in the sector, many of which are now being supported through other Bank-funded
investment and policy loans. This experience showed that significant institutional development and
capacity building are possible to achieve through an investment operation. This achievement was
possible because the Project was implemented at the right time during the evolving power-sector
reform and restructuring, and had the strong commitment and partnership from the Government and
the implementing agencies. This achievement is having a far reaching impact on the sustainability
and reform process of the power sector, and had has helped establish a high level of trust to continue
                                                 24
to work on some of the more challenging aspects of sector development, particularly related to its
financial recovery.

108. When the client is experiencing high economic and energy demand growth and the energy
sector reform and a programmatic approach cannot be adopted, the project design should be focused
and have a shorter duration. If the project design involves many predetermined activities of a wide
raging energy sector issues and many implementing agencies, there is a high risk that the
predetermined activities need to be modified to adjust to the changing needs and circumstances,
which could result in implementation delays and project closing date extension. When a project uses
a programmatic approach, the project life should consider much more time than that required for a
project with predetermined activities. Preparing and getting approvals of project activities will take
a much longer time.

109. There is a need for a follow up training to implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity
to conduct sound economic and financial analyses of transmission and distribution investments.
This becomes more important when a project takes a programmatic approach and requires
implementing agencies to prepare feasibility studies and economic and financial analyses, as a
means to approve subprojects.

110. The current practice of using the country power system levels for KPIs in transmissions and
distributions projects should be revisited. For example, TD2, which was approved by the Board in
July 2005, also used the whole system indicators but at the additional financing, which was
approved in 2011, clarified that the TD2’s limited contribution to the system wide interruptions
indicators and the achievement of PDO will be assessed on the basis of the outcome indicator on the
new generation capacity connected as a result of the project and the intermediate indicators related
to the transmission and distribution assets created, with the latter serving as good proxies for system
reliability. TD2 also had project specific PDO level KPIs for each of selected substations, in
addition to the whole system KPIs. The use of project level indicators is also included in the Bank’s
Sustainable Development Network Core Sector Indictors: Average interruption frequency per year
in the project area (number) and Electricity losses per year in the project area (percentage). If these
project areas level indicators are not available, proxy or other relevant indicators of the project areas
should be used, not the country system wide data. TA is recommended to explore better ways to
measure project’s performance and results.

111. A more realistic assessment of using lower level of administration (community, commune or
district) of power supply operations should be made. District or commune based joint stock
distribution companies and community based off-grid micro hydropower plant operations proved to
have limited operational and financial capacity and lacked economies of scale to be viable.

                       Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

A.      Economic Analysis

A.1.    Transmission and Distribution Systems and Hydropower Plants

 1.     Introduction

The same methodology, assumptions and constant US$ 2001 prices, which were used in the
project appraisal, were used to compare the results. However, some modifications were made: (i)
many subprojects that were actually implemented and the project timeframe were different from
those envisaged at the appraisals due to the restructuring and extension of closing date of the
project, (ii) under this ICR, economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK) and shadow exchange
rate (SER) were estimated, (iii) NOx emission mitigation was estimated, (iv) distribution analyses
were conducted (v) economic analyses of off-grid micro hydropower plants were conducted, and
(vi) TA on capacity building is partially assessed by training cost per person.

 2.     Methodology

Economic analysis was conducted by comparing two scenarios: (a) "with" the Bank project and
(b) "without" the Bank project.

The main benefits of the transmission and distribution systems and small hydropower subprojects
were derived from (i) increased power supply, (ii) reduced electricity technical system losses, and
(iii) increased reliability and quality of power supplied.

The main benefits of the off-grid micro hydropower subprojects were derived from estimated
avoided costs for alternative electricity supply from diesel power plants.

Also, for both small hydropower and off-grid micro hydropower subprojects, benefits to the
project’s global environment objective of climate change mitigations through carbon dioxide
(CO2) reductions and benefits to mitigating health and environmental impacts through nitrogen
oxides (NOx) were estimated as illustrative purpose since their contribution were insignificant,
but the results could provide implication for scaling up these hydropower projects.

Costs were about 73 percent (US$ 309.2 million) of an estimated total disbursed amount of the
Project (IDA, GEF and the GOV). Incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the
Project were obtained by implementing agencies. However, almost all incremental O&M costs
were not actual costs but were assumed estimates, which ranged between 0.5 – 2 percent of the
investment costs.

The above explanations could be presented in the following formula:
?W = ?C+?B, where,
?W = Change in welfare
?C = Costs (investment and O&M)




                                            – 38 –
?B = Benefits (for transmission and small micro hydropower - increased power supply, reduced
technical electricity system losses, and increased reliability and quality of power supplied; and for
off-grid micro hydropower – avoided costs of diesel based power)

The above formula showed that the net present value of change in welfare level as a whole was
the sum of the net present value of change in costs and benefits between (a) "with" the Bank
project and (b) "without" the Bank project.

For the transmission system, each implementing agency had 5-40 sub-projects (Central Power
Project Management Board (CPPMB) 5 sub-projects, Southern Power Project Management
Board (SPPMB) 5 sub-projects, Northern Power Project Management Board (NPPMB) 9
                                                                                     4
subprojects, CPC 24 sub-projects, NPC 37 sub-projects, SPC 40 sub-projects , DNPC 9
subprojects and HDPC 2 subprojects). Furthermore, RARE component had 7 micro hydropower
subprojects. Therefore, to arrive at the result of each agency level, it was necessary to conduct
many economic analyses for all these sub-projects totaling 138 economic analyses.

    3.   Assumptions

Following assumptions are made in this analysis.

Without Bank Project Scenario

It was assumed that no investment would have been made to implement SEIER without the IDA
and GEF financing support. The reason for this assumption is because an aide memoire for a
January 2003 mission noted the continuing shortfall in available investment funds for the power
sector as one of the reasons that rather than cancelling the saving of US$ 77 million of TD1, the
saving was used for (i) the financing of the interconnection between Vietnam and Cambodia; and
(ii) the transfer of subprojects from SEIER. The Bank team also consulted with PCs, EVN and
other implementing agencies about their view on what would have happened if Bank and GEF
financing had not been available. One PC responded that they would have used their own
financing to implement their subprojects anyway even without the Bank and GEF financing.
However, all the other implementing agencies did not provide any views. Therefore, insufficient
information was available to establish the counterfactual scenario of SEIER that would be
financed by other funding sources in absence of the Bank and GEF financing.

Shadow Exchange Rate (SER)

Although the project appraisal did not make an adjustment for shadow exchange rate (SER), SER
                                                                         5
was used by estimating FEP at 8.97 percent (average FEP over 2002-2010).

  No suitable data available for subproject # 34. Cau Ke subsation, #18 Installing capacity in Soc Trang
substation and #19 Installing capacity in Kien Luong 2 substation. Cau Ke substation has been not put into
operation yet because Binh Minh - Cau Ke transmission line (financed by EVN) has not been constructed,
and the reason is difficult in compensation of land. Performance of Soc Trang and Kien Luong 2 were
improved. First, the power factor (cos j) was enhanced. Without the Bank project, it was assumed cos j =
0.9 and with the Bank project, it was cos j = 0.98-0.99. Secondly, voltage stability was stabilized. Without
the Bank project, voltage would have been very low about 91kV. With the Bank project, the voltage was
improved which increase to 95kV-115kV.

Net present values (NPV) are based on the discount rate of 10.21 percent, which was an estimated

value of EOCK (average EOCK over 2002-2011) of Vietnam. The project appraisal used the
default value of 10 percent.

Electricity Costs

The input energy bought as input, and sell as the output from the system were evaluated by the
long run marginal cost (LRMC) at the inlet and outlet of the system, which had been estimated in
the Power Development Plan No. 5. The LRMC was estimated up to the year 2020. The values at
different level were as follow: at bus bar of the power station 3.904 USc/kWh, at 500/220 kV
level 4.569 USc/kWh, at 110 kV level 5.166 USc/kWh, at medium voltage level 6.551 USc/kWh,
and 9.373 USc/kWh at the consumer end. The unserved energy due to the unreliability of the
system was evaluated at 46.865 USc/kWh. Electricity system loss value for supply and
construction of 110 kV transmission systems was evaluated at LRMC of 5.166 USc/kWh and the
incremental energy attributed to the project evaluated at the LRMC for the development of 110
kV system was equal to 0.597 USc/kWh (the LRMC at the 110 kV less the LRMC at 500/220
kV). For the supply and construction of 500kV and 220 kV transmission system, the losses were
evaluated at LRMC of 4.569 US c/kWh and the incremental energy attributed to the project
evaluated at the LRMC for the development of 110 kV system was equal to 0.665 USc/kWh (the
LRMC at 500/220 kV less the LRMC at generation). For the component of small hydropower
rehabilitation, the incremental output of the small hydropower was estimated at LRMC at the end
of the 110 kV transmission system 5.166 USc/kWh. In the “without? the Bank project scenario,
due to the bad condition and lack of the spare parts, the hydropower stations were assumed to
stop operation in a few-year time. All these above assumptions and values were used at the
project appraisal.

There are caveats about these assumptions at the appraisal. There are large differences in LRMC
between medium voltage level and the consumer ends and more clarification was needed.
Unserved energy value was extremely high value, which could be used for the Power Crisis and
thus should be justified. In particular related to a specific amount of unserved energy, this value
depends on the amount in question. Moreover, this value should be consistent with the much
lower values for supply losses. There was no clarification or justification of the validity to include
the capacity benefit inherent in LRMC for small hydropower projects if the firm power produced
by these subprojects is a small (or large) proportion of their total output. Also, no information was
available on how was the LRMC were calculated. Furthermore, since LRMC will change
overtime, especially during the rapid development of transmission and distribution system.
However, no updated LRMC was available to prepare this ICR. Also, assumption of economic
life of small hydropower rehabilitation only up to 2020 should be clarified.

Electricity Generation, System loss, and Interruptions and Outage

The values (kWh) of electricity generations, system loss and interruptions and outages were
obtained from implementing agencies. Although many subprojects have already started

operations much earlier than the closing date of SEIER of December 31, 2012, almost all data
provided from the implementing agencies were updated forecasts and assumptions and are not the
actual data. Some subprojects data provided by the implementing agencies had system losses and
interruptions and outage rates higher than the “without? Bank project scenario. This would not
justify the investment. The Bank team sought for clarification but no responses were provided
from these implementing agencies. This lack of actual performance data and clarification of their
assumptions severely affected the assessment of impacts of the SEIER appropriately.

Other assumptions are the following:

CO2 and NOx emissions were estimated based on the power generation mix of Vietnam for
2006-2010, CO2 emission rates from the World Bank data base and NOx emission values from
                                                         7
power plants from Canada, Mexico and the United States. From 2011, average values of 2006-
2010 were used (321 CO2g/kWh and 0.81NOxg/kWh). Carbon price was based on US$3.3/CO2
ton (in 2001 price) under European Union Emissions Trading Scheme on January 24, 2013. NOx
price is US$18.32/NOx ton, which is the lowest of the price range up to US$36.64/NOx ton (all
                8
in 2001 prices).

•        No shadow wage rate was used because the most of employees under the project were
         assumed to be skilled workers, who were either employees of the implementing agencies or
         consultants, and were supposed to find alternative employments with similar wages.

•        The analyses were made over a project economic life of 20 years or up to 2025 for
         transmission and distribution system and up to 2020 for small hydropower plants, which were
         consistent with the project appraisal.

•        If the actual data were not available, the operation and maintenance cost are evaluated at 0.5-
         2 percent of the investment cost, which are reported by implementing agencies.

To estimate economic costs from financial costs, if actual costs of taxes were not available, value
added tax at 10 percent, industrial import duties at 17 percent and personal income tax at 5
                        9
percent were employed.

•        Micro hydropower plants were assumed to operate at 40 percent capacity factor.

Avoided costs were based on 100kW diesel power plants at 60 percent capacity factor at levelized
                                                                                            10
cost of US$0.18/kWh including diesel US$0.53/liter, which were converted in to 2001 prices.

The economic analysis at appraisal covered 74 percent of the total project cost. The economic
analyses at completion covered 89 percent of the total project cost. An estimated economic
internal rate of return (EIRR) at completion was 36 percent, which was slightly higher than the
EIRR of 31 percent in the main text and 28 percent in Annex 4 in the PAD at appraisal. An
estimated net present value (NPV) at completion was US$ 408 million, which is lower than the

NPV of 460 million in the main text and US$ 435 million in Annex 4 in the PAD at appraisal. An
estimated mitigation of CO2 emission at completion was higher than that at appraisal. This is
because of the delays in completion, which in some cases were about 10 years longer than the
original implementation schedule. Consequently, the benefits were reduced by more than that
could be made up from the reduced costs. Also, there are slight slowdown of annual electricity
production growth at 11 percent in 2007 and 10 percent 2008, compared to higher growth during
2000-2006 at average 14 percent. Afterword, this growth increased again, at 13 percent in 2009
                       11
and 14 percent in 2010.

An estimated mitigation of CO2 emission at completion is higher than that at appraisal.

Overall the Project is economically viable in terms of EIRR. However, some subprojects had
negative EIRR and/or NPV not only at the completion but due to estimated lower level of load
demand than the load that the increased capacity can accommodate and higher levels of system
loss and interruptions/outages in the “with? Bank project scenario than the “without? Bank
project scenario. The NPVs of the actual subprojects, however, were not as high. Relatively very
high EIRR and NPV of DNPC are because their estimates of high interruptions and outage rates
under the “without? Bank project scenarios.

Nevertheless, as noted in the assumption section above, almost all data provide by the
implementing agencies were updated forecasts and estimated assumptions, and were not actual
data. Also, since some subprojects were directly or indirectly linked, consolidated agency level
results included some double counting of costs and benefits. Therefore, careful interpretations of
the results are necessary.

The following are detailed illustrations of subprojects.

Ankroet small hydropower subproject of SPC had an EIRR of 33.8 percent and an NPV of
US$ 2.8 million without including values of CO2 and NOx, With added CO2 and NOx values,
EIRR was increased slightly. NOx impacts are based on conservative value using the lowest
value among the range of estimates and are distributed in various health and environmental
impacts below.

affected communities (resettlement, compensation and environmental management, including
land acquisition and trees) and had some loss due to FEP although there were incremental tax
revenues. Employees or consultants of the power company gained due to the project activities.
Using the national poverty rate in 2010, the poverty impact ratio was 63 percent.

The micro hydropower plants subprojects showed an estimated EIRR of 22.2 percent and an NPV
of US$0.68 million without CO2 and NOx values as in the table below. Adding CO2 and NOx
increased the net benefit by a small amount.

Distribution of the NPV with CO2 and NOx was presented in the table below. Provincial Peoples
Committees, who own all the assets created under the RARE component, gained the most due to
the avoided costs. Employees or consultants benefitted due to the subproject activities.
Communities will also benefit because they could avoid NOx emissions that would have been
generated from diesel fired power plants. The NOx impacts could be health and social welfare
impacts including premature respiratory (70 percent), adult chronic morbidity (10 percent),
material soiling (5 percent), acute morbidity (10 percent), and visibility reduction (5 percent).
Government and economy had to pay for these subprojects and lost due to FEP while they have
gained from incremental taxes and mitigation of CO2 emission. The poverty impact ratio is 54
percent.

1.      Introduction

The rest of SEIER, i.e., about US$ 31.6 million (8 percent of the total project cost) was spent on
technical assistance (TA) including training of EVN and ERAV staff, studies, drafting policies
and regulations, and preparing for the Bank projects. These TA activities will indirectly magnify
impacts in achieving PDO across the energy sector.

2.    Strengthening regulation, planning and implementation capacities for Renewable
Energy Projects

US$ 3.2 million (about 0.8 percent of the total project cost) was spent to deliver varieties of laws
and regulations, studies and preparation of the Bank projects (e.g., REDP), with special focus on
promoting small independent power producers (IPPs) using renewable energy.

3.      EVN staff training program

US$ 3.0 million (about 0.7 percent of the total project cost) was spent to train about 360 EVN
staff members, which on average about US$8,300 was spent per staff.

4.      Technical assistance and capacity building for ERAV

•    US$5.95 million (about 1.5 percent of the total project cost) was spent to develop capacity
     and knowledge on international practices for ERAV staff and managers and to develop the
     regulatory framework (tariff, technical and market regulations and procedures) to implement
     the Electricity Law, mainly the first phase of the roadmap for the development of the
     competitive power market (the VCGM). The following summarizes these activities.

•    Development and completion of regulatory framework for power sector including: (i) cost
     reflective electricity pricing regulations for transmission, distribution and bulk supply, and
     market based mechanisms for retail electricity tariffs including regulations for the
     implementation of each tariff adjustments since the Prime Minister’s Decision 21; (ii)
     technical codes and load research, and the implementation procedures for those codes and
     load research; (iii) Vietnam Competitive Generation Market (VCGM) detailed design and
     market rules, and the market surveillance and monitoring procedures. ERAV reported a total
     of 21 regulations and 14 implementation procedures approved. However, depending on the
     definition of regulations and procedures, the total number could be more than the reported
     total. Each tariff adjustment was accompanies since Decision 21 with MoIT Circular
     (prepared by ERAV) with the implementation regulation; therefore each was a regulation.
     There are procedures for the Grid Code (around 13 procedures) procedures for the
     Distribution Code (around seven procedures needed) and procedures for the Load Research
     Regulations (three procedures).         Additionally, the market rules have implementing
     procedures (a SEIER-funded consultant drafted six but others were drafted by EVN; more
     than six were approved when pilot VCGM started).

•    Support for the implementation of power market in Vietnam: A pilot VCGM started on July 1,
     2011 and the full VCGM has been launched in July 1, 2012.

•    Support in capacity building for ERAV’s staff: About US$ 0.6 million was spent on capacity
     building and training activities including study tours/knowledge exchange, which resulted in
     increased ERAV expertise in electricity price setting, power market design and regulation,
     power system development and monitoring, etc. Total 227 persons of ERAV (132 persons)

     and other stakeholders (95 persons including EVN, NLDC, MoIT, etc.) received training, on
     an average of US$ 2,692 per person, in the areas of basic and advance training on power
     market and pricing courses, study tours and MBA.

5.     Technical Assistance to NLDC and NPT

US$ 0.7 million was spent to provide TA to NLDC on (i) Developing ancillary services
procedures for Vietnam Competitive Generation Market (VCGM), (ii) Design Training program
for the System and Market Operator in Vietnam, (iii) Development of management system
technical requirements for Vietnam Competitive Generation Market and (vi) Efficiency
improvement training of System and Market operators.

NPT also had a two TAs: “Integrated Control, Automation and Information System for 500 kV,
220 kV and 110 kV Substations - Bid Evaluation Methodology? and "Study on the high voltage
connection between EVN and China Southern Grid - CSG". EVN proposed to continue the study
as part of a boarder study on interconnection of the Greater Mekong Sub-region.

B. Financial Analysis
Financial analysis for each component at both appraisal and completion stage used the same
methodology which considers the cash flow for the operation period of 20 years. The cash flow
for each year is calculated subtracting cash-out including investment cost during construction
period, annual operational and maintenance cost, and power purchase cost at each voltage level,
from cash-in which is solely power sales revenue at each voltage level. All the cost and revenue
assume to include tax. Investment cost also includes financing cost (i.e., interest during
construction).
The data used for financial analysis are; (a) investment cost including duties, taxes and interest
during construction as estimated in PAD at appraisal and as reported by each implementing
agency at completion; (b) operation and maintenance cost assuming at 2 percent of investment
cost at appraisal and as reported by each implementing agency at completion; and (c) revenues
from energy sales (after allowing for losses) at the average sales prices for each power company
                                                                                               12
as estimated in PAD at appraisal and as reported by each implementing agency at completion .
Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and NPVs at 6.5 percent discount rate are calculated for
both appraisal and completion stages as follows. The financial analysis at appraisal covered 74
percent of the total project cost. The financial analyses at completion covered 89 percent of the
total project cost. An estimated FIRR at completion was 25.5 percent, which was higher than the
FIRR of 15 percent at appraisal. An estimated net present value (NPV) at completion was
US$ 628 million, which is higher than the NPV of 274 million at appraisal.

Financial indicators have been generally improved since electricity price, which is one of the
most influential factors for financial performance, has been substantially raised during the project
period compared to the assumption set out in PAD (3.33 cent/kWh for bulk supply tariff and
retail tariff). In particular the financial performance of distribution projects has been significantly
improved because of the wider gap between power purchase cost and sales price. On the other
hand, several factors including delay of investment, change in sub-project portfolio, and increase
in construction cost caused lower NPV on several sub-projects, mainly 220kV transmission
projects and hydropower rehabilitation projects.
Overall, the project was found to be financially worthwhile for each implementing agency. It
should be noted that more accurate financial calculation and interpretation would be possible by
addressing several challenges associated with data collection. These include, (i) precise yearly
profile of disbursement for each-subproject, (ii) estimation of incremental electricity attained with
project using a consistent methodology among each sub-project, (iii) estimation of inter-
relationship among each sub-project (double counting of project benefit), (iv) precise yearly
profile of electricity price with tax at each voltage level, and data consistency among each
transmission and distribution implementing agency.

     Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A.      Summary of Borrower’s ICR

1.     Assessment of the operation’s objective, design, implementation, and operational
experience

CPC:
The initial design of SEIER project was not reasonable about some respects. Due to very few sub-
projects (including eight subprojects of 110kV power network and rehabilitation of two
hydropower plants), the capital has partly been used and the efficiency of use has not been
promoted too much. Moreover, equitizing communes were not actually suitable resulting in
three modifications, extension of the loan agreement. The first revision of Agreement has applied
new project approach allowing the project more flexibly carried out in supplementing, changing
list of sub-projects component, and facilitated the implementation units to initiate investment and
construction. Afterwards, with the second revision and the savings from already implemented
projects and coordination of capital among implementation agencies of EVN, the addition of list
of subprojects has expanded scope of power supply, reduced power loss and promoted investment
efficiency. After being revised, not only the project design was streamlined in accordance with
the actual situation with the construction location where there is an urgent demand, but also CPC
has enough time to perform and projects were fully completed meeting the urgent demand of
power supply to areas and enhancing technical criteria of power network operation.

The aim of project was basically rational and suitable to actual requirements. Subprojects
completed by CPC partially reached the objectives.

In recent years, the area load’s growth has risen sharply. The development of 110 kV power
network under project has enhanced transmission capacity and efficiently supplied power source
from the national electricity grid, power source, significantly decreased the radius of power
supply to high, medium-low voltage power network. Thus, the loss of the transmission grid has
significantly been reduced, efficiently shared load of existing substations of area and reduced
investment to increase source of local power generation. It also raised possibility of power supply
to the poor in remote areas by (i) upgrading 110kV and medium voltage power network for rural
electrification; and (ii) rehabilitating small hydropower to supply power to rural areas. Thus, the
power supply to households in project areas has remarkably decreased in terms of cost, creating
favorable conditions for poor households to use power from national power grid. In addition, the
rehabilitation of small hydropower also enhanced to supply power to rural areas.

ERAV:
The project objectives were highly relevant to the current national development priorities and the
Bank’s country assistance strategy. That is to reform the Vietnam power sector from vertically
integrated model into unbundling model and introduce competitive market in power activities.
ERAV has implemented a number of TA projects. Notwithstanding the high relevance, the design
and implementation of the project to achieving the objectives had some shortcomings, as some
activities were not implemented or delayed.

Donai PC:
The need of improvement network and increasing reliability are still strong. Demand has
continued to grow as predicted and the investment-related PDOs remain highly relevant.




                                            – 57 –
The level and the timing of tariff increases were discussed during project preparation. However,
EVN delayed to do this and had to bear the large amount of loss. EVN distributed it to all
member PC, thus DNPC received the debt of VND253 billions due to SPC’s issue. This much
affects the DNPC financial performance in borrowing capital for investment.

NPC:
SEIER has been completed and in good operation. Project design and preparation have been done
in detail. The design and implementation of the project were based on the objective of the project.
So far, at the time of ICR preparation for the project, the design and implementation of the project
were suitable with the target of the project. However, the objective of increasing the number of
households is allowed to connect to the system does not seem to be suitable with the objective,
design and implementation of projects in this component of the project. Project only invested at a
voltage level of 110 kV and people cannot connect directly to the 110kV electrical grid. Besides
that, the people in the project area has connected to the system that increases the number of
households who connect the grid that will be more suitable target for rural energy projects or rural
electrification rather than this project.

NPT and SPC:
The project was carried out in accordance with the Electricity Development Master Plan 2001-
2010, meet the requirements of infrastructure development of power sector and energy demand
growth at an average of about 15 percent per year, as well as the required power transmit from the
power source to the customer (the power company).

NPPMB:
The need of improvement network and increasing reliability are still strong. Demand has
continued to grow much as predicted and the investment-related PDOs remain highly relevant.
The project substantially met its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in these dimensions:

•    Improve overall system efficiency through optimization of transmission system to reduce
     losses and remove bottlenecks: Achievement of this objective is satisfactory. There have been
     gains in transmission reliability and efficiency.
•    Rehabilitation of distribution network in rural economic growth centers: Achievement of this
     objective is satisfactory. Distribution systems have reduced losses and improved reliability.

2.       Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed objectives

CPC:
Subprojects are selected in emergency areas served for the power supply, scattered over many
provinces of the Central Highlands region, meet more and more increased needs of load, and
simultaneously are in the provincial development planning approved by specialized ministries.
Thanks to reasonable design, the project met the target requirements.

Project scopes are also appropriately designed to the rational use of WB loans. Total implemented
and disbursed value of WB loans is USD 34.4 million, substantially appropriated to the value of
Loan Agreement. Relating to the local fund, CPC had also balanced and suitably arranged fund to
perform projects with total value of VND 218 million. Project progress lasted but in general it
was consistent with the actual conditions.

ERAV:
In general, the outcomes of ERAV’s Component under SEIER project met its objectives, those
are: (i) Development and completion of regulatory framework for power sector, (ii) Support for


                                             – 58 –
the implementation of power market in Vietnam, (iii) Support in capacity building for ERAV’s
staff.

Donai PC:
The project substantially met its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in these dimensions:
• Improve overall system efficiency through optimization of transmission system to reduce
   losses and remove bottlenecks: Achievement of this objective is satisfactory. There have been
   gains in transmission reliability and efficiency and loss has been sharply reduced from 7.03
   percent in 2002 to 2.9 percent in 2011.
• Rehabilitation of distribution network in rural economic growth centers: Achievement of this
   objective is satisfactory. Distribution systems have reduced losses and improved reliability.
• Enhance rural access to electricity by upgrading 110kV substransmission and MV
   distribution lines for rural electrification: Achievement of this objective is satisfactory. The
   amount of rural households having electricity access is up to 99 percent now in Dong Nai
   province.

NPC:
Component of the project has contributed to the achievement of development objective of the
project. Actual implementation cost of the project components was reduced more than the
appraised cost. However, the progress of project completion was very long due to changes in the
macro-economic situation, some of the project’s works had to be implemented again (for example,
material and equipment prices are highly increased so project cost should be determined again or
bidding again). Output result of the project components have met the main objective of the
project is to improve the implement performance of electrical energy systems that contributes to
economic and social growth in project area. However, the objective on electricity supply for rural
areas and increase the access ability for electrical grid for people was not achieved. In general, the
project components have gained the relatively good outcome result, it helps the electricity system
operate more efficiently to create high-voltage capacity network that is ready to make pre-
condition for electricity distribution projects in medium-voltage and lower - voltage or electricity
programs, rural energy in coming time.

NPT:
The project meets its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in the following aspects:
• Meet the growing load demand and transmission capacity: Power transmission 220/500kV
   grid increased from 65.4 billion kWh in 2008 to 104.3 billion kWh in 2012.
• Loss of Power transmission 220/500kV grid decreased from 3.48 percent in 2006 to 2.33
   percent in 2012.

SPC:
The project meets its PDOs and is rated satisfactory in the following aspects:
• To meet the growing load demand: electricity production of SPC increased from                7,839
   million kWh (2002) to 36,290 million kWh (2012) (including Dong Nai PC).
• To reduce power losses in the network: power loss is reduced significantly from              10.37
   percent (2002) down to 5.64 percent (2012) (including Dong Nai PC).
• To meet the objective of rural electrification in the South of Vietnam: from 2002 to         2012,
   household using electricity is increased twice from 3,412 thousand of households to         6,863
   thousand of households (including Dong Nai PC).

3.     Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be
helpful in the future


                                             – 59 –
CPC:
The CPC complied with policies and committed to the Bank without situations contrary to
regulations. CPC implemented subprojects sufficiently, following the order and steps in course of
investment and construction. CPC designed and used capital loan reasonably, arranging
counterpart funding sufficiently and timely to complete projects. The whole completed project
which was in use reached high efficiency and met proposed objectives. The exploitation and
usage of project was safe, efficient and sustainable.

The course of project implementation gained good result in general. Nevertheless, some
subprojects experienced shortcoming such as poor implementation progress, unsynchronized
steps in implementing subprojects, slow compensation and resettlement, multiple designs, slow
equipment and materials supplies which are unsynchronized with construction and so on. From
these, some experiences which are learnt from subproject implementation management are as
follows:

•   Prepare investment procedures early before signing loan agreement in order to shorten project
    implementation time since this step takes a long time.
•   Establish and manage the overall project implementation progress, focusing on areas
    affecting project progress such as forming and approving investment project, compensation
    and resettlement, procurement and supply of equipment and materials, starting and
    conducting the construction.
•   Focus on establishment of investment project, reaching the agreement of construction
    location, improving basic design quality and organizing the compensation and resettlement in
    timely manner so that the construction can start on time.
•   Approach local authorities early before starting the project, providing information on
    efficiency that the project brings to the local communities and project requirements that need
    help from authorities, making use of the local support during project implementation process.
    In case which the authorities do not meet project’s requirements, suitable adjustments need to
    be considered.
•   Coordinate with local government closely to organize compensation and resettlement, people
    mobilization, solve problems immediately to assure construction conditions.
•   The procurement of equipment and materials must be held soon after investment project is
    approved, shortening bidding time, strengthening the management of suppliers’ contracts,
    ensuring required quality and quantity so that equipment supply are synchronized with
    construction progress, avoiding situation that contractors waiting for equipment to install.
    Enhancing and rationalizing the course of management, preservation and equipment
    allocation.
•   The work of design and appraisal need to be checked and managed seriously to limit errors
    and trouble in construction process.
•   Specialize the project management by processes and regulations so that the implementation is
    put into order.
•   Organize the bidding to select qualified contractors, reasonable prices and compliance with
    regulations.
•   Organize the collection and payment immediately for contractor to create favorable
    conditions in carrying out project completely, avoiding situation where contractor’s ability is
    weakened due to slow payment or unsolved problems from investors.
•   Apply flexibly the WB capital disbursement and payment methods depending on scale,
    weight and actual conditions such as: advance account, special commitment, direct payment
    and payback payment.



                                            – 60 –
•   Enhance the management of technique so the project implementation and operation is safe,
    flexible and efficient.

ERAV:
The Government cooperated closely with the Bank during the project preparation. It provided
support throughout the project implementation, particularly in project modifications. MoIT
demonstrated a strong support to ERAV and project as well to achieve the project development
objectives. MoIT worked closely with the Bank during project preparation. It showed a high
degree of ownership and made effort to get results. ERAV’s Component were successfully
implemented and the basically, project’s targets were met. Nonetheless, ERAV’s commitment
was failed in implementing 2 TAs and did not take advantages all the training targets. After five
years implemented the project, ERAV has gained many experiences not only in the way of
project management but also the actual experience in aspects of management of electricity. The
key lesson as follow:

The lesson from project management
• Deep understanding in all procedures of selection and employment consultant, the
   procurement of goods, works and non consulting service.
• High knowledge in disbursement procedures, financial management, reporting (e.g., financial
   management reports, procurement plan reports, progress reports, etc.), contract management.
• Big lessons for managers of project in internal control, supervision of all the activities of
   project, effective coordination between consultant, beneficiary (ERAV) and the World Bank.
• The lesson learned from activities of project.
• A clear road map, with objective to meet the pressing needs in monitoring and evaluation of
   all framework in electricity aspects. It also will drive the next stage of the road map in
   developing the VCGM and completing some legal frameworks in electricity aspects which
   will be regulated by Viet Nam government in the next stage.
• ERAV staff’s capacity built to access and decide technical options and project planning and
   implementation the TAs.

Donai PC:
The Government cooperated closely with the Bank during the preparation especially highly
supported DNPC in drawing from special account. Due to restructuring, DNPC belonged to SPC
and could not draw capital. After the necessary procedures, MoF and DNPC signed two
additional agreements enough for DNPC disbursing two last subprojects. Strong commitment and
action enabled the subprojects to be completed. From the technical standpoint, the subprojects
have been well implemented, with thorough consultation, proper preparation and implementation
of engineering, environment, resettlement plans and good fiduciary control.

Lessons learned are following:
• Well-qualified project design consultant unit is very important because that will lead to
   optimal technical design projects and reduce many difficulties during implementation.
• Project supervision should be done closely, regularly and reported clearly so the problems
   could be solved properly.
• Being careful in choosing contractors with full ability of financing plays an important role in
   project completion in right progress especially in this crisis period.

NPC:
All loan conditions have been fulfilled, the Government has made timely guidance when
problems arose during project implementation. The Government arranged the budget to disburse
for the project. Although the project was not completed under the first schedule, the execution


                                           – 61 –
units worked closely together, jointly solving problems during project implementation. Because
the affected people did not fully understand the project's compensation policy, land acquisition
work was slow. It is possible to see that the project has been completed and is operating well,
which indicates good results of the project implementation units.

Lessons learned are the following.

•   Shortening the implementation time: Right from the project preparation stage, it is possible to
    carry out the procurement of supplies and equipment after FS is approved. At the same time
    organizing at the site clearance. Thus, after the detailed design is approved, the site,
    equipment and supplies preparation is ready which will shorten the duration of the project.
•   The coordination between the authorities involved in the project implementation needs to be
    strengthened further. There should be clearly assigned responsibilities for subordinate
    agencies (local authorities at district level and below), in cooperation with the execution
    contractors, project management units for co-implementation.
•   The role of community supervision: The role of community supervision is generally not clear
    for 110kV power projects. If the rural electrification projects promote this role well, the 110
    kV project have not been developed yet. Community supervision will help resolve issues
    faster.
•   Flexibility: The project had a large numbers of sub-components, to be implemented in
    difficult areas during a long period of time. Flexibility is essential, both in term of physical
    scope and approval, to allow for fast adjustment to unexpected conditions (and in this case
    cost savings) that may arise in implementation and increase the benefit of the project.

NPT, SPC and NPPMB:
The Government and EVN cooperated closely with World Bank during implementation of the
project. NPT tried the best to complete all of subprojects, supported by consultants in
investigation, engineering and Environmental Impact Assessment, Environmental Management
Plan, and Resettlement Plan. Some projects had been delayed due to the followings reasons: the
compensation cost did not match, resulted in the late compensation and no site clearance, the
financial capacity of contractor was very low during the global financial crisis such that some
contractors could not implement the project on time and rebid was required, due to the NPT’s
difficult financial situation, the counterpart funding could not meet the progress of the project. In
general, EVN tried to obtain the good results during implementing the project.

The lessons from project design are following.

a. Bidding
• Preparation of Bidding Plan.
• Separating procurement of materials and equipment into bidding packages is a very important
    content in planning for the project. It will facilitate the manufacturer directly supply of goods
    to meet the requirements at the most reasonable prices. The arrangement of varying materials,
    and equipment into lots to have multiple bidders also increase the competitiveness and
    efficiency of bidding.
• Bidding Document
• The difficult problems in the bidding process and implementing the contract need to be
    analyzed, and learn from experience for bidding documents updated accordingly. The
    specification requirements in the bidding documents are particularly important for the process
    of evaluation and selection of contractors, affecting the planning and implementation of the
    project.
• Bidding Evaluation


                                             – 62 –
•   Bidding evaluation based on the specification requirements of the bidding documents for the
    selection of contractors should be made clear and transparent. The evaluation of bids should
    be completed within the valid period of the bidding documents, avoid to extend the validity
    of bids. The security of information in the bid evaluation process is important as it can cause
    complex problems affecting the progress of procurement of materials and equipment for the
    project.

b. Construction Process

• Compensation and site clearance
For 220 kV and 110kV transmission line, the compensation and site clearance must be
implemented in parallel with the construction and installation, because the compensation and site
clearance takes a lot of time. In stage of inventory of assets affected, the PPMBs should
coordinate with the local government to mobilize households to agree handing over their land for
construction before they were paid for site clearance and compensation. This solution is very
effective in speeding up construction and is applied during the construction of 220 kV
transmission line. In fact, difficulties in compensation happened with 10% of households in total
affected households, the majority of households agreed handing over their land for construction
prior to receive payment of compensation.
• Materials and Equipment
We need to test and assembly accessories before erection at site for transmission line subprojects,
as well as commissioning materials and equipment prior to installing in substations to ensure
compliance with the specification requirements of the contracts to avoid processing defects at site
causing slow progress of subprojects.

c. Financial matters

During the implementation of the project, in year 2008 due to the high inflation, the financial
fluctuation, the signed contracts changed from fixed price contract to adjustable price contract. At
present, most of the contracts have been signed in the form of adjustable price.

MOIT-RARE
Problem 1: Project Management is weak
The three mini-hydro projects visited by the mission in the end of year 2010 did not display a
complete project in each case, and there were different problems in each project, ranging from
incomplete work, poor contractor performance and poor maintenance. All of the above are related
to (i) lack of strong and clear ownership, (ii) absence of the sense of responsibility, care and
experience in project management as well as for operation, and (iii) reported delays in payments
to consultants, contractors, operation and management (O&M) company, all of which cause the
final product to be poorly completed or to be incomplete. All three projects visited in the end of
year 2010 displayed negligible community ownership or participation in the project activities and
care for the project. The remote location of the projects, implemented by contractors from Hanoi
or outside the province, the two day travel requirement each way and extremely poor road
conditions, and impacts of weather on travel, material transport and on-site work, are all
contributory factors to poor and delayed performance of contractors and consultants.

Lessons Learned
Placement of the project management responsibility on the District Peoples’ Committee (DPC), a
Government institution, which has only limited administrative capabilities and no technical
capability, should have been avoided. Even a small hydropower plant requires technical and
project management knowledge, to supervise and manage the contractors, especially in remote


                                             – 63 –
locations. A different structure, in which MoIT would directly hire a contractor with proven in-
house project management and technical capability, and the resources may have performed the
tasks to yield a quality output, but at a higher cost. Competitive bidding and selection of perhaps
the lowest bid, is likely to have caused the selection of a contractor with limited resources, with
consequent delays in work, and this causes lack of enthusiasm to complete the work.

Problem 2: Community ownership is absent
The detailed plan prepared in the RARE Organization and Operation Manual for the program to
help organize the community into a cooperative and involve at each stage of the project planning,
construction, and finally, in the O&M of the project, has not been implemented. Reasons sighted
were (i) lack of financial capacity of the communes to provide even a small portion of the capital,
and for subsequent O&M, and (ii) lack of interest owing to fast expansion of the national grid,
and communes expect the grid to reach them any moment. As such, community participation and
ownership of the projects does not exist. The community expects DPC and PMB to assume full
responsibility.

Lessons Learned
It is difficult to conclude whether the community participation to the scale that was originally
expected in the RARE operations manual, would have yielded better results causing the
community to display a sense of ownership of the project. “What happens when the grid arrives?
would be upper-most in their minds, if they are required to commit some funds even for a small
portion of the investment. The power plant at Na Hu rehabilitated by in the RARE program is an
example. Since the project was implemented, the grid has arrived, and a 35 kV line has been
drawn right overhead of the 27 kW power plant. There is no reason why the commune should
remain dependent on the mini hydro and its uncertain lower quality supply, when the grid is
available. Sooner or later, the DPC would spend for a transformer substation to tap the 35 kV line,
and connect the commune distribution system to the grid, and the Na Hu power plant will be
abandoned, and the funds and the effort would have been wasted.

Problem 3: Reducing demand for min-grids, off-grid services
The demand for mini-grid projects is on the decline with the rapid expansion of the national grid.
This situation is to be expected and common across all the developing countries, and the issues of
“waiting for the grid to arrive? is not limited to Vietnam. At the outset, the project expected the
20 mini-hydro based projects implemented under RARE program over 2002-2006, would build
national capacity in project management and development, to enable the program to scale-up 10
times, to build 200 mini-grids in a possible follow-up program.

Lessons learned

MoIT as the implementation agency appears to have been unaware of the upcoming rapid grid
extensions over the period 2002-2005, which reduced the demand for off-grid or mini-grid
services. The multitude of funding sources and the higher degree of autonomy to the Provinces
and to the power companies may have partly caused the inability of MoIT to monitor the demand
for off-grd services and make early corrections to the RARE program, particularly before and
during the Screening Study (2004). The corrections were made in 2006.

4.      Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, during the preparation and
implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of their relationships, with
special emphasis on lessons learned

CPC:


                                            – 64 –
Effective Bank performance created convenient conditions for the CPC to implement, produce
high quality outputs and finish the project. The Bank timely responded to the proposal of the CPC,
such as the extension of project closing date and application of the new approach to implement
the project flexibly and change items of project, which enabled to have suitable time to design
and implement the project with best effect. The Bank allowed using the cost saving or
reallocating fund between subsidiaries of EVN, which helped the CPC to adjust or add more
projects. The Bank timely disbursed fund for suppliers. The Bank’s procurement policy in
bidding and implementing contracts was effectively limited risks to the CPC.

Supervision of the Bank has been carried out fully to ensure coherence and quality to use the fund
effectively and meet the planned purposes, such as procurement, contract implementation,
resettlement compensation, environment and ethnic minority development plan. The Bank gave
advices and helpful experiences for the CPC to develop expertise and fix their limitation to carry
out the work better.

ERAV:
Preparation and appraisal were sufficiently prepared for ERAV’s component. Moreover, basic
project design, monitoring, evaluation, and project benefits analysis were sound.

One of the noteworthy aspects and key factors of success in project implementation was Bank’s
support to project.
• Strong support from the Bank such as advice in managing project and quality of TAs, and
   detailed guidance on capacity building. Problems were identified early and quick responses
   provided.
• Tight supervision by the Bank. It helped the project to avoid all risks in the implementation
   progress.
• Annual training by the Bank on disbursement procedures, contract management, procurement,
   financial management guideline efficiently and other meetings. It helped ERAV continuously
   updated all policies of project management.
• International experience incorporated in project supervision. The Bank was focused on
   development impact and played an effective role in addressing implementation problems as
   they arose to accelerate the project implementation.

Donai PC:
The project responded to meet PDOs and was in line with the Bank’s strategy for power sector.
All key lessons learned from previous project were considered in PAD and during the
implementation such as flexibility in all aspects of project design and implementation, good load
forecasting, quick and smooth start of the project. The schedules of the Bank monitoring, review
and reporting were rational. Progress reports were submitted quarterly, 10 days after the end of
each calendar quarterly; annual integrated reports on December 31 each year. Moreover, The
Bank had field trips annually, assessed the implementing progress as well as noted the issues
raised by the implementing agency and suggested appropriate solutions afterwards.

NPC:
WB has done a good job. The project has been completed and met the origin objectives.
In project preparation stage, the Bank’s expert team worked together with EVN to prepare the
document for the project, building the policy framework, creating the model of financial and
economic analysis, manual for project implementation, providing the detailed tasks for agencies
in charge of the project, and giving the standard form. WB and EVN organized workshops on the
project, disseminating the requirements of the project, specific tasks of the project
implementation agencies. WB supported timely and advised the project implementation agencies


                                            – 65 –
to achieve the objectives. WB was ready to disburse funding for the project. The Bank has
inspected the project through the establishment of the plan and periodic discussions with the
project implementation units, receiving the periodic reports of those units and field testing. The
Bank team supervised timely potential problems.

NPT and SPC:
The Bank responded to objectives of World Bank and the Government’s Plan period 2001 – 2010
for investment in basic infrastructure of power sector and has done well the role of the lender.
The investment project was well prepared. World Bank supported demand of finance for NPT to
strengthen and development transmission power network, to improve the voltage quality for the
areas far from substations and transmission lines. But during implementation of the project,
sometimes the Bank was slow to answer to the difficulties of the SPC.

5.     Description of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project

CPC:
After each sub-projects are put into operation, CPC issued operational and technical regulations
to manage the operation safely and effectively. CPC assigns subordinate units to manage and
operate project. Since then, CPC continued to invest and develop medium and low voltage grid to
supply power, scaling up the110kV subprojects and promote socioeconomic development in the
load centers. Hydropower plants were put into operation, partially generated power to the national
power grid and partially provided power to the medium and low voltage grid of area, promoting
high performance. Financial and economic policy was applied to assure reasonable operation and
maintenance of the subprojects.

ERAV:
ERAV has been still finding funds to support ERAV to develop more legal documents,
regulations on electricity sector and develop continuously the VCGM, particular focus on the
following tasks: (i) Develop regulations on smart grids, demand response to improve the
efficiency of the power operation system, of monitoring and evaluating the implementation all
issued technical regulations; (ii) Develop regulations on electricity prices, complete convert
electricity prices to market mechanisms to encourage efficient electricity using; (iii) develop the
VWCM in the formation and development plan of the electricity market in Vietnam; and (iv)
Continue capacity building and deeply training for ERAV’s staffs.

Since February 2013, ERAV has implemented Distribution Efficiency Project funded by WB
under the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) to support ERAV on the
tasks (i), (ii) and a part of task (iv) as mentioned above. At present, ERAV is seeking fund to
design and build the VWCM and related regulations to VWCM, capacity building ERAV’ staffs
to meet the requirements on management and monitoring on VWCM.

NPC:
After the project implementation, it has been handed over to the operation management unit of
electrical grid at 110 kV level, Northern Grid Company (NGC). NGC was established in 2010
under the NPC with the main functions to manage, operate, repair 110kV electrical grid system in
whole Northern area. As soon as the sub-project completion, Project Management Unit of NPC
(NPMU) handed over asset, technical document and operation documents for the NGC. NGC
within strong personnel organization and management network in all provinces and locality in
whole Northern area receives, operates project.




                                            – 66 –
After project completion and during operation, it was visible that the objectives of the project of
upgrading the system effectively by optimizing the system to reduce losses, increase electrical
energy quality, reducing incidents on the grid, reducing overload of transformers, and increase
reliability on electrical energy supply. The project gave a significant benefit to the power sector.
Besides that, it contributed to the overall development of whole society. The project’s
contribution to development index in rural area, electricity and other economic sectors are still
continued and evaluated. SEIER has helped Vietnam achieve the macro-economic social
development target for 2000-2010, and stabilize the economy after the economic crisis in 2008.
Under economic development plan for 2010-2020 and electrical energy development plan, a lot
of electrical energy projects will have to be done. The continuation of the further assistance of the
Bank will be the key factor to help Vietnam fulfill the socio-economic objectives under the plans.

NPT:
Provincial Transmission Companies (PTCs) are responsible for operation substations and
transmission lines under SEIER which handed over from PPMBs. PTCs will send periodically a
report of indicators for monitoring system performance covering faults, losses and power flows.
These indicators are maintained for operating stabilization and reliability in whole of Vietnam
Transmission grid.

SPC:
Southern Power Projects Management Unit (PPMU) was responsible for construction bidding,
bidding assessment, supervision at site, and commissioning of completed subproject. Southern
Grid Company is responsible for operation substations and transmission lines which handed over
from SPPMU. SPC will send periodically a report of indicators for monitoring system
performance covering faults, losses and power flows. These indicators are maintained for
operating stabilization and reliability not only of Southern gird system in particular but also
whole of Vietnam grid.

MOIT – RARE:
District Operation and Maintenance Entity (DOME) was established to operate the small
hydropower stations under RARE program, namely Muong Te Hydropower Company and started
operated December 2010. Although the cash-flows is starting up, there is no accounting system in
place for management of revenues and expenses, the company director is responsible for all
related financial and technical management without accountant/cashier. The constraints of
DOME for recruitment of additional staff working within Muong Te office is low revenue which
hardly covers operation cost as well as remuneration expense for technical and accountant/cashier
as proposed in business plan. Very limited revenue could not also facilitate the company to hire a
part-time technical specialist for investigation, maintenance and repairing of completed facilities
during operation phase. Grid connection of Nam Si Luong (NSL) small hydropower plant (SHP),
which currently still operated off-grid, would help to improve the revenue by selling surplus
electricity to the national grid.

Technical capacity of operating team is major issue to long term sustainability of the project.
Although operators have been trained by contracted suppliers and consultant hired by MoIT, site
evidences show that there are no compliances with operation procedures and no maintenance.
Operators are recruited from subproject communes with low education would hardly absorb all
technical knowledge provided by training courses which may lead to incompetent operators for
proper operation of facilities. The handing over of completed plants to DOME should spell out
roles and responsibilities of the company, the ownership and obligation of maintenance.
Additional training for operators in O&M should be provided and more staff should be recruited



                                             – 67 –
for DOME Office in case NSL re-operation. Accounting system should be strengthened to ensure
transparency and accountability to all stakeholders.

To assure survival and sustainability of the program, number of issues should be addressed
including the following:

•   Additional investment: (i) worker houses in Mu Ca, Thu Lum, Na Hu; (ii) two motor driven
    operating machines for upper sand gates at Nam Si Luong dam; (iii) A meter 220V-5A for
    about 170 households in Ban Giang Station; and (iv) an operating bridge for Pa U SHP, total
    investment cost for those additional works is estimated by 3,745 million VND. The provincial
    government should allocate provincial budget to finance this additional investment.

•   Capacity building for DOME: Capacity of operators of all small hydropower plants have been
    weak, improper operating may damage the facilities, shorten equipment life, and increasing
    life cycle cost. The training and qualifications of operators and personnel, and the subsequent
    retention of that personal are crucial. Their salaries paid should be competitive. Although
    two rounds of training provided during project implementation, additional O&M training for
    operator is suggested. When all assets created by the program handing over to DOME and the
    revenue start from NSL connected SHP, there should be additional staff for
    accountant/cashier, financial and technical manage to make sure operation, routine
    maintenance, and accountability to all technical and financial management.

•   Working capital and robustness of cash flows: at present, there is no working capital arranged
    for the company. The project should find the way for the company’s working capital which is
    recommended to meet at least 180 days (six months) to cover the various contingencies
    associated with start-up operations due to higher level of uncertainty in revenue collection.
    Many off-grid SHPs serve some of the poorest households of the community, whose ability to
    pay for electricity may be very limited. Overoptimistic assumptions about revenue collection,
    inadequate working capital, unrealistic assumptions about the cost and stocks of spare parts
    are ever-present hazard

•   Spare Parts Purchase: Although number of spare parts is included in the supply contracts, it is
    foreseen that those spare parts would be consumed rapidly owing to often improper operation.
    It is suggested that Muong Te DPC to arrange sufficient spare parts inventory to avoid
    generation delay, by using PPC budget.

•   Grid Connection and Acceptance of NSL: The NSL is very important to the survival of the
    program, thus Muong Te DPC should install the connecting equipments and re-start the plant
    as soon as possible. The revenue from this SHP shall improve the cash flows and may reduce
    the working capital needs. To avoid further damage and risks, Muong Te DPC should be
    careful in selection of consultant undertaking all necessary testing, verification and
    commissioning in accordance with standards and procedures. The DOME should arrange
    protection measures for facilities at dam site as well as provide safeguards from any
    accidence that may occur.

•   Amendment of Power Purchase Agreement for NSL: NPC has agreed in amendment of PPA
    for NSL to enable the plant for benefits of avoided cost tariff (ACT) with higher tariff, but
    DOME should obtain the license for generating and power business from Department of
    Industry and Trade, which may expose the difficulty for DOME at the time being as lack of
    technical engineer team within the company.

B. Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

The Borrower raised the following:

•   Data related to financial and economic analysis. The figures were not consistent with what
    CPC provided and were much lower than their calculation.

Bank’s response: The reasons of different figures were because the Bank has corrected the
economic and financial analyses provided by the implementing agencies. During the ICR
preparation, the Bank team repeatedly provided guidance on how to conduct economic analyses
and asked clarification of the data and methodology of the economic analyses provided by the
implementing agencies.

•   Lessons learned are not sufficient or very few. Assessments also are not very specific or do
    not focus on major issues that readers would remember about the project outcomes or results.

Bank’s response: Lessons learned and assessments were increased and strengthened in the revised
ICR.

•   If ICR is to list all things related to the project, then it is not enough or incomplete.

Bank’s response: ICR is not intended to list all issues related to the Project and also has a
limitation on the page length in the main text, and already exceeds the requirements.
