                         The project has achieved its development objectives. All of the project key indicators have been achieved or exceeded. The key indicator of “number of transmission line faults at 500
                         kV and 220 kV? at the end of the project was reduced to 0.310 and 0.553, respectively compared to the target of 0.321 and 0.578. The system losses also reduced to 2.56% and
                         6.80% for the transmission and distribution networks compared to the target of 3.75% and 7.25%. Capacity of the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) and National

                         Load Dispatch Center (NLDC) has been improved and sound regulations and procedures on tariffs and power generation market have been in place. Policy and regulations
                         promoting renewable energy have been also in place effectively supporting the Government renewable energy development program. In total, 900 MVA 500 kV; 490 km/3313 MVA
                         220kV and 965km/3210 MVA 110 kV have been built and installed. The Demand-side Management measures contributed to reduce up to 331 MW peak load. 5 small hydropower
                         plants with total capacity of 15 MW have been rehabilitated. About 1700 rural households benefited from improved service through the remote area renewable energy program.
