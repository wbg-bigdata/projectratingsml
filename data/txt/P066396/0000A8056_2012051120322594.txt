                         fluorescent lamps (CFL) have been sold under the project. The Technical Assistance (TA) program supporting preparation and implementation of the institutional and regulatory
                         framework for electricity tariffs, the Vietnam Competitive Generation Market (VCGM), technical codes and for demand side efficiency improvements has demonstrated its

                         international good practice, and workshops and training programs have provided consensus and capacity building. The National Load Dispatch Center NLDC under Electricity of
                         Vietnam (EVN) is building capacity and strengthening its organization to carry out its functions as the System and Market Operator.

                         The project cumulative disbursement as December 31, 2011 was 98% of the original budget and 91% of revised budget (including AF). The remain budget has been been largely
                         committed to on-going subprojects and expected to be disbursed by the project closing date.
