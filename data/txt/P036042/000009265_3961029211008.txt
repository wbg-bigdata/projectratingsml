1. INTRODUCTION
1.1           An integral part of a well-functioning market economy is an acceptable medium  of
exchange for economic transactions. As economic activity increases in sophistication, so too does the
need for an efficient and secure system of discharging financial obligations. Cash is a convenient form of
payment for most small transactions where buyer and seller meet face to face. But most large
transactions require some form of non-cash payment instrument such as a paper check or an electronic
payment order to move funds. These non-cash payments also require the use of a financial intermediary,
usually the banking system, to transfer funds from the payer to the payee. A payment system refers
collectively to the institutions, instruments and procedures used for exchanging financial value between
two parties. Weaknesses in a payment system can result in the inefficient use of the available money
stock, inequitable risk sharing between trading parties, lack of confidence in the banking system, and
inadequate support for the development of other financial services. l
1.2            Different payment instruments, each with a unique set of standards and processing
requirements, are required to serve user needs. Paper-based instruments such as checks are used for a
wide variety of transactions that are typically low-value and less time-critical. Electronic payments are
instructions passed between banks without a corresponding exchange of paper. Such instruments are
generally used for high-value payments requiring immediate transfer of funds. Card-based payments
relying on automated teller machines (ATMs), and credit and debit cards are generally used for consumer
payments at the point of sale. Payment services are required to process: local inter-bank debit and credit
payments; non-local, inter- and intra-bank debit and credit payments; high-value and other time-sensitive
credit payments; and international payments in a variety of currencies.2
1.3           All payments require settlement, which refers to the transfer of value between banks in
respect of payment obligations. Settlement can be immediate (funds are immediately and irrevocably
available for use) or provisional (funds are available on a provisional basis pending confirmation at some
later time). The settlement mechanism is either net (payments are settled after netting debits against
credits on an aggregate basis processed periodically in batches) or gross (payments are processed on a
transaction-by-transaction basis). Settlement finality is guaranteed by the system operator and system
participants according to pre-defined rules.
A full discussion of payment systems is contained in "Modemizing Payment Systems in Emerging
Economies," Policy Research Working Paper 1336 (World Bank, 1994). A summary discussion is contained in
"Project Design for Payment Systems," FPD Note No. 37 (World Bank, 1995).
2   A credit payment is the transfer of funds from payer to payee resulting from a payment instruction initiated by
the payer. A debit payment is the transfer of funds from payer to payee resulting from a payment collection
instruction from the payee's bank to the payer's bank. Cashing a check is an example of a debit payment. A
wire transfer is an example of a credit payment.



2
Well-functioning payment systems depend on several critical factors:
* Speed: Most payments do not need to be transferred instantaneously, and indeed, even
in industrial countries, only large, time-critical payments are made in real time. This
notwithstanding, users of payment services must be confident that payments will be
effected within a prescribed time. Delays in payments result, inter alia, in loss of value,
particularly in highly inflationary economies, and create float, thereby decreasing the
efficiency of funds circulation in the economy.
*  Certainty: The point at which funds are irrevocably available for use, or settlement
finality, is a critical requirement in any payment system. Uncertainties about the
completion of the transaction hamper the exchange of goods and services in an
economy.
* Reliability: A payment system must be reliable if it is to maintain user confidence.
Failures in the payment system can have severe, long-lasting impacts on users'
perceptions, and systems must have adequate contingency provisions and backup
capabilities.
- Security: A payment system must have adequate arrangements to deal with fraud,
credit risk, protection against unauthorized use, and dispute resolution.
* Convenience: Even the best designed system is doomed to failure if it does not provide
convenience to users.
.  Cost:  Similarly, cost is an important consideration, and should be suited to the
particular transaction instrument.
1.4           Payment solutions must be tailored to the unique requirements of a given economy, and
will typically involve a series of tradeoffs among the above factors. Ultimately, all these factors have to
do with promoting user confidence in the system in order to meet the needs of a growing economy.
1.5           This report presents the appraisal of the proposed Payment System  and Bank
Modemization Project for Viet Nam. The project was prepared by the National Payments Council with
help from external consultants hired under a PHRD Grant for project preparation. Chapter II of this
report contains a summary discussion of the financial sector, including the current status of the country's
payment system and the Government's sector development strategy. It also situates the proposed project
in the larger context of IDA involvement in the financial sector in Viet Nam. Chapter III contains a
description of the project and implementation arrangements, while Chapter IV discusses project
beneficiaries. Financial aspects, benefits and risks of the project are discussed in Chapter V, and a
summary of agreements to be reached is presented in Chapter VI. Annexes to this report present profiles
of the beneficiary institutions, as well as summary discussions of key implementation topics. A Project
Management Plan, prepared by the National Payments Council, is dedicated to a fuller description of
implementation plans and project management issues and is available in project files.

2. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND PAYMENT SYSTEM
DEVELOPMENT
2.1          The financial sector in Viet Nam consists essentially of the banking sector. The State
Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) was the country's monobank until 1988, when a separation of commercial and
central banking activities took place. Legislative reforms introduced in 1990 extended banking services
to include a wide variety of ownership structures, and there are in operation today 4 state-owned
commercial banks (SOCBs); 36 share holding banks (30 in urban areas); 69 credit cooperatives; 3 joint
venture banks; 16 foreign bank branches (and 64 foreign bank representative offices); and 153 popular
credit funds. There are also two finance companies and one government-owned insurance company. The
Government is developing a securities market, and a limited debt securities market is expected to be
operational by end-1995. A full account of recent developments in the financial sector is contained in
Viet Nam Financial Sector Review. An Agenda for Financial Sector Development (World Bank Report
No. 13135-VN), March 1995.
A. SECTOR OVERVIEW
2.2          Despite the impressive numbers of new banking institutions entering the market, Viet
Nam remains an under banked country. The ratio of currency and deposit liabilities of banks (M3, or
broad money) to GDP appears to have stabilized in recent years at around 23%, a level considerably
lower than that in other transitional economies and regional countries. Anecdotal evidence and data from
the Viet Nam Living Standards Survey suggest that considerable savings in the form of foreign currency,
gold and precious metals and stones remain outside the banking system. Increased public confidence in
the Government's macroeconomic stabilization policies and in the financial system is necessary to bring
these savings into the formal system. The share of narrow money (currency plus demand deposits, or
Ml) to broad money (M3) has grown from 46% in 1989 to 56% in 1994. Currency continues to make up
about 80% of MI, and thus the share of cash in broad money was around 45% in 1994. This compares
with a cash/broad money ratio of 10% in ASEAN countries and less than 25% in most transitional
economies. The large proportion of cash in the broad money ratio reflects a lack of confidence in the
banking system caused, inter alia, by deficiencies in the payment system and a lack of banking services
geared to the individual.
The State Bank of Viet Nam
2.3          SBV's role is slowly but steadily evolving as it modernizes its operations in the context
of a developing market economy. It ceased direct lending to the productive sectors in 1991 and
terminated direct financing of the state budget in 1992. It is gradually adopting credit and money control
policies along the lines of central banks in market economies. Other central banking functions that the
SBV currently undertakes include active management of the country's foreign exchange reserves and the
conduct of inter-bank markets for domestic funds and foreign exchange. However, SBV still operates
under government guidance, and steps should be taken to increase its independence.
2.4          SBV has its head office in Hanoi, and branches in each of the country's 53 provinces.
This large branch network loses its relevance in a two-tier banking system. These branches are involved
in a variety of central bank activities such as supervision and clearing and settlement of payment
transactions. There is a need to modify the SBV's organizational structure and to redefine the role of its
provincial branches.

2.5           Monetary Control. A key challenge for Viet Nam is to strike a proper balance between
its desire for rapid growth and the need for macroeconomic stability. The Government has taken far-
reaching steps to unshackle the economy from central control, and has faced severe macroeconomic
imbalances in the transition process. Given the reemergence of inflationary pressures in 1994, the
Government is focusing on further reducing the fiscal and external deficits under an economic program
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. For the foreseeable future,
Viet Nam's monetary stance will have to be contractionary.
2.6           The SBV exercises monetary control through three instruments of monetary policy:
setting interest rates on banking system assets and liabilities; varying the cost and availability of central
bank credit to banks; and stipulating reserve ratios on their deposits. SBV has recently introduced credit
ceilings, in the aggregate and bank-by-bank, in an attempt to contain credit expansion. These instruments
are largely direct in character and their use retains elements of interventionism. The SBV is gradually
developing the tools and the skills to exercise indirect monetary control. An auction system to issue
Treasury bills is being developed, and pilot auctions commenced in December, 1994.
2.7           Supervision and Prudential Regulations. Bank supervision has existed since SBV's
creation in 1951, but needs to be modernized to better serve the needs of a rapidly growing banking
sector with diversified ownership. At present, SBV maintains an off-site surveillance system, developed
with technical assistance from the IMF, which is based on monthly prudential returns submitted by
banks. While improvements are required, the systematic collection and analysis of data are good first
steps in ensuring supervisory oversight of the deposit money banks. On-site supervision is largely
bottom-up at the branch or sub-branch level, and is conducted by the SBV's provincial branch network.
A change in the focus of supervision to a more top-down approach is required to ensure the health and
stability of the banking system as a whole. This implies a redirection of resources to address the sources
of greatest systemic risk.
The Commercial Banks
2.8           The commercial banking sector is dominated by the four state-owned commercial banks
(SOCBs), which accounted for 87% of commercial bank operations in Viet Nam in 1994. There has been
substantial growth of credit to the private sector since 1990, and although state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) are still the dominant users of credit, their share of bank credit has dropped to around 60% in
1994, from an average of 86% in 1991-92. Credit to the private sector consists essentially of short-term
loans for agriculture and commerce. Long-term lending, provided mainly by SOCBs to SOEs, is largely
in foreign currency. The structure of commercial bank funding has changed in recent times. In 1994,
around 40% of credit flows were met through a run-down of net foreign assets, reflecting in part an
increase in SOCB medium-term borrowing from foreign banks. The remainder was roughly equally
distributed among resources mobilized by the banking system on its own, net borrowings from the SBV,
and float associated with the weak payment system in Viet Nam.
2.9           An accurate assessment of bank financial performance is problematic, since accounting
practices deviate in many ways from international norms. A Chart of Accounts for commercial banks has
been defined with IMF assistance and is being implemented in all Vietnamese banks. However,
considerable upgrading is still required at the bank level to improve accounting practices. The
Government is canying out detailed portfolio audits and diagnostic reviews for two SOCBs, which will
permit a better assessment of their true financial situation. Similar diagnostics will also be undertaken for
the remaining four banks participating in the project. Chapter IV discusses the institutional framework



5
and financial performance of the six banks participating in the project, and detailed profiles of these
banks are given in Annex 10 to this report. Significant institution building is required to strengthen the
Vietnamese banking sector, and is being pursued through a variety of mechanisms, including the
proposed project (Section B).
B. THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
2.10          The development of the financial sector in Viet Nam is necessarily going to be a long-
term process. Action is required on many fronts to create a modern financial system capable of
supporting the country's transition from a centrally-planned economy to a market-oriented one. A
comprehensive discussion of the Government's policy orientations in the financial sector is contained in
Viet Nam Financial Sector Review (Report 13135-VN). Key elements of the Government's development
strategy are outlined below.
2.11          The Government is pursuing three key objectives for the further development of the
sector in addition to maintaining a credible, sustained and stable macroeconomic environment. These
are: (a) moving toward a market-based policy in monetary management; (b) fostering efficiency and
competition in the sector through equal treatment for all participants and through modernization of
common systems; and (c) promoting public confidence in the banking system. Given the vast reform
needs and the institutional capacity constraints, the Government's strategy for achieving these objectives
is based on a building block approach in which areas of immediate concern are addressed as a priority.
This strategy is also dictated by the Government's pragmatic political stance of gradual, but sustained
reform based on achieving a broad consensus among stakeholders.
2.12          In the area of monetary management, the Government intends to build upon its
achievements to date in moving from direct to indirect control. An auction system to issue Treasury bills
has been established, which provides a basic building block in the development of open market
operations. In the interim, steps are being taken to rationalize the direct instruments of monetary control
that are presently utilized. Interest rates are positive in real terms, and the inverted rate structure (the
stipulated rates for medium- and long-term loans are lower than those for short-term loans) is being
gradually redressed. Interest rate policy needs to be further modified to strengthen the financial
liberalization process, and this is an important element of the on-going policy dialogue that both the IMF
and the Bank are conducting with the Government. SBV's refinancing policy is being gradually modified
to make the SBV truly a lender of last resort. As part of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) program, the Government has removed the subsidy element involved in the refinancing
of specific, long-term loan contracts, and has limited the amount of such refinancing. The need for short-
term refinancing to cover shortfalls in settlement balances will be greatly diminished with the
consolidation of settlement accounts proposed under the proposed project (Chapter 3). The Government
prescribes a reserve requirement of 10% of deposits for all banks; however, effective reserves are
considerably higher since banks hold high levels of non-statutory "liquidity" or "transactions" balances
with the SBV. These pose a significant burden on the banking system, since reserves are not remunerated
on market terms. Here, too, improvements in the clearing and settlement function will eliminate the need
for large holdings of these other, non-statutory reserves.
2.13          A first step in rationalizing the role of the SBV branch network is being undertaken
through the removal of settlement accounts from the provincial level and their consolidation at the head
office level. The significance of this move should not be discounted. It represents an important step in



6
rethinking the role of the provincial branches, notably with respect to their supervisory role, and is the
peg on which to hang further organizational reform of the SBV.
2.14          Improvements in accounting practices are required at the SBV, and the IMF is a
significant source of technical assistance in this area. Reforms in SBV's refinancing policy, including
caps on the amount of central bank credit, should help strengthen the financial position of the SBV.
2.15          Constraints to intermediation are being gradually removed. A key constraint is the
inadequate payment system (Section C), which is being addressed by the proposed project. The
Government intends to eliminate the turnover tax on banking activity (the tax ranges from 2% to 30%
and varies by bank), which should reduce distortions in the system. However, additional measures are
needed to level the playing field. For example, the profit tax rate discriminates against the SOCBs, and
should be harmonized across banks. Provisions for doubtful loans are not tax deductible, leading to
disincentives for adequate provisioning. The Government is studying these problems with a view to
finding phased solutions that are politically acceptable and that are budget neutral.
2.16          In order to encourage competition in the banking sector, the Government has pursued a
policy of relatively free entry, as a result of which several banks are now operating in the country.
However, as discussed in Section A, the banking system is heavily dominated by the SOCBs, which are
hampered by an accumulation of inherited bad debt in their portfolios. As a first step in accurately
assessing the financial situation of these banks, comprehensive portfolio audits, carried out by
independent, international auditors, are planned for the four SOCBs and the two joint-stock banks
participating in the project. The audit of Agribank is underway, and a draft report is expected before end-
1995. Terms of reference for an audit of Incombank have been prepared with Bank assistance, and that
audit will be launched in the second half of 1995. Audits of the remaining two SOCBs as well as the two
joint-stock banks are expected to take place in 1996, and will be financed under the project. These
reviews will form the basis of concerted portfolio restructuring plans, notably to rid the banks of
inherited bad loans, and to determine appropriate capital requirements based on an accurate assessment
of their portfolios.
2.17          The Government accords a high priority to the institutional development of the banking
system. Thus, training and technical assistance in modern banking techniques is actively being solicited
from a host of bilateral and multilateral sources. The largest bilateral donor in this area is the Swedish
International Development Authority (SIDA), which is funding a multi-year training and technical
assistance project (Bank executed). This project has been instrumental in providing training to several
hundred middle and senior bank managers, and has facilitated Vietnamese participation in the SWIFT
international payment messaging service, as well as in drafting the Check Law. The project has provided
significant support to the National Payments Council (para. 2.29). Swedish assistance is also funding a
special audit of one SOCB. German technical assistance is helping to develop a Bankers' Association (an
independent body representing the profession). Other bilateral donors include France, which is providing
training in macroeconomics; Australia, which is funding the Agribank special audit; and the Netherlands,
which has expressed an interest in funding four commercial bank audits in conjunction with the proposed
project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is presently undertaking its own Financial Sector Review,
and has provided some technical assistance in the area of commercial banking and capital markets
development. The IMF is a significant source of technical assistance to the SBV, and has in place two
resident advisors who are working with the SBV in the areas of indirect monetary control procedures,
improvement of supervisory control, and foreign exchange management. The IMF has also provided
legal technical assistance to support the development of payment systems to complement the Bank's and



7
the Government's project preparation efforts. The Bank is assisting in the institutional development of
the Agribank through the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project (Credit No. 2561-VN).
2.18          The above activities notwithstanding, there remains a significant need to upgrade the
institutional and organizational capabilities of the commercial banks, and in particular, the SOCBs. The
Government is not keen to pursue an all-encompassing, top-down approach in such institutional and
organizational restructuring. There is likely to be significant resistance to such an approach from the
banks themselves, and the sheer magnitude of what needs to be done is likely to pose severe absorptive
constraints. Current Government strategy is to address SOCB issues in a thematic fashion across all
SOCBs, rather than to undertake the full gamut of organizational, institutional and financial studies on an
institution-by-institution basis. One reason for such an approach may be Government desire to maintain
all four SOCBs at similar levels so as not to be seen to be actively targeting any one institution.
2.19          The Government intends to develop securities markets as part of its financial sector
development strategy. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided significant technical
assistance to the SBV to put in place the necessary regulatory framework for such development. It is
expected that a national securities market, trading debt securities in an initial stage, will be operational
by the end of 1995. Adequate arrangements are required to facilitate the adoption of a delivery versus
payment methodology for securities trades, thereby ensuring an equitable allocation of risk to all
participants in a transaction. Such risk sharing is a critical success factor in securities market
development. The Government's other financial market development activities concern the foreign
exchange and inter-bank money markets. Adequate financial sector infrastructure, including satisfactory
payment arrangements, is essential to improve the transactional efficiency of these markets.
C. PAYMENT SYSTEM: CURRENT STATUS, CONSTRAINTS AND ORIENTATIONS
2.20          There have been significant improvements in the payment system in the past year.
Payments within the major cities are now effected within two or three business days, a vast improvement
over previous clearing cycles of two weeks or more. Nonetheless, the consensus among users is that
much more needs to be done to foster an effective and efficient system. Government payments between
agencies, as well as other expenditures, are handled outside the banking system. There is no electronic
payment of payroll, even in the larger companies. Cash is the predominant means of payment in Viet
Nam. The heavy reliance on cash has a historical basis, and can in part be traced to the legacy of a
monobank, which was not geared to serving the individual. High inflation in the recent past has no doubt
contributed to the public's lack of reliance on the banking system.
Payment Instruments
2.21          The range of non-cash instruments is limited at present, and non-cash payments are
paper-based. The most commonly used non-cash payment instruments are authorized payment orders,
which account for nearly three-quarters of all non-cash payments, and various forms of bank drafts.
Individuals have only recently been allowed to open checking accounts, and personal checks are not yet
widely used. Recent improvements in checks include a more convenient format and color coding by bank
to facilitate processing. Payment vouchers in denominations of D100,000, D500,000 and D1,000,000 are
available, with an expiry date six months after date of issue. The denominations are considered too low
by commercial banks, and too high by certain payees. Payment vouchers are susceptible to fraud, given
the printing techniques in use. A limited number of paper-based credit transfers takes place. International
credit cards were first accepted in Viet Nam in 1990, and appear to be increasingly used. Four



8
Vietnamese banks have recently been licensed by Mastercard to issue its cards. One domestic bank has
recently introduced a local currency card, whose use remains limited.
Clearing and Settlement Arrangements
2.22          The SBV has a head office in Hanoi, and maintains a branch in each of the country's 53
provinces. Each settlement bank is required to hold a settlement account with SBV in each province in
which it operates. The SBV branches act as provincial clearing and settlement centers for inter-bank
payments. Intra-provincial (local) inter-bank transfers are made through an exchange of paper documents
between banks at one, and sometimes two, clearing sessions per day. Checks are verified by issuing
banks via a physical inspection of the documents, and output lists are used as a basis for posting net
movement of funds to clearing house accounts, then distributed to participants via paper, diskette or
modem for input into the banks' customer accounting systems. Inter-provincial (non-local) inter-bank
payments require the transfer of both electronic instructions and paper documents. The electronic
instruction is transferred either via a national communications network developed by the SBV's Center
for Informatics of the Bank (CIB), or the commercial bank's own network. In the CIB network, transfers
are processed by the provincial SBV branch, which inputs the infornation onto the CIB system. CIB then
routes the transfer to the appropriate receiving SBV branch. Settlement accounts are debited and credited
accordingly upon receipt of a copy of the transfer document.
2.23          Procedures for intra-bank payments depend on the degree of computer support available
at branch level within the commercial banks and on the size of the branch network. In general, banks
centralize the processing of inter-bank transfers at one (Hanoi) or two regional centers, and transfer
requests are made via computer using dial-up links. Branches effect their transfers via their accounts
with the regional center. In view of its large branch network, Agribank currently organizes its inter-
branch transfers on a three-tier basis. Within a province, branches act for sub-branches and transfer
between each other, mainly via the postal system. Inter-provincial transfers are sent via dial-up link to
regional centers, which in turn process them via accounts held at the head office in Hanoi.'
2.24          Foreign payments were, until recently, mainly routed through Vietcombank, which
transmitted them via telex to correspondents. Several Vietnamese banks have recently joined SWIFT,
and systems have now been set up to allow their branches to transmit and receive foreign payments via
their respective head offices, with each branch having foreign currency accounts in the head office for
the posting of transactions. These banks are connected to the SWIFT access point in Singapore at
present, although there are plans to establish a SWIFT access point in Viet Nam in the coming years.
Current Payments Volumes
2.25          The total value of all payments is reported to be six times GDP, which reflects both a
shallow financial sector and relatively inefficient use of the money supply. In the more developed
economies of the region, the corresponding figure is around 10, while estimates for developed countries
(Group of Seven) range from 40-100. Nearly three-quarters of all payments are intra-bank, and over three
quarters of all intra-bank payments are intra-provincial. The average number of daily inter-bank
payments is less than 10,000, and about two-thirds are intra-provincial. Payments are concentrated in a
few provinces and cities (notably Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi). There are signs of very rapid growth in
Details on the main information flows involved in intra- and inter-bank transactions are available in the project
files.



9
non-cash payments, albeit from low levels: in 1994, the annualized rate of growth in payments averaged
50%.
Constraints
2.26          The underlying weakness of the current Vietnamese payment mechanisms stems from
the prior needs of a centrally planned economy. The current range of payment instruments and services
does not fully address the needs of customers for the reliable, confidential, timely and cost-effective
means of payment that are essential in a market economy. The current payment system is also unable to
cope with the anticipated significant increase in the volume of monetary transactions that are
characteristic of the transition process. The insecure and unreliable nature of the present
telecommunications infrastructure is a severe constraint on electronic funds transmission. The
commercial banks are reluctant to use the national inter-bank electronic funds transfer network for
reasons of speed, control and confidentiality. Most inter-provincial payments are achieved by a
combination of intra-bank and local inter-bank transfers, resulting in payment delays with all the
attendant consequences.
2.27          The requirement to fund settlement accounts at the provincial level ties up a significant
portion of commercial bank resources - resources that could be used for productive purposes - and
creates severe coordination problems. It is difficult for the banks to optimize the use of settlement funds
(either for clearing and settlement or for physical cash transactions) on a national basis, since there is no
effective mechanism for rapid transfer of funds between provinces. An electronic funds transfer
mechanism would permit the consolidation of settlement accounts at the national level.
Development Orientations
2.28          One of the key problems in the development of new payment arrangements is the need to
harmonize the objectives and goals of the SBV with the comparable objectives and goals of the rest of
the banking sector. The SBV also has the difficult task of developing and enforcing standards covering
payment instruments, operating procedures, and rules and regulations. The new payment arrangements
must be comprehensive and national in scope to meet the payment requirements of the Vietnamese
economy in an efficient manner. Thus, the improvement initiative must cover local and non-local inter-
bank payment transactions as well as intra-bank and international transactions. An additional
requirement is the need for an efficient integration of payment processing with customer accounting and
settlement accounting procedures.
2.29          To provide advice on the various tasks to be carried out in modernizing the system, a
National Payments Council (NPC) was set up in July 1994, consisting of representatives of the
concerned departments of the SBV, the SOCBs and the banking sector as a whole. In addition, a Bankers'
Association was established in August 1994. The NPC has established four working level sub-
committees as follows: (a) Legal & Regulatory and Accounting & Standards; (b) Automation
(computing & telecommunications); (c) Commercial Bank Modernization; and (d) Payment System
Operations. These sub-committees provide advice on critical policy and design issues related to their
assigned area of involvement.
2.30          The SBV's guiding principles behind the design, establishment and operations of the
national payments arrangements include: (a) universality of access by financial institutions; (b) cost
efficiency and self-financing through cost recovery; (c) minimization of payment system risks; (d)
integrity and reliability; (e) active user participation in all phases of system development; and (f) cost



10
minimization in system design through trade-off between the use of new and existing equipment. The
proposed project has been prepared in accordance with these guiding principles.
D. THE BANK'S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
2.31          The Bank is assisting in the development of the financial sector through a variety of
instruments. Analytical support and policy advice have been provided through two sector reports, the
first in 1990 shortly after the monobank was dismantled, and the second in 1995. These reports have
formed the basis of a policy dialogue with the authorities on financial sector development issues. Some
policy reforms pertaining to the financial sector, such as the removal of the turnover tax and the carrying
out of portfolio audits for two SOCBs, are being supported through the Structural Adjustment Credit
(Credit No. 2657-VN). The Bank has been instrumental in mobilizing bilateral assistance for conducting
these audits, and has assisted the Government in drafting terms of reference for the same. The Bank has,
since 1992, been involved in training and sundry technical assistance activities through two SIDA-
financed Banking Sector Training and Technical Assistance projects. The Agriculture Rehabilitation
Project is supporting the institutional strengthening of Agribank through training and technical
assistance, and is providing a line of credit for inputs and on-farm development works to private,
smallholder farm households. A Rural Finance Project is also under preparation, addressing the financing
needs of the rural poor by improving their access to the formal financial system.
2.32          Given the direct links between the real sector and the financial sector, a key element of
the Bank's policy dialogue with the Government has been to stress the need for real sector restructuring
in conjunction with bank restructuring. The Structural Adjustment Credit is supporting policy reforms in
the state enterprise sector. In addition, the Bank is executing UNDP-funded technical assistance through
a State Enterprise Reform Project which is assisting the Government in legal reform pertaining to the
sector and in implementing a pilot enterprise restructuring and privatization program.
2.33          The Bank has consistently sought opportunities to coordinate its financial sector
assistance with that of other donors in order to avoid duplication and to seek synergies between its
interventions and those of other donors. The proposed project is a good example of that approach: it
builds on the technical assistance provided to the SBV by SIDA in support of the NPC, SWIFT
membership and the Check Law, and it incorporates IMF technical assistance in the area of legal advice
pertaining to payment system development. Agreement in principle has been obtained for bilateral
cofinancing from the Netherlands to fund external audits of four banks (the remaining two SOCBs and
the two joint-stock banks that are participating in the project). In addition, the Economic Development
Institute has provided critical training during project preparation to familiarize the NPC with payment
system issues.
E. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.34          There has been one previous IDA operation with some banking sector involvement in
Viet Nam - the Agriculture Rehabilitation Project. This project involves, inter alia, a line of credit
channeled through Agribank, and includes technical assistance for strengthening of this institution. While
it is too early to draw definitive conclusions from this operation, implementation experience suggests
that the main project risks relate to the limited institutional experience. The proposed project has been
prepared bearing this constraint in mind. Lessons from other Bank experience in the payment systems
area include: (a) the importance of tailoring payment system solutions to the country's geography,
infrastructure, banking and legal structures, and culture; (b) the need for a formal project management



I1
structure, with the key involvement of the central bank; (c) active user involvement at both policy and
working levels in providing direction to the improvement efforts; and (d) a phased implementation
process whereby the system is extensively tested before "live" operations, i.e., introduced on a pilot basis
in an initial stage and only fully rolled-out after experience has been gathered in operation. These lessons
have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project.
F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
2.35         The last Country Assistance Strategy for Viet Nam (Report No. 13545-VN), discussed
by the Bank's Board on October 25, 1994, indicates that the greatest challenge facing the Govemment is
managing the transition to a market economy. Modemizing the financial system is a high priority that
will affect all sectors in Viet Nam, as is recognized in the Country Assistance Strategy, dated October,
1995. The recent Financial Sector Review identified key bottlenecks in the sector, including high
taxation of the banks and a weak payment system that discourages the use of the banking system. The
Country Assistance Strategy further states that one of the highest priorities in Viet Nan is to get the
financial system to provide basic services to producers, especially private farmers and firms, and to
mobilize capital now held in liquid forms outside the banking system. Put differently, a key task ahead
for the Government is to promote confidence in the banking system and make it more customer-oriented.
2.36         The rapid development of the Vietnamese economy requires the support of a robust and
efficient financial sector which, in turn, requires an adequate banking sector infrastructure. Efficient
payment, clearing and settlement systems and the associated legal and regulatory framework are the
principal building blocks of such an infrastructure. The Bank is uniquely placed to assist the Government
in the design and implementation of such financial system infrastructure. It has experience in such
projects and is well-equipped to deal with the variety of policy, design and implementation issues
involved. It can provide objective "best practice" advice, thereby ensuring that key strategic and policy
issues involved in the design of such systems are fully taken into account. The proposed project is fully
consistent with the Bank's broader financial sector strategy that is being pursued through analytical
work, policy dialogue, lending operations and technical assistance. Furthermore, it complements on-
going initiatives in private sector development.

3. THE PROJECT
A. OBJECTIVES
3.1           The ultimate objective of the proposed project is to assist in the development of a modem
banking sector able to service the needs of a growing economy, thereby increasing confidence in the
Vietnamese banking system. The immediate objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) improve payment
services in the economy in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and increase efficiency of
funds transmission, while providing convenience and service to users; and (b) strengthen the institutional
capabilities of participating banks in order to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal
management and customer service.
B. DESCRIPTION
3.2           The project consists of four components: (a) a national inter-bank payment clearing and
settlement system; (b) commercial banks' intra-bank payment systems; (c) commercial banks' institutional
strengthening and (d) project management support. A schematic description of the project is provided in
Figure 3.1. A detailed description of the payment system components of the project is contained in Annex 1.
The first two components (inter- and intra-bank systems) will be procured on a turn-key contract basis
wherein the contractor will provide the computer hardware, software, training and initial systems operation.
Thus, although not identified as a separate project component for the purposes of this section, training and
skills transfer is an integral part of project design and philosophy (see Section E). The commercial banks
participating in this project have been selected by the SBV on the basis of their involvement in payment
processing activity: among them, they account for 90% of banking activity in the country.
National Inter-bank Payment Clearing and Settlement System
3.3           The national inter-bank payment clearing and settlement system will address the needs of
both the SBV and the commercial banks and will provide local and non-local inter-bank clearing and
settlement services. This system will consist of two components: (a) an Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS);
and (b) a Settlement Account Processing System (SAPS).
3.4           The IBPS will handle intra- and inter-provincial domestic inter-bank payments in dong. A
currency conversion facility will be available for non-dong denominated payments. IBPS will comprise two
sub-systems: (a) a low value sub-system for credit transfers and pre-authorized debit transfers, able to
handle batches of items (bulk payments) as well as individual items, operating with a net settlement
mechanism; and (b) a high value sub-system for credit transfers, providing a real-time gross settlement
facility for individual time-critical payments.
3.5           Direct access to IBPS will be restricted to settlement banks, each of which will have a single
centralized settlement account at the SBV.  For settlement purposes, IBPS will interact with SAPS.
Participation criteria for settlement banks, covering financial strength, conformity with technical standards,
and risk management ability, will be established by the SBV (see Section G). A bank without a settlement
account may participate indirectly via a correspondent relationship with a settlement bank. IBPS has been
designed to permit access by settlement banks through six provincial processing (clearing) centers as well as
through the main banking centers of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Any commercial bank that meets the
participation criteria established by the SBV can use the system.



13
Commercial Banks' Intra-bank Payment Systems
3.6           The second component will address the intra-bank and international payments needs of the
six participating banks: the four SOCBs and as well as two joint-stock banks. There will be a Commercial
Bank Payment System (CBPS) for each of the six commercial banks (CBs) included within the scope of this
project. Each system will be able to handle all domestic intra-bank payments, both intra- and inter-
provincial. The CBPS has been designed to support the different customer accounting organization
structures (centralized, decentralized, or a hybrid) used by CBs. The generalized CBPS architecture is thus
capable of accommodating the varying needs of the CBs in their present situation as well as those of their
future customer accounting improvement plans (para. 3.8).
3.7           Payment instructions from a CB branch will be electronically transmitted, after validation,
to the account holding branches for updating of the customer accounts maintained for originators and
receivers. The stand-alone SWIFT-based international payments facility recently introduced at the head
offices of the CBs could, in due course, be integrated with CBPS to provide participating branches with the
ability to send payments to, and receive payments from, foreign correspondents.
Commercial Banks' Institutional Strengthening
3.8           The third component of the project consists of: (a) diagnostic reviews of the CBs'
modernization needs, with particular emphasis on the design of appropriate customer accounting systems;
and (b) diagnostic portfolio reviews and financial audits of the CBs to determine their true financial
situation. The introduction of an automated, integrated intra-bank payments and customer accounting
interface capability provides a sound infrastructure to allow the CBs to implement a range of new banking
products and other customer services by providing electronic access to customer accounts from all
participating branches. The diagnostic reviews of the CBs' modernization needs will be undertaken in two
phases. The first involves the drafting of detailed terms of reference, tailored to the specific situation of each
CB, which will be undertaken by consultants hired through the PHRD preparation grant (terms of reference
are contained in Annex 2). It is expected that these consultants will be fielded in December 1995. The
second phase involves the actual carrying out of the diagnostic reviews for each CB based on the agreed
terms of reference, which will be undertaken within the project timeframe. Terms of reference for the
portfolio audits are contained in Annex 3; these will be customized as necessary by each CB.
Project Management Support
3.9           The fourth component of the project provides support for project management, consisting of
consulting services for: (a) procurement of the systems (para. 3.19); and (b) technical support to the Project
Management Unit (para. 3.18); including vehicles and miscellaneous office equipment.
C. COSTS AND FINANCING
Project Cost
3.10          The base project cost is D507 billion (US$45.3 million equivalent), and total project cost
including contingencies is D674 billion (US$53.9 million equivalent), with a foreign exchange component
of about 92%, or US$49.6 million equivalent. Physical contingencies represent around 10% of base cost,
while dong price contingencies represent about 23%. Table 3.1 summarizes the cost estimates by
beneficiary and component; details are in Annex 4. Base costs are in January 1995 prices, and are derived
from the most recent equipment, material and labor cost data available for similar, turn-key operations.
Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of escalation factors of 7% and 6% for local costs for 1995
and 1996-99 respectively, and 2.6% for foreign costs. The Government of the Netherlands has expressed an
interest in cofinancing the portfolio audits of the four commercial banks (US$1 million).

Financing Plan
3.11          Table 3.2 summarizes the proposed financing plan for the project. IDA financing will
account for about 81% of the total requirements of US$60.5 million equivalent. The proposed IDA
credit of US$49 equivalent will finance 99% of the estimated foreign exchange cost and will be made
to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam at IDA's standard rate for a 40 year term, including 10 years of
grace on repayment of principal. The SBV, on behalf of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, would be
the primary implementing agency. Part of the proceeds of the IDA credit would be on-lent to the CBs



16
in the amounts shown in Table 3.3, at a fixed interest rate of 6.25%1 per annum, with repayment in US
dollars over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The dong/dollar foreign exchange risk would
be borne by the CBs. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Implementing and On-lending
Agreements, satisfactory to IDA, setting out the terms and conditions of the on-lending arrangements in
respect of each CB's improvement plans and providing for CB carrying out of their respective
components, would be concluded between the SBV and the CBs as a condition of effectiveness of the
IDA credit. Draft Agreements were reviewed at negotiations and found satisfactory.

D. IMPLEMENTATION
3.12         The project will be implemented by the SBV and the six CBs. Project implementation
procedures will vary by the type of goods and services to be procured. The system contract supplier
will initially be responsible for the full operation of both inter- and intra-bank systems. The inter-bank
system will be implemented by the SBV and the supplier in four phases after procurement:
*  construction, including detailed systems specification on the basis of the technical
specifications already prepared; site preparation and installation, system testing and
development of training plans, required documentation and disaster recovery plan and
drill;
*  initial pilot, in which the new systems will be installed in selected initial pilot sites,
new settlement accounts will be established, and parallel running of old and new
payment systems will be ensured;
*  pilot expansion, including site preparation for remaining sites, delivery of on-site
training, further acceptance testing and decommissioning of the old payment system;
and
*  operations and maintenance, in which the vendor will operate the new inter-bank
system for a period of one year after it has been installed in all sites covered by the
project.
In parallel, the SBV will finalize the legal and regulatory framework (Section G), operating rules and
procedures for membership in the new payment arrangements, and telecommunications service
agreements (Section F). A tentative project implementation plan is contained in Annex 5. Annex I
contains details on the sites included in the project for both the IBPS and CBPS.
3.13         The intra-bank systems will be implemented by each CB, and will follow broadly the
same structure and phases as the inter-bank system. The pace of implementation will depend on the
individual implementation capacity of the CB concerned. Similarly, expansion of the system beyond
the sites selected for inclusion under the project will depend on the individual needs and financing



18
capabilities of each CB. The institutional development component of the project will also be
implemented by each CB.
Project Management Arrangements
3.14         The proposed project will be a large and complex undertaking, involving many
different players. Project organization and management plans will need to change over time to support
the shifting requirements of the project as it progresses from preparation to full operation. The Project
Management Plan (available in project files) is perforce an evolving document, which will describe at
any given point the current thinking on project organization and implementation plans.
3.15         The SBV has ultimate executive responsibility for the project. The NPC (para. 2.29)
will play an important advisory role in policy formulation, membership rules and guidelines, payment
system rules and regulations, standards, pricing and cost recovery. Operational support to the various
SBV departments and CBs will be provided by a Project Manager and a Project Management Unit.
3.16         Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU was established in September 1995
within SBV, and is primarily responsible for: (a) coordinating day-to-day implementation activities; (b)
administering the IDA credit; and (c) serving as the focal point for Bank supervision activities. The
PMU has been staffed with appropriately qualified personnel and will be responsible for the planning,
scheduling and executing day-to-day activities during the procurement, construction and
implementation phases of the project.
The PMU will be responsible for the following:
credit administration: procurement, disbursement, administration of on-lending
agreements, internal reporting;
*     translation and interpretation: project translation and interpreter support;
project planning and monitoring: activity planning, resource management, cost
control, progress reporting;
*     risk management and change control: threat assessment and management, project
change control;
*     organization and communications: NPC, SBV, CB and third party communications,
project library; and
*     key  relationship  management: World  Bank, telecommunications, suppliers,
consultants, other ministries and agencies.
3.17         As the project progresses through each phase, the PMU will need to respond to
changing project requirements, and the relative importance of the different functions can be expected to
change over time. For example, project planning, organization and communications will be crucial at
the start of the construction phase, while emphasis will switch to risk management and change control
once the principal project planning tasks are completed. Logistic support for the PMU, consisting of
three vehicles and miscellaneous office equipment, will be provided under the project. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the PMU will be maintained with staff in adequate numbers and with
functions acceptable to IDA, for the life of the project.



19
3.18          Resident Advisor. In order to assist the PMU, a Resident Advisor will be appointed.
This individual would be an experienced technical specialist who would advise the PMU on technical,
project management and vendor contract matters. Given the complexity of the project and the very fast-
changing technological environment of computerized systems, it is advisable to have an experienced
professional during system construction and pilot operation to provide independent advice to the PMU
on vendor proposed change orders and system design modifications. The SBV is particularly desirous
of having such support in view of the limited local experience in dealing with foreign vendors and with
implementing of complex systems. The Resident Advisor will be hired prior to contract negotiations
with the vendor and so will be available at the very onset of the construction phase. It is crucial that the
person selected be committed to working in Viet Nam and be flexible enough to respond to the PMU's
changing needs. Terms of reference for such a person are provided in Annex 6.
Procurement
3.19          Procurement arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3.4, and the
procedures to be followed are described in Annex 7. Consulting support will be provided to assist the
PMU in procurement matters. The cost of each item includes its pro rata share of physical and price
contingencies. The portion of the project not financed by IDA would follow the normal procurement
procedures of the entity concerned. All consultants will be retained on the basis of qualifications, terms
of reference, and a selection procedure acceptable to IDA.2

3.20          About US$43.95 million equivalent of goods and services, or 85% of the IDA credit,
would be suitable for procurement through a single system contract following international competitive
bidding (ICB) procedures according to the Bank's procurement guidelines and using the Bank's
2   In the event that the portfolio audits are financed by bilateral assistance from the Netherlands, qualifications
and terms of reference acceptable to IDA would be required.



20
standard bidding documents. In the evaluation of bids obtained following ICB procedures, a margin of
preference equal to 15% of the CIF price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and import
taxes, whichever is lower, will be allowed for domestic manufacturers. About 14.6% of the credit
amount, or US$7.2 million equivalent, would be used for financing consultant services procured
following the Bank's procedures for the use of consultants. Miscellaneous off-the-shelf, readily
available goods (including vehicles) with a per item value of less than US$50,000 equivalent would be
eligible for procurement through national shopping (NS), with a minimum of three quotations, in an
aggregate amount not to exceed US$1 10,000. Prior review and approval by IDA would be required for
all bid documents, contract award recommendations and contracts for goods and services procured
under the project. The total number of procurement packages is foreseen to be: (a) ICB - one package;
(b) NS - four packages; and (c) consulting services - 12, covering some 500 person-months of services
for policy and implementation support.
Disbursement
3.21         The estimated disbursement of the IDA credit is shown in Annex 8 and summarized in
Table 3.5. This assumes that the Credit Agreement will become effective by February 1, 1996. The
project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1999. A credit closing date of June 30, 2000 has been
established. The credit is expected to be disbursed approximately 5 years after effectiveness based on
the advanced stage of preparatory work, particularly with regard to the largest contract (85% of credit
amount). Retroactive financing not exceeding US$4.9 million equivalent of the proposed credit is
recommended for eligible payments made prior to the date of credit signing, but after the appraisal end
date of May 12, 1995. These expenditures would concern consulting services and equipment required
to support the PMU, and will contribute to an efficient start-up of project activities, including bid
preparation for the system contract.

3.22         The credit will be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for goods, 100%
of local expenditures for goods (ex-factory), and 75% of local expenditures for other items procured
locally (all for the PMU); (b) 100% of total expenditures for consulting services, excluding taxes; and
(c) 95% of the system contract supply and installation, exclusive of taxes. (The remaining 5%
represents local handling, transportation and related costs.) Disbursements for all expenditures would
be based on full documentation. The SBV will open a Special Account in a commercial bank with an
authorized allocation of US$500,000 (representing an average of about 4 months' small disbursements)
to facilitate payments for eligible expenditures. Application for replenishment of the Account,
supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted monthly or when the account is drawn



21
down by 20% of the authorized allocation, whichever occurs first. For withdrawals outside of the
Special Account (application for direct payment or for issuance of Special Commitments), a minimum
application value of 20% of the authorized allocation of the Special Account would be observed.
Monitoring, Reporting and Supervision
3.23          Performance Monitoring. Monitoring of payment system  perfornance is an
important aspect of ensuring that the system meets the stated needs of users and generates the sought
after improvements. To help build confidence in the system, a strict daily processing timetable will be
developed, as will a reporting system to demonstrate realized service levels to participants.
Performance measures that will be monitored include: system availability, message throughput, delays,
faults and errors, time-to-repair, and communication service levels and line speed. A detailed list of
performance monitoring indicators is contained in the Project Management Plan (available in project
files). A list of implementation progress and development impact indicators is provided in Annex 5.
3.24          Project Accounts. The PMU will maintain separate project accounts for all project
components. These accounts will be audited by an independent auditing firm. Audits will be provided
within 9 months of the close of the Vietnamese fiscal year. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that project accounts, audited by a firm acceptable to IDA, will be provided within 9 months of the
close of each fiscal year.
3.25          Periodic Progress Reports. The PMU will provide semi-annual progress reports on
the status of on-going and planned project activities. These reports will be provided by September I
and March I each year, covering six-monthly activity from January to June and July to December,
respectively, and beginning March 1, 1996. In addition to physical progress in project implementation
and the status of key project activities, the progress reports will provide financial information relating
to expenditures planned, committed and disbursed. The PMU will monitor project performance
indicators on a regular basis, as described in paragraph 3.23, as well as general implementation and
development impact indicators as described in Annex 5. For the purposes of the periodic progress
reports to IDA, the PMU will provide summary statistics on: system availability (percent of normal
business hours that the system is ready and available for use); total number of payment messages per
day (including number of messages during the daily peak hour); system performance (number of faults
and errors in hardware and software per month); and mean time to repair for major hardware and
software faults. These indicators will be calculated once the testing phase of the project is complete and
pilot implementation has begun. Cost recovery indicators will also be presented in these progress
reports (costs, including telecommunications, and pricing structure by payment message type). In
addition, the PMU will provide any information relating to the project as may be reasonably requested
by IDA from time to time.
3.26          Supervision Plan. Supervision of the project by IDA will extend over a period of
approximately five years (1995-1999). The focus of supervision will change as the project progresses
through its different phases. In the very early stage, the focus would be on the procurement process for
systems and technical assistance services, including the establishment of the PMU for project
implementation. Once the selected vendor has begun system construction, the focus will turn to the
technical supervision of detailed system design and implementation plans. During this phase of project
implementation, supervision would also concern the requisite operating rules and procedures and
organizational arrangements. On the technical assistance side, the focus of supervision would be on
following up with the selected consultants on the status of the institutional studies and audits. Once the
institutional studies and audits have been completed, the supervision effort would switch to agreeing on
the appropriate follow-up to the results of these studies. Supervision of the project would require



22
expertise in payment systems and commercial bank institutional development. At least two supervision
missions would be required annually over the life of the project, and more frequent supervision support
should be programmed for the first 18 months of project implementation. Such additional supervision
effort will be facilitated by coordinating it with other missions to Viet Nam and the region. Bank
supervision will follow the indicative plan provided in Annex 9, and will require an estimated 70
staffweeks over the life of the project. Around 19 staffweeks will be at headquarters to review, inter
alia, procurement actions and progress reports.
E. STAFF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
3.27          Staff training and development is one of the most important factors that will influence
the success of the project. The vendor will be required to train and develop staff in the SBV and CBs.
In general, the level of training and development delivered by the vendor must be sufficient to ensure
that the inter-bank and intra-bank payment systems can be successfully operated and maintained by
Vietnamese banking personnel after one year of operational support. The training program will be
mainly focused in three broad areas:
*      application training will address the needs of technicians and end-users (bank branch
personnel, systems operators, supervisors and managers) and train them in the use and
operation of the inter-bank and intra-bank payment system applications;
*     technical training will cover the skills required to support the installation, operation,
and maintenance of the computers and telecommunications equipment and services.
This training will primarily be delivered to technical personnel in the SBV and CBs;
and
*      management training will cover the skills necessary to ensure that the new payment
mechanisms deliver the sought after improvements. This training will therefore focus
on interpreting and using the information that will be generated by the system.
3.28         Due to the large numbers of personnel that will be involved, a cost effective approach
to training delivery will have to be employed. It is envisioned that the training courses and materials
will be developed and delivered in modular and repeatable units. A "train the trainers" approach may
also be used as a way to contain training costs. Vendors will be expected to provide a full set of easily
maintained materials and course notes for each training module. In their proposals, vendors will be
required to demonstrate that they understand the difficulties and complexities involved in developing
and delivering a large scale training program in a foreign language in a transitional economic
environment. The adequacy of the training and skills-transfer program will be an important element in
the evaluation of the proposals. Through these measures, it is expected that the SBV and CBs will be in
a position to deliver any required on-going training by the end of the contract period.
F. TELECOMMUNICATIONS
3.29         The National Inter-bank Payment Clearing and Settlement component of project is
critically dependent upon the availability of a secure and robust data communications network. Without
such a network, the ability to implement an Electronic Funds Transfer system will be severely limited.
Two options are available to satisfy this need. The banking sector could: (a) build and operate a
dedicated closed user group data communications network; or (b) procure the necessary data
communication services from a reputable supplier. Skills availability and economic factors strongly



23
support the second option, as it would obviate the need for the banking sector to develop a capability
that has no real relationship with banking and could be best satisfied by the national
telecommunications sector.
3.30         Improving the telecommunications infrastructure is one of the highest priorities of the
Government, and significant investments are being committed to upgrading physical circuits and
installing a modern telecommunications infrastructure backbone. According to current plans, there will
be digital fiber optic and microwave links across the country, digital switches in all 500 districts in Viet
Nam by the end of 1995, and such switches in all 10,000 villages by the year 2000. Also, Viet Nam is
in the process of implementing an X.25 data communications network. Viet Nam Post and
Telecommunications (VNPT) have recently signed a contract with a leading international
telecommunications company, to procure, install and initially operate a nationwide X.25 data
communications network. Installation planning is well advanced with equipment delivery expected by
end-June 1995, initial implementation (6-8 major sites) by September 1995, access nodes in 30 cities
by the end of 1995, and nationwide coverage completed by the end of 1996.
3.31         This delivery schedule is in line with and adequately meets the timetable established
for the IBPS component of the project. The testing of the new payments mechanisms and the initial
pilot implementations are expected to start in early- 1997, when the X.25 data communications network
will be in operation in the IBPS pilot implementation sites. The architectural design of the envisaged
new national payments arrangements is predicated on the assumption that VNPT will provide all data
communication services required by the SBV and participating commercial banks. These services will
include the provision of data quality physical circuits from the X.25 switch (owned and operated by
VDC, the data communication subsidiary of VNPT) to the processing equipment located within the
payment system participant's premises. Specific communication interface requirements will be
specified by VNPT. The project includes the equipment to be installed within participants' premises
necessary to establish the link/interface with the X.25 data communications network. All services and
equipment required to establish the physical connection from a specific location to an X.25 access point
will be the responsibility of VNPT/VDC. Minutes of Agreement between the SBV and the Department
General of Posts and Telecommunications (which oversees VNPT and VDC), signed in September
1995, provide a clear statement of intent by both parties to purchase or provide, respectively, initial and
future data communications services required for payment operations. These Minutes were reviewed at
negotiations and found acceptable.
3.32         Appropriate pricing arrangements and Service Level Agreements are now being
negotiated between the SBV/CBs and VNPT. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
requisite X.25 data communications capabilities between the eight IBPS and PPC sites will be made
available by September 30, 1996. Agreements were also obtained that a Service Level Agreement
describing the data communication service, service level parameters, service level performance values,
and service credits and other consequences of non-performance would be entered into between
SBV/CBs and VNPT, on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, by December 31, 1996.
G. LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
3.33         The SBV attaches great importance to the development of a comprehensive legal and
regulatory framework to underpin all aspects of the new payments arrangements. Significant work has
already been accomplished with the advice of the Legal & Regulatory sub-committee of the NPC to
facilitate the efficient and equitable operation of the payment systems to the benefit of all the
participants involved. This sub-committee is advising on a series of decrees to ensure that:



24
*      the legal structure by which the payment systems are owned, controlled and monitored,
including provisions governing membership or access to the systems and the
establishment of their rules and regulations, is soundly based and ensures proper
representation of all the participants;
*      procedures and regulations for the day-to-day operation of the systems, especially
regarding the clearing and settlement timetable and the finality of the payment process,
are clearly documented;
*      specific rights attached to existing or newly proposed payment instruments, whether in
paper or electronic form, or related to the way they are handled and settled, are
formalized unambiguously;
*      the participants in the systems, as providers of services and users of instruments, are
clear as to their rights, responsibilities and liabilities to each other and have statutory or
similar protection and redress in the event that fraud or mistake by other participants
results in a financial loss; and
-      internationally accepted standards, definitions and procedures are adopted to the extent
possible.
3.34          Several major documents have been produced and are being readied for formal review
and modification prior to final action by the appropriate Vietnamese authorities. These authorities
include: the Governor of the SBV, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Trade and the appropriate Standing Committee of the National Assembly. The primary documents
include: (a) the Decree Law on Checks; (b) the Regulation on Completing and Auditing Accounting
Vouchers and Maintaining Accounting Documents; (c) the Regulation on Electronic Fund Transfers;
and (d) the Regulation on Organization and Technical Procedures for Inter-bank Clearing and
Settlement Operations (available in project files). A variety of internal and external advisers have
contributed to the drafting of these major documents, including relevant departments from the SBV and
commercial banks, international legal firms, and the IMF. Comments from all sources have been
examined and analyzed to determine their appropriateness to the realities of the Vietnamese
environment. Prior to implementing the new payment arrangements, the SBV will produce an overview
descriptive document detailing all the essential factors of interest to payment system participants in a
single place, thereby obviating the need to reference multiple documents.
3.35          Participation criteria and membership rules for commercial banks in the IBPS need to
be established. Typically, these criteria require that participants: be licensed to provide banking
services in the country; be in good standing, meaning that they are financially sound and have not
violated any existing rules and regulations; have a settlement account with the SBV; and satisfy certain
minimum transaction volume requirements. Furthermore, participants are normally required to accept
and work within any published rules, regulations, standards and operating procedures governing the
payment system. Draft participation criteria along these lines were reviewed at negotiations and found
satisfactory. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that participation criteria, satisfactory to IDA,
would be adopted by the SBV as a condition of effectiveness.
3.36          Operating procedures for the IBPS are being developed by SBV with advice from the
Legal & Regulatory sub-committee of the NPC. Typically, such procedures cover: type of items
processed; entry, storage, release and delivery of payment messages; primary and back-up computer
facilities; formats and reports; account identification numbers; charges; clearing and settlement



25
procedures; liabilities for loss sharing; fraudulent transfers; operating hours; participant requirements;
system inquiries; and administrative procedures. It is desirable to finalize these operating procedures
once the system has been designed and tested, and after any implementation issues have been ironed
out during the initial pilot phase. This would enable experience gained from actual implementation to
be incorporated into the operating procedures such that a tried and tested set of rules is made available
to IBPS participants when the system commences "live" operations. According to the present
implementation schedule, "live" operation of the IBPS is not expected before June, 1997. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that drafts of the SBV regulation on electronic funds transfer (para. 3.34)
and IBPS operating procedures would be prepared and furnished to IDA for comments, and thereafter
issued by December 31, 1996, taking into account IDA's comments, and that the IBPS would be
implemented in accordance with such regulations and procedures.

4. THE BENEFICIARIES
A. PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
4.1          The ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the Vietnamese people, who will have better
payment services, and the Vietnamese banking system as a whole, which will be able to offer secure and
reliable payment services to its customers. The direct beneficiaries of the project are: (a) the State Bank
of Viet Nam (SBV) for the inter-bank payment system and for the institutional strengthening of the
PMU; and (b) the participating commercial banks (CBs) for the intra-bank payment improvements as
well as for the commercial banks' institutional development component. Four of the banks are fully
state-owned: the Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank), the Bank for Investment and Development
of Viet Nam (BIDV), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank), and the Bank for
Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank); and two are shareholding banks with public/private
ownership: the Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Eximbank); and the Viet Nam Maritime
Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank). These banks together account for around 90% of banking
activity in the country.
B. THE STATE BANK OF VIET NAM
Organizational Framework
4.2          The SBV is the country's central bank. Prior to the banking reforms of 1988-89, it was
the country's monobank, engaging in both central banking and retail credit activities. The State Council
passed two Decree-Laws in May 1990 aimed at establishing a modem two-tier banking system (available
in project files). The SBV Decree-Law redefines the organization and functions of the SBV, while the
Commercial Bank Decree-Law lays out the rules for organizing and operating commercial banks, credit
cooperatives and state- and privately-owned financing companies. The SBV's retail credit operations
were hived off into two new state-owned commercial banks, Agribank and Incombank (para. 4.15).
4.3          SBVs' headquarters are in Hanoi and it has branches in each of the country's 53
provinces. These branches act as quasi-independent central banks for their particular provinces. They are
involved in clearing and settling payments at the provincial level, and perform a supervisory function for
banks within their province. Each provincial branch is headed by a director, and typically has four to
five departments.
4.4          The Center for Informatics of Banking (CIB) is a separate organizational unit within the
SBV system and provides technical support for computerized bank applications. Its headquarters are in
Hanoi and it has a branch in Ho Chi Minh City. At present, the CIB operates the SBV's electronic
payment clearing system. The total staff of CIB number 120. The CIB is headed by a director who
reports to a deputy governor at SBV headquarters. An organizational chart of the SBV is attached to this
report.
Budget and Control Procedures
4.5          The Accounting Department at SBV's headquarters is responsible for, inter alia,
preparing annual budgets for the SBV system. A draft budget is prepared around September of each year
for the succeeding fiscal year. The budget process may be characterized as being bottom-up and top-
down: each of the operational units and branches within the SBV system (numbering approximately 60)



27
submit their individual draft budgets, which are consolidated at headquarters, while in parallel, draft
budgets for the SBV system are prepared by the Accounting Department based on various strategic and
operational directives at headquarters for items such as credit, foreign exchange and gold purchases,
personnel and salaries, training, construction and equipment purchases. The draft budget represents a
fusion of these two approaches. This budget is submitted to the appropriate director-level counterparts at
the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Finance around October, and discussions are held with
these agencies to reach consensus on the draft budget. The draft budget is then submitted to the relevant
deputy governor, who discusses it with the directors of all the SBV departments to reach another
consensus on its contents. It is then submitted to higher level representatives of the State Planning
Committee, the Ministry of Finance and the Board of Administration of the SBV for approval, typically
in December.
4.6           Once approved, the total budget for the SBV system is allocated to each individual unit
or branch. Around 10-15% of the total budget is reserved as contingency at headquarters for adjustments
during the course of the fiscal year. Once the individual budgets have been received, the branches and
units are free to make expenditures provided that they pertain to the approved expenditure categories and
fall within the allocated amounts. Approval from headquarters is required for individual transactions
exceeding DIOO million for expenditures involving equipment and office supplies, small construction
works, and the rehabilitation or upgrading existing fixed assets. The Director of the Accounting
Department is authorized to approve expenditures under D300 million, while the approval of the deputy
governor concerned is required for per-item expenditures above this amount.
4.7           Within the allocated categories and prescribed limits, there do not appear to be specific
government procurement procedures that need to be followed for spending the resources allocated.
However, all expenditures are subject to internal audit by the SBV. Each operational unit has two to
three internal auditors who review expenditures (and where applicable, revenues) for their individual
units. These auditors have a dual reporting relationship: to the director of the branch or unit concerned,
and to the Internal Audit Department at headquarters. At headquarters, the Internal Audit Department
undertakes the internal audits of organizational units such as CIB (in addition to the various headquarters
departments), and may undertake its own audit of certain expenditures at the branch level. In addition,
expenditures made by the SBV system are subject to Ministry of Finance review at the end of each fiscal
year.
Personnel Policies
4.8           SBV employs 4,900 staff at its headquarters and in its 53 branches.
4.9           Staff salaries are included in each individual unit or branch budget, and are based on the
administrative salary scale applicable to the SBV system. The Personnel Department at headquarters is
closely involved in any staff changes throughout the SBV system. For example, if a branch wishes to
recruit additional staff, it must obtain the approval of the Personnel Department, which then instructs the
Accounting Department to increase the salary allocation for the branch concerned. In addition to their
salaries, SBV staff receive certain bonuses and allowances that, on average, amount to 60% of their base
salaries. In general, salary levels are low and uncompetitive with commercial banks (including state-
owned banks).
4.10          Staff Training. The SBV runs two Banking Colleges which now offer, in addition to a
general, banking college-level curriculum, specialized short courses for the benefit of the banking system
at large. They are also the recipients of significant donor assistance, including two SIDA-financed, Bank-



28
executed Banking Sector Training Projects. These projects have provided: (a) training in general
banking practices for middle and senior level managers drawn from domestic banks; (b) programs for
trainers to enable the Vietnamese to have their own training force; (c) computer skills courses focusing
on banking applications; and (d) various specialized short courses in key functional areas such as foreign
exchange transactions, loan appraisal, financial analysis of projects, etc.
4.11          The SBV is committed to upgrading the skills of its staff, and constantly seeks avenues
to introduce its staff to modem banking techniques. Training is provided through a variety of means:
overseas study, through both long-term programs and study tours; in-country courses and seminars run
by international experts; in-country training offered through domestic universities and colleges; and on-
the-job training provided by resident experts and through rotational assignments. Specialized training in
payment systems has been provided in the course of project preparation by EDI. The provision of
training in areas relevant to system implementation and operation has been built into the proposed
project by requiring the tum-key supplier to provide the necessary training as part of the contract, and by
phasing out supplier operation as local staff are trained in the use of the new system (see Chapter 3).
Financial Performance
4.12          Selected financial performance indicators for the SBV are shown in Table 4.1. SBV's
profits rose in 1994 as a result of an increase in income and a sharp decrease in expenditures, explained
to some extent by an increase in the efficiency of its operations, particularly with regard to foreign
exchange operations. As a result, the declining trend in SBV's return on assets ratio seems to have been
reversed. Nonetheless, SBV's capital to assets ratio remains low, and could be a cause for concem if
there are recurring losses.

4.13          The SBV is turning its attention to strengthening its accounting practices with assistance
from the IMF. As with other areas of institutional development, the strengthening of SBV's operating
and accounting practices is going to take time. As a first step, a chart of accounts has been defined and is
being implemented; improvements to the chart of accounts based on implementation experience will be
an on-going process.



29
C. THE PARTICIPATING COMMERCIAL BANKS
4.14          The participating commercial banks include the four state-owned banks (Agribank,
BIDV, Incombank, and Vietcombank) as well as two joint-stock (shareholding) banks (Eximbank and
Maritimebank). Banks within each group share many common characteristics. The paragraphs below
present these common features for each set of CBs. Detailed profiles on each CB are contained in Annex
10.
State-owned Commercial Banks
4.15          Organization. Two of the four SOCBs were in existence even during the monobank
days prior to 1988: Vietcombank, established in 1963 to handle the country's foreign trade finance and
management of foreign exchange reserves, and the BIDV, established in 1958 to provide long-term
finance for public works and infrastructure projects, and to serve as the financing conduit for the State
public investment program in these areas. The other two SOCBs - Agribank and Incombank - were hived
off in 1988 from the SBV's retail credit departments covering agriculture and industry, respectively. All
SOCBs operate under their specific charters, and while they still maintain a certain degree of
specialization based on their historical role, they are by law universal banks and allowed to engage in any
legal banking activity.
4.16          All SOCBs are governed by a Board of Directors, which normally meets twice a year to
establish operating targets and objectives and to examine past performance. The Board is chaired by the
General Director of the SOCB and includes representatives from the MOF and the SBV as members.
The General Director appoints Board members contingent on the approval of the Governor of the SBV.
The General Director is the Chief Executive Officer conducting day-to-day activities and is appointed by
the Prime Minister at the proposal of the Governor of the SBV.
4.17          The SOCBs operate branch networks of differing extent, ranging from 17 branches at
Vietcombank to over 500 at Agribank. In addition, the SOCBs make extensive use of smaller sub-
branches and transaction offices, which offer a narrower range of banking services and which serve a
significant resource mobilization function. The degree of autonomy and credit authority varies among
the banks, and a number of factors usually weigh in credit decisions, including: the size of the branch,
credit worthiness of the borrower, the size of the loan, the term of the loan, and the nature of the asset or
project to be financed.
4.18          Accounting. All SOCBs apply the Commercial Bank Chart of Accounts as mandated by
the SBV. This accounting framework deviates from internationally accepted accounting principles: the
treatment of earnings from problem loans is unclear, provisioning for problem loans is minimal or non-
existent, and there are no guidelines for the consolidation of accounts. The Government mandates items
as diverse as depreciation expense for equipment to allocation of retained earnings. The portfolio audits
and diagnostic reviews either underway or planned for the SOCBs will permit a better assessment of
these accounting deviations.
4.19         Auditing. None of the SOCBs is subjected, in the normal course of events, to an
independent external audit. All of them have some form of internal audit procedures, exercised through
the Comptroller's Department, which monitors compliance with internal policies and regulations. The
SOCBs have also implemented some form of "off-site" monitoring between headquarters and branches
wherein branches send in regular reports on credit outstanding, deposits mobilized, etc. All SOCBs are



30
subject to SBV supervision, generally on an annual cycle. The MOF provides a certification of SOCB
accounts on an annual basis, generally within three months of the close of the fiscal year. This
certification is provided after the MOF has checked compliance with the latest rules and regulations on
past activity. There is a forward looking element of such financial control wherein the MOF renders an
opinion on the financial viability of prospective SOCB activities, and ensures their consistency with
Government directives.
4.20         Two SOCBs (Agribank and Incombank) are undergoing comprehensive financial audits
and portfolio reviews as part of the Government's general financial sector development program. Such
diagnostic reviews for the other two SOCBs (Vietcombank and BIDV) will be undertaken under the
project for the 1994 and 1995 fiscal years (para. 3.8). Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
these audits will be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to IDA.
These comprehensive diagnostic reviews will enable a better appreciation of the true financial situation
of all four SOCBs, and will set the stage for portfolio restructuring, asset classification and portfolio
monitoring. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that financial statements for each SOCB, audited
by auditors satisfactory to IDA, will be submitted within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year over
the life of the project.
4.21         Staffing Policies. Each SOCB has an active program of staff recruitment, with well-
defined procedures and criteria for selection. In general, new recruits must be university graduates in
finance, accounting, economics, or banking, and must demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language.
Basic computer skills are also required. Some SOCBs have rigorous testing procedures and the demand
for entry-level jobs appears to be quite strong. There appears to be little or no mid-career recruitment.
The SOCBs are at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment compared to joint-stock banks, and
particularly foreign banks, due to their rigid, administered salary scales. Although SOCBs are allowed to
supplement the low base salaries through the payment of bonuses, the maximum amount of the bonuses
that can be paid is also administratively determined. The bonus ratio is determined on a bank-by-bank
basis by the SBV and the Ministries of Finance and Labor, and is based on the SOCBs' expected profit
for a given year. The bonus is distributed equally across a salary grade, and the system does not provide
particular pecuniary rewards (or sanctions) for performance. There is greater autonomy in promotion
decisions in recent times, and most SOCBs are now promoting staff based on performance and potential,
rather than on seniority.
4.22         Training. All SOCBs recognize the critical importance of providing training to their
staff in modern banking techniques. All of them participate in the various bilaterally funded training
programs offered in Viet Nam (para. 2.17), and they all encourage English language training through
special training allowances and other incentives. Some of the more enterprising SOCBs have set up in-
country seminars and training programs provided by their correspondent banks. Overseas training is also
provided to some staff through bilateral programs and similar arrangements with foreign banks, and
Vietnamese banks have been accessing their correspondent network for this purpose. Such training is
generally short-term in nature.
4.23         Taxation Regime. SOCBs are subject to the following taxes: (a) turnover tax; (b) profit
tax; and (c) a capital use tax. The turnover tax ranges from 2% to 30%, depending on the type of bank,
and is applied to the interest margin (interest income less interest expenditure). A turnover tax of 6% is
applied to service and fee income on a gross basis. Turnover taxes are expected to be eliminated as part
of the structural adjustment program being implemented by the Government. The profit tax rate for
SOCBs is 45%, applied to net income before any provisions and reserves. The capital use tax is 6% on



31
the statutory capital of the bank. "Excess profits" after the payment of these taxes and after the
constitution of the allowed reserves are turned over to the Government.
4.24         Provisions and Reserves. The SOCBs' equity accounts include three special funds that
could be called general and specific reserves. A Bonus Fund consists of funds allocated for staff
bonuses, while a Welfare Fund to provide for pensions and such, and a Fund for Construction and
Procurement to finance fixed assets. Reserves for "Risk Prevention" are maintained by each SOCB,
which is allowed to set aside 10% of net earnings each year for this purpose. However, no guidelines
have been established as how these funds are to be used to deal with problem loans.
4.25         Financial Performance. Summary financial performance indicators for the SOCBs (in
addition to the joint-stock banks) are shown in Table 4.2. Details are available in Annex 10.
Joint-stock Banks
4.26         Organization. Eximbank and Maritimebank operate as joint-stock banks. They have
only been operating since the late 1980s, owing their establishment to the dismantling of the monobank
system and to enabling legislation that permitted the creation of private banking institutions. Both banks
concentrate in financing particular commercial sectors: Eximbank focuses on exporting and importing
activities and Maritimebank works primarily in shipping and telecommunications. Although individuals
own shares in both banks, institutions comprise the major shareholders. Not surprisingly, trading
institutions predominate among shareholders of Eximbank, and shipping and telecom firms own most of
Maritimebank's shares. The shareholders of these banks meet at regular intervals and elect a Board of
Directors to represent their interests. The Board of Directors selects senior bank officers and exercises
considerable responsibility in bank policies and operations. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank are fairly
small, with only a couple of hundred employees each, but both plan extensive expansions. Both banks
have only a handful of branches, concentrated in the major commercial areas of the country, and both
have developed extensive corresponding banking relationships.
4.27         Accounting. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank comply with Vietnamese rules and
regulations concerning the preparation of their financial statements. However, as noted previously,
Vietnamese accounting does not necessarily follow internationally accepted principles. In view of this
fact, Maritimebank has invested considerable time and effort into revamping its accounting systems and
computer capabilities to allow it to prepare financial statements that follow international norns, and
these should be available for the 1995 fiscal year.
4.28         Auditing. Both banks have an internal unit that performs an auditing function. These
units work to ensure compliance with internal policies and procedures. They function independently
within the structure of the banks and report to their Boards of Directors. The SBV exercises a
supervisory role over both Eximbank and Maritimebank, as it does with all banking institutions in the
country. Neither bank undergoes regular external audits. However, in 1992, Maritime underwent an
external audit by an international accounting firm from Hong Kong as part of its participation in the
Vietnam Country Fund. Both banks indicate that the principal reasons for the past lack of external audits
are inadequate accounting standards and a lack of domestic auditing capacity. Comprehensive portfolio
reviews and financial audits for the 1994 and 1995 fiscal year will be undertaken under the project.
Although these banks are new and are not burdened with inherited bad loans facing the SOCBs, such
reviews will help identify weaknesses in the portfolio and in credit management that need to be
addressed for the future health and sustainable growth of these banks. They will also provide a measure
of comfort to potential foreign investors. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that these audits will



32
be carried out in accordance with terms of reference and timing acceptable to IDA. In addition,
assurances were obtained at negotiations that financial statements for each bank, audited by auditors
satisfactory to IDA, will be submitted within 9 months after the close of each fiscal year over the life of
the project.
4.29          Staffing Policies. Both Eximbank and Maritimebank recruit staff using the same criteria
as the SOCBs. They look for recruits who have a college-level education in a banking or financial
discipline, who have a facility with a foreign language, and who are computer literate. New recruits at
Eximbank must undergo foreign language testing and endure a three to six month probation period.
Maritimebank requires new employees to sit for a formnal examination after an initial training period.
Eximbank is reportedly required to follow state guidelines concerning its pay structure.  Despite
supplementing this pay scheme with a system of bonuses, Eximbank cannot compete with salaries
offered by other private and foreign banks, and bank managers report a serious turnover problem.
Maritimebank, on the other hand, does not appear to be bound by government dictates in the
determination of its salary structure, and offers relatively high wages which are further supplemented by
bonuses. Consequently, employees of Maritimebank can earn appreciably more money than similarly
skilled staff working at SOCBs. Although managers at Maritimebank report that they still cannot match
the salaries offered by foreign institutions, they report no significant turnover problems.
4.30          Training.  Both Eximbank and Maritimebank are committed to enhancing the
professional qualifications of their staff through training activities. In recognition of this fact, both banks
report that they contribute considerable financial and human resources to training their staff. Given this
expense, Eximbank has enacted policies that attempt to recover training costs for staff leaving the bank.
While most training concentrates on banking topics, foreign language training is also stressed. Both
banks attempt to satisfy most of their training needs internally, but also utilize external training
resources. They also provide their managers with limited overseas training, and have been creative in
locating funding sources to cover the associated costs.
4.31          Taxation Regime. Both banks pay a profit tax of 45%. However, they are subject to
different rates with regard to the turnover tax. Eximbank pays a rate ranging from 6% to 25%, while the
range formn Maritimebank varies from 6% to 1 5%.
4.32          Financial Performance.  Summary financial data for Eximbank and Maritimebank
(along with the SOCBs) are shown in Table 4.2. Details are available in Annex 10.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS, BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. INTRODUCTION
5.1          Much is required for efficient financial sector development: a sustained, stable
macroeconomic environment; sound financial sector policies; and a competitive and well-functioning
banking system. This project attempts to improve the functioning of the banking sector through
improvements in basic financial sector infrastructure. A well-functioning payment system is a necessary
underpinning to efficient financial sector development. A poor payment system can lead to inefficiencies
in the use of the available money stock, inequitable risk sharing between trading parties, and inadequate
support for the development of other financial services. Ultimately, a well-functioning payment system
increases confidence in the banking sector. Confidence in the banking sector can also be increased by
strengthening the institutional capacities of the banks, and by enabling them to provide a range of new
banking products and services to their customers. Key first steps in this regard are being provided under
the proposed project: the carrying out of comprehensive portfolio audits to determine the banks' true
financial situation, and the development of modernization plans, tailored to the specific needs of the CBs,
to enable these banks to meet the demands of a fast-growing, market-oriented economy.
5.2           Section B of this chapter discusses financial aspects related to the inter-bank payment
system and presents an analysis of cost-recovery scenarios. Section C discusses major project benefits,
while Section D presents an assessment of project risks.
B. COST RECOVERY
5.3          The SBV will operate the inter-bank clearing and settlement systems (IBPS and SAPS),
incurring investment costs and on-going operating costs. These costs will be recovered by charging
direct participants (settlement banks) appropriate fees for the services provided. Break-even prices have
been calculated on the basis of estimated costs and for several scenarios of payment volume growth.
Growth of payment volumes is likely to proceed in three stages: (a) further increases in the volume and
value of industrial and commercial transactions, following past trends; (b) an influx of high value
financial market transactions within the next 3-5 years; and (c) rapid growth in the volume of low value
personal sector payments in the next 5-7 years. Given the uncertainty regarding the timing of future
volume increases, the system has been designed to be readily expandable at short notice. In its present
configuration, the system is expected to accommodate the payment needs of the Vietnamese economy
until the year 2003.
5.4          There are two major influences on the rate of growth of non-cash payment volumes:
*     the rate of economic growth; and
*     the rate of migration from cash to non-cash payments, driven by the level of confidence
in the banking system and the technical quality and cost efficiency of payment services.
5.5          Real GDP growth is forecast at 8% per annum for the rest of the decade, while the
proportion of Ml (narrow money) to M3 (broad money) is forecast to rise from 56% in 1994 to 85% by
2000. Currency is expected to make up a lower proportion of Ml than in the past, reflecting greater use
of the banking system. Most banks are predicting growth in payment volumes of at least 25% per year;
growth in payment volumes was around 50% in 1994.



34
5.6           Total annual inter-bank payment volumes for the period 1995-2003 were estimated from
a starting point of 300,000 for the last quarter in 1994. Four scenarios of payment growth were
constructed:
*      10% growth per annum to 1997; 15% growth thereafter;
*      10% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter;
*      20% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter; and
*      20% growth per annum to 1997; 60% growth thereafter.
5.7           System costs are fixed (initial investment and start-up; basic operation and annual
maintenance) and variable, or volume dependent (additional operating costs as volumes processed
increase). For a given year and a given scenario, there is a break-even price at which the stream of
revenues is equal to the stream of costs. This break-even price is for the inter-bank clearing and
settlement only, and does not take into account the costs incurred by the commercial banks in processing
payments up to the point at which they enter IBPS as an electronic payment instruction, and on receipt of
electronic instructions from IBPS. Furthermore, telecommunications costs are not included in the
estimates pending negotiations with VNPT/VDC; however, rough estimates indicate that they would add
between US$0.10-US$0.60 per transaction. Table 5.1 shows the results of this analysis for the various
scenarios described above.
Table 5.1: Break-even Prices for Inter-bank Clearing and Settlement
(US$/transaction)

10% to 1997; 15% thereafter    13.05    5.46    3.46    2.42    1.84    1.47    1.21
10% to 1997; 30% thereafter    13.05    5.01    2.94    1.91    1.34    0.99    0.75
20% to 1997; 30% thereafter    10.47    3.80    2.13    1.32    0.88    0.61    0.44
20% to 1997; 60% thereafter    10.47    3.44    1.77    0.99    0.60    0.38    0.24
5.8           The above table indicates the range of average prices that must be charged to achieve
full cost-recovery of the system under the different assumptions of volume growth and at different points
in time.1 The actual tariff schedule will have to be determined based on the desired differentiation in
rates for high value, time-critical payments requiring real-time gross settlement and low value bulk
payments that will be settled on a net basis. Telecommunications costs will also have to be incorporated
into the tariff structure. It is envisaged that there will be an initial subsidy to encourage use, but that this
will be recovered within the first few years of live operation. The system will generate a surplus after
break-even, which could be applied to further system expansion.
5.9           Even under the most conservative growth scenario, and allowing for full cost recovery
by 2000, barely four years into implementation, the average price that needs to be charged per
transaction is US$2.42 equivalent, not including telecommunications costs. Even if the high end of the
The model divides total cost incurred to date for the design, installation and operation of the system by the
total number of transactions to arrive at the break-even price for a given year.



35
estimates available for telecommunications costs is used, the total cost per transaction is around
US$3.00. Clearly, the actual prices charged will depend on the type of transaction, and can be expected
to vary around this average figure. Nonetheless, this average cost should be compared to the present high
value payment clearing and settlement charge of US$30 per transaction. Uncertainties with regard to
final investment cost and payment volumes make it difficult to establish a pricing structure and fee
schedule at the present time. However, SBV's guiding principles are: (a) full cost recovery of fixed and
variable investment, operating and maintenance costs; (b) full cost recovery in a 5-7 year timeframe,
with an interim target of 70% cost recovery by 2000; and (c) differentiated pricing of payment services
depending on their time-criticality, value and settlement procedure. These principles are acceptable.
Assurances were obtained that the pricing structure and fee schedule would follow agreed principles.
C. BENEFITS
5.10          The major project benefits relate to the alleviation or elimination of payment system
related problems facing the banking sector at the present time.
5.11          The decentralization of SBV settlement obliges the banks to keep multiple current
accounts at each branch of the SBV, thereby tying up funds and increasing costs. The existing clearing
procedures do not allow a window before final clearing during which banks could cover deficits or place
surpluses on an inter-bank basis. No information concerning settlement account status is available during
the day. Because of these constraints, treasury management within the commercial banks is
impracticable and inter-bank money market activity is marginal. The proposed project addresses these
problems. At present, non-statutory balances held by the banking sector at the SBV amount to 12% of
total deposits (in addition to the required reserves of 10%), or close to D3 trillion. With the new system,
settlement accounts will be centralized, thus facilitating better treasury management and freeing up
resources that can be used for productive purposes. The centralization of settlement accounts will also
give a boost to the fledgling inter-bank market as banks rationalize their liquidity management.
5.12          Payment processing procedures are inefficient in that significant delays continue to
occur and result in uncertainty as regards to payment finality. Payment delays will be significantly
reduced under the proposed project, and float in the system will be reduced as a result. Float increases
intermnediation costs, and large and unpredictable float levels influence short-term liquidity in the
economy, thereby introducing additional uncertainty in controlling monetary aggregates. Even if only
25% of the total value of payments in the economy go through the banking system, one day's float in the
clearing and settlement cycle represents 0.5% of GDP. Under the proposed project, high value payments
would be processed in real time, rather than the present 2-3 days. For small value payments, the clearing
and settlement cycle will be reduced from up to 15 days at present to 1-2 under the new arrangements.
5.13          The choice of payment instruments is limited and does not meet modem requirements.
Modem payment systems will enable banks to develop new products (such as card-based consumer
systems) which can attract customers into the banking system and which can become an important
source of fee income. A strengthening of the intra-bank payment mechanisms will provide an effective
vehicle for developing the skills of CB personnel in essential management and bank operational
processes. The institutional development studies financed under the project will enable the CBs to
introduce customer accounting improvements. With centralized customer account management, CBs will
enhance their ability to offer good quality customer services. Improvements in operational efficiency and
customer service will improve the image of the banking sector, especially the image of the SOCBs. The
carrying out of audits will be the first step in assessing the true financial situation of the banks, and will



36
enable these banks to present their financial statements in internationally recognized form. This will
increase the confidence of private investors in these banks. In the case of the joint-stock banks, this will
facilitate tapping foreign investors for capital.
5.14          Project preparation has provided a sound basis for developing the essential legal and
regulatory framework for clarifying the rights and responsibilities of all parties in regard to the
processing of payments transactions. This work is well advanced and, when enacted through decrees
and/or regulations, will provide significantly increased user confidence in the banking system. In
addition, the necessary standardization of payment instruments, bank/branch identifier codes, currency
codes and payments transaction processing methods will provide a sound basis for the design of efficient
payment and customer accounting procedures in all financial institutions within Viet Nam, and is being
welcomed by these institutions.
D. RISKS
5.15          There are risks associated with every large and complex system development project,
and the proposed project is no exception. Threats to the success of the project are those events that might
result in an undesirable change to the project plan and implementation strategy. Formally identifying the
major threats, assessing their potential impact and formulating plans and strategies to eliminate or reduce
their impact are key elements of effective risk management. Such threats can stem from external sources,
internal sources, and the project structure and scope. Against this backdrop, the major threats facing the
project have been identified and steps have been taken to manage the associated risks, as noted in the
following paragraphs.
5.16          Inadequate cooperation between the several stakeholders in the project could result in a
lack of commitment and failure to realize project objectives. Project preparation has fully involved the
various stakeholders, and the project has received the approval of the various parties involved. The
established organizational structures will continue to be used for the procurement, construction and
installation phases of the project. The roles, responsibilities, working level inter-relationships, and
authorities of the NPC, its various sub-committees and the PMU as defined in the Project Management
Plan, will ensure the active involvement of all key parties to the project in making critical decisions.
5.17          A major project risk relates to the procurement process. The award of large contracts for
computer hardware and software is technically complex, and needs to be carefully managed. This risk
has been minimized in the proposed project through the design of a transparent system for procurement
under a turn-key contract and through the provision of consultants to assist in the evaluation process.
Procurement based upon incorrect transaction volumes and inaccurate descriptions of currently installed
equipment could result in sub-optimal purchasing decisions. Steps are being taken to ensure that the
necessary information is obtained and referenced appropriately in the bidding documents. This will
ensure that the new arrangements make optimum use, as far as is practical, of all existing equipment and
that the capacity of newly acquired equipment is in line with real needs.
5.18          Incomplete understanding of the payment system requirements and their technical and
operational implications could result in sub-optimal decisions and a negative impact on overall system
quality. To avoid this threat and to ensure the medium-term availability of all essential skills and
knowledge, the agreed acquisition strategy makes provision for the successful vendor to both operate and
support the new payment arrangements for a period of one year after full system implementation as well
as providing comprehensive training to relevant Vietnamese personnel.



37
5.19         Inadequate project management and procurement skills could result in project delays,
cost over-runs and adverse changes in project scope. Steps have been taken to limit these risks through
the establishment of the PMU, the production of a Project Management Plan defining key
implementation actions, the training of key PMU personnel, and the recruitment of a Resident Advisor
and experienced procurement phase consulting support.
5.20         Pressure to implement changes in project scope during the construction phase of the
project could result in delays and cost increases. In any development project, the cost of making changes
increases as the project proceeds, and in a turn-key procurement, vendors may request excessive payment
for implementing the requested changes. Steps are being taken to ensure that a well defined change
control function is built into the PMU to ensure that only essential changes are accepted for action and
that implementation is undertaken in a controlled manner. In order to supplement the technical
capabilities of PMU staff in this area, an experienced Resident Advisor will be recruited to provide the
necessary expertise.
5.21         Inappropriate arrangements for the provision of data communications services from
VNPTNDC could result in project delays and excessive costs. Steps have been taken to prepare the
PMU for the negotiations with VNPTNDC. Minutes of Agreement between the SBV and the
Department General of Posts and Telecommunications record the intent of both parities to purchase and
provide, respectively, the required data communications services. Since the implementation of
telecommunications improvements is well advanced and expected to be completed by end-1995, and
given that actual payment system operation is not expected before mid-1996 at the earliest, it is unlikely
that the lack of availability of data communication services will be a constraint on project
implementation. Nonetheless, the definition of contingency plans in the event that the necessary data
communications services are delayed will be required as part of the vendor proposals.
5.22         Delays in the construction of the primary and backup sites for the new inter-bank system
could hold up project implementation. However, since new buildings are not essential to house the new
systems, the fall-back option of using existing facilities should mitigate this risk.

VIET NAM
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Description of Payment System Components of the Project
A. NATIONAL INTER-BANK PAYMENT CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEM
1.           The national inter-bank payment clearing and settlement system will address the
needs of both the SBV and the commercial banks, and will provide local and non-local inter-
bank clearing and settlement services to satisfy financial sector needs for the next eight years.
This system will consist of two components: an Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS) and a
Settlement Account Processing System (SAPS). Figure I provides a schematic description of the
scope of the new payment arrangements.
2.           The Inter-Bank Payment System (IBPS) will be able to handle all domestic
inter-bank payments, both intra- and inter-provincial , in Vietnamese dong. IBPS will comprise
two sub-systems: (i) a low value sub-system for credit transfers and pre-authorized debit
transfers, able to handle batches of items (bulk payments) as well as individual items, operating
with a net settlement mechanism; and (ii) a high value sub-system for credit transfers, providing
a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) facility for individual time-critical payments (see Figure 2).
3.           Direct access to IBPS will be restricted to settlement banks, each of which will
have a single centralized settlement account at the SBV. For settlement purposes, IBPS will
interact with the SAPS. Participation criteria for settlement banks, covering financial strength,
conformity with technical standards, and risk management ability, will be established by the
National Payments Council. A bank without a settlement account may participate indirectly via
a correspondent relationship with a settlement bank.
4.            Each participating commercial bank will enter payment instructions into IBPS
via data entry terminals at its branches. Having been validated on input, these instructions will
be transmitted to a Provincial Processing Center (PPC) for automated clearing and routing to the
bank branches of the recipients. A currency conversion feature will be available to handle non-
dong denominated payments. Electronic data transmission between the participants will be
achieved by using the VNPTNDC X.25 data communications network. As a fall-back option,
there will be a facility for both magnetic diskette and paper-based message entry and distribution
at each PPC. Commercial bank will have alternative routing options for inter-bank payments (see
Figure 4).
5.           Multilateral netting of low value payments at each PPC will occur at designated
times, initially end-of-day. (see Figure 3). On completion of the netting process, settlement
requests will be submitted to SAPS at the National Settlement Center (NSC). An individual
settlement request will be generated and submitted immediately to SAPS for each high value
payment received at a PPC. SAPS will make postings to settlement accounts unless there are
insufficient funds on the account to be debited and the funding requirement cannot be



40                                  Annex 1
accommodated with the bank's intra-day overdraft limit, in whicih case the settlement request
will be held in a queue pending receipt of funds.
6.            The automation of inter-bank payments clearing and settlement presents the
SBV with important policy issues. The participation criteria for settlement banks, the volume
and timing of inter-bank payment flows, and the availability of intra-day liquidity will have
implications for systemic risk and the cost-efficiency of the payment system as a whole. The
IBPS has been designed to permit changes in policy (for example, changes in settlement reserve
levels) to be implemented without difficulty. The IBPS has also been designed using a modular
architecture and thus can easily accommodate expansion in payments transaction volumes as
well as geographical coverage. Discussions on the essential policy issues have been initiated
with relevant NPC personnel and broad agreements have been reached on the initial positions to
be adopted.
7.            The inclusion of an RTGS capability will support the existing small number of
time critical payments transactions and will further support: (i) the needs of emerging inter-bank
money market transactions; (ii) the needs of a delivery-versus-payment approach to clearing and
settling securities markets transactions; and (iii) a payment-versus-payment approach to foreign
currency transactions.
8.            The technical design of the IBPS includes appropriate backup capability of all
critical components and processes, and accommodates the long tern data storage requirements
specified in relevant SBV regulations. In summary, the IBPS will provide an efficient, reliable,
secure and cost-effective solution to the present and medium term future needs of the
Vietnamese financial sector for inter-bank payments.

B. COMMERCIAL BANK'S INTRABANK PAYMENT SYSTEMS
9.            The second major component of the project will address the payments needs of
the four state-owned commercial banks as well as two share holding banks. The system has been
designed to provide intra-bank and international payments services to satisfy the needs of their
customers for the next eight years. The project will develop a separate Commercial Bank
Payment System (CBPS) for each of the six commercial banks included within the scope of this
project (see Figure 2). Each system will be able to handle all domestic intra-bank payments,
both intra- and inter-provincial. Initially, the main payment types will be credit transfers and
pre-authorized debit transfers, principally bank drafts and direct debits. Electronic payment
instructions derived from checks using truncation techniques and card-based transactions will be
added in due course.
10.           Each participating commercial bank branch will enter payment instructions into
the CBPS via a data entry terminal. Electronic data transmission will be achieved through the
VNPTNVDC X.25 data communications network. Delivery from and to the more remote
branches can be achieved by using dial-up modem links. The system has been designed to
support the X.28 dial-up capability and thus remote branches can have a seamless access to the
national X.25 services. Payment instructions may be checked/validated at the originating branch
with reference to limits set by that branch or by a controlling branch at a district/provincial level
or indeed by the bank's head office. After validation, these instructions will be transmitted to the
account holding branches for updating of the customer accounts maintained for originators and
beneficiaries.
11.           The CBPS  has been designed to  support several customer accounting
organization structures including: (i) a fully centralized customer accounting structure; (ii) a
completely decentralized customer accounting structure; and (iii) a hybrid structure with
centralization at the provincial level (see Figure 1). Thus, the generalized CBPS architecture
will satisfy the varying needs of the several participating banks, as well as other prospective
participants.
12.           The stand-alone S.W.I.F.T.-based  international payments facility recently
introduced at the head offices of the commercial banks can be integrated with CBPS, to provide
participating branches with the ability to send payments to, and receive payments from, foreign
correspondents.
13.           The introduction of an automated, integrated intra-bank payments and customer
accounting interface capability provides a sound infrastructure for use by the participating banks
in implementing a range of new banking products and other customer services by providing
electronic access to customer accounts from all participating branches.

C. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
14.           The overall technical objective of the payment system design is to provide a
modular and structured system architecture which follows best international practice. The
payment system consists of three integrated but independent components: (i) an applications
component: the software that provides the required business functions; (ii) a communications
component: the telecommunications networks which are used to transfer data electronically
between applications held in different physical locations. Separate networks exist for the inter-
bank and intra-bank payment systems, and there is one intra-bank network for each participating
commercial bank; and (iii) a processing component: the computers and other devices which run
the applications software.
15.           In line with modern design practices, a number of key design principles have
been followed. These are described in summary terms in the following paragraphs.
*  Application Independence. The application software modules will be independent
of both the communications and processing architectures. This will (i) help ensure
system data confidentiality, (ii) ease application software maintenance; and (iii)
allow for separate business decisions regarding the choice of communications
carrier, the introduction of new applications and the location of application
processing.
* Open System Architecture. International public standards (CCITT X Series) have
been used to ensure: (i) independence from vendors and their proprietary standards;
(ii) a wide choice of potential vendors; and (iii) ease of implementation and system
stability.
*  Common Communications Network. A network such as that being provided by
VNPT/VDC will provide reliable, secure and cost-effective data message and file
transfer capabilities using the X.25 access protocol.
*  Common Standards. These cover file and message formats, the identification of
banks, bank branches and accounts to ensure: (i) inter-operability; (ii) ease of
making changes to the system; (iii) ease of implementing new participants and new
branches; and (iv) overall efficiencies.
*  Modularity. This is to ensure that different applications or application modules can
be located on different computers at different locations depending on volumes and
organizational requirements.
*  Security and Integrity. The system must be secure, reliable and readily available
for use by participants. Consequently, its design incorporated the following: (i)
terminal access controls; (ii) file access controls; (iii) validation controls; (iv)
identification, certification and authentication; (v) software upgrades and
downloading; (vi) communications (Encryption/Closed User Groups); (vii)
certification of interfaces; (viii) confidentiality (of specific data); (ix) payment
message integrity (acknowledgments/sequence checks/time stamping, etc.); (x)
physical security; (xi) monitoring and measurement processes; and (xii) audit trails
to allow monitoring and tracing of every system event.



47                                 Annex 1
Reliability and Performance. As with all essential banking systems, care has been
taken to ensure that the system allows for: (i) ease of exception handling to permit
the rigorous treatment of such matters as validation errors, authentication failures,
and hardware and software faults; (ii) high levels of overall availability in the 99.5 %
plus region; and (iii) protection against major disruptions (disaster recovery) such as
natural disasters, but also covering such matters as loss of power supply or first level
communications.
16.          In addition to addressing the specific needs of the banking sector for secure,
reliable and cost-efficient payment systems, the project has been designed, at the request of the
owner, to provide an upgraded overall computing capability in designated branches of the SBV
and participating commercial banks. This has been accomplished by specifying additional
processing, communications and storage capacity to support existing and new application
systems. The technical architectures have been designed to permit modular expansion. Thus the
processing equipment which make up the architectures in the designated upgraded branches can
be further upgraded as capacity needs change. These upgrades can be accomplished through on-
site changes and thus can be made without disruption of services to existing users.
17.          The detailed user requirement specifications will be described in the project
bidding documents. These requirements will permit qualified vendors to offer best practice
solutions to satisfy the needs of the Vietnamese banking sector. In addition, care has been taken
to ensure that vendor solutions will make optimum use of the existing equipment that has been
purchased by the SBV and participating commercial banks during recent years.
18.          Schematic presentation of the processing architectures of the NSC, PPC, CBPC
and a typical CB branch are shown in Figures 5-8, respectively.

D. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT
19.          The payment systems component of the project is critically dependent upon the
availability of a secure and robust data communications network. Without such a network, the
ability to implement an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) system will be severely limited.
20.          Over recent years, the Government of Viet Nam  has demonstrated that
improving the telecommunications infrastructure is one of its highest priorities. Significant
investments are being made in upgrading physical circuits and installing a modem
telecommunications infrastructure backbone. Current plans contemplate a digital fiber optic and
microwave links across the country, digital switches in all 500 districts in Viet Nam by the end
of 1995, and such switches in all 10,000 villages by the year 2000. In addition, Viet Nam is in
the process of implementing an X.25 data communications network. Viet Nam Post and
Telecommunications (VNPT) has recently signed a contract with Sprint International, a leading
international telecommunications company, to procure, install and initially operate a nationwide
X.25 data communications network. Installation planning is well advanced with equipment
delivery expected by end June 1995, initial implementation (6-8 major sites) by September 1995,
access nodes in 30 cities by the end of 1995, and nationwide coverage by the end of 1996.
21.          This delivery schedule is in line with and adequately meets the timetable
established for the payment systems component of the proposed project. The testing of the new
payments mechanisms and the initial pilot implementations will not start until the first quarter of
1996 at the earliest. Banking sector confidence in the delivery and successful operation of the
data communications network is likely to be enhanced through the contractual arrangements
between VNPT and Sprint International.
22.          Based upon the above, the architectural design (see Figure 9) of the envisaged
new national payments arrangements is predicated on the assumption that VNPT will provide all
data communication services required by the SBV and participating commercial banks. These
services will include the provision of data quality physical circuits from the X.25 switch (owned
and operated by VDC, the data communication subsidiary of VNPT) to the processing equipment
located within the payment system participants premises. The payment system participant
equipment will be  owned and operated by the respective SBV and commercial bank
participants. Specific communication interface requirements will be specified by VNPT.
23.          The scope of the payment systems component for data communications
equipment will be limited to the equipment to be installed within participants' premises
necessary to establish the link/interface with the X.25 data communications network. All
services and equipment required to establish the physical connection from a specific location to
an X.25 access point will be the responsibility of VNPTNDC.

E. IMPLEMENTATION AND MIGRATION
24.           Modernization of the payment systems will be undertaken in four stages: (i) the
construction and successful operation of a 'testbed' for the payment systems to ensure that all
aspects of the initial new arrangements are appropriately tested in a controlled environment; (ii)
successful demonstration of all key aspects of the arrangements in a carefully planned and
executed initial pilot, which will test all aspects of the new arrangements in a real life operating
environment; (iii) the controlled roll-out of the new payment systems to additional SBV and CB
branches in the "first pilot network expansion"; and (iv) operation and maintenance of the new
systems for one year after the first pilot expansion.
25.           The location of the inter-bank testbed will be Hanoi. The location of each of the
six intra-bank system testbeds will be in each of the CB's respective Processing Centers. The
following will be provided for the testbed sites:
software development/modification and testing of the new systems;
*   test and certification of new  software releases or upgrades prior to their
installation into the live active systems;
*   operational, maintenance and support (help-desk) services for the live systems;
*   education, training and support services for SBV  and commercial bank
personnel; and
*   sufficient functionality to facilitate detailed and comprehensive testing.
26.           During each pilot, the existing payment mechanisms will run in parallel until the
new systems are proven. The initial pilot will cover:
*   establishment of an appropriate operating and administrative organization;
*   installation of the necessary equipment;
*   training of necessary personnel; and
*   establishment of a review group to monitor and report progress.
27.           The IBPS Initial Pilot will run for at least three months, and will include:
*   creation of a national settlements center (NSC) in Hanoi and at the back-up site;
*   development of the IBPS application software;
*   upgrading of the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City SBV branches to become
Provincial Processing Centers (PPCs) to handle electronic inter-bank payments;
*   creation of the pilot inter-bank network linking the NSC and PPCs to the X.25
data network;
*   connection of a number of CB branches to the inter-bank payment system
network; and
*   connection of CB head offices, via their CB processing centers, to the inter-bank
payment system network.



55                               Annex 1
28.          The intra-bank payment systems initial pilot will include:
*   upgrading the processing capabilities of the CB headquarters and its processing
center;
*   upgrading the processing capabilities of a number of CB branches as follows:

*   development, integration and implementation of intra-bank payment system
software, including the interface to customer accounting systems;
*   creation of a pilot intra-bank network linking the CB branches to the CB
processing center; and
*   connection of any upgraded CB branches in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to the
PPCs, thereby giving them direct access to the IBPS.
29.          Following the successful completion of each initial pilot, both systems will be
extended to include other branches and locations in the First Pilot Expansion phase. For the
IBPS, the pilot expansion will occur over twelve months to cover:
*   upgrading SBV branches in Hai Phong, Danang, Vung Tau, Can Tho, Nghe An,
and Nam Dinh to handle electronic inter-bank payments;
*   expanding the inter-bank network to link all the newly upgraded SBV branches;
and
*   providing additional local communications to connect CB  branches into the
IBPS.



56                               Annex 1
The intra-bank pilot expansion will include:
upgrading the processing capabilities of additional CB branches as follows:
Bank                         Number of Branches at
end of First Pilot Expansion
Agribank                   57
BIDV                       54
Eximbank                   3
Incombank                  59
Maritimebank               5
Vietcombank                17
*   expanding the intra-bank network; and
*   connecting the upgraded CB branches into the upgraded SBV branches thereby
giving them access to the IBPS.
30.          Following the successful completion of the pilot expansion, it will be possible to
include other commercial banks, and additional branches of the CBs, in the IBPS. Each new
participant will need to meet the membership criteria established by the NPC. However, for the
next few years, there will be banks that will continue to rely on existing paper/manual payment
mechanisms, and it will be necessary to support existing payment methods during the
implementation of the new systems and for a period during their subsequent operations.
31.          Settlement Accounts. At the start of the initial pilot, a national settlement
account will be created at the NSC for each commercial bank. During the implementation period,
each bank will need to maintain a settlement account at the SBV head office (NSC) and a
separate settlement account at each SBV branch to support the current method of payments. As
the IBPS is rolled out, the commercial banks can migrate to full electronic payments and thereby
reduce or eliminate their holdings of settlement balances at the SBV branches.
32.          The vendor will provide full-time, on-site operational support at sites to be
designated for each of the seven sub-projects (SBV and six CBs). This support will be provided
during implementation and for one year following the first pilot network expansion.

Background
1.          Initial steps have been taken by the six commercial banks participating in the
payments systems modernization project to develop an Information Technology (IT) Strategy to
support their evolving business and banking needs. The commercial banks recognize that future
business success will require a capability to respond rapidly to changing internal and external
needs for information based services and decision support mechanisms within an acceptable cost
and pricing structure.
2.           The on-going technical infrastructural investments in Viet Nam will provide a
basis for carefully paced information technology based changes. Typical areas within the
commercial banks that are targeted for improvement include the centralization of customer
accounts, the development of customer information records, improved treasury operations for
enhanced financial planning and control, as well as customer, portfolio and liquidity risk
management and the development of consolidated approaches to cash management. In summary,
the commercial banks want to exploit the ways that information technology can improve both the
internal management and operational activities as well as the products and services that can be
made available to customers.
3.           In order to identify these specific opportunities for realizing significant benefit
from IT, detailed "Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies" are required for each of the
six commercial banks participating in the project. These studies are expected to provide a
blueprint for the time phased implementation of selected initiatives designed to exploit the most
significant opportunities over a five year time period. Terms of Reference (TORs) for conducting
the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies for each of the six participating commercial
banks are to be developed as a matter of urgency. The purpose of this document is to provide an
outline description of the objectives and scope of the Improvement Specification and Scoping
Studies as well as the TORs for an initial short Study Definition Mission to develop and agree
the TORs for the detailed studies.
Objectives of the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies
4.           The primary objectives of the Improvement Specification and Scoping Studies is
to provide each participating bank with a soundly based description of the way in which IT can
be used, during the next three to five years, to support its transformation into a modern
commercial bank. These IT strategies should be consistent with the current and future business
plans of the bank and therefore should identify how the cost effective use of IT can address the
major business problems or opportunities that exist. In this regard, careful emphasis should be



58                                 Annex 2
placed on the already identified needs to improve management infonnation and executive
decision support mechanisms as well as computer based enhancements in areas such as customer
accounting, credit management, financial management, asset/liability management and risk
control. Particular attention should be given to the progressive centralization of customer
accounts and their integration with the already planned enhancements in the inter and intra-bank
payment system arrangements. The study outcomes should also include cost justified and time
phased implementation programs and technology acquisition strategies.
Study Definition Mission
5.            As mentioned at the outset, a short Study Definition Mission will be undertaken
to develop and agree the TORs for the detailed studies. Although there is likely to be much
commonality in the resulting TORs for each bank, the mission should recognize that custom
tailored TORs may be required. Based on the content of the resulting TORs and the views of the
participating banks, the mission should discuss the advantages and disadvantages of differing
execution strategies. For example, is there a need for six separate studies; one for each
participating bank, or is there advantage in combining or partially combining the work of the
detailed studies? The mission should develop a clear recommendation in this regard.
6.            The six participating banks are: (a) Agribank; (b) BIDV; (c) Eximbank; (d)
Incombank; (e) Maritimebank; and (f) Vietcombank.
7.            Specific issues to be addressed during the study definition mission, for each
bank, will include: (a) What key business and banking activities will be required to satisfy future
needs? (b) Which of these activities can benefit from an enhanced use of IT? (c) What IT
investments have already been made or are planned? (d) What benefits are being sought? (e)
What do the business priorities dictate in terms of IT development or acquisition? (f) What
application systems, hardware and networks are currently installed, can be modified or can be
developed? (g) What is an achievable level of (change) ambition during a three to five year
period? (h) What should be included in the scope of the detailed studies? (i) What preparation
work should be done prior to the commencement of the detailed studies? (j) How should the
studies be implemented? (k) What resources, human and financial, will be required to undertake
the studies?
8.            Based on the information generated from the above, the mission should produce
appropriately detailed Terms of Reference for each bank. These Terms of Reference should
define the specific objectives of each study, the approach to be adopted and the expected
outcomes. In addition, the Terms of Reference should clearly define the following:
* Project scope, structure and timing;
* Role of external consultants and commercial bank personnel;
* Guiding principles (For example; participative and designed to gain management
and user commitment at defined organizational levels);
* Definition of primary activities and key deliverables (For example, a statement
of user requirement specifications for the progressive centralization of customer
accounts for inclusion in a subsequent Bidding Document);



59                               Annex 2
* Estimate of required resources both internal and external expressed in weeks of
effort; and
*  An assessment of the primary sources of benefits.
As mentioned in paragraph 5, the mission should also make a clear recommendation as to the
opportunities for combining the six studies or parts of these studies.
Study Definition Mission - Required Resource and Timing
9.           The mission should make maximum use of the material that was generated
during the recently completed.user specification phase of the payments system modernization
project. In particular, use should be made of the 'Improvement Project Proposal(s)' that were
prepared by each of the six banks plus the associated meeting notes. These proposals broadly
covered the following topics:
Section A:          Introduction and Summary
Section B:          Description of the Present Arrangements
Section C:          Improvement Needs and Sought After Benefits
Section D:          Implementation Strategy
Section E:          Implementation Management Plan
Section F:          Anticipated Costs / Benefits and Sources of Funding
Section G:          Other Information (As Appropriate)
10.          These documents will be updated by each participating bank and should be made
available through the Project Management Unit (PMU) within the State Bank of Viet Nam. The
PMU has been established recently and is responsible for coordinating all work related to the
improvement initiatives. In particular, the PMU will be responsible for making meeting
arrangements and providing interpreters to support the work of the consultants during the
mission.
II.          The mission should plan on spending 15 days to complete the field work and an
additional 8 days to prepare the mission deliverables. Mission support will be provided by two
suitably experienced consultants; a commercial banking consultant and a banking oriented
computing and telecommunications consultant. Most of the work will be undertaken in Hanoi.
However, it will be necessary to visit Ho Chi Minh City and Hai Phong to meet with
representatives of Eximbank and Maritimebank respectively.

VIET NAM
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for External Audit and Diagnostic Review of a
Commercial Bank
1.           The Viet Nam Bank ....... seeks the service of an international public accounting
firm to audit the financial statements of the Viet Nam Bank . for the fiscal years ending
December 31, 1994 and 1995. In addition, the selected firm will also (i) prepare a special
diagnostic report; and (ii) prepare a comprehensive Management Letter summarizing the process
of the audit and specifically commenting on the issues or concerns raised during the examination
of the financial statements and the preparation of the diagnostic study.
2.            The audit and diagnostic review will be performed in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, will consider all relevant International Accounting Standards and
International Standards of Audit, and will comply with the recommendations of the International
Federation of Accountants. In instances where national standards, laws or regulations preclude
the use of such standards, and the effect is judged to be material by the auditors, adequate
footnote disclosure should be made, including the impact of such departure on the financial
statements.
3.            Where a bidding international accounting firm chooses to joint venture with a
local firm for this engagement, the international firm will be the prime bidder, and the audit
reports must be signed in the name of the international firm which will be solely responsible for
carrying out this assignment.
4.            The financial statements will cover the following:
(a)    balance sheet;
(b)   income statement;

61                                    Annex 3
(b)    Management and  financial information  generated  at field  offices  and
headquarters, with special attention given to the flow and adequacy of
information from field offices to headquarters.
(c)    Accounting practices and standards currently in use by the Bank, and how they
compare with generally accepted practice and standards.
(d)    Asset quality and the implied risk profile of the Bank. This assessment should
cover no less than 75% of assets, and should include not only loans but all other
extensions of credit (on and off-balance sheet) and the Bank's investment
portfolio. This assessment should include consideration of:
*  the level, distribution, and severity of classified assets;
*  the level and composition of non-accruing, non-performing, renegotiated,
*  rolled-over and reduced rate assets;
*  the adequacy of valuation reserves;
*  management's ability to administer and collect problem assets;

-  credit exposure.
* Problem assets should be identified and placed in risk classifications according to
specific criteria for "substandard", "doubtful", and "loss" categories as per the
attached classification and provisioning matrix. Assets should be categorized as
performing or nonperforming, and risk-classified irrespective of whether they are
overdue for payment, or whether guarantees and collateral are available. All credit
to an individual borrower (or to a related group of borrowers) should be placed in the
same risk classification or different classifications should be specifically noted and
justified.
(e)    Credit procedures and practices including consideration of:
*  the standard loan process from  the client's initial inquiry, or bank's
marketing efforts, to the final lending decision, and the credit decision
process;
*  formalized  credit policies and  procedures, underwriting  criteria  and
identification of target markets;
* lending organization, concerned departments, management levels and
staffing;
*  profile of chief lending officers, credit manager and officers, their lending
skills and that of all relevant staff;
* internal loan review process, internal risk categories, and procedures for
management of problem loans;
*  mechanism  for legal recovery, foreclosure and repossession of collateral,
and transmission of legal rights;

adequacy of financial information received from the borrower and analyzed
by the Bank as the basis for extension of credit and periodic assessment of
the changing risk inherent in the credit; and specific lending procedures and
techniques for project appraisal, approvals and legal finalization of projects,
procurement and disbursement, follow-up and supervision.
(f)    Adequacy of reserves for loan losses, and other valuation reserves, including:
*  the amounts set aside as specific reserves and general reserves;
*  the extent of reliance on collateral for establishing the recommended
*  reserves; and

e.g., specific reserves should be calculated and assigned in all instances
when the related problem assets exceed one-half of one percent of paid-up
capital and retained earnings.
(g)    Capital adequacy  giving  consideration  to  risk-weighted  assets and  the
recommendations of the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision;
(h)    Quality of earnings including the assessment of the reliability and composition
of reported earnings of the Bank, with consideration given to:
*  the extent to which accrued but uncollected interest is taken into income --
especially with regard to loans classified in risk categories of substandard or
worse;
*  the extent to which collateral values (rather then operating cash flows) are
the basis for decisions to capitalize interest and/or roll-over extension of
credit;
*  capitalization of expenses; and
* any other income recognition policies which distort earnings.
(i)    Liquidity position of the Bank both in terms of its ability to manage its asset and
liability positions and in terms of its ability to generate operating cash flows
sufficient to cover its operating cash expenses, with consideration given to:
*  the volatility of deposits;

prospects and timing for possible draws on guarantees and other off-balance
sheet items;
*  the overall adequacy, effectiveness, and compliance with liquidity, assets
and liability management policies; and
*  the nature, volume, and anticipated usage of credit commitments, contingent
liabilities, and guarantees.

VIET NAM
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for Resident Advisor
1.            As part of the country s financial sector modernization strategy, the State Bank
of Viet Nam wishes to improve payment services in the economy in order to reduce float, speed
up circulation of funds and increase efficiency of funds transmission while providing
convenience and service to users. For this purpose, a program to improve inter- and intra-bank
payment services has been designed, with the assistance of external consultants, and the
technical specifications of the required improvements have been defined. The Government of
Viet Nam is seeking financial assistance from the International Development Agency to
implement the new arrangements.
2.            A description of the project is contained in the Staff Appraisal Report of the
Payment System and Bank Modernization Project. Background on the financial sector in Viet
Nam is contained in a report entitled Financial Sector Review. Both reports are attached for your
information.
3.            The project is being implemented by the State Bank of Viet Nam  and six
participating commercial banks. The design, testing, implementation and initial operation of the
system will be undertaken by a vendor selected through International Competitive Bidding
procedures in accordance with IDA guidelines. The selected vendor will provide the necessary
services on a turn-key basis and will operate the system for a period of one year after successful
implementation in the selected pilot sites. A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been set up at
the State Bank of Viet Nam to oversee project implementation, coordinate the various project
activities and beneficiaries, and serve as the contact point for the vendor, IDA and other
interested entities.
4.            The State Bank of Viet Nam requires the services of a Resident Technical
Advisor to advise the PMU on technical, project management and vendor contract matters. The
successful candidate will serve as a source of independent, technical expertise during the system
construction and pilot operation phases. He/she will be expected to evaluate the validity and
usefulness of vendor proposed change orders and system design modifications, and provide
recommendations on the same to the PMU. He/she will work closely with all beneficiary
institutions to define desired modifications to the system design and implementation schedule
contained in the technical specifications, and will assist the PMU in negotiating these with the
selected vendor.
5.            He/she will assist the PMU in setting up the appropriate systems for project
implementation and financial monitoring and reporting. In addition, he/she will act as a resource
person for technical and project management advice to the commercial banks.
6.            The Resident Advisor should have a broad understanding of the project
management aspects of large scale complex software development projects covering: (a)



79                                Annex 6
application software design and development; (b) computer hardware and operating system
software; (c) transport networking; and (d) physical network equipment.
7.           He/she should have at least fifteen (15) years in the Information System (IS)
industry. His/her most recent five (5) years of industry experience should have been in a project
managerial capacity in which he/she managed directly or indirectly at least fifteen (15)
subordinate staff. In addition, he/she must have specific experience in working with vendors
employed on a contract basis. He/she should have specific experience gained through the
management of at least one significant project which involved the development, implementation,
operation and support of integrated solutions covering multiple sites, a large application system
software development and its integration with application independent communication network
services.
8.           In addition to the above, he/she should demonstrate enthusiasm  about the
specific opportunity to work on this very important project in Viet Nam.

VIET NAM
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Procurement Procedures
Inter- and Intra-bank Systems
I .           A turn-key contract for the inter- and intra-bank payment systems improvements
will be let on the basis of International Competitive Bidding. The Bank's Sample Bidding
Documents for computer systems will be used. Bids will be evaluated according to a two-stage
procedure.
2.            After Bank review and "no-objection" of the finalized bidding documents, and
after the requisite Bid Invitation Notices and local advertisement, the bidding documents will be
released to vendors. Vendors will be given 60 days to prepare their Stage I bids. A Bidders'
Conference will be held during this period to respond to questions and to provide any requested
clarifications to all interested vendors.
3.            The Stage I review of the bids will consist of an assessment to identify which
bids satisfy the specified qualifications criteria. These criteria are both general (standard
requirements as specified in the sample bidding documents) as well as specific to the project.
The general criteria include: information on the supplier, the company's financial strength, the
proposed use of sub-contractors, relevant experience, key personnel, key qualifications to
develop and implement the project, and other documentation specified in the bidding documents,
such as performance guarantees. Project-specific qualification criteria include the following:
(a)    the Bidder must have supplied software development services and relevant
integration and operation services covering software, hardware and
communication network equipment for at least five (5) years worldwide, and the
average annual turnover (total sales) in this regard over the last five (5) years
must have been in excess of 50 million US dollars worldwide.
(b)    the working capital for the fiscal year ending in 1994 of the Bidder must have
been in excess of 8 million US dollars.
(c)    the Bidder must have successfully implemented at least two (2) contracts
worldwide for a total value (per project) in excess of 15 million US dollars
within the last five (5) years for on-line transaction processing systems within
the banking industry using modern communication network systems, having had
turn-key management responsibility.
(d)   the Bidder must have on its current staff, at least one key person in each of the
following specialist areas involved in the project:
*  Application software design and development



81                                 Annex 7
*  Computer hardware and operating system software
*  Transport networking
*  Physical network equipment
Each key person must meet the following minimum requirements:
(a)    fifteen (15) years in the Inforrnation System (IS) industry, with the last ten (10)
years in the particular specialist area.
(b)   the last seven (7) years of industry experience in a managerial capacity with at
least fifteen (15) subordinate staff.
(c)   the overall Project Manager nominated by the Bidder must have at least twenty
(20) years relevant industry experience, the last ten (10) of which have been in a
project manager staff over extended periods which involved the development,
implementation, operation and support of integrated solutions covering multiple
sites, a large application system software development and its integration with
application independent communication network services.
4.            A sufficiently detailed contract compliance evaluation of those bids that meet
the above qualification criteria will also be undertaken in Stage I to identify those bids that are
deemed to be substantially compliant with the technical specifications. Deficiencies relating to
each bid will be identified and documented.
5.           At the end of Stage 1, a Stage I Evaluation Report will be produced and sent to
the Bank for review and "no objection". Desired modifications to the requirements will be
documented in an addendum for issue to Stage 2 bidders during pre-Stage 2 clarification
meetings. Vendors will be given 3 weeks in which to submit the Stage 2 bids. There will be a
public opening of Stage 2 bids, with the results being communicated to the Bank.
6.            The Stage 2 evaluation will consist of two components: a detailed technical
evaluation wherein each bid is scored for technical merit; and a detailed financial evaluation
wherein each bid is assessed on "value for money". A Stage 2 Evaluation Report will be
prepared, combining the results of both the above analyses, and providing a recommendation for
the bid award. Following the Bank's review and "no objection", the successful vendor will be
invited to negotiate a contract.
7.           Further details on the evaluation process, including the technical merit
weightings and detailed evaluation procedure and methodology, are contained in the Project
Management Plan.
Commercial Bank Diagnostic Reviews of Modernization Needs
8.           Terms of reference for each of the six diagnostic reviews (one for each
participating commercial bank) will be prepared by consultants hired through the PHRD grant
according to the requirements laid out in Annex 2. The resulting terms of reference and scope of
work will be finalized by each commercial bank concerned, and communicated to the Bank for
review and "no objection". Consultants to undertake these studies will be hired on the basis of



82                                 Annex 7
the Bank's guidelines: a Letter of Invitation will be sent to a short-list of consulting firms,
inviting proposals in regard to the terms of reference, and setting out the criteria against which
the proposals will be evaluated. Once the proposals are received, they will be evaluated in
accordance with these criteria, and an Evaluation Report, together with recommendations on the
award, will be sent to the Bank for review and "no objection", following which the commercial
bank concerned will sign a contract with the winning firm.
Commercial Bank Audits
9.            Terms of reference for the portfolio reviews and audits will be finalized by each
of the four banks involved on the basis of the draft contained in Annex 3. The procurement
procedures will be as for the Diagnostic Reviews. However, the procurement procedures of the
Government of the Netherlands will apply if it provides bilateral funding for these audits.
Project Management Support
10.          Miscellaneous equipment for the Project Management Unit (PMU) consists of
three vehicles, office furniture and three computers and related peripherals, for a total value of
US$ 110,000 equivalent including all contingencies. All items will be procured through
International or Local Shopping on the basis of at least three quotations. After sales service and
availability of spare parts and maintenance will be important criteria in the selection of the
vendors for the vehicles and for the computer equipment.
11.          Terms of reference for consulting support for the procurement phase should
include the following:
Finalize Bidding Documents (to be undertaken by PMU/NPC/CBs): Finalizing of draft
bidding documents, in particular the post qualification requirements, the methodology to be
adopted for the- two-stage bid evaluation, and the interfacing of technical requirement
specifications with the general terms and conditions of the contract as described in the model
World Bank document describing the Two-Stage Bidding process for procuring complex
computer based systems and related services.
Prepare for and Conduct Bidders Conference: The NPC has an interest in ensuring that each
potential bidder has a clear understanding of all aspects of the procurement process in regard to
both content and procedure. In addition, potential bidders are likely to submit questions,
especially technical ones, about the content of the bidding document. Consultant support for
these activities is required to support the PMU in preparing for and conducting a bidders
conference. This will include the analysis of bidders questions and the preparation of appropriate
answers. Answers will be formally given to potential bidders during a bidders conference in
Hanoi. In addition, the bidders conference should be used as an opportunity to provide vendors
with up to date information, if appropriate.
Stage 1 Support: The following consultant support is required: (a) support to the PMU / Bid
Evaluation Organization in their review of the Stage 1 technical proposals. This review will
consist of two components: (i) a preliminary assessment to identify those bids that satisfy the
mandatory pre-qualification requirements; and (ii) a sufficiently detailed evaluation of qualified
bids to identify those that are deemed to be substantially compliant with the specifications and
post qualification requirements for the first stage evaluation. The supervision and the preparation



83                                 Annex 7
of formal evaluation reports will include a statement of deficiencies relating to each qualified
bid. Careful attention should be paid to those bids that are deemed to befQnt substantially
compliant. In addition, assist in identifying the need for any modifications to the statements of
technical requirement specifications to bring all substantially compliant bids to a comparable
technical level. Modifications to the requirements will be documented in a Memorandum for
issue to qualified bidders during pre Stage 2 clarification meetings; and (b) prepare an
Addendum to technical specifications, if necessary, to provide all qualifying bidders with a list
of desired modifications and/or upgrades to the statement of technical requirements
specifications.
In undertaking this support, the consultants will be required to read and assess all vendor
responses. PMU / Bid Organization Structure personnel should also read and analyze all vendor
responses. The consultants should ensure that the resulting decisions are defensible and agreed
with appropriate Vietnamese personnel. A Stage I evaluation report should be prepared and
communicated to the Bank together with the Addendum to Technical Specifications.
Preparation for Stage 2 Bidding: Following receipt of the World Bank's "No Objection" letter,
the consultants should support the PMU in conducting clarification meetings with each
substantially responsive vendor. The objective of these meetings is twofold: (a) to assist that
vendor address technical deviations as outlined in the Memorandum; and (b) to explain the
content of the Stage 2 Addendum to ensure that all qualified bidders have an identical
understanding of the Stage 2 requirements. Following such meetings, assist the PMU in issuing
the Addendum and inviting Stage 2 bids.
Stage 2 Support: This stage requires the detailed analysis of the technical content of each
vendor response. In particular, it requires the assessment of vendor responses to each numbered
requirement and sub-requirement referenced in the bidding document and the allocation of an
appropriate weighted points score. The consultants will act in an advisory capacity to the
Vietnamese evaluation teams. In addition, they will undertake detailed evaluations of each Stage
2 bid and facilitate the development of a final ranking of bids through comparison of consultant
and Vietnamese team results. Consultant input will vary with the actual number of vendor
responses to be evaluated.
Following Stage 2 bid openings, the consultants will: support the PMU / Bid Evaluation
Organization in their review of the final technical and commercial proposals to ensure that the
reviews are conducted in accordance with the methodology specified in the bidding documents;
and supervise the preparation of draft evaluation reports, which will include a detailed statement
of deficiencies relating to each qualified bid, and a ranking of bidders on the basis of the
combined technical and price scores.
The consultants will be required to undertake detailed evaluations of each bid and facilitate a
consensus prior to the preparation of the draft evaluation report package.
12.          As an integral part of the previous step, assist the appropriate decision making
organization (NPC, etc.) to both understand the outcomes of the evaluation process and prepare
final versions of the evaluation reports for submission to the World Bank.
Contract Negotiation Support : Following receipt of the World bank's "No Objection" letter;
support the PMU and other appropriate participants in preparing for and conducting the formal



84                                  Annex 7
contract negotiations with the winning vendor(s). Care should be taken to identify and protect the
owner from scope, schedule and cost risks.
13.           The above activities will require some 34 staff weeks of consultant support. In
the interest of maintaining continuity of the technical approach, and in order to best assess the
responsiveness of the various bids, the design consultants responsible for producing the technical
specifications will be hired to provide the above support during the procurement phase. A draft
contract, together with the finalized terms of reference , will be sent to the Bank for review and
"no objection".
14.           The Resident Advisor will be an individual appointment. Here, the key factor
for success is not only the technical competence and experience of the individual, but, equally
importantly, his/her inter-personal skills and ability to assimilate and adapt to the situation as
exists in Viet Nam. Thus, a variety of sources will be tapped to obtain the names of suitable
individuals, including word of mouth and the professional network. Given the lack of experience
in this area on the part of the PMU, the Bank may be asked to assist in identifying suitable
individuals.

VIET NAM
PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Profiles of Participating Commercial Banks
A. Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank)
Introduction
I.           Background. The Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture (Agribank) is the dominant rural
credit institution in Viet Nam. It was separated from the Rural Credit Department of the SBV on
November 14, 1990, pursuant to Decree No. 400/CT by the Prime Minister. The Charter for Agribank
was enacted on November II, 1992.
2.           Business Activity. While Agribank has traditionally performed the role of a rural
financial institution, it currently provides a wide range of banking services. Agribank has the authority
to operate in the areas of fund mobilization, trust operations, lending, international banking, leasing,
precious metals and gem dealing, and a number of other areas, including participation in joint-ventures
with foreign financial institutions. Agribank lends to some 2,500 SOEs and 40 stock companies, as well
as to more than 10 million production households. Agribank is also the executing agent for trust services
for a variety of international bilateral aid organizations and NGOs. Agribank recently provided US$4
million from the ADB to develop the sugar industry, and another US$23 from the ADB to improve the
dairy sector. It is also expected to extend credit to poorer individuals and poorer provinces and to the
victims of natural disasters.
3.           Agribank plays a critical role as the provider of rural finance, given its extensive rural
branch banking system. It acts primarily as a direct lender, but also lends indirectly through cooperatives
and rural shareholding banks. Agribank is developing greater operational efficiency and outreach
through rationalizing its rural network and by engaging in innovative rural lending practices. Agribank
has begun to experiment with extending banking services to rural areas by establishing subdistrict
transactions offices and by forming mobile banking teams that make frequent village visits.
4.           Agribank has established specialized branches active in the silk and rubber industries. It
has also established four subsidiaries active in leasing, precious metals and gems, brokering, and
investment consulting. Agribank also owns a 50% stake in Vinasian Bank, a joint-stock bank it began
with the Siam Commercial Bank of Thailand. Agribank is actively exploring other investment
opportunities, a recent example being its discussions with Smith New Court to establish an investment
company.
5.           Agribank's loan portfolio is dominated by short-term loans, but Agribank has shifted its
lending focus away from SOEs and towards financing rural households and small businesses. This
reorientation is apparent from the growth in new loan volume to those private borrowers from about D
355 billion in outstanding loans at the end of 1991 to about D 4,630 billion. By comparison, loans to
SOEs barely increased, rising from D 2,219 billion in 1991 to D 2,409 billion in 1994.
6.           Rough estimates of the distribution of credit through Agribank indicate that new loan
funds were distributed broadly. Outstanding loans at the end of 1994 had the following breakdown:
agriculture 53%, forestry 16%, aquaculture 20%, and other sectors 11%.  Alternatively, the



88                                   Annex 10
categorization of loans by Agribank suggests that the proportion of production and farm input supply
loans was 25% in 1991 and 23% in 1992. Food marketing loans also reportedly declined from 31% in
1991 to 25% in 1992. Given recent changes in how Agribank reports loans by use, and the potential for
misinterpretation, no clear pattern of loan distribution can be discerned. There is some variation in the
interest rates for short-term rates, but there is no apparent variation in regards medium-term loans.
7.           Foreign Assistance. To enhance its operations and further its development, Agribank
has received support from the World Bank, International Development Agency, training and technical
assistance funded by the Swedish and French governments, as well as assistance from domestic and
foreign information and telecommunications institutions. It has recently received SDR 69.4 million as
part of the Agriculture Rehabilitation Credit from IDA, an US$80 million loan from ADB and DM 7
million for a project in the central provinces.
Institutional Aspects
8.            Branch Network. Agribank is headquartered in Hanoi and has an extensive nationwide
branch network. It has a southern representative office in Ho Chi Minh City and a central representative
office in Quy Nhon City, five regional branches, 53 provincial and city branches, and 416 district
branches. In addition, there are nearly 2,400 transaction offices at entities such as agencies, shops and
savings desks mobilizing funds for Agribank. Agribank is aiming to increase its branch network in rural
areas, where it sees significant opportunities to increase its funds mobilization capabilities. This
expansion strategy focuses on increasing Agribank's transaction office network, which serves Viet
Nam's 7,000 villages. Agribank would eventually like to have one transaction office in operation for
every one or two villages in the country.
9.            Strategy and Planning. With the assistance of outside donors, Agribank is in the process
of developing a comprehensive institutional development plan. This plan constitutes the heart of
Agribank's strategy to transform itself into a genuine commercial bank that is capable of satisfying the
banking needs of the agricultural and industrial sectors, fully competitive in the region, and integrated
into the international community. This plan will be fully implemented by the year 2000 and proposes
that Agribank: (i) perform an external audit; (ii) increase equity capital to US$300 million; (iii) delineate
precise job qualifications at headquarters and branch levels; (iv) prepare a comprehensive training
program based on an accurate staffing plan; (v) improve credit processes and procedures; and (vi)
develop a computerized management information system.  Regarding progress on the plan's
implementation, Agribank is currently undergoing an external audit, and it has retained outside expertise
in management information systems and human resources development.
10.          The Board of Management prepares an annual business plan, which is then approved by
the Board of Directors. This business plan covers a broad range of activities and specifies details on
extending credit, mobilizing funds, using funds, and estimating revenues, expenditures, and taxes. The
primary objective of the plan is to balance the projected sources and uses of funds. It also details plans
concerning human resources development, training and technology improvement.
11.          Organizational Structure. Agribank is governed by a Board of Directors, who are
appointed with the approval of the SBV. The Board chooses Agribank's senior management, including
the Director General, who must also be approved by the SBV. The Director General is the senior
executive officer of the bank. He has general oversight of all of Agribank's major divisions: the General
Inspection Department, the General Director's Office, Domestic and Overseas Representative Offices,
Business Strategy Section, Business Techniques Section, Financial Management Section, Logistics
Section, Non-banking Companies, Universal Banking Regional Branches, and Specialized Operations



89                                   Annex 10
Branches. The senior management of Agribank is represented by the Board of Management, which
compmses the General Director and six Deputy General Directors.
12.          Staffing and Training. As of June 30, 1994, Agribank had 20,728 employees, 330 of
whom worked at the headquarters office. Since 1994, Agribank has adopted a recruitment criteria
focusing on qualified college graduates knowledgeable in foreign languages and informatics. A recent
breakdown of staff educational levels is as follows: 17 post-graduates (<1%), 5,456 graduates (26%),
11,363 high school graduates (54%), and 2,729 vocational graduates (13%). In order to retain qualified
staff in an environment in which the MOF establishes a common base salary for SOCBs, Agribank has
introduced a performance based compensation system that allows top performers to qualify for bonuses
of up to three times their base salaries. Agribank also stresses job security in its efforts to compete with
the higher salaries paid by private sector financial institutions. It also gives grants to promising
university students with the intention that they will join Agribank upon graduation. Agribank is not
cuffeRtly expanding its staffing levels, and is hiring personnel only to replace retirees.
13.          During 1995, Agribank expects to have 6,000 attend training of some kind. Most of
these staff will receive training at one of Agribank's five training centers. This training will primarily
comprise project design, appraisal, and evaluation; international banking operations; informnation
technology; and foreign languages. In addition, 200 Agribank staff will receive external training, much
of it funded by the Bank and ADB.
Operations
14.          Credit Polic. Agribank has established policies for granting short-term loans, and is
currently preparing guidelines for medium- and long-tern loans, with the assistance of ADB. When
making a loan, Agribank analyzes both the technical and financial viability of the proposed activity.
While Agribank has the authority to lend up to 50% of borrower assets and 100% of expected income, in
practice, it limits short-term loans to 70% of the proposed investment and 50% of medium-term
investments due to credit rationing. Credit officers at the village level have the authority to make loans
of up to D 20 million, those at the provincial level can makes loans of up to D 20 billion, and those at the
provincial level have a limit of D 100 billion. Loans exceeding D 100 billion are reviewed by a credit
committee at the central level and require the approval of the General Director. However, these limits
are not always strictly adhered to. Smaller sized loans have a simplified approval process which is
decided by a joint liability group. Larger loans require collateralization and are subject to much greater
scrutiny zmd analysis. The credit officer is responsible for tracking a portfolio of loans and Agribank has
a number of remedial measures for dealing with poorly performing loans. As part of the external audit
which Agribank is currently undergoing, a thorough review is being conducted on its loan portfolio.
15.          The flow of credit remains subject to the vestiges of a planned credit allocation scheme,
as Agribank channels funds to particular agricultural subsectors and geographical areas. Based on the
annual availability of funds, Agribank's provincial directors determine the allocation of lending funds
across their banking districts. It is believed that the factors affecting such decisions include the existence
of designated economic enterprises zones, priority borrower populations such as ethnic minorities, and
district loan collection performance. Agribank onlends at rates derived from the reference rates set by
the SBV. In principle, Agribank has latitude to adjust rates based on variations in operating costs and
credit risks.
16.          Resource Mobilization. Agribank views its rural expansion program as an important
tool for resource mobilization as it hopes to attract individual savings. Interest rates paid by Agribank on
demand and savings deposits generally follow SBV guidelines. However, Agribank has become
increasingly dependent on project-linked "deposit substitutes" offering higher rates in a bid to attract



90                                     Annex 10
savings. These substitute funding arrangements take various forms, including bonds and promissory
notes. Agribank increased its dependence on deposit substitutes from 0.1% of total nonequity funds at
the end of 1991, to 4.7% at the end of 1992, and to 19% at end of September 1994, representing 41% of
total deposit substitutes of all the deposit-taking banks in Viet Nam. Agribank recently began marketing
bonds at 19.5% to mobilize small savers, which it views as a stable source of finance. Agribank is also
interested in raising capital in foreign markets.
17.           Auditing. For internal audit purposes, Agribank has a General Inspection Department
that operates on the district and provincial level. There are typically one supervisor at the district level
and six to seven at the provincial level. These personnel produce monthly and quarterly reports for bank
management. The internal auditing system is currently being converted to a computerized operation.
Regarding external auditing, Agribank is currently undergoing an extensive audit by an Australian
accounting firm. The final audit report is being finalized and should be available by June-July 1995. In
addition, SBV and MOF perform supervisory audits of Agribank activities.
Financial Structure and Performance
18.           Structure. For the period 1990 to 1994, the total assets of Agribank increased 306.9%, rising from
D 2,627.7 billion to D 10,691.8 billion, averaging an annual growth rate of 42.3%. During the same period, total
liabilities grew 291.4%, rising from D 2,522.5 billion to D 9,872.8 billion. By comparison, total equity grew much
faster, rising from D 105.4 billion to D 819.0 billion, or 677.1%. Despite this dramatic rise in equity, the proportion
of equity in Agribank's capital structure remains small; in 1994, the debt to equity ratio was 92:8.
19.           Lending by Agribank has increased rapidly, rising from D 1,551.8 billion in 1990 to D
7,023.2 billion in 1994, an increase of 352.6%. Deposit growth has been much slower, rising from D
1,104 billion in 1990 to D 2,485.2 billion in 1994, an increase of 125.1%. Consequently, the loans to
deposit ratio for Agribank rose from 140.6% in 1990 to 282.6% in 1994.
20.           Profitability. Agribank has returned to profitability after losing D 80.6 billion in 1991
and D 42.8 billion in 1992. Agribank reported net income of D 6.0 billion in 1993 and D 12.7 billion in
1994. Agribank generates almost all of its revenues from interest income, which accounted for nearly
99% of total revenue in 1994. Earnings have been pressured since total expenses have been increasing
faster than total income. Interest income increased by 1,070.6% from D 199.8 billion in 1990 to D
2,338.8 billion in 1994; by comparison, interest expenses increased by 1,748.8% from D 90.5 billion to
D 1,673.1 billion. However, while the ratio of interest expenses to interest income stood at 84.5% in
1991, it has been declining steadily, and was 71.5% in 1994. Non-interest expenses have also been
contributing to poor profitability. While salaries as a percentage of total assets had been declining for a
number of years, they rose in 1994, reaching 3.7% of average assets. In 1994, net income measured in
terms of average assets was just 0.1%, and it was likewise small when measured in terms of average
equity, at 1.9%. Agribank is subject to a 2% tax on financial margin, a 45% profit tax on net income,
and a 6% tax on capital use. As with other SOCBs, there are few incentives to maximize profit, since the
disposition of surplus is regulated by the state.

1995 (7%), 1996-98 (6%), 1999-00 (5%). Interest expenses include expected costs associated with the proposed IDA credit assessed as
follows: 1995 (D 0.007 bil), 1996, (D 1.452 bil) 1997 (D 3.877 bil), 1998 (D 6.375 bil), 1999 (D 7.328 bil) and 2000 (D 7.289 bil), and so
represent a relatively small portion of total interest expenses. These numbers were converted to from Dong to USS based on an exchange rate
of D 11,200 = USSI.

B. Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV)
Introduction
21.          Background. The Bank for Investment and Development of Viet Nam (BIDV) currently
operates as an SOCB. From the period 1957 to 1987, it functioned under the Ministry of Finance as the
Bank for Reconstruction and allocated funds from the state budget to promote the assembly and
construction sectors. From 1987 to 1990, it was known as the Bank for Investment and Construction of
Viet Nam and was administered by the SBV. During this period, it allocated funds from the state budget,
provided working capital to the assembly and construction sectors, and provided preferential loans for
investment and development. It has been known by its current name ever since November 1990.
22.           Business Actiyity. BIDV is the sole bank in Viet Nam specializing investment and
development. It also conducts a number of other banking activities, including offering term credit to
enterprises for development, granting working capital loans to assembly enterprises, providing domestic
and international settlement, acting as an agent for trust lending, and mobilizing long-tern funds from
both domestic and international sources. Since the beginning of 1995, BIDV has begun a number of new
activities, including mobilizing short-term funds and offering loans to economic sectors of the economy,
as well as a host of other commercial banking activities. Until December 1994, BIDV had also allocated
funds from the state budget for development purposes, but this activity has been turned over to the MOF.
23.          BIDV plays an important developmental role in the Vietnamese economy. It is a
significant source of term financing, and 70% of its loans are medium- and long-term. These loans are
mainly used to finance construction and materials supply. BIDV has recently begun to offer export
finance credit, which grew from nothing in 1993 to US$150 million in 1994. It views this activity as
vital to the country's development, given the need to import high-value capital goods. It has also
handled bilateral funding from France, Gernany and Japan. BIDV currently has 525,000 customers and
654,000 accounts.
24.          BIDV is actively pursuing investment opportunities. It has a 50% stake in VID Public
Bank which it set up with a Malaysian bank. It also has a 10% share in housing banks in Hanoi and Ho
Chi Minh City. BIDV is also currently seeking approval from the GOV to establish two joint-venture
leasing companies, one with a Japanese partner and the other with a Korean partner. BIDV would have a
50% share in these enterprises and would have to put up US$5 million in capital for each one. BIDV
also recently received approval to establish a leasing company and an investment company for building
houses. As the privatization process proceeds in Viet Nam, BIDV has expressed its interest in
purchasing the shares of newly privatized companies. It would also like to begin investment banking
operations once a stock market is in full operation.
Institutional Aspects
25.          Branch Network. BIDV has a nationwide branch network and an active presence in all
of the country's provinces. It has a headquarters and transaction office in Hanoi and a representative
office in Ho Chi Minh City, where it is also planning to open another transaction office. In addition,
BIDV has 54 provincial branches, and five transaction offices and 40 sub-branches at the district level.
There are 18 departments at headquarters. The five largest branches have eight to ten departments each,
while the smaller ones have four. BIDV is currently upgrading the services in its sub-branches and
transaction offices so that they can offer more banking services. It sees the primary function of its
branch network as funds mobilization.  BIDV has established over 100 correspondent banking
relationships.

26.           Strategy and Planning. BIDV's primary strategic objective is to diversify its activities,
particularly with regard to capital sources. Previously, BIDV was limited to providing funds for SOEs,
but its client base and product range have grown substantially. BIDV produces an annual plan with
detailed targets covering a range of areas, including funds mobilization, loans outstanding, profit, and
wages. When devising these targets and objectives, planners carefully examine BIDV's financial
operations, capital structure, and recent performance.
27.           Organizational Structure. The highest body at BIDV is the Board of Govemors. The
Board of Govemors chooses the Board of Management, which comprises the bank's senior managers.
There are many functional departments in the bank, including intemational banking, intemational
settlement, risk information and prevention, appraisal-consultancy, guarantee-services, credit,
communication-propaganda, capital and resources-marketing, financing and accounting, informatics,
personnel, wages and emulation, human resources development, legislative, and administration.
28.           Staffing and Training. BIDV currently has 3,135 staff and will increase to 3,200 in
1995. BIDV has indicated that it faces serious shortfalls of experienced people, and has asked many of
its directors to stay on since many are due to retire this year. BIDV recruits new staff who are college
graduates, proficient in English, and computer literate. At the end of 1994, the educational breakdown of
BIDV's work force was as follows: post graduate (<1%), university graduate (45%), secondary
education (36%), and elementary education (10%).
29.           About 90% of staff at BIDV work with computers, but their technical expertise and job
requirements vary considerably. Consequently, BIDV has designed its computer training program along
the following lines: (i) intensive training for experienced users; (ii) training to allow application users to
better understand applications programming; and (iii) specialized training in database management and
systems analysis. This program would be accomplished by administering spot training; by attendance at
one of the three training centers located in the northem, central, and southem regions of the country; or

30.          Credit. BIDV offers short-, medium-, and long-term credit, and so is flexible in meeting
the banking needs of a particular project or borrower. When determining credit allocation, BIDV
considers the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the amount of time it will take to receive this
repayment. Priority is acorded those projects which expand existing production and which promote
exports. BIDV has a number of policies to protect against credit risk. BIDV requires collateral from
non-SOEs up to 60% of the value of the credit. For SOEs, BIDV looks closely at the capital structure of
the SOE and at the contract between the SOE and its counterparty. For long-term loans to SOEs, BIDV
requires the borrower to pledge the property to be financed and, in some cases, may require a guarantee
from the line ministry. For traditional borrowers, BIDV does not require deposits, but deposits may be
required from  new customers if conditions warrant.  Credit authority rests with different levels
depending on the size and term of the loan. Branch directors may approve short-term loans of up to D 5
billion per borrower; however, the head office must approve larger short-term loans, and for all medium-
and long-term loans. BIDV has a single borrower limit equivalent to 10% of legal capital.
31.           BIDV reports that is having little trouble with the quality of its loan portfolio and further
report that, for some years, it did not register any overdue payments. It attributes this success to a
number of factors: lending has concentrated on financing equipment rather than on trading, which is less
risky policy since physical goods can be used as collateral and auctioned off; good relationships with its
borrowers, which helps in the determination of credit worthiness; a deep understanding of the customer,
which aids in appraisal; a centralized approval system, which ensures consistency; and a comprehensive

monitoring process, which covers the entire length of the repayments period. BIDV believes that its
monitoring capabilities would be further enhanced with the implementation of a centralized payments
system, which the proposed Bank project would support. BIDV assumed US$3.5 million in bad loans
upon the dismantling of the monobank system. These loans have been frozen and are no longer
classified as loans on the balance sheet. They are accounted for in the "Other Assets" line item with an
offsetting entry in "Borrowings from SBV".
32.          Audifing. BIDV's Annual Report is audited by he SBV. In 1994, BIDV hired a
Vietnamese accounting firm, VACO, to audit its branches in Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Dinh. BIDV
recognizes the need to undergo an external audit but, like the other SOCBs, it does not believe that local
auditing capabilities have sufficiently developed to perform such an exercise. In recognition of this fact,
BIDV has approached the World Bank about identifying the resources to allow an international
accounting firm to perform a comprehensive audit of BIDV's finances and operations.
Financial Structure and Performance
33.          Structure. BIDV's total assets increased from D 1,929.0 billion in 1991 to D 8,662.1
billion in 1994, representing a 349.0% increase. Total liabilities grew much faster during the same
period, rising from D 739.6 billion to D 5,247.6 billion, a 609.5% increase. On the other hand, total
equity increased by only 187.1%, going from D 1,189.4 billion to D 3,414.5 billion. Between 1993 and
1994, total assets rose by 63.7%, total liabilities by 150.0%, and total equity by 7.1%. Given the rapid
growth in liabilities, BIDV's capital structure has changed radically and the ratio of debt to equity rose
from 38:62 in 1991 to 61:39 in 1994.
34.          Total loans increased from D 1,433.8 billion in 1991 to D 5,298.5 billion in 1994,
representing an increase of 269.5% By contrast, total deposits are much smaller than total loans, but
have been going at a faster rate. In 1991, total deposits amounted to D 291.7 billion, and rose to D
1,230.0 in 1994, a 321.6% increase. Consequently, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994 was 430.8%.
Between 1993 and 1994, total loans grew by 42.2% and total deposits grew by 22.4%.
35.          Profitability. BIDV has consistently reported profits. From 1991 to 1994, net income
increased 146.7%, rising from D 26.9 billion to D 66.3 billion, an annual average rate of 41.0%. From
1993 to 1994, net income increased by 9.8%. BIDV earns most of its revenues from interest income,
which accounted for 93.3% of total revenues in 1994. During the period 1991 to 1994, interest income
rose from D 216.4 billion to D 478.4 billion, and interest expenses from D 138.7 billion to D 223.9
billion. Lending expenses accounted for two-thirds of all interest expenses in 1994, with borrowing
expenses making up the balance. The ratio of interest expenses to interest income decreased from 64. 1%
in 1991 to 46.8% in 1994. Despite these positive developments, other profitability measures have been
eroding, largely reflecting growth of non-interest expenses. The ratio of net income to average total
assets was 2.2% in 1992, 1.4% in 1993 and 0.9% in 1994. At the same time, net income to average total
equity decreased from 3.3% in 1992, to 2.3% in 1993, and to 2.0% in 1994. BIDV is subject to a profit
tax of 45%, a turnover tax of 15% assessed on interest rate spread, and a capital use tax of 6% assessed
on capital provided by the GOV.

C. Viet Nam Export Import Bank (Eximbank)
Introduction
36.          Background. The Viet Nam Export Import Bank (Eximbank) is one of the first joint
stock banks established in the country after the 1988 banking sector reforms. Decision No. 140/CT of
the Chairman of the Council of Ministers dated May 24, 1989 authorizes the establishment of Eximbank
with the stated purpose of promoting export development programs and investment for export oriented
production and processing. Article I of the Decision establishes the bank as a "limited joint stock bank,
with its own legal status, autonomous accounting and self-determination in monetary and credit business
and banking services...". Article 2 of the same Decision states that Eximbank is "organized and managed
in accordance with the Charter adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders' Delegates and ratified
by the Director General of the State Bank of Vietnam." Eximbank's Charter was adopted on November
15, 1989, and ratified on January 17, 1990. Eximbank thus formally began operations as of that date.
37.          Eximbank has 125,000 outstanding shares. Its shareholding structure is as follows: 68%
shares held by 191 state-owned enterprises; 24% shares held by 18 private economic organizations; and
8% shares held by 1,348 individual shareholders. The largest shareholders are the Saigon Jewelery
Company, an SOE owned by the local People's Committee (12.2%), Generalimex, a general trading
company in Hanoi owned by the Ministry of Trade (11.0%), Generalexim, a general trading company in
Ho Chi Minh City owned by the Ministry of Trade (11.0%), Asian Commercial Bank, a joint-stock bank
in Ho Chi Minh City (8.0%), and Saigon Tourist Company, also in Ho Chi Minh City (1.6%).
Authorized legal capital at founding was D 100 billion, which was subsequently increased to D 125
billion by Decision No. 198/QD-NH5 issued by the Governor of the SBV on October 10, 1993. Paid-up
capital as of December31, 1994 was D 125 billion.
38.          Business Activty. Eximbank focuses on providing banking services for exporting and
importing activities. Similar activities are carried out at headquarters and in the three branches. The
bulk of the bank's business is short-term lending. However, Eximbank recent extended a five-year loan
for the construction of a new hotel. Eximbank is also involved in foreign exchange trading and export-
import settlements. Eximbank's client base is primarily trading companies. It has not targeted industrial
borrowers since its capital base is relatively small. Eximbank maintains extensive correspondent
banking relationships with 424 foreign bank branches in close to 50 countries. Eximbank has not
established any subsidiaries and is not active in any joint-ventures. Eximbank counts amongst its
competitive advantages its good knowledge of the SBV and local Vietnamese banks, as well as of the
country's development strategy and potential.
39.          The total value of export reimbursement through Eximbank was US$301 million in
1993, or 10% of the total turnover of national exports. The total value of settlements for imports was
US$339 million in 1993, also accounting for 10% of the total turnover of national import settlement. The
total value of usance L/Cs opened in 1994 was US$300 million.
Institutional Aspects
40.          Branch Network. Eximbank is headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, and has three
branches: one in Hanoi, inaugurated on November 27, 1992; one in Danang, opened on January 28,
1994; and the third which recently opened in 1995 in Can Tho. Eximbank's initial strategy was to
establish a present in major commercial centers involved in foreign trade. Eximbank now expects strong
banking demand in rural areas, and so is exploring a strategy aimed at expanding its branch network in
rural areas in the northern and southern regions of the country where it expects significant growth.



101                                 Annex 10
41.          Strategy and Planning.  Eximbank's major business objective is to support export
development through: (a) financing trade; (b) financing export-oriented production, sub-contracting and
manufacturing; and (c) taking equity participations in export-oriented ventures. Operational objectives
are to: (a) mobilize funds in Vietnamese dong and foreign currencies through direct borrowings and
deposit mobilization; (b) undertake foreign currency operations through trading and transfers from
overseas Vietnamese; (c) provide international payment services; (d) provide bank guarantees to local
enterprises for local and foreign borrowing; (e) grant dong and foreign currency loans for export-oriented
activities; and (f) provide other services related to cash operations, gold imports and consulting advice.
42.          Management prepares a five year plan which is discussed at the general shareholders'
meeting. It provides direction and does not contain many quantitative objectives. The current five year
plan aims to: (a) pursue a policy of rural expansion; (b) diversify operations by offering with new
activities and products; (c) increase capital to D 500 billion by 1999; (d) increase sources of funds to D
7,000 billion by 1999; (e) expand the ATM network; and (f) introduce new credit card and Smartcard
instruments.
43.          The aims laid out in the five year plan as well as careful analysis of data provided by
each branch, provide the basis for the preparation of Eximbank's annual business plan. This plan sets out
very specific financial, operational and institutional targets source of funds, use of funds, export-import
financing, asset management, criteria for treasury management, organizational development, business
efficiency, technology development, human resource development.
44.          Resource Mobilization. Eximbank intends to increase its deposit mobilization efforts to
meet the increasing needs for loan funds. In addition to offering different deposit products, increasing
customer confidence in the bank is key to achieving this objective. Eximbank is therefore desirous of
improving its payment services. Eximbank recently received SFR 24 million as part of a SFR 40 million
loan by the Swiss govemment to finance exports of Swiss goods into Viet Nam. Eximbank borrowed the
funds at 1% and can on-lend at a rate of 5% to 6%. In order to expand its activities, Eximbank has asked
for approval from the SBV to double its capital from the present D125 billion to D250 billion, of which
30% would be reserved for foreign participants.
45.          Organization Structure. Eximbank's chief executive body is the General Meeting of
Shareholders' Delegates, whose members are chosen on the basis of each 250 shares of stock. Under this
body is a Board of Directors, whose members are elected by the General Meeting every four years and
who serve a four year terms. The Managing Director General is chosen by the Board of Directors for an
open ended term, but may be removed six months after his appointment at the discretion of the Board.
The selection of the Managing Director General and the members of the Board of Directors is subject to
the approval of the SBV. The Board consists of a Chairman, who is the Director General of the Saigon
Jewelry Company; two Deputy Chairmen, one from Generalexim; one from Generalimex; and eight
members drawn from various state enterprises and the People's Committee of Quang Nam in Danang
Province. Eximbank's two Comptrollers, drawn from Saigon Finance Company and Tenimex report
directly to the General Meeting of Shareholder's Delegates.
46.          The Deputy Director General oversees functional departments at headquarters and the
bank's two branches. Activities at headquarters are organized in seven departments: Intemational
Relations; Intemational Settlements; Credit and Investment; Cash; Planning and Foreign Exchange;
General Accounts; and Administration. Both branches have five divisions each: Intemational Relations
and Settlements; Credit and Investment; Cash; Accounting; and Administration.
47.          Staffing and Training. Eximbank is growing rapidly and currently employs 250 staff,
compared to 215 in 1994 and 145 in 1993. Hiring levels depend on workload activity. Eximbank
recruits college graduates from colleges specializing in economics, banking and foreign languages.
Recruits undergo a foreign language examination and have a three to six month probation period at the



102                                    Annex 10
bank. Bank management reports that it has difficulties retaining qualified staff due to the relatively low
pay structure imposed by the MOF. Eximbank has attempted to supplement basic salaries with bonuses
tied to bank profitability and individual performnance, but the compensation package is still below what
foreign banks can afford to pay. As an example, the average compensation for a new employee at
Eximbank is D 850,000 per month, while the average package for a new employee at a foreign bank is D
3,000,000 per month.
48.           Eximbank wishes to create a well-trained cadre of professional staff. Most of the staff
are recent college graduates. However, the amount of external training is restricted by resource
constraints. Training is also achieved through rotational assignments in the bank's branches. Many staff
also attend classes in foreign languages after regular work hours. Bank managers complain that many
staff leave the bank once it has committed considerable resources training them, and Eximbank now
requires compensation for training by the those employees leaving the bank to work elsewhere.
Eximbank has a five-year staff development and training plan in order to bring the skills of its staff to
international standards.  Eximbank has availed itself of the training programs offered by various
bilateral, multilateral and private agencies in Viet Nam, including the Bank-executed, SIDA-financed
Banking Sector Training Project. Some staff have been sent abroad for month-long training courses in
foreign banks. Eximbank's correspondent banks send specialists to provide training on specific topics to
Eximbank staff.
Operations
49.           Credit.  Eximbank has standard written credit policies and procedures which are
available to all credit officers.  Eximbank thoroughly appraises the loan and examines the credit
worthiness of potential borrowers. It requires collateral, but admits this requirement is somewhat
problematical when dealing with SOEs. The Hanoi branch has the authority to approve loans under
US$5 million, and the Da Nang branch has a lower threshold.
50.           Turnover of "investment" loans and other advances was D3,784 billion in 1993. Annual
lending tumover for the first II months in 1994 is reported as D828 billion in local currency and US$143
million in foreign currency. The bulk of this (84%) was in foreign currency. Prescribed lending rates in
dong are considerably higher than those in dollars, and since the dong/dollar exchange rate has been
reasonably stable over the past 2-3 years, companies prefer to borrow in dollars.
51.           Eximbank extends considerable effort to ensure the quality of its loan portfolio. At the
appraisal stage it conducts a vigorous analysis of the loan and the credit worthiness of the borrower. It
typically requires collateral. In the case of letters of credit, Eximbank has them drawn up in the name of
the bank. Loan payments are then constantly monitored and remedial actions are enacted as soon as
problems arise. As a result, problem loans constitute a relatively low 3% of Eximbank's portfolio.
52.           Resource Mobilization. Eximbank mobilizes resources both domestically and from
abroad. Domestic resources include customer deposits in both dong and foreign currency. Total turnover
of deposits in 1993 was D6,896 billion in local currency and US$2,090 million in foreign currency,
almost all demand deposits. Eximbank's savings deposit turnover in the same year was D130 billion in
local currency and US$4.3 million in foreign currency. The Government-prescribed term deposit rates
are lower than the rates obtained on Treasury bonds, as a result of which Eximbank's deposit base
contracted in 1993. Eximbank maintained over 7,000 accounts in 1993 (4,026 in foreign currencies and
3,009 in local currency), of which 1,673 accounts were held by non-residents.
53.           Total turnover of Eximbank's borrowings were D345 billion in 1993, of which US$22
million in foreign currency. These were all short-term  loans with terms ranging from  1-3 months,
obtained from domestic and foreign banks as well as the SBV. Eximbank has recently signed some



103                                  Annex 10
framework agrzaents with German banks on long-term credit facilities for financing up to 85% of the
contract value of Vietnamese imports from Gerrnany.
54.           Eximbank is currently seeking approval from the SBV to double its shares outstanding
from 125,000 to 250,000. As the price of one share is currently D 1,000,000, this increase would
substantially raise Eximbank's available capital. Its shareholders have already registered for this
increase so the issue is fully subscribed. Further equity issues will set aside 30% of shares for foreign
investors.
55.          Auditing Policies. Eximbank has a Comptroller appointed by the Board of Directors that
is responsible for ensuring compliance with the bank's internal control procedures. The Comptroller and
his staff review branch activities each month and will make inspections as warranted. Eximbank does
not currently have external audits conducted. The SBV conducts off-site inspections of Eximbank on a
regular basis. In addition, Eximbank's financial statements are certified by the SBV.
Financial Structure and Performance
56.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Eximbank grew 139.1%, rising
from D 773.9 billion to D 1,850.3 billion. During the same period, total liabilities grew 149.5%, rising
from D 679.5 billion to D 1,695.1 billion. Total equity grew at a slower pace, rising from D 94.4 billion
in 1991 to D 155.3 billion in 1995, an increase of 64.5%. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets rose by
77.5%, total liabilities by 88.9%, and total equity by 6.9%. As a result, the ratio of debt to equity
increased from 88:12 in 1991 to 92:8 in 1994.
57.           The loan portfolio of Eximbank has undergone significant growth, increasing from D
291.1 billion in 1991 to D 943.5 billion in 1994, a rise of 224.1%. Deposits have grown at less than half
this rate, increasing from D 552.1 billion in 1991 to D 1,093.3 billion in 1994, a rise of 98.0%. During
this period, the loans to deposits ratio has varied considerably, rising from a low of 52.7% in 1991, to a
high of 132.6% in 1993, and stood at 86.3% in 1994.
58.          Profitability. Eximbank has consistently reported after tax profits. Net income has
grown steadily, from D 0.9 billion in 1991, to D 5.8 billion in 1992, to D 11.5 billion in 1993, and to D
19.8 billion in 1994. While non-interest income has increased in each of the last four years, interest
income actually fell in 1993, but stood at a high of D 47.2 billion in 1994. Eximbank increased financial
margin in each succeeding year during the period 1991 to 1994. Beginning with a negative margin of D
6.3 billion in 1991, it achieved a margin of D 16.2 billion in 1994. Eximbank stands out among the
SOCBs since non-interest income makes up nearly one-half of its total income revenues; moreover, non-
interest income has been increasing faster than non-interest expenses over the period 1991 to 1994,
further aiding bank profitability. The ratio of net income to average total assets rose from 0.6% in 1992,
to 1.1% in 1993, and 1.4% in 1994. In addition, the ratio of net income to total equity increased from
4.8% in 1992, to 7.9% in 1993, and to 13.2% in 1994.
59.          Eximbank is subject to a turnover tax assessed on the spread between income and
expenses and ranging from 6% to 25%, depending on the particular lending activity. In addition, it pays
a profit tax of 45% on net income. Over Eximbank's five-year existence, it has paid a total of D 48
billion in taxes to the Government. The ratios of dividends to share face value have been:
Yea           Dividend Ratio
1990         62.5%
1991         47.2%
1993         34.8%
1994         43.5%
1995         24.0%

D. Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam (Incombank)
Introduction
60.          Background.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of Viet Nam  (Incombank) began
operations as an SOCB in 1988. It was created from the industry departments within the SBV.
61.          Business Activity. Incombank has traditionally been involved in providing credit to
industry and commerce. However, it is active in all fields of banking, particularly handling monetary,
credit and banking services for all types of economic entities, especially for the industrial, transportation,
post, trading and service sectors. These activities include receiving deposits; issuing time-bonds;
receiving funds from foreign and domestic banks; providing short- and medium-term financing in
domestic and foreign currencies for domestic economic organizations and individuals; foreign exchange
transactions; intemational banking; precious metals and gem trading; handling foreign and domestic
payment transactions; issuing bank guarantees; mortgages; leasing; real estate; participating in joint-
ventures and partnerships; and providing consulting and other services on banking and investment
activities. Incombank intends to maintain industrial and commercial lending as its core activities.
However, it is looking to expand its activities in precious metals and gem trading, and to engage in
securities trading when the market develops sufficiently.  Incombank has 50,000 customers and
maintains 60,000 accounts. Incombank has correspondent relationships with 385 foreign banks based in
40 countries.
62.          Incombank is actively pursuing joint-ventures with both domestic and foreign partners.
It is currently involved in 10 joint-ventures, owning between 10% to 50% of the shares outstanding.
Incombank also owns 10% of Saigon Income Bank, a joint-stock bank in Ho Chi Minh City. In addition,
it owns 50% of a joint-venture Indovina between Viet Nam and Indonesia.
63.          For 1994, the sectoral breakdown of Incombank's loan portfolio was as follows:
commerce (27.0%), industry (26.8%), other (20.9%), agriculture (14.9%), construction (6.4%),
transportation (3.9%), and forestry (0.9%). The term structure of Incombank's current loans outstanding
is predominantly short-term. Medium- and long-term loans outstanding presently account for 15% of the
loan portfolio; however, Incombank plans to boost this share to 25% in 1995. This reallocation is
disadvantageous to Incombank given the inverted structure of interest rates, but is necessary to comply
with SBV dictates. In addition, the SBV requires Incombank to make concessional loans to students and
veterans.
64.          Foreign Assistance.  Incombank has begun to access foreign capital.  In 1993, it
implemented the German-Vietnamese lending program for DEM 7 million, the Taiwanese program for
US$2.3 million and the EC program for the amount of US$8 million. Although the amount of funds
borrowed were small, they enabled Incombank to strengthen its relations with international financial
institutions, paving the way for the development of future foreign banking relationships.
Institutional Aspects
65.          Branch Network. Incombank is headquartered in Hanoi. It has an extensive network of
92 branches operating in all the important industrial and commercial centers in Viet Nam. In addition,
Incombank maintains 150 transaction offices and 300 savings offices. The headquarters manages and
operates the entire branch system and serves as the point of contact in international transactions. Branch
offices offer a full range of banking services and are staffed by 150 employees while transaction offices
provide a more limited range of services and typically employ from 10 to 15 staff. Savings offices are



108                                    Annex 10
smaller still and seek to mobilize funds on the village and precinct level. Incombank is currently
implementing a strategy to upgrade its network of transaction offices into full-fledged branches. Its
market research has discovered that customers prefer to bank at branches rather than transaction offices,
and so it is using this expansion strategy to expand its customer base and to increase funds mobilization.
Incombank plans to transform one-third of its transaction offices into branches by 1997 and the
remainder by the year 2000. This effort will entail significant staff increases.
66.           Strategy and Planning. Incombank is in the process of preparing a comprehensive
institutional strategy governing its overall operations until the year 2000.  The philosophical
underpinning of this strategy is to enhance the economic prosperity of the economy. The major
objectives of this new strategy will be to: (i) increase assets; (ii) increase asset quality; (iii) enhance
credit risk management; (iv) increase domestic funds mobilization; (v) promote staff training; (vi)
modernize bank facilities; and (vii) increase international banking operations.
67.           The General Director leads a team  that includes representatives from  several key
departments in drafting an annual business plan. This plan details specific operational, institutional and
financial targets and is subjected to internal review before being presented to the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors holds substantive discussions of this plan in its Bi-annual Review Meeting and its
Annual Review Meeting before approving it.
68.           Organizational Structure. A Board of Directors presides over Incombank and acts as an
advisor to the Board of Management. The Board of Directors exercises advisory and decision making
power and coordinates both Incombank's internal and external relations. The chief executive officer of
Incombank is the General Manager, who is appointed by the Prime Minister upon the recommendation of
the Governor of the SBV. The General Manager also chairs the Board of Directors, which further
includes the First Deputy Director, two representatives from the branches, a representative from the
SBV, and one from another government agency. The Board of Management includes the General
Director and five Deputy General Directors.
69.           Staffing and Training. Staff levels at Incombank have remained fairly steady. They
stood at 11,009 in 1991, 10,656 in 1992, 10,495 in 1993, and 10,620 in 1994. Incombank is upgrading
its staff resources by recruiting more qualified personnel. New recruits must now pass an examination
administered by Incombank and must also possess a foreign language capability (preferably English).
Regarding education credentials, Incombank will target graduates from the economics university, other
graduates specializing in banking, and graduates from the banking colleges. In an effort to retain
qualified staff, Incombank offers salary increases related to performance to supplement base pay levels.
It is also pressing the GOV to raise the base salary scale, which governs the pay levels at all the SOCBs,
in order to remain competitive with the private banks which are not restricted by these government-
mandated restricted.
70.           Incombank has trained 3,352 staff, overwhelmingly in domestic programs. Of this total,
1,093 received operational training, 86 received computer training, 1,303 received English training, and
80 received legal training. Incombank has indicated that it will concentrate its training efforts on English
training and operational knowledge. Incombank is also enhancing its training programs. It has set up
two new training centers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. These will focus on providing technical and
professional training of a short-term nature, for both high and low level staff. Incombank is currently in
the process of retraining its staff in view of the migration of the banking sector away from central
planning into a more market oriented environment. Professional and technical training will be tailored to
individual needs and will be supplemented with annual refresher courses. Training in new services will
be provided as warranted. Staff managing the computer networks at the branch level will receive
specialized training, and technical staff at the central level will attend short-term technical refresher



109                                  Annex 10
courses. Overseas training and refresher courses will also be provided to management personnel.
Managers needing training in the provision of new services will be eligible for overseas training of one
year and upwards. Incombank has sent 30 staff for overseas training.
Operations
71.           Credit. Incombank has developed manuals for bank officers covering areas such as
guarantees, short-term loans, medium- and long-term loans, and funds mobilization. These are amended
annually to keep them current with changing business environments. Branch managers at major
branches have the authority to make loans up to D 30 billion for individual clients, while the limit at
smaller branches is D 15 billion. Credits of less than D 10 billion are then monitored by the individual
branches, while those exceeding D 10 billion are monitored by headquarters. Incombank reduces its risk
exposure by lending in proportion to the value of collateral secured. Each branch is allocated a certain
amount of funds each year based upon the quality of the branch loan portfolio, the ratio of overdue debt,
and the capabilities of the branch in an effort to further mitigate risk. Incombank is obliged to make
loans at concessional rates to students and veterans.
72.           With the dismantling of the monobank system, Incombank inherited bad debts of D 500
billion of the SOEs. These frozen debts are no longer accounted for as loans and are handled on the
balance sheet on the asset side as D 500 billion under "Other Assets" and D 500 billion under "Due from
SBV", with a corresponding D 1,000 billion under "Borrowings". In order to address problem loans, the
SBV allows that Incombank set aside 10% of its net income. Incombank reports that its loan portfolio is
in relatively good shape, and that only 0.15% of total loans outstanding are problem loans.
73.           Audit Policy. Incombank currently conducts only internal audits. The auditing function
is performed by the Accounting and Finance Department and by the chief accountant. It establishes
accounting procedures and produces monthly, quarter and yearly reports to the Board of Management.
In addition, the SBV and MOF jointly supervise Incombank's accounts and activities. However,
Incombank will undergo an external audit of its accounts in 1995, financed by Swedish bilateral
assistance under a program supported by the Structural Adjustment Credit. Loans below D 10 billion are
monitored at the branch level., while larger loans are monitored by headquarters.
Financial Structure and Performance
74.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Incombank roughly doubled,
rising from D 5,080.4 to D 10,178.8. During the same period, total liabilities increased at a slightly
slower rate, rising from D 5,017.4 billion to D 9,537.1 billion. By contrast, total equity increased by only
46.8%, growing from D 325.2 billion to 477.5 billion. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets increased by
28.2%, and total liabilities by 31.2%, while total equity decreased by 13.8%. Incombank has a small
capital base; the debt to equity ratio was 94:6 in 1991 and 96:4 in 1994.
75.          Incombank's total loans outstanding rose 121.7% between 1991 and 1994, growing from
D 3,013.2 billion to D 6,681.0. Deposits grew even faster, rising from 2,680.5 billion in 1991 to D
7,563.5 billion in 1994, an increase of 182.2%. Recent growth in time deposit accounts form most of the
rise in deposits. As a result, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994 stood at 88.3%. Between 1993 and
1994, loans increased by 8.6% and deposits by 73.6%.
76.          Profitability. Incombank has been steadily increasing its profitability. Net income rose
from D 40.0 billion in 1991, to D 45.3 billion in 1992, D 80.5 billion in 1993, and to D 106.0 billion in
1994. These increases represent annual average increases of 40.8%. Between 1991 and 1994, interest
income grew from D 417.0 billion to D 1,858.0 billion, or an increase of 345.5%. During the same



110                                         Annex 10
period, interest expenses rose from D 298.6 billion to D 1,270.4 billion, or an increase of 325.4%. As a
result, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income declined slightly from 71.6% to 68.4%; however,
this ratio was as low as 59.6% in 1993. In 1994, interest income represented 97.5% of total revenues.
Also in that year, interest from loans accounted for over three-quarters of interest income, with interest
from deposits making up most of the rest. Non-interest expenses have been rising rapidly, but have not
eroded earnings. Salary expenses have been rising, growing from 0.6% of average total assets in 1991 to
1.7%  in 1994. However, net income to average total assets increased from  0.8%  in 1992, to 1.1%  in
1993, and remained steady at 1.1% in 1994. By contrast, net income to average equity increased from
10.7% in 1992, to 15.0% in 1993, and to 20.6% in 1994. Incombank is subject to a 6% capital use
charge levied on capital allocated by the GOV, a 15% turnover tax on financial margin, and a 45% profit
tax on net income.

E. Viet Nam Maritime Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank)
Introduction
77.          Background. The Viet Nam Maritime Commercial Stock Bank (Maritimebank) is a
joint-stock bank and was licensed to operate by Working Permit No. 0001/NH-GP, granted on June 8,
1991, by the Governor of the SBV, soon after the legislation on financial institutions and banking came
into effect. One July 12, 1991, the headquarters of Maritimebank opened in Haiphong. Besides being
the first joint-stock bank to receive a permit to begin operations, Maritimebank was also the first one to
publish its balance sheet in the newspapers.
73.          Maritimebank currently has 52 shareholders, comprising  both institutions and
individuals. Most shareholding institutions are active in the maritime and telecommunications sectors.
At the end of 1994, the largest shareholders were the Viet Nam Directorate General of Post and
Telecommunications (10.7% of total shares outstanding), Viet Nam Shipping Company (9.2%), Civil
Administration of Viet Nam (8.4%), Viet Nam Ocean Shipping Company (7.4%), and Viet Nam
National Maritime Bureau (7.0%).
79.          Business Actiyity. Maritimebank offers banking and financial services to serve the
business needs of its shareholders, and to contribute to the development of the economic sectors in which
they are active. Modeled as a bank of economic groups, Maritimebank closely links its activities with
the business of major economic enterprises which are, on the one hand, its shareholders and, on the other
hand, its customers. It has been active in an ADB-funded project to upgrade the county's ports and has
expressed interest in participating in a Bank-funded project to upgrade Highway 5.
80.          Maritimebank's principal financial products are letters of credits and lending. However,
it also handles domestic and foreign transactions by means of documentary credit, collection, and
remittances; participates in foreign exchange trading; mobilizes domestic and foreign currency reserves;
collects investment funds; handles remittances from overseas Vietnamese; and trades gold and other
precious metals and gems. Maritimebank has expressed an interest in moving into areas such as leasing,
credit cards and government securities.
81.          Maritimebank has a small investment portfolio. In partnership with the Ministry of
Trade, it has invested D 2.0 billion in Vicocimex, an export/import company in Ho Chi Minh City. It has
invested another D 2.0 billion in an insurance company, also in Ho Chi Minh City, and is also involved
in a garment company in Ho Chi Minh City.
Institutional Aspects
82.          Branch Network. Maritimebank is headquartered in Haiphong and has five branches in
Can Tho, Da Nang, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Quang Ninh. Maritimebank plans to expand its
operations into every major commercial and economic area of the country, with a particular focus on
ports, and to enhance its inter-provincial network. As part of its expansion strategy, Maritimebank plans
to open three sub-branches in Ho Chi Minh City and another in Hanoi by the end of 1995, and to open
new branches in Qui Nuon and Vung Tau soon thereafter. Maritimebank has correspondent banking
relationships with 155 banks.
83.          Strategy and Planning. The Board of Directors develops the general strategy guiding
Maritimebank's operations in consultation with the Board of Management for presentation to the
Meeting of Shareholders. Maritimebank's current strategy is to expand its branch network and to



115                                    Annex 10
increase its capital resources; it hopes to increase its share capital to D 600 billion by the year 2000. The
Board of Management is responsible for producing an annual business plan. The business plan is
developed in the context of Maritimebank's strategic objectives, and contains detailed financial,
operational and institutional targets. These are of both a qualitative and quantitative nature. This plan is
discussed each June at the Meeting of Shareholders. Maritimebank has been in the fortunate position of
exceeding its targeted performance each year. Some major targets for the 1995 business plan are to raise
legal capital to D 200 billion, increase customer deposits to D 600 to D 700 billion, and raise US$20
million in foreign borrowings.
84.           Maritimebank is currently implementing an ambitious project to modernize its
accounting and reporting systems so that it will be able to produce balance sheet, income statement, and
cash flow statements that conform to internationally accepted principles. Maritimebank expects to
produce these new financial statements for its accounts in 1995. Despite these changes, Maritimebank
will retain the capability of reporting financial information to SBV as required. The management of
Maritimebank has recognized that it most adopt international accounting standards to attract international
investors, to better conduct business with overseas businesses, and to aid in share price determination.
Maritimebank also expects that these steps will also enhance the bank's management information system
by providing managers with more useful data.
85.           Organizational Structure. A Meeting of Shareholders convenes annually. One of its
primary functions is to select members of the Board of Governors to represent shareholder interests.
Members on the Board serve for five years and their selection requires the approval of the SBV. The
Board meets every two to three months to discuss important bank affairs. It also selects the four
members of the Board of Management, which comprises Maritimebank's senior managers, including the
Managing Director, who is the bank's top officer. The head office in Haiphong is composed of a
Managing Director's Office (which has a credit section, and international banking section, and a
marketing section), and Accounting-Statistics Department, and Administration-Personnel Department,
and an electronics data processing center. Depending on the nature of the activity, the branches report to
functional departments at the bank's headquarters in Haiphong.
86.           Staffing and Training. Maritimebank plans to increase its staffing in 1995 from 200
employees to 261 in support of its expansion efforts.  Maritimebank currently recruits university
graduates with a background in banking and finance, skills in computer technology, and proficiency in
English. These candidates then undergo one month of training by Maritimebank, after which they are
required to pass a formal examination. Maritimebank has plans to recruit promising candidates wshile
they are still in college and has successfully piloted such a program at a secondary school in Haiphong.
87.           The salary structure of Maritimebank is approved by its Board of Directors and is not
subject to the dictates of the GOV. The salaries to Maritimebank employees are therefore quite high
relative to SOCB employees, and are further supplemented by a bonus package. These bonuses are not
directly linked to individual performance, but are instead determined by overall bank profitability and
staff level. While staff turnover is not a serious issue at Maritimebank, senior managers voiced concern
that they could not match the salaries offered by foreign industrial concerns.
88.           Maritimebank is committed to training and retraining to its staff to enhance their
capabilities. While conceding the importance of training, bank managers noted that the associated costs
were very expensive to the bank in terms of both budgetary and staff resources. Foreign language
training is part of the training regimen. Regarding external training, Maritimebank is planning to send
30 staff for overseas training this year. It has reached an agreement with ANZ Bank to train some of its
employees in Australia, and has also approached some banks in its correspondent network about
providing training courses for Maritimebank personnel.

Operations
89.           Credit Policy. Maritimebank conducts its credit decisions in full compliance with SBV
regulations and internal bank policies. It acts with due care to mitigate credit risk and conducts rigorous
loan appraisals. Maritimebank requires its borrowers to make deposits and to extend collateral as part of
its risk reduction strategy. Approval limits are governed by loan and branch size. The larger branches in
Hanoi, Haiphong, and Ho Chi Minh City may approve loans of up to D 1.5 billion per transaction, while
smaller branches may approve loans of up to D 1.0 billion. Loans of greater value require the approval
of the Managing Director. It is anticipated that the credit limits stipulated above will be raised during
1995. In any case, all loans need to be reviewed by the Risk Prevention Bureau. The Risk Prevention
Bureau devises credit risk regulations and policies and is represented in each of the bank's branches. For
approval, loans currently require the signatures of four bank officers: the branch manager (or Managing
Director), the chief accountant, the credit risk officer, and the head credit risk officer. Maritimebank is
currently looking to streamline its loan approval process. Maritimebank imposes a single borrower limit
of 10% of legal capital.
90.           Maritimebank has developed policies and procedures in order to assess the credit risk of
its client base. When drafting a letter of credit, Maritimebank may require a deposit of up to 100% of the
credit for new customers. For established customers, Maritimebank typically segregates borrowers into
three categories depending on their credit worthiness, with the most credit worthy required to make
deposits equivalent to 10% of the value of the credit, and the least credit worthy are required to put up
between 20% and 30%. When making a loan, Maritimebank reduces risk by requiring collateral. It will
typically make a loan up to 70% of the value of collateral for physical goods such as ships, inventories,
or imported and exported goods, and 50% for most other classes. Maritimebank makes few medium-
and long-term loans. Most of its short-term lending is for self-liquidating transactions. Maritimebank
has reported that 3% of the loans in its portfolio are currently experiencing problems. Credit officers
monitor borrower repayments, and Maritimebank has a number of policies in place to mitigate potential
problems with loan repayments. Responsibility for collections shifts to the Overdue Department for
loans more than seven days overdue.
91.           Resource Mobilization. Savings mobilization has doubled in each year of operations.
Maritimebank increased its share capital from D 40 billion to D 60 billion in 1993. It is seeking to
further increase its share capital to D 200 billion, and hopes to receive approval in late 1995 or early
1996. It will offer 30% of these new shares to foreign investors.
92.           Auditing. Maritimebank has a Board of Supervision which performs an internal audit
function. It reports to the Board of Directors and has a representative in each of Maritimebank's
branches. The accounts of Maritimebank are not reviewed by an external auditor on a regular basis.
However, in 1992, an international auditing firm based in Hong Kong performed an audit of
Maritimebank in connection with the establishment of a country fund for Viet Nam. The SBV exercises
a supervisory control of Maritimebank to ensure it is compliance with Vietnamese banking regulations.
Financial Structure and Performance
93.           Structure. For the period 1991 to 1994, the total assets of Maritimebank have grown
more than four fold, rising from D 136.7 billion in 1991 to D 733.4 billion in 1994. During the same
period, total liabilifies grew 664.6%, rising from D 84.3 billion to D 644.8 billion, while total equity
grew 69.2%, from D 52.3 billion to D 88.6 billion. Between 1993 and 1994, total assets rose by 40.2%,
total liabilities by 44.8% and total equity by 13.7%. Because liabilities have been increasing faster than
equity, Maritimebank's debt to equity ratio increased from 62:38 in 1991 to 88:12 in 1994.



117                                        Annex 10
94.             Maritimebank's loan portfolio has undergone significant growth, rising from  D 34.1
billion in 1991 to D 435.5 billion in 1994, an annual average growth rate of 148.3%. Deposits also grew
dramatically, if somewhat less so, increasing from D 82.8 billion in 1991 to D 440.8 billion in 1994,
representing an annual average growth rate of 83.4%. Consequently, the loans to deposits ratio for 1994
stood at 98.8%. Between 1993 and 1994, loans increased by 42.0% while deposits increased by only
12.4%
95.             Profitability. Between 1991 to 1994, net income has increased at an annual average rate
of 133.2%, rising from D 1.5 billion to D 16.9 billion. During the same period, interest income rose
from D 3.2 billion to D 53.4 billion, and interest expenses from D 0.7 billion to D 15.3 billion. As a
result, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income rose from 22.1% in 1991 to 28.8% in 1994.
Maritimebank earns virtually all of its interest income from its loans; furthermore, interest income
accounted for 86.3% of total revenues in 1994. Maritimebank has been containing its costs. When
compared to average total assets, salaries increased from 0.5% in 1992 to 0.6% in 1993, but
administrative expenses declined from 1.3% to 0.9%. Maritimebank has consistently reported after-tax
profits. The ratio of net income to average total assets was 2.5% in 1992, 2.2% in 1993 and 2.7% in
1994. At the same time, net income to average total equity rose from 8.9% in 1992, to 12.6% in 1993,
and to 20.4% in 1994. Maritimebank pays a standard 45% profit tax. In addition, it pays a revenue tax
which varies from 6% to 15% depending on the type of income. In 1994, Maritimebank paid profit taxes
of D 13.9 billion and a turnover taxes of D 6.6 billion.

F. Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank)
Introduction
96.           Backgzround. The Bank for Foreign Trade of Viet Nam (Vietcombank) was established
in 1963 to handle trade finance and management of foreign exchange for the country. The latter function
has been gradually transferred to SBV after the creation of a two-tier banking system.
97.           Business Activity. The core business activity of Vietcombank is the provision of trade
financing. However, Vietcombank is active in a number of other areas, including: short-, medium- and
long-term loan facilities; funds transfer; deposit taking; documentary credits; guarantees; foreign
exchange; credit cards; spot, forward and swap transactions; and consultancy services. Vietcombank is
kae on enhancing funds mobilization and expanding its investment activities, especially as regards the
private sector. The current loan portfolio is concentrated in the trade sectors (46%), industry (22%) and
agriculture (12%). It is moving into retail banking in order to more easily mobilize savings and to
expand its client base of individuals. Vietcombank is using its trade expertise and its strong relationships
with its corporate clients to expand into areas such as merchant banking. It is focusing its lending
activities on a range of industrial sectors it finds attractive, including oil, light and heavy industry,
cement, construction materials, textiles, and agricultural products.  In light of these activities,
Vietcombank believes that its chief competitors will be Eximbank and Incombank.
98.           Vietcombank has established several subsidiaries involved in leasing, general trade,
hotels, consulting and financing, the latter in Hong Kong. It is further looking to set up a subsidiary in
real estate development and a finance company subsidiary in Moscow. Vietcombank has been active in
seeking out investment opportunities. It is involved in several joint-stock companies, with a 10% share
in Ziadinh, a bank in Ho Chi Minh City, a 5% share in the Military Bank, a 4% share in Eximbank, and a
small interest in a hotel. In 1993, Vietcombank established Firstvina Bank, a joint-venture in which it
has a 50% stake with Korea First Bank. Vietcombank also has a 50% share in a shipping concern known
as Vietfrachd. Vietcombank is investigating the establishment of other joint-ventures and is currently
planning a joint-venture consulting outfit with Paribas and a joint-venture property company with Keppel
of Singapore.  While Vietcombank has a direct interest in ensuring the financial success of its
investments, it is aware of the dangers involved extending loans to support these activities.
Consequently, it does not envisage substantial lending after an initial start-up period which it estimates to
be about six months.
Institutional Aspects
99.    Branch Network. Vietcombank is headquartered in Hanoi (with 480 staff), and operates 17
branches and 10 sub-branches. The branch in Ho Chi Minh City is the largest and employs around 300
people, while the smaller branches are run by 40 to 50 staff. Vietcombank has no immediate plans to
open new branches, but plans to expand its sub-branch network in 1995 by opening three to four sub-
branches in Hanoi and one to two in Ho Chi Minh City. Its current plans for expansion focus on building
up its sub-branch network over the next few years in Da Nang, Haiphong, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City,
Quay Ninh, and Vung Tau, in an effort to support its drive into retail banking. Vietcombank is also
interested in expanding into export processing zones and other specialized industrial zones.
Vietcombank maintains overseas offices in France, Hong Kong and Sweden.
100.          Strategy and Planning.  As part of annual planning, each branch provides detailed
operational and financial information to the General Affairs Department at headquarters. Headquarters
then consolidates this information and delivers it to the Board of Directors in October or November. The
Board of Directors discusses this information and produces a business plan early in the year. This plan



122                                   Annex 10
typically specifies the funds each branch is expected to mobilize, informs them of the total credit they
can lend, and the total amount they can borrow from headquarters. The Board also sets the overall
strategy for the bank and continually monitors management progress in meeting its objectives. The
Board meets twice a year and formalizes the targets and objectives to be achieved over the next six
months or over the next year. Based on such factors as past performance, market conditions, and
liquidity constraints, the Board adjusts these targets and the methods needed to reach them. The Board
also makes decisions concerning new products and services. Vietcombank sends its business plans to
SBV and MOF to aid them in their policy decisions.
101.         Organizational Structure. A Board of Governors oversees bank activities. It is entirely
an internal unit; 11 of its members are senior bank officers, and it is chaired by the Director General of
Vietcombank. Directly under the Board of Governors is the Board of Management, which is headed by
the Director General and includes all top headquarters and branch managers. Four Deputy Directors
General report to the Director General, who also administers the Personnel Department. The Board of
Management meets regularly and deals with any activity that senior management deems important. It
also sets bank-wide policies and procedures. Under the Board of Management are the individual
branches, an Operations Center at headquarters (comprising Planning and Dealing, Payment Center,
Credit Security, Export Settlement, Import Settlement, Remittance Section, Cash Section, Accounting
Section, Card Payment Section, and Saving Section), and a further nine departments, also at headquarters
(comprising General Affairs, International Relations, Personnel, Consulting, Investment Guarantee,
Treasury-Accounting, Over-Due Debt Management, Electronic Data Processing, and Administration).
102.         Staffing and Training. Vietcombank currently employs about 1,700 staff. Over 60% of
its staff have college educations. Vietcombank recruits qualified university graduates with a background
in banking and finance, who have attained proficiency in a foreign language, and who have received a
certificate in computer operations. Potential recruits are required to sit for an examination administered
by Vietcombank and to undergo foreign language testing. Vietcombank ties its hiring levels to expected
growth, which has been significant in recent years.  Still, competition is very keen to work at
Vietcombank; as an example, 150 applicants recently applied for 10 positions. The policies governing
promotion have recently been revamped. Promotion decisions are now made by a group of senior
management where previously they had been made by an employee's immediate supervisor, often with
interference from the Party, trade unions, etc. It was believed that the old system favored personal
relationships at the expense of professional competency.
103.         As with other SOCBs, the base salary rate is subject to yearly decisions negotiated with
the MOF, SBV and the Ministry of Labor. In an effort to retain qualified staff, Vietcombank also
negotiates a bonus structure that allows employees to increase their pay in a manner commensurate with
their performance. This is accomplished by a bonus system which is paid on a quarterly basis.
Nevertheless, the compensation system remains highly administered and well below the levels of foreign
and private banks.
104.         The management of Vietcombank views training as an area critical to the bank's success.
Orientation training is provided to all new recruits.  Vietcombank has established an internal training
center in Ho Chi Minh City and also sends staff to a foreign language college. Vietcombank also
supports external training, and actively uses its correspondent network to provide training expertise and
to fund the bank's external training efforts. In 1994, Vietcombank sent 30 managers abroad for training,
mostly to attend short-term courses.

Operations
105.         Credit. The individual branches have a great deal of latitude in making credit allocation
decisions. (Further evidence of this autonomy is the fact that branches have their own balance sheets.)
All branches are given a lending allocation each year which they may not exceed. The current level for
the Ho Chi Minh Branch is US$100 million. The branches may then allocate credit as they see fit, but
headquarters approval is required for medium-term loans exceeding US$1.0 million in Ho Chi Minh
City, and US$0.5 million in all other branches. At headquarters, such loan approvals are handled by the
Investment Department and require the approval of either the Director General or the Deputy Director
General. There is no such approval limit for short-term loans.
106.         Vietcombank considers project appraisal to be the crucial element in making credit
decisions.  Since financial statements in Viet Nam  are of dubious value, the credit manual that
Vietcombank has compiled is little more than simple list of procedures. Given that credit risk is very
high, Vietcombank exercises great prudence in making credit decisions. There are no credit committees
and so branch directors make the final decisions on loans subject to the policies deiineated above. Once
a credit decision has been made, all follow-up on monitoring the credit is manual. Branches currently
make weekly, monthly and quarterly reports to headquarters covering a variety of information on credit
outstanding, total assets and funds mobilization.  Vietcombank intends to computerize its credit
monitoring operations pending the upgrading of its computer network.
107.         In order to deal with problem loans, Vietcombank is only allowed to set aside 5% of its
equity in a special reserve account, but there are no regulations governing how these funds are to be
utilized to deal with loan problems.  To mitigate potential losses, Vietcombank requires private
borrowers to put up collateral which it could then auction off to recover its money. Recovering money
from SOEs is more problematic since Vietcombank would need to obtain their willingness and capacity
to repay in the event of default.
108.         Resource Mobilization. In a bid to increase resource mobilization, Vietcombank has
expanded into retail banking and increased its branch network. It has also expanded its range of services
by offering savings accounts and certificates of deposits with maturities of one, two and three years.
Vietcombank has also raised money through bilateral credit agreements with its correspondent banks and
through pre-export loans. Vietcombank has also expressed an interest in raising funds on the Eurobond
market in the future.
109.         Auditing. Vietcombank's financial statements meet the requirements of the SBV, but
are not prepared according to internationally accepted accounting practices. Vietcombank's financial
statements are not currently examined by an external auditor. The internal audit function is performed
by the Comptroller Department which supervises compliance of both headquarters and branch activities.
This Department functions as an independent unit. It is staffed by five personnel at headquarters, and is
supplemented by additional staff from other departments as necessary. In theory, the Comptroller
Department is responsible for auditing the full scope of Vietcombank's internal financial accounts and
controls and procedures but, in practice, it confines itself merely to the checking accuracy of financial
information. Vietcombank is developing a plan to enhance its information technology and management
information systems.
Financial Structure and Performance
110.         Structure. Total assets for Vietcombank increased 35.8% from 1991 to 1994, rising from
D 12,315.7 billion in 1991, to D 14,421.8 billion in 1992, before dropping to D 13,399.1 billion in 1993,
and rising again in 1994 to D 16,727.1 billion. Total liabilities followed a similar trend, rising from D



124                                         Annex 10
12,231.8 billion in 1991, to D 13,939.4 billion in 1992, and falling to D 12,877.1 billion in 1993, and
rising to D 16,201.6 billion in 1994. Total equity, on the other hand, rose in each year, increasing from
D 337.5 billion in 1991 to D 525.6 billion in 1994, an increase of 527.0%. As a result, while the ratio of
debt to equity is high, it has been falling, and dropped from 99:1 in 1991 to 97:3 in 1994.
Ill.            The loan portfolio for Vietcombank has been growing consistently, rising from  D
2,784.4 billion in 1991, to D 7,134.5 billion in 1994, an increase of 156.2%. Deposits grew dramatically
from 1991 to 1992, rising from D 6,926.3 billion to D 10,391.2, but rose to only D 11,921.1 billion in
1994. As a result, the ratio of loans to deposits decreased from 40.2% in 1991 to 36.1% in 1992, but
jumped to 55.7% in 1993, and stood at 59.8% in 1994.
112.            Profitability.  Vietcombank appears to be a highly profitable bank. It recorded a net
income of D 166.0 billion on total revenues of D 593.2 billion in 1994. While interest income has been
rising, this growth has been coming from loan income, as deposit income has dropped slightly over the
last two years. While the financial margin of Vietcombank increased from D 497.6 billion in 1993 to D
512.9 billion in 1994, the ratio of interest expenses to interest income increased from 30.2% to 46.3% in
those years. Vietcombank has a low cost structure. In 1994, non-interest expenses (net of taxes) were D
135.4 billion, and salaries were just D 15.3 billion.
113.            Vietcombank has an unusually high tax burden. It is subject to a 45%  profit, a 2%
capital use tax, and a turnover tax ranging from 6% to 30%. Vietcombank must allocate its net income
among three different funds: a bonus fund, a welfare fund, and a business promotion fund. However, the
maximum annual contributions to these funds are determined by the Government, and any profit after
such allocations reverts to the Government.

PAYMENT SYSTEM AND BANK MODERNIZATION PROJECT
Cost Recovery of the Inter-bank Payment System
1.           It is envisaged that the SBV will operate the inter-bank clearing and settlement systems
(IBPS and SAPS), incurring one-off start-up costs and on-going operating costs. These costs will be
recovered by charging direct participants (settlement banks).
2.            A simple model has been constructed to assist the SBV in the estimation of break-even
prices on the basis of projected volumes and estimated costs. The components of the model are
described below.
Projected Volumes
3.            We have projected total annual volumes for the period 1995-2003 on a range of
assumptions regarding the rate of growth of inter-bank payments. These projections recognize the two
major influences on the rate of growth of non-cash payment volumes:
(a)   the rate of economic growth;
(b)   the rate of migration from cash to non-cash payments, driven by the level of confidence
in the banking system and the technical quality and cost efficiency of payment services
(including intra-bank payment systems).
4.            The baseline for projections is provided by the quarter 4 1994 inter-bank payment
volumes provided by the six banks included within the scope of this project. Details regarding the
information requested and supplied are set out in Appendix 3 of the Statement of User Requirements (in
project files).
5.            Total inter-bank payment volumes for Q4 1994 have been estimated using the following
formula:
*  0.9*sum of all reported inter-bank payments (out and in)/2.
[0.9* reduces the total number of reported payments by 10% - an estimate of the
proportion involving a bank not within the scope the project
/2 allows for the fact that all payments between the reporting banks will have been
reported twice].
* Where a bank did not report a quarterly total, it was estimated as follows:
* 78*(highest daily total+lowest daily total)/2
[78 is the number of business days in the quarter].



129                                   Annex 11
This approach yields a Q4 1994 total approachiniLg 300.000 - the starting point for projections.
The model includes four scenarios for payment growth for the period 1995-2003:
(i)    10% growth per annum to 1997; 15% growth after the first expansion of
new systems
(ii)    10% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter
(iii)   20% growth per annum to 1997; 30% growth thereafter
(iv)   20% growth per annum to 1997; 60% growth thereafiter.
It is assumed that new settlement banks will join the system after 1998, but that this will not result in an
increase in inter-bank payment volumes: payments will be captured directly from new participants,
instead of via other banks acting as their agents.
NB    These volume projections provide only a rough guide, since current estimates are
unreliable and current and future growth rates uncertain.
Estimated Costs
6.            Base costs incurred during 1995-99 are not volume-dependent and are derived from the
project cost estimates. The one-off, start-up costs (covering hardware, project management, acceptance
testing, training and documentation) incurred by new joiners will include SBV charges set to recover in
full the cost of implementation services that it provides. Given this policy of full cost recovery, new
joiner costs are not included in these cost estimates. Annual maintenance costs are estimated at 15% of
hardware and software cost from 1999 onwards.
7.           IT operations will be locally resourced from 1999, at an average annual employment cost
per full-time staff member (in 1995 prices) of US$2,500, with an initial staffing level of 5. IT operations
will include a technical help desk facility. A sum (initially US$5,000 in 1995 prices) is included to cover
the cost of transport, materials and voice communications.  It is assumed that staffing and other
requirements will increase at an annual rate of 20% as transaction volumes, the number of participants,
and the real-time gross settlement component of the system increase.
8.            Business operations will be locally resourced from  1997, at an average annual
employment cost per full-time staff member (in 1995 prices) of US$3,000, with an initial staffing level
of 5. A sum (initially US$10,000 in 1995 prices) is included to cover the cost of transport, materials and
voice communications. It is assumed that staffing and other requirements will increase at an annual rate
of 20% as transaction volumes, the number of participants, and the real-time gross settlement component
of the system increase. Estimates for both business and IT operations assume the availability of
appropriately skilled local resources going forward.

Telecommunications Costs
9.            The main on-going operating costs are data communications costs relating to the
transmission of payments across the VNPT/VDC network from 1997. These costs must be estimated
with reference to projected volumes and an indicative unit message cost. Pending negotiations with
VNPT/VDC to establish these message unit costs, telecommunications costs have not been taken into
account in determining the break-even prices. However, the model has been designed to incorporate
these costs as and when they become available.
Action - Indicative Data Communications Charge
SBV should obtain from VNPT/VDC an estimate of a 'bundled' charge, reflecting
the number and type (X.25/X.28) of lines used
the number of payment messages across the VDC X.25 network
network management services.
This charge should take into account all payments trafric (intra-bank as well as inter-bank). Inter-
bank volumes should be multiplied by 4 (reflecting a 1:4 inter-bank:intra-bank ratio) to provide a
rough estimate of all trafric.
The line requirements set out in part 6 of the Statement of User Requirements (Tables 6.1 and 6.2) allow
for total payment volumes of up to about 300,000 payments per day (see project files).
Break-Even Prices
10.          For a given year and a given volume scenario, there is a break-even price at which the
stream of revenues is equal to the stream of costs. The break-even price for a given year Y is calculated
as follows:
sum of total annual costs incurred (1995-Y)/sum of projected volumes (1997-Y)
The sum of costs includes an estimate of the sum of commitment fees and service charges incurred on
the IDA credit. The actual break-even point will be determined by actual volumes (hence revenues) and
actual costs, as well as by price.
NB    This is the break-even price for inter-bank clearing and settlement - not a price for end-to-
end processing of inter-bank payments. Further, this is an average break-even price, and actual
costs will vary around this average for individual transactions.
I l.         Additional operating costs (mainly in the business operations category) will be incurred
by the commercial banks in processing payments up to the point at which they enter IBPS as an
electronic payment instruction, and on receipt of electronic instructions from IBPS. These costs are
considered to be part of the normal operating costs of the commercial banks in the provision of the new
payment services.
12.          The table below shows the result of the break-even analysis under the four volume
growth scenarios. The prices do not include telecommunications costs, which can be expected to add



131                                   Annex 11
between US$0.10-0.60 to the per message costs. The break-even prices for a given year Y and a given
volume scenario indicate the price that must be charged from the very beginning of system operation to
achieve full cost-recovery in that year. As can be expected, the earlier full cost recovery is desired, the
higher the price that must be charged, and vice versa.

20% to 1997; 30% thereafter    10.47   3.80    2.13    1.32    0.88    0.61    0.44

Prices
13.          Charges for inter-bank clearing and settlement should be set to recover both start-up and
operating costs. The tariff structure should differentiate between different types of transactions and levels
of service, and prices should be set so as to achieve full cost recovery in an acceptable time frame (say,
by 2000). This implies that there will be an initial subsidy to encourage use, but that this will be
recovered within the first few years of live operation of the system. After break-even (when revenues
exceed costs), a surplus will be available for further development of inter-bank payment systems. The
NPC will decide on actual pricing policy. It should avoid cross subsidization between different types of
payment: item charges should reflect differences in the cost of different items, such as real-time gross
settlement compared with net settlement. The charging policy may combine fixed membership fees with
per item charges - one way of giving discounts to high volume users.
