Borrower:                Governmenit of the Republic of Yemen
BeTleficiiries:          Ministrv of Education, Saina'a and Aden Universities
Credit Amount:           US$19.4 million
Terms:                   Standard IDA
Proiect Description:    The overall aim of the Project is to improve secondary
school teaching while creating a basis for quality
improvement through upgrading the cadre of teachers,
making better use of the teacher resource and planning
for future improvements. The Project would: (i)
provide support for the fouir-year and one-year
secondary teacher training programs at the Faculties
of Education (FOEs) at Sana'a and Aden; (ii) start a
master's program in education at Sana'a; (iii) improve
science education; (iv) upgrade and expand FOE
facilities; (v) establish an In-service Training
Institute and reorganize the structure of the
nationwide network of in-service training; and (v')
improve the nationwide coordination of policy
formulation, and of the planning and monitoring of
secondary teacher training.
Benefits:                By ensuring a supply of qualified Yemeni secondary-
level teachers, particularly women, administrators,
and key educational development personnel, the Project
would improve the quality, efficiency and general
access to secondary-level education. Savings,
including substantial foreign exchange costs, would
result from the improved efficiency in secondary
teacher training and from the replacement of
expatriates with Yemeni teachers. Improved science
education would stimulate human resourre development
in key economic sectors. Increasinr numbers of
secondary-level female teachers nould encourage
females to enroll and particijeate in education.
Risks:                   Two risks are associated with the proposed Project:
(i) the failure to implement policies to rationalize
the teacher ,caining and deployment system because of
the lack of coordination among key ministries and
agencies. This risk would be mitigated by the
establishment of the Advisory Group for Trained
Manpower, which would have high-level government



- ii -
support and assistance for conducting its work: and
(ii) the possible slow implementation of the building
program. This risk would be minimized because site
acquisition was completed by appraisal and because the
preparation of tender documents (with assistance from
overseas architects) is well underway.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
STAFF APi RAISAL REPORT
1. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BACKGROUND
1.01     The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR, or North Yemen) and the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY, or South Yemen), merged on May 22, 1990 to
form the Republic of Yemen (ROY).  The two governmental administrations hav-
joined at the cabinet level and are now aligning forces at lower ministerial
levels; 1991 will continue to be a transition period during which some
separate institutions, policies, and practices will coexist at the subsectoral
level. The Government intends to introduce its first joint budget in 1991 and
its first joint development plan in 1992.
1.02     Unification brings together two sets of resources that now have
greater development potential. With a population of about 11.0 million
(1988), ROY occupies an area of about 530,000 sq km of largely mountainous and
desert terrain in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The North
has modest oil and gas reserves, good tourism potential and a dynamic market
sys-em. The South also has some oil reserves, large fishery resources, a good
strategic location and the Port of Aden. The elimination of border
disagreements has opened up this area to investment in oil exploration, the
country's greatest hope for economic growth; oil exploration had already begun
to substantially change the export structure. Due to increased oil
extraction, the northern economy grew nearly 14 percent in 1988 and
approximately 5 percent in 1989. As total merchandise exports increased from
US$16 million in 1986 to US$1,186 million in 1989, oil exports increased from
zero to US$1,119 million.
1.03      However, unification also brings together two economies that face
serious macroimbalances and substantial external debt. Northern debt service
has increased sharply from only 7 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1985
to 23 percent in 1989; southern debt service stands at 16 percerc of foreign
exchange earnings, but this lower number is the result of concessionary terms
from socialist countries, which no longer provide economic aid. The public
expenditure deficit is pressed by a ballooning public sector wage bill
compounded by the relocation of 100,000 public sector employees from Aden to
Sana'a. Furthermore, the situation is worsening because of growing inflation;
domestic savings that have been largely negative over the last decade; limited
investment, and those who do invest hire skilled expatriates instead of Yemeni
workers; low gross international reserves; and unemployment presently at 28
percent and rising.
1.04       These problems are aggravated by external economic circumstances
caused by the Gulf crisis. These include: (i) the return of 750,000 migrant
workers from Saudi Arabia, who not only are unemployed and bring with them
120,000 school age children to be educated, but who also are no longer
generating the US$400 million in remittances that provided capital for Yemeni
microenterprises; (ii) lost contracts for refining and preferential purchases
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil; and (iii) lost budgetary support from the Gulf

Indeed, the low f ixed iiVe.'t metiut in thle North of 12 percent of CDP in 1989 was
financed total lv hv *xt'ruiall rc:.,wurces, mainly in the form of workers'
remi.ttalaces and borrowinig.  Durinig thie past two years, improved economic
activity in the Soutth made up for many of the losses sustained in 1986 due to
thie civil war and the sharp decline in workers' remittances; GDP grew about 3
percent in 1989.  However, with workers' remittances continuing to drop and a
new economic system stressing private sector productivity after long-standing
centralized control over production, investment, distribution and prices,
problemiis do exist. These problems are compounded by the fact that the public
sector in thwe Southl accouLts for two thirds of ROY public sector employment
although the area has only 20 percent of the country's total population.
1.05     Preliminary work on formulating a strategy that effectively meets the
problems facing ROY has made human resources development a priority.
Generating private sector investment and investor interest in hiring Yemeni
workers, lowering debt service payments, and replacing higher priced
expatriates are all key objectives. However, only an educated populace can
assure that these objectives are met, as well as respond to the many changes
raking place and certain to take place in ROY. A productive work force
requires a broad-based and efficient primary education system to provide basic
literacy and numeracy; a solid secondary education system to train primary
school teachers; and training in skilled occupations. However, the budgetary
squeeze, together with the high population growth, puts increasing pressure on
the Government to rationalize the use of resources, including those targeted
for secondary education.
II THE EDUCATION SECTOR
A. Overview
2.01     The need for an integrated country strategy and current efforts to
define such a strategy are mirrored in the education sector, where time and
effort will be required to merge the education systems of the two former
states and to define the roles of the relevant ministries (Annex 1). Before
unification, the North operated on a 6-3-3 structure (six primary grades,
followed by three preparatory and three secondary grades); in the South the
system was 8-4 (eight unity, i.e., primary and preparatory grades followed by
four secondary grades). The proposed system for the unified ROY is nine years
of basic education followed by three years at the secondary level. In the
North, primary teachers have been trained in secondary-level teacher training
schools and in special secondary school programs, while all postprimary
teachers have been trained in the five Faculties of Education (FOEs) of the
University of Sana'a. In the South, primary teachers are trained in
postsecondary one- and two-year programs, and secondary teachers at the two
Colleges of Education (COEs) of the University of Aden. The merging of the
two systems will have major impacts on many aspects of tht educational system,
including curricula, structural framework, internal effiriency and access for
girls. To address these and other problems, the Governmient has established a
new Ministry of Higher EducatiDn (MOHE) and has intep-ated officials from both
formor Ministries of Educqtioni (MOE) into a reorga:.ized MOE and MOHE.  MOE has



coiri;t itkit ot  a worlintg ctuni t tee to def'ine a new structure and to design new
l.iws gpvorniring  ducationi. 'rhe restructuring work is expecf-.d to be completed

:Nvaii.ibie to eduicatiorn inore efficiently and eff'ectively.
E..kcat ion Policies
0.(2     Prior to unification, both the North and the South gave high priority
to expanidinig access to primary education. In the two decades from 1966 co
1987, enrollments increased fivefold in the North (to 79 percent of the age
group) and more than sixfold in the South (to 82 percent of the age group).
Both parts of the cour.try expanded access for females, but with greater
success in the South where the ratio of girls to boys in unity schools is
6:10. In the North, the gross enrollment ratio for girls is only 39 percent,
as compared with close to 100 percent for boys. Beyond the primary level,
schools in the North and South have operated under different policy
frameworks. In both parts of the country, primary schooling is open to all
children. At the secondary level, in the South, entry is restricted; in the
North, all those who meet the entry qualifications are given a place. The
same policies govern entry to the universities (Annex 2). The South uses
entrance examinations and admits only the number in each department planned
for by the Government in each department. In the North, entrance
qualifications are based on secondary school performance, and all those
qualifying can gain entrance, although not always to the department of their
choice. Neither university charges tuition, but in the South, all university
students receive monthly stipends, and students from outside the city are
given free room and board. Similar support is provided in the North only for
students in the FOEs.
Financing
2.03     Within the new Government's already overstretched budget, adequate
financing for education--especially given the poor condition of facilities and
the limited supplies and materials--presents a challenge of particular
urgency. Although government expenditures on education as a percentage of the
national budget grew from 11.2 percent in 1978 to 20.3 percent in 1989 in the
North, the increase only just kept pace with enrollment growth; in current
terms, this implies a substantial decline in real per capita resources.
Between 1978 and 1989, enrollment grew by 470 percent while the budget for
education grew (in current rials) by 490 percent. In the South, the share of
the government budget allocated to education declined from 12.6 percent in
1978 to 10.3 percent in 1988, leading to shortages of resources in all areas.
2.04     Budget data from the North indicate that while 25 percent of the
recurrent budget is spent on education, educational materials are
significanuly underfinanced (Table 1.1). Almost 90 percent of the budget is
spent on salaries, just over 2 percent on educational software. Foreign
secondary teachers working in Yemen accounted for an estimated US$80 million
equivalent foreign exchange cost in the combined 1989 education budgets for
the North and the South. If the proportion of expatriate teachers were to
remain the sar , this cost would increase to US$160 million equivalent by

Demographic Pressures
2.05     The ROY population growth rate of about 3.2 percent per year is among
the highest in the world.'  Consequently, more than half the population is
below 15 years of age and in need of schooling. The Governments of both the
North and the South responded to the need for expansion over the past 25 years
by building schools and expanding teacher training programs. In the North,
primary school enrollments grew from 24 percent of the school-age population
in 1975 to 79 percent in 1988, representing dramatic progress towards the
Government's goal of universal primary education. The gross enrollment rate
for boys ir.creased from 23 percent in 1970-71 to approximately 126 percent in
1988-89. (Rates in excess of 100 percent represent overage students, common
in rapidly expanding systems.) During the same period, the increase for girls
was also substantial, from 2 percent to 39 percent, though lagging
significantly behind that for boys (Table 2 of Annex 1).

2.06     Educational expansion is continuing; the increasing number of primary
school granluates Is putting Irl.-,sure on higher grade levels (Table 1 of Annex
1),  Between 1988 and 2000, enrollments in the North are projected to rise
from 1,148,000 to 1,795,000 students in primary grades (1-6); from 238,000 to
474,000 In lower secondary grades (7-9) and trom 86,000 to 289,000 in upper
secondary education grades (10-12).  It is estimated that enrollment
percentages may rise from 79 percent to 85 percent in primary grades, from 30
percent to 3/ percent in preparatory grades, and from 14 percent to 27 percent
in secondary grades. Approximately 10 percent of the secondary students are
female, and this percentage is expected to increase to 20 percent to 25
percent by the year 2000. Figure 1 above illustrates the dramatic growth in
enrollments at the primary and secondary level in the North.
The Supply of Teachers
2.07     The public financing of scbooling is quite new in Yemen.  Only since
the early 1970s have both parts of the country attempted to open schooling to
the society at large. Thus, few Yemenis have the educational qualifications
required to become teachers. Somewhat different strategies were adopted in
the North and in the South to address this problem. The South expanded
schooling slowly, using some foreign teachers, but attempting to keep the rate
of expansion within its capacity to provide Yemeni teachers. Conversely, the
North expanded rapidly, and staffed schools with expatriate teachers, mostly
from Egypt, but from other Arab countries as well. At present, the proportion
of expatriate teachers is 70 percent in the North but only 16 per -nt in the
South. The North has made substantial progress in replacing expatriates in
urban areas, but recruitir.g Yemeni teachers for rural schools has, until now
proven difficult; most educated people prefer to live in urban areas, and
social customs make it difficult for single women to live away from home.
Three ongoing IDA Credits 1340-, 1470-, and 1773-YAR, as well as two completed
projects, are assistir.g the Government establish a geographically dispersed
primary teacher training system; with this system, primary teachers will be
able to be trained where they live and where they will work. Training
secondary teachers requires greater resources and more highly educated
instructors. Implementing this same strategy for secondary education is,
therefore, not feasible; and progress in meeting rural needs has,
consequently, been slower. Using expatriates was an effective stopgap
measure. However, . ;patriates are unacceptable in the longer term because
their teaching reflects training in other countries and is considered
culturally inappropriate. In addition, foreign teachers do not remain in
their posts for long periods of time, making investments in their upgrading
uneconomical; their salaries also impose a substantial foreign exchange
burden. Finally, as recent events in the Gulf have demonstrated, even the
supply of teachers can not be guaranteed.
Quality Concerns
2.08     Although precise measures of educational achievements are lacking,
Yemeni officials express great concern that the raptd expansion of the system
has been at the expense of educational quality. In urban areas, class sizes
are above 60 and often reach 100. Schools operate with two and sometimes
three shifts. Educational materials are lacking, and few teachers have
received in-service training or adequate supervision. Many rural areas are
without schools, and places for female students are limited. Many curricula
are outdated, and, even at the secondary level, most schools have no science

equ1p11e1 nt ajnd few other educatiornal1 aids.  The Goverivnent realizes that
qlualitat ive improVvemenits ill education are essentlial if currelit shortages of
skilled labor are to t1  redressed.2   The poor quality of education in the
Southl is due to the sharl) reductions in funding in recent years (para. 2.03),
It is clear that enrollment increases of the kind now occurrinig (Figure 1)
cannot be sustained. Thie Government will need to achieve a better balance
between increasing access anid inaintaining quality, in order for its
investments in educationi to continue to bear fruit.
B. Main Issues in Secondary Education
2.09     The rapidly growing primary and secondary education systems in Yemen
exhibit the familiar shortcomings of inadequate access; inequitable provision
in rural areas and with respect to gender; and low quality resulting from
poorly trained teachers, the lack of educational materials and suitable
textbooks, and outdated curricula. In the past two decades, primary education
has clearly been favored by the external agencies giving support to
educational development in Yemen. The need to build a strong base has been
recognized by USAID and IDA, the two largest sources of financial assistance
to the sector. Major support has been given to the expansion of teacher
training and to curriculum development, textbook production and the
strengthening of educational management (through five IDA credits and USAID
support). While the problems of primary education in Yemen are not yet
solved, and will requiie substantial future support, the rapid expansion at
the primary level is putting increasing pressure on secondary education. The
Government has, therefore, decided chat assistance for secondary education is
now necessary and should proceed in tandem with measures to improve primary
education. Secondary education is a relatively new phenomenon in YemenL2,
having increased from about 1,000 students in 1975 to about 300,000 at
present. As the Government has moved quickly to respond to the demand for
secondary education, three overriding problems have emerged: (i) there is a
shortage of well-qualified Yemeni secondary teachers because recent attempts
to remedy shortages have been at the expense of providing high quality
training; (ii) the existing teacher resource is poorly used because of weak
in-service training mechanisms and the absence of training for school
administrators and managerial personnel; and (iii) the rational use of
existing resources has been impeded by the lack of planning and coordinating
mechanisms, and by inadequ-.te data and information about teacher's needs and
good teaching practices. These issues are summarized in paras. 2.10-2.16 and
discussed in detail in Annex 3.
L   The vast majority of returning migrant workers are unskilled and,
therefore, do not change the priority given to producing
scientifically literate and skilled workers.
3 Henceforth, "sotondary" education will be used to refer to post-
primary in the North (preparatory and secondary) and post-unity in
the South.



Redressing the Shortai e of Yemeni Secondar  Teachers and Administrators
2.10     The shortage of Yemeni teachers (described in para. 2.07) is most
dramatic at the secondary level, where only 15 percent of all teachers are
Yemeni.  l'he capacity to train secondary teachers is relatively new.  FOEs
were established at the University of Sana'a in 1973, at Taiz in 1985, at
Hodeidah in 1987, at Ibb in 1988 and at Hajjah in ]989. The University of
Aden established a College of Education (COE) in 1970 and a branch at Mukalla
in 1986. To date, these institutions have produced only about 3,100 students,
far short of the 9,000 now needed. Recently, the Government has undertaken
crash programs to train teachers, more than doubling enrollments in 1989/90
(para. 5 of Annex 3); consequently, the physical and administrative
infrastructure of FOEs have been overwhelmed, with a severe drop in
instructional quality. However, should significant numbers of these new
students complete their training, the Yemeni educational system would come
closer to reaching a "steady state" in which teacher supply would meet teacher
demand. The demand for new teachers should level off to about 3,800 annually
(Table 1 of Annex 1 and para. 5 of Annex 3). Meeting the demand for women
teachers, who are in particularly short supply in rural areas, is an
additiornal concern.
2.11     Two recent studies, Development Needs of the Education Sector
(February 1989) and Media and Methods Study (July 1989) done jointly by IDA
and UNESCO, identified the major shortcomings of the preservice training
system, including inadequate instructional programs and the shortage of Yemeni
faculty. An analysis of the instructional programs revealed that the
curriculum does not adequately emphasize teaching skills, leaving graduates
unequipped to function effectively in the classroom. Many textbooks were
found to be inappropriate, either out of date, overly theoretical, or in
conflict with the educational policies of Yemen. The present FOE and COE
facilities are inappropriate for the specialties offered and inadequate to the
number of students served; the poor maintenance practices of the limited
facilities, common to Yemeni schools in general, also result in a poor
learning environment. A major bottleneck is the absence of a master's program
in education that could train potential faculty. Because of these
shortcomings (addressed in more detail in Annex 4), teachers now being
certified in Yemen do not have the necessary training or background to teach
effectively in secondary schools. Furthermore, science education in schools
is of poor quality, in part because the education of teachers is inadequate
and in part because needed resources are not always available (Annex 5).
Finally, the shortage of Yemeni faculty in the FOEs and COEs hampers efforts
at improvement.
Using Existing Teacher Resources More Effectively
2.12     Teachers work most effectively when well managed by head teachers,
inspectors and other managerial personnel. Remedying acknowledged
shortcomings in school management requires upgrading the skills of teachers as
well as of school managers. To accomplish this, the existing in-service
training system needs to be improved, and new programs for training school
administrators and managerial personnel need to be established. Such
improvement programs would also have to extend to personnel in the provinces.
Yemen requires two types of in-service training for teachers, neither of which
is in adequate supply. All teachers need periodic upgrading of their
knowledge and skills. In addition, the approximately 15 percent of teachers



- 8 -
who lack formal qualifications need more extensive training. In the past, the
large number of foreign, temporary teachers reduced the Government's
willingness to invest in in-service training. Responsibility for in-service
activities is fragmented and uncoordinated at MOE (Annex 6); curricula are
inadequate; and no incentives exist for teachers to undertake in-service
training.
2.13     Currently there is no program to develop the skills of head teachers,
school principals, in-service trainers, inspectors or supervisors. Training
at this level requires faculty whose degrees are more advanced than those of
the teaching force. Providing such faculty, as well as faculty for preservice
teacher training, requires education beyond the bachelor's level. A major
bottleneck is the absence of a master's program in education in Yemen. Until
recently it was unrealistic to contemplate establ'"hing such a program because
so few qualified faculty were available and library and physical facilities
were inadequate. As a result of a systematic program to train educators
overseas, Yemen is now developing the critical mass necessary to establish a
graduate program.
Rationalizing Policies for Training and Strengthening Planning
2.14     Yemen's past policies governing teacher training have been shaped by
overwhelming shortages. Many positive incentives for prospective teachers
were introduced, including: (i) a release from military obligations; (ii)
free accommodations during training; (iii) monthly stipends for five years
(for a four-year program); (iv) assignment near a teacher's preferred
location; and (v) guaranteed employment for at least five years after
graduation. Free enrollment was allowed in student preferred speciality. As
requirements for secondary teachers in some specializations and in some
geographical locations are nearing saturation, the across-the-board
application of these incentives is becoming dysfunctional. Stipends must be
better targeted to ensure that needed groups, such as women and rural
teachers, are brought into the system. Furthermore, because the system in the
past has been driven by shortages, no effective mechanism has existed to plan
the number of graduates needed and their specialties. There has been no
incentive for the major agencies involved, MOE, the Ministry of Labor, the
Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform (MCSAR) and the new MOHE,
to collaborate on determining overall teacher needs and the needs for specific
specialties.
2.15     Recently, a new potential supply of recruits has emerged--university
graduates in other fields (besides education) who have appropriate substantive
training and are not finding jobs. A survey of recent graduates, conducted
during project preparation, indicated that about half of the respondents would
be interested in pursuing a teaching career. Paring these estimates to
eliminate students not in appropriate fields, and accounting for an upward
bias in the sample, it is reasonable to assume that about one quarter of the
approximately 4,000 graduates who will not qualify for other public sector
jobs would be available for a one-year ceacher-training program (para. 18 of
Annex 2).
2.16     A final shortcoming of the system is the relative absence of
practical information on where and how change should be introduced into the
education system. Effective problem solving is often preceded by action
research or pilot projects to experiment with innovative solutions to chronic



. 9 -
problems. In part due to investments in the Education Development and
Research Center (ERDC) (financed by Credit 1203-YAR) and in part due to
training undertaken by university staff, there is now a group of people in
Yemen with the skills to carry out such studies, but no mechanism yet exists
for identifying potentially useful studies or for supplying adequate funds.
C. Experience with Prior IDA Lending
In the Former YAR
2.17     IDA involvement in education and training in YAR began in 1973.  Of
the eight IDA-assisted projects in the education sector, with a total
financial commitment of US$84.1 million, four have been completed. The first
education project was signed in 1973; the most recent one in 1987. IDA
involvement has supported: primary teacher training with special emphasis on
women teachers; the development of skilled manpower through vocational
training, technician training and engineering education; the expansion of
nonformal education, particularly in rural areas; public administration
training; and the development of planning and research capabilities in MOE.
In the Former PDRY
2.18     Of the four IDA-assisted projects in the PDRY education sector, with
a total financial commitment of US$25.3 million, two have been completed and
two are nearing completion. The first education project was signed in 1975,
the most recent in 1984. IDA involvement has focussed on improving the
quality of formal education and providing vocational training and technical
education as a means to upgrade manpower skills and to help alleviate manpower
shortages and has included: training for primary teachers, vocational
instructors and rural extension personnel; curriculum and textbook
development; the development of school maintenance programs; and the
coordination of manpower training programs.
2.19     In spite of effectiveness and implementation delays resulting in slow
disbursements, the six ongoing projects (paras. 2.17-2.18) are generally
meeting their objectives and form a cohesive core of IDA-a.sisted projects in
the sector. The slow implementation experienced in some ongoing projects has
been due in large measure to delays in site selection, or subsequent changes
in sites, and delays in the preparation of tender documents and the award of
tenders. The problems of site selection are now being addressed prior to
appraisal. The problems with civil works contracts are, however, not merely
sectoral and are being addressed through departmentwide efforts.
Lessons Learned
2.20     The lessons learned from completed and ongoing projects, which have
been incorporated into the design of the proposed Project, are the following:
(i) special attention must be paid to civil works, especially the selection of
sites and the preparation and award of tenders, to avoid unacceptable delays
in project implementation. Assurances must be obtained that sites will be
available and tender documents will be prepared before project effectiveness;
(ii) building maintenance is deficient, and provisions must be made to eisure
the adequate maintenance of civil works; (iii) sustained attention must be



- 10 -
given to counterpart training to promote institutional development; (iv)
project designs should be flexible to allow for changes in piiorities; anid (v)
specific incentives should be used to attract women and residents of remote
areas into teaching.
D.  Government Strategy and Policy Dialogue with IDA
Ggvernment Strategy
2.21     The developmental strategy for the education sector of unified Yemen
is still under preparation.   In the interim, however, an agreement on prograws
common to both the North and the South forms the basis of the current
government strategy, with which IDA agrees.  These priorities, agreed duririg
unification, are, among others, manpower development, institution building and
administrative reform. This interim strategy includes: the improvement of
the quality, efficiency and coverage of basic and secondary education; the
eradication of adult illiteracy; the extension of educational opportunities to
rural areas and greater participation of women in employment (in the former
YAR); and the develG,mnent of an educational infrastructure capable of
supportin), and promoting skilled manpower development in key economic sectors.
The strat,gy emphasizes that strengthening teacher training, in particular
secondary teacher training, which suffers from poor quality and has received
little do or support, is a prerequisite for improving education in ROY.
IDA Strat gy
2.22       DA's lending strategy in the two Yemens has supported government
plans for establishing a modern education and training system and has been
closely a sociated with the development of appropriate sector policies. The
expansior and improvement of primary- and, subsequently, secondary-level
teacher t aining have been at the core of IDA assistance. This assistance
will cont nue and will increasingly focus on quality and efficiency concerns.
The Asso( ation will also assist the Government in improving the applicability
and cost- ffectiveness of other education and training programs (includiuig
public a( inistration) and in implementing greater targeting of stipends and
other in( atives. Accordingly, the specific objectives of IDA assistance to
the educ.  ion sector of Yemen are:  (i) to assist the Government in
strength( ing its institutional capacity to set sound policy and administer
programs  3 enhance the quality of school education; (ii) to develop a corps
of highl' qualified Yemeni teachers through efficient programs at all levels
of educai an; and (iii) to assist in alleviating key skills shortages in the
major ec( 3mic sectors by expandi'  and improving technical education and
vocation.   training.  Work towar   -laborating a more durable framework for
IDA assi  ance to the newly merg,  country is being conducted through an
educatiox sector study initiated in December 1990. This study focuses on the
complexii es of unifying the two different systems in the North and the South,
as well . on the impact of the returning migrants on the education sector;
the stud, will recommend a strategy and policy framework for the long-term
developmE t of the sector.

111. THIE PROJECT
3.01     The proposed Project was requested by the Government in July 1989.
Three missions visited ROY:  two preparation missions in November 1989 and
March 1990, a preappraisal mission in July 1990, and an appraisal mission in
December 1990.
A. Proiect Objectives
3.02     The overall aim of the Project is to improve secondary school
teaching while creating a basis for quality improvement through upgrading the
cadre of teachers, making better use of the teacher resource and planning for
future improvements. The Project has three objectives: (i) to increase the
number of well-qualified Yemeni teachers; (ii) to improve the effectiveness of
the way teachers are employed in the classroom; and (iii) to improve the
mechanisms for planning, coordinating and monitoring the training and
deployment of secondary school teachers, as well as for introducing
innovations in the teaching system.
B. Policy Framework
3.03     Achieving the Project objective of enhancing teacher resources and
their utilization at the secondary level depends on achieving better
coordination among the relevant agencies and on adopting appropriate policies
to ensure this coordination. The Government has agreed to establish a
coordinating structure for teacher training and development (described in
paras. 3.18-3.19 and detailed in Annex 7). The expected benefits from
coordination are that: (i) enrollments in FOEs and COEs would not exceed the
capacity of the institutions to provide good quality education; (ii) the mix
of specializations studied would match those needed by secondary schools;
(iii) effective use would be made of the one-year teacher training program
designed for university graduates who specialized in fields other than
education; (iv) stipends and other incentives would be targeted to meet
existing shortages; and (v) the recruitment of women to be trained and to
serve teachers would be facilitated.
C. Project Scope
3.04     Project activities designed to meet the principal objectives are as
follows:
(a)  To increase the number of well-qualified Yemeni teachers, especially
women and teachers in rural areas, the Project would finance civil
works, furniture, equipment, education software, program support and
technical assistance to: (i) reorient the curricular offerings of the
regular four-year program at six FOEs/COEs through curriculum and
textbook development (paras. 3.07 and 3.09); (ii) establish a one-
year program at the FOEs at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah to certify non-



- 12 -
education university graduates for secondary-level teaching (para.
3.08); (iii) establish a master's degree program in education at .he
Sana'a FOE that would train primary- and secondary-level teacher
trainers (para. 3.10); (iv) improve science and environmental
education by establishing Science Resource Centers (SRC) and by
developing low cost demonstration equipment (para. 3.11); and (v)
improve physical facilities with new construction at the Sana'a, Taiz
and Hodeidah FOEs; renovations at the Sana'a and Taiz FOEs and at the
Aden COE; and hostel construction for women at the Sana'a, Taiz, and
Hodeidah FOEs and renovation of the women's hostel at COE Aden
(paras. 3.12-3.15).
(b)  To improve the effectiveness of classroom teaching, the Project would
finance civil works, equipment, education software, program support
and technical assistance to: (i) establish an In-service Training
Institute (ITI) at MOE (para. 3.16); and (ii) reorganize and
strengthen the national network for in-service training (para. 3.17).
The master's program mentioned above would further this aim by also
training administrators and other key education personnel.
(c)  To improve governmental mechanisms for Rlanning, coordinating and
monitoring the training and deployment of secondary school teachers,
as well as for introducing innovations in the teaching system, the
Project would finance technical assistance and purchase minor
equipment to: (i) support the work of the Advisory Group for Trained
Manpower and its committees (paras. 3.18-3.19); (ii) administer a
fund to finance development projects designed to investigate
educational improvements at the school level (para. 3.20); (iii)
study tertiary education (para. 3.21); and (iv) strengthen the
University Project Unit (UPU) (para. 3.22).
3.05     The new facilities financed by the Project, together with the
renovation of existing facilities, would allow an annual output of
approximately 3,800 new teachers each year: 2,900 from four-year programs and
900 from the one-year programs at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah. Table 3.1
summarizes the new student places to be constructed, the renovation of
existing student places and student places for which only the provision of
equipment, furniture and materials would be supported.

attending 4- to 8-.week in-service training programs.  An output of 640
per year implies that the entire key personnel of MOE could be given
training in about eight years through one four-week program.
D. Project Components
3.06     The Project objectives would be met by six components, four to be
implemented under the direction of the Sana'a FOE and two by MOE. Detailed
descriptions of the components are provided in paras. 3.07-3.22.
Support for Four- and One-Year Secondary Teacher Training Programs
3.07     Four-Year Program.  The courses prescribed by the current education
curriculum at FOEs are oriented toward theoretical knowledge about education
rather than toward developing teacher competencies; they include the mastery
of subject matter, effective teaching techniques, and classroom management
(para. 2.11; para. 8 of Annex 3). A curriculum improvement process would be
developed for implementation at all FOEs and at the Aden COE. The process



- 14 -
would be carried ouit I;,,  (aCuri iculum Development Committee to be appointed by
the deans of thesm F()EO,/COE.  Tlhe process would involve: (i) an assessment of
the effectiveness of the ctui-rent course offerings and the curricular needs of
the systemn aid tlie studelLts; (ii) the subsequent organization of seminars to
disseminate the results of thie assessment; and (iii) a revision of education
courses, esp(cially t'lose that develop the specific competencies and skills
needed by secondary school teachers.  The Project would finance a nleeds-
assessmient study, seminars and workshops for curriculum development, and other
related activities not currently financed by the regular FOE budget, estimated
at US$60,000.  Eighteeni staff-monlths of specialist services in curriculum
development, six stafi-monlths of specialist services in laboratory technician
training and 136 staff-months of fellowships in curriculum development,
library management and o.-ctoral studies are provided under this component. In
addition, 5/6 staff-months of fellowships would be included for master's
degrees in science education. These provisions would also meet the needs of
the new one-year progiam.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the Government thiat enrollments at each FOE/COE would be limited to respective
capacities to ensure effective and efficient training.
3.08     One-Year Program.  To recruit into teaching available university
graduates, and thereby accelerate the "Yemenization" of the teacher corps, a
new one-year certification program (para. 15 of Annex 3) would be established
at the FOEs at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah. These cities have, at present, many
unemployed graduates who would qualify, and the number of these graduates will
increase in the future. Expected enrollments at Sana'a (630), Taiz (270) and
Hodeidah (90) would produce about 900 new teachers annually. The program
would focus on developing teaching skills and would make use if the textbooks
of the regular, four-year program (para. 3.09). During negotiations, the
Government reconfirmed its policy requiring certification through the one-
year program for all noneducation university graduates seeking regular
teaching appointments at the secondary level.
3.09     Textbooks.  To alleviate the shortage of high-quality textbooks in
education (para. 2.11; para. 9 of Annex 3), the Project would support a
textbook development scheme.  To manage this scheme, a Textbook Development
Committee (TDC) involving all FOEs would be established. Textbooks in
priority areas, including one on environmental sciences, would be selected
from regional and interniational publishers for translation or adaptation to
local, teacher-training needs, The resulting new editions would be printed
through the University's Book Unit, an organization with experience in the
international procuremnent of books and other university-level instructional
materials. The new books would be made available for sale at cost. The
Project would finance the review and selection of about 12 textbook titles,
the purchase of rights to translate or adapt the textbook titles selected, the
translation or adaptation contracts and the pilot testing of new materials,
all estimated at about US$245,000. To assist FOEs in the establishment of the
new textbook scheme, the negotiationis for the acquisition of the above
publication rights and the development of editorial skills, the Project would
provide 12 staff-months of international expert services and 12 staff-months
of short-term felle,ships to train the TDC members.  During negotiations
assurances were obtained from the Government that established international
practices would be observed in the translation or adaptation of copyrighted
textbooks.

nuirher of academic credits.  Thie program, starting in 1992, would Initially
admit 2,0 studeints, mostly FOE staff, and would gradually expand to an expected
output of about 50 graduates annually. The Project would Linance all costs
related to the design of the master's program through the twinning arrangement
(US$150,000), physical facilities, equipment and materials (books, journals,
software), arnd techinical assistance (64 staff-months of international expert
services for program design and initial operation, and 12 staff-years of
fellowships for doctoral studies, would be provided). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that the program would follow a
credit-based system.
Science Education Program
3.11     To provide the foundation for a technically competent and productive
Yemeni society, the Project would assist in raising the quality of science
teaching and learning (para. 2.11; paras. 11-12 of Annex 3) in FOEs, COEs, and
secondary schoo'- by: (i) establishing five SRCs, with the provision of
appropriate eauipment, software and other materials including scientific
periodicals at Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah FOEs, the Aden COE and at the MOE
curriculum unit; (ii) building, furnishing and equipping laboratories for
teaching biology, physics and chemistry at the FOEs at Sana'a, Taiz and
Hodeidah and at the Aden COE; (iii) bu4lding and equipping science method
laboratories (two in Sana'a, one each at Aden, Taiz and Hodeidah); (iv)
initiating a science workshop program that would develop classroom
demonstrations based on the curriculum and using locally available materials;
the workshop program would be provided with 14 staff-months of short-term
consultants, 15 staff-months of brief study tours, and materials development
and seminar and publication costs estimated at US$120,000; (v) supporting
secondary-level science curriculum development, including environmental
sciences, through 12 staff-months of specialist services and 36 .itaff-months
of fellowship training at curriculum centerb abroad, to familiarize Yemeni
science educators with current teaching innovations and anproaches.  (See
Annex 5 for details.) Further, to upgrade the capabil4y of Yemeni science
educators at the FOEs, fellowships at the master's level would also be
provided (para. 3.07).
Expansion of Facilities
3.12     Facilities at FOEs and the COE are inadequate to meet enrollment
targets. About 13,000 enrollees are required to produce 2,900 graduates from
the four-year programs, as well as 900 from the one-year programs (para.
2.10), as shown in Table 3.1. The Project would support the construction and
renovation of the various FOEs/COE, as shown in Table 3.2. Physical
facilities to be provided include lecture i-oas for 60 and 30 students;
science, psychology and language labs: compute.- labs, worikshops and audio



- 16 -
visual ro(.mns; library and scienice resource center facilities; faculty offices;
teacher anid student facilities and a cafeteria.  Furniture and equipment would
be provided for all student places at the four FOEs/COE.  Also, FOEs at Ibb
and Hij jabl w(uld receive equipmnent to bring their laboratory and other
taci litits up to standard.
3.13     Present phvsical facilities (building, site development, equipment,
furniture) are insufficient, quantitatively as well as qualltatively (para.
2.11; para. 10 of Aninex 3). Therefore, to support the educational activities
effectively, the physical facilities at the Sana'a and Taiz FOEs and at the
Aden COE. would be renovated to acceptable standards. In addition, support
would also be provided to maintain buildings, equipment and furniture.
3.14     Of special concern is the recruitment of women to teach in rural
schools (para. 2.07). To strengthen the capacity of the FOEs to recruit and
train women in the field of education, hostels would be built on tlle campuses
of Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah to house approximately 800 female students.
Existing hostel facilities in Aden for 240 women students would also be
renovated. The provision of dormitories is expected to increase female
enrollment at the FOEs by about 50 percent.
3.15     New civil works would be designed by an international architectural
consulting firm with the participation of professional staff from UPU. To
accelerate the civil works design, funds of up to US$400,000 from allocations
made to the Sana'a FOE in the ongoing Teacher Training Project (Credit 1773-
YAR) would be made available.

the continued development of the teachers and administrators responsible for
secondary instruction, an ITI would be established in Sana'a under the aegis
of the Deputy Minister for Teacher Training. ITI would be vested with the

evaluat ion (student, teacher, prograni, school), guidance and counseling and
education.al research for personis inI key positions, e.g., head teachers,
headinasters, in-servict trainers, inspectors and supervisors (para. 2.13).
Through a twinniinlg arrangement estimated to cost US$100,000, a university or
traininlg, institution ovtrseas wou.. provide advice, participate in program
design and curriculum development and maintain a long-term professional
relationsthip withl ITI.  The Project would support the construction of new
facilities for the ITI at Sana'a, with a hostel for about 100 trainees,
including 30 places for women. Requisite equipment, furniture and library
facilities would also be provided. To facilitate the assessment of training
needs, the development of training programs, the preparation of training
materials and the upgrading of training skills of ITI staff, the Project would
provide 25 staff-months of specialist services and 32 staff-years of
fellowship training.  During negotiations, the Government provided assurances
that the creation of ITI, with an autonomous structure, would be effected by
March 1992.
3.17     In-service Training Network.  To optimize the efforts of various MOE
agencies involved in in-service training, the Project would support the
establishment of an in-service training network consisting of regional
centers, which would integrate the planning and delivery of in-service
training (para. 2.12; para. 2 of Annex 6). ITI would serve as the headquarters
of this network, and all groups involved in in-service training--supervisors,
inspectors, FOEs, regional centers--would be involved in the planning of
training activities. The Project would provide equipment and furniture to
regional training centers and to regional supervision directorates. The
specialist services and fellowship training outlined in para. 3.16 would
assist in strengthening the network as well.
Improvements in Planning and Management
3.18     Interministerial Coordination.  Better coordination is needed among
the agencies that review the effectiveness of current policies, formulate new
policies and prepare programs to meet teacher shortages. The Government has,
therefore, agreed to draw on the resources of the newly established Ministry
of Human Resources Development, headed by the Deputy Prime Minister, and an
education committee in MOE to establish the following: (i) an Advisory Group
for Trained Manpower (AGTM), chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister for Manpower
Development; (ii) an education subcommittee, chaired by the Minister of
Education; and (iii) a secretariat or working group, chaired by the Deputy
Minister for General Education. (See Annex 7 for details.)
3.19     The main purpose of the AGTM would be to review the requirements for                X
trained manpower on an annual basis and to provide direction to the tertiary
education system in meeting these needs. The AGTM, through the education
subcommittee and with technical support from the working group and the
establishment of a management information system (MIS) in MOE, would (i) agree
annually on appropriate enrollments in the universities to meet national
teacher needs, by subject specialties; (ii) adopt or recommend to the Cabinet

mentioned, or a simil,tr coordiniat ing, structure to formulate and review
policies withlinl which the 1'roject would function; the terms of reference and
the membership of both the Education Subcommittee and the working group would
be sent to IDA for coLn:lvnt,.
3.20    yDevlopmept l'roject Fund.  To enhance the ability of MOE to respond
to emerging needs in the field, a small Development Project Fund for
educational practitioners would be established (para. 2.16, Annex 8). The
fund t-nuld support projects that focus on the problems facing education in
Yemen. More practically oriented development projects would test new ideas
for solving problems at the school or community level, such as how to improve
curriculum and teaching methods and administrative and academic supervision;
fostering community participation in school maintenance; and lessen the social
problems women teachers confront (Annex 8). Policy direction for the fund
would rest with a High Supervision Committee, which has already been
established, chaired by the Deputy Minister for Inspection and Evaluation.
The committee includes representatives from relevant MOE directorates, the
ERDC supported under Credit 1203-YAR), and the FOE at Sana'a. The work of the
committee would be carried out by a secretariat housed in ERDC and would be
chaired by the Vice Director of ERDC. Development projects would be proposed
to or directly identified by this committee and either advertised for
competition or assigned for execution to qualified individuals or groups. The
projects would be selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) the
relevance to the Yemeni situation: (ii) the involvement of both professionals
and practitioners; and (iii) the potential for adaptation to other sites. The
secretariat would carry out the day-to-day work and would monitor ongoing
projects. It would also plan and hold an annual conference on educational
innovation at which researchers would present their findings to a Yemeni
audience. The Project would provide financing for about 20 small development
projects and for organizing the conferences at an estimated cost of about
US$250,000. During .iegotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that projects would be selected according to agreed criteria and that all
projects costing more than US$10,000 would be sent to IDA for comment.
3.21     Tertiary Education Study.  A team comprising a Yemeni researcher (12
staff-months) and a foreign consultant (6 staff-months), under the direction
of the Vice Rector of the University of Sana'a, would assess the tertiary
education needs in light of emerging developmental priorities. The study
would examine the employment records of graduates from tertiary institutions
and the relevance of their specialties to labor market needs and would then
make recommendations for the long-term development of tertiary education.
Tetrms of reference, agreed to by the Government, are in Lnnex 9. During
negotiatiens, assurances were obtained from the Governmnent that the study
would he completed bv Januarv 1994, and a joint review would be conducted to

IV.  PRVJ)E.Tr COSTS. FINANCING. AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Costs
4.01     The total baseline cost of the proposed Project is YRl 349.5 million,
or US$29.1 million equivalent, and is based on the prcposals submitted by FOEs
and the MOE estimated at US$70.0 million. With contingencies of US$6.0
million equivalent, the total project cost is estimated at US$35.1 million
equivalent. A summary of project costs and foreign exchange requirements (65
percent) by component is given in Table 4.1. A summary of project costs by
category of expenditure is given ir Table 4.2. The costs include US$9.3
million equivalent expected to be financed by the OPEC Fund.
Cost Estimates
4.02     Estimated civil works costs for the Project were based on a review of
recent bids received by MOE for comparable architectural standards. The Gulf
crisis has resulted in construction cost increases of up to 20 percent,
bringing costs to about US$460 per square meter. The cost of renovating
facilities to bring them up to acceptable standards varies from about US$92
per square meter at the FOE Sana'a to about US$230 per square meter at the
Aden hostel for women. Furniture costs for new facilities and equipment were
estimated at 9 percent and 11 percent of construction costs, respectively. In
buildings to be renovated, furniture and equipment cost estimates ranged from
20 percent of the cost of new furniture and equipment at the Sana'a FOE to
100 percent of new costs at the Aden hostel. Professional fees were
calculated as a percentage of construction cost, including site development:
8 percent for new buildings and 12 percent for renovated buildings. Base cost
estimates reflect prices at the time of negotiations.

Customs Duties and Taxes
4.03     Project costs iniclude an estimated US$1.6 million in indirect taxes
on locally procured civil works and goods. Equipment and goods imported
directly for use by govertunent ministries are exempt from duties and taxes.
Contingency Allowances
4.04     Project costs include a physical contingency allowance of 7 percent
of the estimated costs of civil works, furniture, equipment and materials.
They also include price contingencies of 13.4 percent calculated for the
period beginning at negotiations and in accordance with an agreed
implementation schedule (Annex 10). Estimated annual price increases are
given below.
Table 4.3: ESTIMATED ANNUAL PRICE INCREASES

Foreign Costs           3.4          3.4          3.4          3.4
Foreign Exchange ComPonent
4.05     The foreign exchange component has been estimated as follows: (i)
construction and refurbishment of existing facilities, 60 percent; (ii)
furniture 85 percent; (iii) equipment 85 percent; (iv) specialist services 85
percent; and (v) fellowships 95 percent. These percentages have been
determined on the assumption that: most construction material would be
imported; all equipment and furniture would be imported; and all prvject-
financed specialists would be foreign due to the shortage of qualified Yemenis
in teacher training. The resultant foreign exchange component of the Project,
including contingencies, is estimated at US$22.6 million equivalent, or about
65 percent of total project costs.
Recurrent Costs
4.06     The incremental recurrent costs (YR1 25.0 million equivalent, or 0.02
percent of the MOE recurrent budget) would mainly cover the salaries of the
incremental Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff and the operation and
maintenance cost of equipment and buildings. When fully operational, the
annual maintenance costs and the costs of consumables are estimated to be
US$0.5 and US$0.4 million, respectively. Savings, however, would be realized
from: (i) reduced enrollments in four-year programs; (ii) the training of
noneducation graduates; (iii) the gradual replacement of expatriate teachers;
and (iv) revisions in stipend policies, which offset these increases (Annex
11). To ensure the maintenance of facilities, a sectorwide issue in Yemen,



- 22 -
the Project wouild suppor,t 30 percent of recurrent costs otl maintenance (para.
3.13).  These costs (US$0.5 million) would be incurred during the last three
years of the Project'c; life and( are not, therefore, being financed on a
declining basis.  During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that adequate budgetarv allocations for the maintenance of
buildings, equipment and furniture (US$0.5 million equivalent), and amounts
satisfactorv to IDA for the purchase of consumables would be made by the
Government.
B. Proect Financing
4,07     The proposed credit of US$19.4 million and OPEC Fund cofinancing
(civil works, equipment, furniture and professional fees for the Taiz FOE and
the Aden COE) of US$9.3 million equivalent would finance 100 percent of the
foreign exchange component (US$22.6 million) of the Project and 49 percent of
the local costs (US$12.5 million). The Government would finance 51 percent of
local costs, which amount to US$6.4 million (18 percent of the total project
cost). The signing of a cofinancing agreement with the OPEC Fund would be a
condition for effectiveness. The proposed financing plan is summarized below.

/a Professional services for Sana'a FOE civil works (not included in
above plan) estimated at US$400,000 would be financed from the
ongoing Teacher Training Project (Credit 1773-YAR).
C. Proiect Implementation
Implementation Period
4.08     The construction, furnishing and equipping of all FOE and MOE
facilities, as well as the completion of the Project's TA component, are



- 23 -
scheduled to be accomnplished by June 30, 1998 (Annex 10). In order to allow
sufficient time for the submission of withdrawal applications, the closing
date would be December 31, 1998. Comprehensive implementation plans for each
component, developed with the respective implementation agencies, are attached
to Annex 10.
ProJect Management
4.09     The Deputy Minister of Education and the Vice Rector of the
University of Sana'a would have responsibility for the implementation of their
respective project components.
4.10     University Components.  The Vice Rector of the University of Sana'a
has designated a senior staff member as project coordinator to manage day-to-
day operations. Professional services for the design and construction of the
civil works component would be provided by the UPU responsible for the
construction and maintenance of university buildings. UPU would be
strengthened by the appointment of a project director, an accountant, a
procurement specialist and a bilingual secretary to oversee the proper
implementation of FOE components. During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that full-time UPU staff would be maintained with
organization, staffing and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.
4.11     MOE Components.  The day-to-day operations of project implementation,
including the preparation of construction tender documents, the supervision of
construction and the procurement of equipment and TA for the MOE components
would be handled by the Project Implementation Unit at MOE, which has
extensive experience in project implementation. The Minister of Education has
designated the Deputy Minister for Educational Planning as project coordinator
to oversee implementation under the supervision of the Minister.
Status of Preparation
4.12     Technical Assistance.  Terms of reference and the implementation
schedule for TA agreed during appraisal as a collaborative effort with the
University and the MOE are summarized in Annex 12.
4.13     Sites.  With respect to the expansion of FOEs, new sites would not be
necessary since civil works would be carried out for existing buildings. The
site for ITI in Sana'a has been acquired at the Higher Education Complex,
Sana'a.
4.14     Architectural Designs.  The professional services for architectural
structural designs, and for the supervision of the construction of the
university component, would be carried out by foreign consultants, with the
participation of professional UPU staff (para. 3.15), and would be supported
from funds from the Teacher Training project (Credit 1773-YAR). Preliminary
sketches of Sana'a and Taiz facilities have been reviewed and revisions have
been proposed by IDA. The professional services for the civil works of the
MOE components would be carried out by the existing well-staffed PIU of the
Ministry. Construction drawings for both components are well under way. A
shortlist of six design consultants has been submitted and reviewed by IDA.



- 24 -
4.15     Eguipment and Furniture Lists.  Preliminary furniture and equipment
lists for FOEs and for ITI were submitted for IDA review and were found to be
satisfactory.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
4.16     Procurement.  Procurement arrangements are summarized in the
following table.

Credit.
/a Of which US$6.4 million for civil works, US$2.2 million for equipment
and furniture and US$0.7 million for professional services would be
provided by the OPEC Fund under OPEC procurement procedures.
/b Consists of curriculum studies, seminars, twinning arrangements, etc.
4.17     Civil works contracts (amounting to US$12.1 million including
contingencies) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding (ICB). All civil works contracts would be of less than two years
duration. Detailed lists and specifications of equipment and furniture based
on preliminary lists already identified would be presented to IDA for review
and approval prior to procurement. Equipment and furniture items (amounting



- 25 -
to US$3.3 million) would be grouped, to the extent possible, in large packages
to permit bulk procurement. Packages in excess of US$50,000 would be procured
through ICB in accordance with the May 1985 Bank Guidelines. Readily
available off-the-shelf goods of not more than US$50,000 in value could be
procured through prudent shopping, based on prices quoted by at least three
suppliers. These items would not exceed a total of US$0.4 million.
4.18     For the purpose of comparing foreign and local bids under ICB,
qualifying domestic manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference
equal to the existing rate of custom luties on competing imports for nonexempt
importers, or up to 15 percent of CIF price, whichever is lower. Prior IDA
approval of procurement documentation and contract award recommendation would
be required for all equipment awarded through ICB and for all civil works.
4.19     To ensure the timely and efficient implementation of technical
assistance, MOE and the university would procure specialist services and
fellowships through a comprehensive technical assistance contract. Portions
of TA agreed through twinning arrangements with international universities or
other institutions (paras. 3.10 and 3.16) would be excluded from the package.
The conditions for twinning arrangements and the TORs and qualifications of
experts to be selected were agreed during appraisal. Three to six
institutions would be requested to submit proposals, following a shortlisting
of institutions acceptable to the Association on the basis of the "Guidelines
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the Bank as
Executing Agency." During negotiations,
4.20        Disbursements.  Disbursements would be made against:
(a) 80 percent of total expenditure on civil works;
(b) equipment, furniture, books and educational materials:
(i)    100 percent of foreign expenditure on directly imported
items;
(ii)   100 percent of local ex-factory expenditure for locally
manufactured items; and
(iii) 85 percent of expenditures for locally procured items;
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditure and 90 percent of local
expenditures on specialist services (including professional
services) training and fellowships;
(d) program support:
(i)    100 percent of foreign expenditure on twinning arrangements;
(ii)   85 percent of local expenditure; and
(e) 30 percent of expenditure on maintenance of civil works and
equipment.



- 26 -
4.21        As shown in Annex 13, the proposed credit would be disbursed over
a period of seven years, which conforms to the current country disbursement
profile. Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 31, 1998.
4.22        Special Accounts.  Withdrawal applications against contracts for
civil works, goods and services, exceeding US$50,000 equivalent would be
supported by normal documentation. Disbursements against contracts below that
level and travel, subsistence, operation and maintenance would be made on the
basis of statements of expenditures, available for examination by IDA
missions. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government would
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA, a Special Account for the university and MOE with the Central Bank of
Yemen to which IDA would make an initial deposit, equivalent to about US$1.0
million. The Special Account would be replenished against monthly withdrawal
applications when the undisbursed balance of the account fell below an amournt
equal to 50 percent or less of the Special Account.  During negotiations, the
borrower provided assurances that this account would be established and
operated according to IDA guidelines.
4.23        Proiect Accounts.  The university and MOE would keep separate
accounts for project expenditures in accordance with accounting principles and
practices acceptable to IDA.  In accordance with the practice under ongoing
education projects, these accounts and the Special Account would be audited
annually by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA, and copies of the
audited statements would be sent to IDA within six months of the end of the
fiscal year. During negotiations, the borrower provided assurances that these
audit conditions would be met.
E. Monitoring and Supervision
4.24        Mid-term Review.  Although the Project has been carefully designed
to meet existing secondary teacher training needs, circumstances in Yemen
require some flexibility to adjust the Project to change. Major developments
as a result of unification, the ongoing analysis of teacher needs and the
Government's concern to hasten the process of Yemenizing the teaching force
may have an impact on project activities. Therefore, it was agreed thiat a
mid-term review of the Project would be undertaken jointly by the Government
and IDA before June 30, 1993. This review would take stock of progress and
constraints and, if necessary, adjust project objectives, components and fund
allocations. During negotiations, the borrower provided assurances that this
review would be conducted by June 30, 1993.
4.25        Supervision Plan.  A project launch mission is planned to commence
after credit signing. The proposed Project is the first covering the
Universities of Sana'a and Aden. Because the Sana'a UPU is new, an average of
at least 12 staff-weeks per year would be necessary to allow biannual
supervision to monitor the critical project activities given in Annex 14.
These supervision missions would include a teacher training specialist with
experience in in-service training, a science education specialist, in addition
to the task manager, to monitor program development and delivery.  Generally,
one supervision per year would include an architect and a textbook development
specialist.  The respective project units under the university and MOE would
be in charge of preparing documents for IDA supervision missions.

V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
5.01        By the year 2000, because of more qualified teachers and better
classroom teaching, higher student achievement is expected. Through the
emphasis on training women teachers from rural areas supported by appropriate
incentives and policies (paras. 3.03 and 3.19), the Project would be expected
to improve access to education for girls and children in rural areas.
Finally, the focus on science education would improve Yemen's capability to
develop human resources in key economic sectors. More specifically, the main
benefits expected to accrue from implementation of the proposed Project are as
follows:
(a)    Qualitative Improvements.  Improvements in the quality of school
education would result from: (i) more effective school
administration, classroom teaching, inspection and supervision
facilitated by the training of some 640 MOE staff annually at ITI
(para. 3.16); (ii) the improvement of the skills of some 50 key
technical staff of MOE, through well focused training, in the
areas of student assessment, and instructional resources and
textbook development (para. 3.16); (iii) a more practical
orientation to the teacher training curricula (para. 3.07)
implemented in improved facilities (paras. 3.12-15) with access to
better books and educational resources (para. 3.09); and (iv) the
Yemenization of the teaching force by the late 1990s (Table 1 of
Annex 1). The Yemenization of the teaching force would also
contribute to savings in foreign exchange; if the proportion of
expatriate teachers were to remain the same, this cost (now US$80
million) would increase to US$160 million by 1999 (para. 2.04).
(b)    Institutional Development.  Diverting noneducation graduates to
teaching (para. 3.08) would constitute an efficient utilization of
the country's human resources and provide a viable alternative to
adjusting teacher supply according to changing needs. The
establishment of an inuerministerial coordinating structure to
monitor teacher supply and demand (para. 3.18), the development of
an MIS in MOE (para. 3.19) and the review of stipend and
recruitment policies for teachers (para. 3.03) would help
coordinate development efforts for the sector. Furthermore,
instituting the development projects (para. 3.20) would insure
planning, innovation and change in education through the
cooperative efforts of academics and practitioners. National
policies for enhancing quality might then be based on successful
pilots. Successful pilots coordinated with institutional capacity
for planning change, would be useful in the design of Lhe quality
enhancement project scheduled for the FY93 program. Finally, the
establishment of ITI and the design of a training system network
(para. 3.17) would create a national capacity to develop MOE staff
and teachers, which would continue to serve the needs of Yemen
much beyond the life of the Project.



28 -
(c)   Environment.  The proposed Project has been classified as "C" for
environmental assessment. Components that enhance environmental
benefits include: (i) curriculum and textbook development in
environmental science for the four-year teacher training program
(para. 3.09); and (ii) the review of the environmental component
in the science education program (para. 3.11).
B. Risks
5.02        The proposed Project has two potential risks.  The first risk
concerns the capacity of the university system in ROY to plan and implement
reforms in teacher training. This risk is mitigated by the establishment of
an interministerial coordinating structure, the secretariat in MOE, to provide
a supportive policy framework for teacher training and deployment (para.
3.19), the careful design of TA (para. 4.12), the training of project
implementation staff (para. 3.22) and the support to FOEs through twinning
arrangements with similar institutions abroad (para. 3.10). The second risk
concerns the slow implementation of projects, particularly civil works, caused
by delays in site selection, in the pr-pnaration of tender documents and in the
award of tenders. This risk has been minimized by ensuring site selection
during appraisal (para. 4.13) and ensuring that the architectural designs of
civil works are well under way (para. 3.15).
C. Sustainability
5.03        The Project has been carefully designed to ensure sustainability
beyond the life of the Project. The infrastructure being put in place would
continue to contribute to the development of education in Yemen over the next
several decades, with affordable recurrent costs. The physical facilities at
FOEs and COE have been designed to meet the expected annual requirement for
teachers after expatriate teachers have been replaced, and the rate of
expansion has slowed to a more sustainable level. Should some overcapacity
emerge because of circumstances not foreseen, the buildings have been designed
with sufficient flexibility to meet other university needs. While incremental
recurrent costs for operation and maintenance are expected to rise by about
YRI 25.0 million annually (para. 4.06), these would be offset by decreasing
expenditures for stipends as the number of students decreases and as better
targeting of stipends is adopted. The mechanism established for
interministerial coordination, if it functions as planned, would provide for
annual examinations and the reformulation of policies to assure that they are
attuned to continually changing needs and circumstances.
D. Project Monitoring
5.04        The critical activities in the implementation of the Project and
their expected dates of completion would serve as bases for implementation
monitoring and are summarized in Annex 14 (please see also Annex 10).

VI. ACTIONS AGREED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Goverrunent
that:
(a) the enrollment at each FOE/COE would be limited to its respective
capacity (para. 3.07);
(b) all noneducation graduates seeking teaching appointments at secondary
level schools would require certification through the one-year
program (para. 3.08);
(c) established international practices would be observed in the
translation or adaptation of copyrighted textbooks (para. 3.09);
(d) the structure of the master's program would be based on a credit
system (para. 3.10);
(e) the proposed autonomous organization structure of ITI would be
finalized by March 1992 (para. 3.16);
(f) a coordinating structure, following principles agreed at
negotiations, would be established by March 1992 to formulate and
review policies within which the Project would function; TORs and the
membership of the education subcommittee would be sent to IDA for
comment; this structure and its functioning would be carefully
assessed as part of each annual review (para. 3.19);
(g) all development projects would be selected according to agreed
criteria and all projects costing more than US$10,000 would be sent
to IDA for comment (para. 3.20);
(h) the Tertiary Education Study would be completed by January 1994, and
the report would be sent to IDA for comment; a joint review would be
conducted by the university and the Association to discuss the
conclusions of the report and prepare a timetable for implementing
agreed recommendations (para. 3.21);
(i) adequate annual budgetary allocations for the maintenance of
buildings, equipment (US$0.5 million equivalent) and the purchase of
consumables (satisfactory to IDA) would be made by the Govv nment;
allocations and their utilization would be reviewed annually (para.
4.06);
(j) both MOE and the university would finalize TA procurement contracts
by March 1992 (para. 4.19);
(k) the Government would maintain a special account for FOEs and MOE on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, and this special account
would be operated according to IDA guidelines (para. 4.22);
(1) all project accounts, including the special account, would be audited
by persons acceptable to IDA and in accordance with appropriate
auditing rules and practice within six months of the end of each



30 -
fiscal year, the government will provide IDA with certified copies of
the project accounts and an audit report of such scope and detail as
IDA may reasonably request (para. 4.23); and
(m) a joint mid-term review of the Project would be completed by January
30, 1994 by the Government and the Association (para. 4.24).
6.02     Condition of Effectiveness.  The signing of a cofinancing agreement
with the OPEC Fund would be a condition for project effectiveness (para.
4.07).
6.03     Subject to the above conditions, the Project would provide a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of SDR 13.5 million equivalent to the Government of
ROY.

The Education Syvtem
1.    The educational systems of YAR and PDRY are still in the process of
adjustment and preparation for actual unification. Below are issues from each
that are pertinent to the Secondary Teacher Training Project.
The Former Yemen Arab Republic (YAR)
2.        Student Enrollments.  Prior to 1962, schools were limited to major
townls and open only to male students. The rapid expansion of the Yemeni
educational system has given access to unprecedented numbers of students in
the span of two decades. Girls' access to primary education, which was
practically nonexistent at the time of the Revolution, now encompasses 23
percent of the age group, and female participation rates have increased from
5 percent to 22 percent since 1965. As the education budget increased,
enrollments nearly cioubled every five years (Table 2). Particularly dramatic
was the increase in secondary education enrollments, which had a total of
1,800 students in 1965.
3.       Rapid expansion has had some costs.  Given current rates of
enrollment increases, it is projected that the system will have 2.65 million
students by the academic year 2000-01. These additional students will mean
that large numbers of teachers and schools will be needed, school maintenance,
textbooks, inspectors, as well as more stupervisors and equipment. Since the
Government is justifiably reluctant to build schools without Yemeni teachers
to staff them, there is a scarcity of schools, leading to schools with two
shifts and to student-teacher ratios of 53 percent in urban areas. Many
schools are in need of repairs (e.g., 36 percent of primary schools) and lack
necessary sanitation facilities. Only 25 percent of primary schools have
water connections. Multigrade classrooms are frequent in rurp.-. primary
schools, although teachers are not adequately prepared to hdndle them, and
appropriate materials do not exist for students or for teachers.
4.        Although greatly increased, secondary-level female participation is
limited to urban areas; female secondary-level students were only about 31,000
in 1988-89 (Table 3). One significant reason for low female enrollments in
the secondary level is the fact that few girls' schools exist (43 preparatory
and 16 upper secondary), and only 178 postprimary teachers were female in
1988-89. If the numbers of female teachers increase, female enrollments might
increase to a greater extent than currently projected.
5.        Educational Management.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been
responsible for the training and deployment af teachers, the development of
curricula and instructional materials, examinations, inspections and
educational planning. Some ministry responsibiiities are delegated to

. " r i..,howeverl, are strai ned by the influx of students.  A Ministry of
Iii   ,  icit i on (MOHlE) was established sthortly after unification, and now has
c;nidir- ioni over the Faculties of Education (FOE).
O        The expansion of the education system (Table 2) has strained the
oI:iIi     .ti v  mach i nery of MOE, of local governments and of schools
tyQ1vt'.  A shortage of schiool principals exists, in part because few
tQc'cicVls (preferably Yemeni) can be found with the necessary credentials to
assullj. the posts. As a result, only 1,389 out of 6,236 primary schools; 668
out of 1,213 preparatory schools; and 233 out of 334 secondary schools had
principals in 1988. The rest were managed by teachers, who had inadequate
experience and no training for this position. The limited number of
principals and their weak administrative role underline the importance of in-
service and graduate courses in educational administration.
7.       The Effects of Teacher Shortages.  The high percentage of foreign
teachers negatively affects Yemeni education in many ways. Aside from having
a short-term commitment to Yemeni education, foreign teachers receive much
higher salaries than local teachers and create a foreign exchange drain.
Salaries for expatriate teachers in secondary schools amounted to US$80
rnillion in 1989. The average Yemeni teacher earns approximately YRI 53,548
per year as compared to YRI 82,000 for a foreigner. As a result, the
education system expansion during the last decade has been inordinately
expensive.  The share of expenditures on education to total government
expenditures increased from 11.2 percent in 1978 to 20.3 percent in 1989 and
reached over YRI 3.9 billion, excluding international donor support.
Moreover, recurrent expenditures accounted for over 87 percent and capital
expenditure for only 13 percent. These percentages may not be excessive for a
developing country with a wide-reaching educational system, but they are high
for a country which provides no access to 57 percent of its school-age
children and only had 1,217 postprimary schools in 1988. The Government must
increase capital expenditures and at the same time, have the personnel
available to staff the new schools.
8.       The strictures imposed on the educational system by expensive
foreign teachers adversely affect the quality of education. Urban schools are
crowded, and, reportedly, some students are turned away for lack of space.
Many governorates have limited facilities (Table 3). Crowding particularly
affects girls who have a very limited choice in the location of schools they
can attend and results in limited attention being given to students.
Nevertheless, teacher shortages exacerbate a scarcity of school buildings
because the Government is, justifiably, reluctant to undertake extensive
construction of schools without Yemeni teachers to staff them. The shortage
of teachers encourages the dropping out of secondary-level school students,
particularly in the transition from the preparatory to the upper secondary
levels; one fourth of the students who graduate from preparatory school do not
continue to secondary school. Furthermore, limited access limits demand for
education, particularly in rural areas, which are considered unattractive

educ it  i0rn, p.ntt icul,irly in rural areas, which are considered unattractive
l,;( ; fur t.tclcrs.  Most secondar"-level teachers, particularly women, are
urb;tn dw1tll '; arid least likely to accept employment in rural areas.
9.       (:ovcrrnwent Policies to Increase Teacher S-pply.  The Goverrnment has
ena;cttd pol icies to inicrease the number of Yemeni teachers at all levels.  A
la;rge Con01strLlutioll programn of primary teacher training institutes (PTTIs) has
iAvil Uildcl t.kenl, wthicti has been supported by IDA and the Government's own
fund(.  As a result, there are about 18,000 teacher trainees in soma 110
PTTIs, out of wlmichi a'bout 90 are attached to schools in rural areas. The
Govcrinursnt is building 20 more institutions and IDA is supporting an
additiolnal 15, thus creating a sufficient capacity for future years.
10,      For the past several years, all secondary-school and university
gradtuates have bad to perform one year of national service by teaching at
primary or secondary schools. In 1988-89, 3,919 taught in primary schools,
244 in lower secondary schools, and only 93 were appointed to upper secondary
schools. To prepare them, the Sana'a FOE offers a short course in teaching
methodology. Relatively few eligible graduates are exempted, mainly for
advanced studies. National service teachers do teach in rural areas, but they
tend to remain in the more populous governorates or near cities where they
live.
11.      Students of both primary and secondary teacher training institutions
are given considerable money and other incentives.  These include: (i) release
from military obligations; (ii) free accommodation, where dormitories exist,
and a stipend (YR1 700 per month for PTTI students, YRI 950-1,100 for FOE
students); (iii) guaranteed employment for at least five years after
graduation.  Since the demand for primary education teachers is much larger
than that for secondary education teachers, stipends do not yet appear to
create in PTTIs the distortions they create in FOEs.
12.      The curricula and roles of PTTIs are being upgraded, and the older
five-year system is being abandoned in favor of a system encompassing grades
9-12 and a postsecondary two-year system for urban areas where secondary-
level graduates are available. In the fuLure, therefore, there will be an
increased supply of teachers with improved general education.
The Former Yemen Democratic Re2ubl c (PDRY)
13.      The educational system of South Yemen provides access to a larger
percentage of the pnpulation than that of the North and faces less pressure to
expand because of tt;a lower rate of population increase in the former PDRY.
Until the 1967 revolution against the British, access to education for the
nopulation at large was quite limited; adult literacy during that period
was about ) percenc.
14.      The socialist government that took charge developed policies to
extend primary education but it also limited secondary- and tertiary-level
education and developed more vocaticna; and technical schools. The duration
of postbasic education (grade 8 onward) varies: four years for general
secondary and primary teacher training, five years for technician training and
two years for trade school training. In light of these policies,

226, (io in 1980-81, using 10,000 primary and 1200 secondary teachers (Table
4 ).  Ii 1987-88  thre- wore approximately 310,839 students in unity schools;
31 ,550 itl general upper secondary schools, 1,900 in teacher training; and
nearl  7,000 itl tt chniical and vocatio.ial schools.  Limited admissions
resultcd, in part in a studeuit-teacher ratio of 16:1 in academic four-year
upper secondary schlools irn 1987-88, in comparison to a ratio of 21:1 in YAR.
Despite high initial enrollment in schools, however, dropout rates are high;
90 percent of boys and '3 percent of girls enroll in the first grade of unity
schools but 47 percent of all students drop out before completing the eight-
year courSe of study.
15.       In 1987-88, there were some 12,800 primary (called unity schools,
grades 1-8) and 1,900 secondary school (grades 9-12) teachers. There were no
axpatriates among primary-level teachers, but expatriates made up about 16 the
of the teaching force at the secondary level. However, the expansion of
primary education without having to hire expatriate teachers resulted in the
recruitment of unqualified teachers. About 25 percent of unity school
teachers are graduates of unity schools only.  The upgrading of these teachers
would be an important task of the unified MOE, and a reinforced in-service
education system would significantly facilitate the task.
16.      Teacher training for unity school grades 1-4 takes place in teacher
training institutes which admit students after the eighth grade. Teachers for
grades 5-12 are trained in two- and four year programs at the University of
Aden (Annex 2).
17.      The unification of the primary and secondary education systems of
PDRY and YAR will be the focus of considerable discussion. The present plan
is to establish basic education in grades 1-9, followed by secondary education
in grades 10-12. This restructuring has implications for the structure of
teacher training. PDRY trains teachers for grades 1-4 in secondary-level
institutions, teachers for grades 4-8 in two-year university programs and
teachers for grades 9-12 in four-year university programs. Similarly, MOHE is
considering a plan for training teachers for grades 7-9 of the unified system
in two-year programs or junior/community colleges.

Assumptions: 681 would transfer from grade 6 to grade 7; dropout and repetition rates in grades 7-9 would average 6.2 and 7.9,
respectively; 702 would transfer from grade 9 to grade 10; dropout and repetition rates in grades 10-12 would average 11.5 and 6.3.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Yemeni Higher Education
A. The University of Aden
1.       The University of Aden was the only the university in former PDRY.
It comprises seven faculties: education, economics, agriculture, law,
medicine, technology and foreign languages. Consonant with the policy of the
socialist government to restrict access to postprimary education, the
institution has grown slowly. It had only 4,600 students in 1987-88
(Table 1), 41.6 percent female, whose studies are completely subsidized. In
addition to a free education, all university students receive stipends of
approximately YRI 500 per month.
2.       The College of Arts, Sciences and Education prepares teachers for
grades 5-8 and 9-12 in two separate courses of two and four years' duration,
respectively. Specialization subjects are Arabic, English, history and
geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and philosophy. A diploma
is awarded after two years and a Bachelor of Education degree after four
years. Professional educational subjects, such as psychology and teaching
methods, take up 12 percent-15 percent of the curriculum.  The college offers
no graduate degree, but its students are eligible to pursue graduate degrees
in other faculties.
3.       Enrollments are relatively low in the College of Arts, Sciences and
Education: 912 students in 1988-89, about 45 percent of whom were female
(Table 2). Since university stipends do not require that graduates teach,
many graduates opt to work in other sectors.
B. University of Sana'a
4.        The University of Sana'a, the country's only university, was
established in November 1970 with 74 students and 9 staff members. Within 20
years, the University of Sana'a has evolved a highly structured administrative
organization, physical facilities and support services. The university system
is still expanding. The Taiz FOE has been earmarked as the nucleus of a
second university due to be started in 1992
5.       Enrollment growth in the 1980s has been phenomenal.  The 1978
university master plan had projected that,by 1990, the institution would have
approximately 5,000 students. Instead, in 1990 there were about 37,000
students, including 341 graduate students (mainly at the master's degree
level). During 1988-89 alone, the increase was 70 percent, from 23,450 to
37,000. The enrollment explosion is a result of the rapid rise in the
enrollment in secondary education, the liberal admissions policy, the high



- 40 -                          Annex 2
Page 2 of 7
rate of unemployment among secondary school graduates, free tuition and the
high rate of return from a university education. It is also the result of
rapid economic expansion, an increase in real income among the population and
regular donor assistance. It is projected that by the year 2000 the
university will have a student population of 79,000. Nevertheless, female
participation is low, i.e., about 14 percent-15 percent and is not
significantly increasing.
Resources
6.       The enrollment explosion has brought about a financial and human
resource crisis. The overall student/staff ratio has risen to an alarming 80
from a satisfactory overall ratio of 1:23 in 1978/79. There is a critical
shortage, as well as inefficient use, of existing physical facilities and of
administrative and support services. Kuwait, as the principal donor, met more
than 90 percent of the university's recurrent and capital expenditures in the
1970s. However, this assistance has declined while the budget has averaged a
27% increase from 1986 to 1988. The government contribution to the university
increased to the current level of about 60 percent of total operating
expenditures, at a time when the country's macro-financial position was
deteriorating.
7.       There is an acute shortage of well-qualified professors in YAR.
Forty percent of the university staff are non-Yemenis. In an effort to reduce
this dependence, 223 staff members have gone overseas for further training,
mainly to Egypt but also to the US and UK. However, this major effort still
falls far short of meeting the need to raise the staff/student ratio to
acceptable levels.
Placement of Graduates
8.       In years when educated citizens were very scarce, the YAR Government
adopted a policy of guaranteed public sector employment to all Yemeni
graduates, whether trained in the University of Sana'a or outside the country.
Until 1988, the Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reform was able
to place all graduates, in spite of the rapid rise in their number, from 417
in 1981 to approximately 3500 in 1989. However, the noneducation public
sector now needs fewer liberal arts students, and unemployment is rising. At
the same time, there is a major shortage of Yemenis with the requisite
scientific and technical training and experience, including an acute shortage
of secondary science school teachers. The government, therefore, has revised
the policy that guarantees employment to all graduates in order to (i)
rationalize its recurrent expenditure budget; and (ii) force students to take
market forces into consideration before making vocational choices.
Secondary-Level Teacher Training
9.       Faculties of Education (FOEs).  FOEs are semi-autonomous units, that
generally follow the curricula and policies of the Sana'a Faculty. In Sana'a,
teacher trainees take education courses in FOEs and content courses in the
faculties of their specializations. The five FOEs offer a variety of
specialties to their students (Table 3). Only Sana'a, Taiz and Hodeidah offer
science specialties, which might explain the scarcity of science teachers



- 41 -                          Annex 2
Page 3 of 7
outside Sana'a.
10.      The university follows a semester credit system that includes
required and elective courses, although, in practice, few electives exist.
Requirements include two courses of Islamic education, 15 hours of education
requirements and 31-33 hours of specialization. Undergraduate education
students follow a subject specialization, choosing a pair of subjects as a
major and a minor (exc.pt in the case of English, where there is no minor).
11.      The FOE in Sana'a has nine departments:  Islamic and Arabic studies,
social studies, English, science, mathematics, foundations of education,
educational administration and planning, educational psychology and
educational technology. In Sana'a, students take a combination of education
courses and subject matter courses. The Sana'a FOE offers education courses,
while other university faculties offer subject matter courses.
12.      Provincial faculties offer a smaller selection of subjects according
to their capacity. Predictably, Arabic and Islamic studies are easier to
teach in a resource-poor environment, although the demand for science teachers
is much higher than the demand for humanities teachers. The Hodeidah Faculty
has introduced the only physical education specialty in the country and is
planning to introduce arts education. Provincial faculties offer content as
well as education courses, since no other faculties exist. This means that
the provincial faculties have to be prepared to assume responsibilities that
the Sana'a Faculty does not. These include the employment of specialty
professors, the provision and equipment of laboratories and the management of
a larger range of activities and units (e.g., student dormitories) than full-
fledged universities have to deal with. The administrators have neither the
experience nor the staff to carry out all the functions necessary to run
independent faculties. Furthermore, provincial FOEs have no specific budget
assigned to them.
13.      Admissions to the Faculties of Education.  Entrance to FOE is open to
two types of candidates: primary-level teachers in service with at least two
years of teaching experience and holders of a secondary education certificate.
The former, who constitute approximately 30 percent of admissions, may have
graduated either from the five-year or from the three-year PTTIs, and are,
according to some professors, not qualified enough for university study.
14.      Candidates are admitted on the basis of examination scores and an
interview. (PTTI graduates are given a special examination). Admission
standards to FOEs are reportedly very low, since the better students opt for
different fields. The admission criterion was lowered to 60 percent, a score
deemed too low, although the examination probably does not have enough
reliability or validity to determine qualified university students.
Constructing a reliable test, however, is a rather low priority given other
problems faced by the faculties.
15.      Low Internal Efficiency.  Failure rates are high, particularly since
the recent large enrollment increase; 45 percent of men and 30 percent of
women failed some courses in the first year. In Taiz, for example, only 65
percent of the students passed the first year without carryover courses in
1989-90, as compared to 95 percent in the previous years.  Since students who



- 42 -                          Annex 2
Page 4 of 7
fail continue to receive stipends, few actually drop out (7 percent of first-
year students in Taiz in 1989-90), and the system becomes bloated with first-
year repeaters   The failure rate diminishes to about 15% for both sexes in
the second ye,, and thereafter, in part because students whc drop out after
that time have to pay back the stipends they have received. The Sana'a FOE
has adopted a policy of expelling students who fail a year more than twice but
allows repeaters to keep the stipends, a policy which theoretically enables
students to repeat each year once and receive stipends for a total of two
years. The internal efficiency problem, therefore, is due to (i) the low
quality of students admitted to FOEs, many married with children and jobs;
(ii) the inadequacy of a single, end-of-semester examination as a measurement
instrument, particularly when the student-staff ratio is over 80, and students
receive little individual attention; and (iii) the lack of incentives to
graduate and start teaching as soon as possible.
16.      Female Participation.  Approximately 23 percent (1346) of the
stidents in all FOEs are female (Table 3). The number of women in FOEs is
increasing, and education has become an acceptable profession for them. Yet,
educational delivery to them might not be equal to that of men. In classes,
women are limited to a few, separate rows on one side. Professors tend to
interact exclusively with the males and have a very limited interaction with
women.
17.      Teaching Loads.  In spite of the shortage of Yemeni staff in FOEs
(Table 4), the instructional staff have a very light teaching load. A
lecturer teaches about 12 credit hours per week, an associate professor about
10 and a full professor about eight.  The light teaching load increases the
wage bill.  However, professors do a lot of advising work, particularly during
registration time.  They also score essay examinations by themselves, a load
which becomes quite heavy at the end of each semester.  Apparently, few have
second jobs, although some travel to provincial faculties to teach.
18.      Teacher Training for Noneducation Graduates at the Sana'a FOE.  The
diploma course for graduates of noneducation faculties, offered since 1988,
should be a viable and much cheaper alternative to the four-year undergraduate
program. To find out how viable this alternative would be, a preinvestment
study surveyed the interest of 500 third- and fourth-year students in the Arts
and Sciences Colleges of Sana'a University. Data indicate that: (i) 59
percent of the respondents indicated a readiness to enter teaching, although
students responding to the survey were most likely to need a job; (ii) 63
percent of the men and 81 percent of the women were interested in teaching;
(iii) more arts students (65 percent) were interested in teaching than science
students (48 percent); (iv) only 28 percent of those interested in teaching
indicated readiness to work in any area specified by MCE; (v) 52 percent would
be interested in entering a one-year diploma course, and (vi) 77 percent would
choose Sana'a and 15 percent would choose Taiz for a one-year diploma course.
Noneducation graduates likely to become teachers, therefore, are likely to be
urban-based, l1beral arts graduates. This profile from noneducation faculties
should encourage FOEs to emphasize science specialties and the training of
rural area resider.ts in their four-year programs.
19.      Practice reaching.  The current system offers a student the
opportunity to teach in a secondary school or in a PTTI everv two weeks for

specialization, have two groups of about nine students whom they observe and
evaluate during practice teaching. Although feedback is supposed to be given
to students on their performance, it appears that there is little systematic
effort to do so. Since many merely teach content courses, (e.g., psychology)
they often have little usable feedback to give. The large numbers of students
who entered the faculties in the fall of 1989 are expected to make the current
system unworkable. It will be virtually impossible for the university to
place all 7,000 education students in schools capable of providing suitable
practical experience, and it will be almost impossible to locate sufficient
numbers of experienced teachers to act as supervisors under the conventional
block practice" approach. Improved substitutes must be found to guarantee
students time to teach, as well as obtain effective and expert feedback.

S IK.(CNDAR'I TEACHER TRAINING( PROJECT
Ma iI n Ue" in S  ot,dary FdtlcntiOn
Secondary education iF- a relat.ively new phenomenotn in Yemen'.  As
recentlIy as 19/ 9, only about 1,000 students were enrolled in secondary
schlools. Major donors, including IDA and USAID, have concentrated on
assisting primary education.  Thus, problems of secondary education have
received little attention.  Secondary schools suffer from all the shortcomings
mentioned in para. 2.08 of the main text.  However, it is the Government's
view, with which IDA aglees, that the most pressinig problem at present is the
inadequacy in the teaching force, both in number and quality. Thus, in the
context of the proposed project, the key secondary education issues are: (i)
the shortage of well-qualified Yemeni secondary teachers; (ii) the poor use
being made of the existing teacher resource because of weak in-service
training mechanisms and the absence of training for school administrators and
managerial personnel; and (iii) the failure to rationally use existing
resources because of lack of planning and coordinating mechanisms, and
inadequate data and information about teacher needs and good teaching
practices.
Shortaze of Well-Qualified Yemeni Secondary Teachers
2.          The secondary education system has an urgent need for teachers,
especially in the North. The use of expatriates is more extensive at the
secondary level; only 15% of teachers at this level are Yemeni. In 1989 three
of the 12 northern governorates had no secondary-level Yemeni teachers at all.
The shortage of teachers also impairs the capacity of the system to perform
other key functiotns adequately, such as school administration, inspection,
supervision and higher level educational management. The South is almost
self-sufficient in secondary teachers, but the demand for schooling, and hence
the need for teachers, is expected to increase when limits on enrollment are
relaxed under unification.
3.          The situation regarding female teachers differs dramatically in
the South and the North.  In the South, secondary education is coeducational.
About one third of the students are female, and in the city of Aden female
students outnumb-er males.  Teacher supply and demand is relatively in balance
and the proportion of women in the Colleges of Education (COEs) at the
Universitv of Aden is close to 50 percent.  In the North, where secondary
education is largely segregated by gender. the shortage of female teachers is
acute, particularly in rural areas. In 1988/89 in the North only about 180
secondary teachers were Yemeni women   The shortage of female secondary school
graduates is a major bottleneck; in 1990 only about 1,700 females graduated

4.          To meet the need for seconidary teachers in YAR, the University of
Sana'a established FOEs in Sana'a in 1973. in Taiz in 1985, in Hodeidah in
1987, in Ibb in 1988 and in l{ajjah in 1989.  In the South, a COE was
established at the University of Aden in 1970.  Subsequently, in 1986 another
branch was established at Mukalla.  In the North, FOEs have only produced
about 3,100 graduates, far shiort of the 9,000 now required (Table 1 of Annex
1).  The Southl produces about 300 graduates a year, close to its requirements.
Sinice unification, the COE a. Aden hlas begun enrolling students from the
North.
5.          Rec-itly, in the North, the Government has undertaken a crash
program to increase the number of Yemeni secondary teachers. In the first
year after the new policy was introduced, admissions to FOEs more than
doubled, increasing from about 3,400 in 1988-89 to 7,300 in 1989-90. About
4,000 were admitted to the 1990-91 class, a smaller nuiber but still exceeding
the capacity of FOEs. The faculties were unprepared for such drastic
increases in student enrollment; the paiysical and administrative
infrastructures were overwhlelmed, risking a severe drop in instructional
quality. The lower-scoring students admitted into overcrowded faculties in
1989/90 had 50 percent-70 percent failure rates iTI the first year (para. 15 of
Annex 2). While keeping enrollments high in FOEs could eliminate teacher
shortages in secondary schools in a few years, the consequence of producing
poor quality teachers is undesirable, and IDA has urged the Government to
bring enrollments under control. Given these shifting policies. projecting
the number of teachers that will be needed on an annual basis, once the non-
Yemeni teachers are replaced, is difficult. Nonetheless, "'y making some
plausible assumptions (Table 1 of Annex 1), taking into account the large
enrollments of the last few years but assuming thes- would drop back to more
feasible levels, the mission estimated that with an output of about 3,500 per
year in the North and about 300 in the South, after the year 2000 teacher
supply and demand would be in relative balance. These figures have been used
as a basis for planning physical facilities for the future.
6.          In the past decade, the Government of the former YAR instituted
multiple incentives to ntice students into secondary teaching, including: (i)
release from military obligations; (ii) free accommodation, where dormitories
exist; (iii) a stipend of YR1 950-1,100 per month for all education students
(including a year of repetition after fai]ur-;); (iv) jobassignment near a
teacher's preferred location; and (v) guaranteed employment for at least five

systkiratic approach to taking advantage of this resource is needed.
7.          Two recent studies, "Development Needs of the Education Sector'
(Fel,ruarv 1989) and "Media and Methods Study" (July 1989) by IDA and UNESCO
identified the major shortcomings of the preservice training system: (i)
inadequate instructional programs; (ii) the shortage of Yemeni faculty; and
(iii) overreliance on four-year preservice training programs.

8.          The curriculum does not emphasize teaching skills.  FOE curricula
fall short in providing instruction in content appropriate to secondary-level
curricula and effective classroom teaching techniques. The foreign,
constantly changing professors who staff FOEs are often not familiar with the
Yemeni secondary school curricula or with techniques for providing practical
instruction. To date, FOEs have not had the resources to systematically
review the curriculum, analyze teachers' current jobs and identify the
additional skills needed for effective teaching and learning.
9.          Many textbooks are inappropriate.  Textbook quality greatly
affe(.ts instructional quality. Textbooks are selected in Sana'a and are sold
to students at cost by university bookstores. However, in many fields there
is a scarcity of up-to-date textbooks in Arabic, and of the existing titles,
only a minority reaches Yemen. The faculties, therefore, have very limited
choice and students often must rely on notes and photocopied chapters. The
problem can best be addressed by selecting or adapting existing textbooks. In
special circumstances it may be necessary to write new books, but this should
be a rare occurrence, given the large number of satisfactory textbooks
developed in other parts of the world. COEs have a special problem because
they are just now in the processing of adopting Arabic as the language of
instruction for science.
10.         Facilities are inadequate.  None of the present FOE or COE
facilities is adequate for the specialties offered and the numbers of students
served. Although FOEs now account for about 50 percent of all admissions at
the University of Sana'a, increased student intake has not been accompanied by
necessary increases in staffing, laboratories, library resources, classroom
space, audiovisual equipment or resources for practice teaching. The Sana'a
FOE was constructed to serve 750 students and now serves approximately 7,000,
with nominal additional accommodation provided in other faculties. The Taiz
FOE, with approximately 4,000 students, regularly teaches evening courses in
other locations. The Hodeidah, Hajjah and Ibb FOEs are occupying,
respectively, a girls' secondary school, a girls' Primary Teacher Training

Institute an(i a library building. The COE at the University of Aden is housed
in dilapidated buildings and lacks essential facilities. Addressing these
problems will require both upgrading facilit'.es and rationalizing student
intakes.
11.         Science education is of poor quality.  The fast pace of scientific
changes and tthe urgent needs in the area of skilled labor make .cience
education worthy of special attention. Of particular importance is the
deteriorating state of the Yemeni environment and the threat to the fragile
desert ecosystem from increasing industrialization. Addressing both problems
will require substantial increases in scientifically trained experts and a
more scientifically literate population. The quality of science teaching and
learning in preparatory and secondary schools in Yemen is quite low.
Curricula and textbooks are antiquated, and even demonstration laboratory
facilities are nonexistent in most schools: of approximately 2,000 secondary
schools in the North, only about 400 have any science equipment (the South has
at least some laboratory equipment in every school); and the skeletal in-
service training network has been unable to provide guidance on instruction or
on conducting science demonstrations using locally available materials.
12.         Another important source of the problem is the poor preservice
science education given to students in FOEs. Science teacher training is
relatively new in Yemen, especially in the North, and few local professors are
qualified to teach science methodology to teacher trainees. To train science
teachers, FOEs (and COEs) need updated science methodology and other
laboratories, and science learning resources. The capacity of MOE and other
agencies involved in curriculum development and dissemination is also
inadequate to meet the demands for higher quality science and environmental
education.
Shortage of Yemeni Faculty at FOEs
13.         Current ',creases in enrollment have raised the student-staff
ratio in the FOEs to aoout 100:1 while the entire university system faces a
scarcity of qualified local academics2. There are few Yemenis with the
master's or doctoral degrees required to be professors of education (Table 4
of Annex 2). To cover FOE needs, foreign academics are recruited at
considerable cost, mainly from Egypt. Foreign professors at Taiz, for
example, cost approximately US$4,000 per month, twice as much as equally
qualified Yemeni professors.
14.         The Government has shown great concern about faculty scarcity, and
nearly 40 FOE staff are currently abroad obtaining advanced degrees (Table 5
of Annex 2), largely through scholarships provided by IDA (Credit 1773-YAR)
and other donors. However, more will be needed in the short and medium term
if FOEs are to improve the student-staff ratio, especially in the provinces.
Overall., there is a pool of more than 5,000 educators in Yemen who could
benefit from advanced training. FOE and MOE staff, inspectors, and more than
2,500 school administrators receive little, if any, training. Of the 900
trainers in PTTIs only a few are Yemenis, and they have master's degrees from
2The ratio in COEs is about 1:10, a much more acceptable level.

15.         Faculties other than education produce graduates with knowledge
that is useful to schools.  However, noneducation graduates who have entered
teaching thius far are few and lack formal teacher training. An evening
program was designed in the University of Sana'a to enable such graduates to
complete the FOE educational courses in one year, but it is optional, little
known, and attended by only about 20 students, mostly MOE employees and a few
practicing teachers. Since a one-year program costs much less than a four-
year program, the Government has recently decided to divert to secondary-
level teaching university graduates who apply for civil service positions and
cannot be placed in their specialty (Annex 2). An IDA preinvestment study
supported under the Teacher Training project (Credit 1773-YAR), completed in
June 1990, indicates that a program for noneducation graduates would be
attractive to liberal arts graduates in Sana'a and Taiz, particularly women,
and concludes that in a proper policy framework of incentives and recruitment
procedures, 1000 noneducation graduates could be trained as teachers annually
(para. 18 of Annex 2).
Using the Existing Teacher More Effectively
16.         Yemen requires two types of in-service training, neither of which
is available. All teachers need periodic upgrading of their knowledge and
skills. Additionally, the approximately 15 percent of teachers who lack
formal qualifications need more extensive training. The large number of
foreign, temporary teachers has reduced the Government's willingness to invest
in in-service training. Both the North and the South have the rudiments of an
in-service network, but activities have been of limited effectiveness because
of key institutional weaknesses, including an inadequate budget. In MOE,
responsibility for in-service activities is fragmented and uncoordinated
(Annex 6). The In-service Section of the General Directorate of Teacher
Training has a training staff of 29, mostly graduates of the University of
Sana'a without any specialized training. They oversee the activities of the
eight regional centers. Inspectors and supervisors are expected to conduct
in-service education programs but lack specialized knowledge, training
materials, secretarial support and transportation. Currently, there is no
program to develop the skills of head teachers, school principals, in-service
trainers, inspectors and supervisors. Furthermore, in-service education is
completely optional and educators receive no incentives to attend. To address
these shortcomings, MOE plans to extend and strengthen tlt' in-service training
network.

the need for coordination, recently created the post of Deputy Prime Minister
for .Manpower Development, with a brief to oversee the deployment of trained
manpower, thereby creating a focus in the Government for addressing these
types of problems.
18.         Instructional quality cannot improve without information to guide
where and how change should be introduced.  Effective problem solving is often
preceded by pilot projects and experimentation which can: (i) introduce
innlovation and change in needed areas (examinations, rural education, women's
education, etc.); (ii) provide tested evidence on which to base future
policies for the quality improvement of education; and (iii) encourage
teamwork. Until recently, basing decisions on experimental evidence has been
hampered by the shortage of Yemenis who could design applied educational
research, but their number is steadily increasing, in part due to investments
in EDRC (financed by Credit 1203-YAR) and in part to training undertaken by
the universitv staff.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Master's Degree Program in the Sana'a FOE
Issues
1.          The potential educational leadership in Yemen is limited by a
shortage of opportunities for graduate training in education. Currently,
educational professionals needing higher level training must go abroad. Such
foreign training, however, is both expensive and difficult for people with
families, and for women generally. As a result, there is at present only a
small pool of Yemeni specialized educators; this perpetuates dependence on
foreign specialists and trainers in MOE and in FOEs.
2.          Most of the professional staff in the MOE possess only a
bachelor's degree--no higher a level than that prescribed for preparatory and
secondary school teachers. In FOEs, where current increases in enrollment
have raised the student-staff ratio to around 100:1, the scarcity of qualified
Yemeni educators has forced the recruitment of foreign academics, mainly from
Egypt, at considerable cost. As a consequence, over half of the 163 teaching
staff in FOEs are expatriates. Those who are Yemeni are mostly at the
assistant professor and lecturer levels (Tables 4 of Annex 2). The Government
has shown great concern about faculty scarcity, and nearly 40 FOE employees
are currently abroad obtaining advanced degrees (Table 5 of .nnex 2), largely
through scholarships provided by IDA (Credit 1773-YAR) and other donors.
However, more will be needed in the short and medium term if the FOEs are to
reach a somewhat improved student-staff ratio of 60, particularly in the
provincial FOEs.
3.          Educational research within the university is also marginal due to
the absence of postgraduate programs of study: faculty do not have the time
to devote to research; nor do adequate facilities for research exist. The
establishment of a master's program will result in many students devoting time
to research on problems of relevance to ROY and of interest to the students
and the faculty. In the course of time a research pool will develop, which
would be a great asset to ROY, as otherwise the country will have to continue
to depend on foreign experts.
Objectives/Descrijtion
4.          The aims of the master's degree in education are to:
(a)   enhance the professional capabilities of academics and
administrators of the education system, in areas such as
educational management, school and teacher supervision,
educational evaluation, instructional system and media
development, guidance and counseling; and, in a subsequent phase,
adult education, special education and distance education;



- 53 -                         Annex 4
Page 2 of 5
(b)   develop experimentation, innovation and research capabilities in
the areas mentioned above; and
(c)   meet the shortage of qualified Yemeni faculty in the FOEs of the
university and of professionals in the MOE and the PTTIs across
the country.
5.          The project would support:
(a)   program design, development and initial operation through an
exchange program/twinning arrangement;
(b)   the construction of buildings for instruction, administration,
libraries, reprographic and computer facilities, and dormitories;
(c)   the provision of equipment for laboratories, libraries,
reprography, media development and use, and computer centers;
(d)   the provision of library books and other resources, including
research facilities; and
(e)   fellowships to improve the qualifications of teaching faculty for
the programs.
Intake/Admissions
6.          Considering the current number of school principals, PTTI
personnel, supervisors, inspectors and FOE demonstrators who currently lack
graduate training, it appears that the country will have to provide, over
time, graduate studies in education to about 1,000 professionals. In
addition, at least 500 extra teacher trainers will be needed to meet the needs
of projected student numbers until the year 2000 and to gradually replace the
non-Yemeni educators at all levels of the system. Considering the fact that
studies abroad are often highly desirable, the program has been planned to
produce 50 graduates per year. At this rate, the program would provide
adequate professionals for the Yemeni education system in approximately 20
years. The program would be open to those who possess a university degree in
education or another subject and have a minimum of three years of teaching or
administrative experience. Only 20 students would be admitted in the first
year of the program's operation. As the Sana'a FOE buildings are completed,
intake will be gradually increased to full capacity.
Program Design and Development and Initial Operation
7.          The master's program in education would normally have a duration
of two years. A student would be able to acquire a degree either through
academic course credits or through a combination of course credits and
dissertation. This broad framework for the program is to be confirmed by the
university prior to appraisal.
8.          The development of courses, curricula and material will require a
study of different course structures and their adaptability and relevance to
the Yemeni education system and a consultative process with educators



- us -                         Annex 4
Page 3 of 5
and a good reputation in the field of teacher education. The project would
support thie setting up of a planning and implementation group with
representation from FOEs and a few educators from an identified university of
excellence, to be identified as a "twinning institution." The process of
program design, development and initial operation would comprise the following
steps:
(a)   the setting up a study group with three designated members from
FOEs in ROY to gather information on a number of overseas
universities with potential in this area and to develop a short-
list of about three universities on the basis of demonstrated
capability and professional excellence in this field;
(b)   a visit of the study group, in consultation with IDA, to the
shortlisted universities (about three staff-months) to discuss and
formulate tentative plans and determine the financial implications
of an exchange program, including seminars and workshops for
program design and course development in Yemen as well as at the
identified university;
(c)   the final selection of the twinning institution for the exchange
program and the constitution of the planning and implementation
groups, composed of the study group and the educators designated
by the selected university;
(d)   the conducting of two seminars and two workshops for designing,
developing and finalizing the program and course details and
sample instructional and study materials; and
(e)   the starting of the program, with assistance from the professors
of the university participating in the exchange program during the
initial phase.
Student-Staff Ratio (SSR)
9.          The ideal SSR for such programs should be between 8:1 and 10:1.
However, considering the acute scarcity of professors in the FOE and the time
that will be taken by project fellows to acquire master's and doctoral
degrees, an SSR of 15:1 has to be accepted. This figure will be gradually
improved to 10:1.
Buildings. Equirment and Library Materials
10.         The project will provide for the construction of building space
for an ultimate intake of 100 annually; it will provide for equipment; library
materials (books, research journals, microfiches of selected research
reports/dissertations and other study materials); and computer facilities to
support research.
Fellowships
11.         Competent faculty are crucial to the success of any educational
program. Therefore, the project would support fellowships to enable selected



- 55 -                ~~~~Annex 4
Page 4 of 5
staff of the FOE to acquire master's/doctoral qualifications in education,
specializing in the areas mentioned in para. 2 above. Considering the size of
the faculty that would be responsible for the master's program, the fellowship
needs are for five master's and four doctoral-level programs, requiring 144
staff months of fellowships.
12.         The organization and administration of the fellowships could be
linked with the exchange program for program design, development and initial
operation (para. 5).

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Science Education ComRonent
1.       Science education provides the foundation for a technically competent
and productive society. Improving science education in ROY will help ensure
these ends into the next century. Realizing its importance, the Government
has given high priority to strengthening the capacity of secondary schools to
teach science by instructing teachers in modern curriculum content and
effective instructional methods.
2.       The objective of the science education component would be to initiate
some preparatory activities on which a larger, comprehensive longer-term
strategy to improve the quality of science teaching and learning in
preparatory and secondary schools in Yemen could be built. This objective
would be accomplished through two means:
(a) Improving the pre-service education and training of preparatory and
secondary teachers at the FOE of the University of Sana'a and its
several branches, and at the COE of the University of Aden; and
(b) Improving curriculum and classroom teaching practices/methodology.
3.       Specifically, the Project would support:
(a) Establish five SRCs at three FOE branches: Sana'a, Taiz, and
Hodeidah, at ERDC, and at the Aden COE.
(b) Construct and equip science laboratories at Taiz, Hodeidah, and Aden.
(c) Construct and equip science method laboratories:  two at the Sana
campus, one at the Taiz branch, and one at the Aden COE.
(d) Extend and improve school science through support for science
workshops, science curriculum development teams, and science
fellowships.
4.       Science activities supported by the Project would be implemented
under the direction of a Coordinating Committee comprised of at least one
science educator from each of the FOEs/COEs, one representative of the MOE
science curriculum development team, and a representative of UPU.
Science Resource Centers.
5.       The Project would establish five centers in three FOEs where science
is taught (Sana'a, Hodeidah and Taiz), at the Aden COE, and at the MOE
curriculum unit. Each center would occupy a room; each would be adjacent to
the library when possible. The centers would be equipped with audio-visual
information resources: printed material, film, magnetic media and computer



-58-                            Annex 5
Page 2 of 4
software on science education for use by science educators and FOE/COE
students. These would help science educators in ROY to keep abreast of
developments throughout the world in the field of science education. The
center would be able to draw on the facilities of the library for access to
equipment such as a VCR, a slide projector and microfiche; indeed, each would
be managed as part of the library. The Project would finance the procurement
of all software and other materials, including subscriptions to relevant
journals during the life of the Project and any attendant equipment (copiers,
projectors, film readers, computers) not currently available nor being
procured through other project components.
6.       Science educators would be expected to use resources from the center
in their teaching, and regularly update course content by using the audio-
visual aids.
Science laboratories
7.       As part of the expansion of physical facilities of FOEs (para. 3.18)
the Project would build, furnish, and equip laboratories for teaching biology,
physics, and chemistry at the FOEs at Taiz and Hodeidah (the Sana'a FOE has
access to the laboratories of the Faculty of Scienze). Because these
laboratories would be used for teaching basic science to prospective teachers
rather than prospective researchers, they would be equipped more modestly than
the laboratories at the main campus of the University of Sana'a. The science
laboratories of the COE at Aden would be similarly equipped. The Project
would also acquire an initial supply of consumables to conduct the experiments
required by the curriculum. The subsequent replacement of consumables would
be through the regular budgets of the universities.
Science Method Laboratories
8.       Even well equipped secondary schools in Yemen have only simple
facilities. Therefore, it is useful to train teachers in ways that
approximate the conditions in the schools in which they will teach. The
methods labs would be rooms with benches, water, and gas but no specialized
facilities. They would provide education students with the opportunity to
practice the demonstrations required by the secondary school syllabus. The
Project would finance the construction and equipping of two laboratories of
this tyoe at Sana'a and one each at Aden, Taiz, and Hodeidah. Each room would
accommodate 36 students and would have an adjoining store room for apparatus.
If few students are enrolled, a single room could be used for all science and
environmental subjects. Where more than one room is required, division by
discipline would be appropriate. For the present instructional program, each
student would be expected to use the laboratory for a total of four hours per
week during his or her pre-service training. Assuming a forty hour week, one
laboratory would accommodate 360 students. Students would work in groups of
three. By organizing work so that students take turns so that each conducts
two different experiments during a single laboratory period, a laboratory
would need to be equipped with six sets of each kind of apparatus. The
equipment would be identical to that used to equip preparatory and secondary
schools.
9.       Equipment would be purchased in two phases: first, the equipment
required by grades 10-12; then the remainder for the curriculum for the other



~ 59           ~             Annex 5
Page 3 of 4
grades.  The Project would also finance an initial supply of the consumables
required to conduct the demonstrationis.  Replacements would be financed
through regular university budgets.
Science Workshops
10,      Because out of 8,000 primary, preparatory and secondary schools in
the former YAR only 400 hiave any facilities for conducting the demonstrations
required by the science curriculun, (para. 2.19; secondary schools in the
South are better equipped), the Project would support a workshop program to
develop alternatives to the required demonstrations that would only use
locally available materials ar.d could be done in schools lacking standard
facilities.  Yemeni science educators would observe similar advances achieved
in other countries and upon their return would conduct national workshops that
would develop instructional materials for wider distribution and adoption.
Some workshops would be assisted by foreign experts. Workshop participants
would produce a first draft of an instruction booklet on conducting the
demonstrations. Upon completion of the workshops, science educators would
organize an international conference to be held in Yemen in order to review
workshop res.Alts with foreign experts who could then provide constructive
advice. Accordingly, science educators would prepare final versions of
instruction booklets. The materials would subsequently be disseminated in
collaboration with ITI (para. 3.22). The Project would finance: (i) program
support amounting to US$120,000 to cover the cost of 20 local workshops for 20
participants each, annual national conferences to disseminate workshop
findings and to produce the resulting instructional materials; and (ii) the
cost of technical assistance for 14 staff-months of international expert
services on science teaching and 15 staff-months of fellowships for short
study tours for Yemeni science educators.
Secondary Level Science Curriculum Development
11.      The school science curriculum will be revised in line with a larger
effort to update and unify the country's education curricula (para. 2.19).
The standard method for undertaking curriculum development work is to
establish a team comprised of curriculum specialists, subject matter experts,
and inspectors and teachers who, under the guidance of MOE, would prepare a
new syllabus and textbook. To assist this process, which would be undertaken
by MOE in close collaboration with FOEs, the Project would provide up to 12
staff-months of specialist services and 36 staff-months of fellowship training
at curriculum centers abroad, to familiarize Yemeni science educators with
curricula adopted by other countries at similar stages of development and with
current teaching innovations and approaches.
Timing
12.      Three of the four activities designed to improve science teaching and
learning are mutually interdependent: developing curriculum, holding
workshops and equipping methods laboratories. It is expected that the work on
finding alternatives to experiments would begin immediately and that the
analyses made of existing standard experiments and possible alternatives would
be made available to curriculum teams as they undertook curriculum revision.
The results of the workshops would be put into practice in schools as soon as
possible and incorporated into the ongoing teaching of methods courses at the

university level. The procurement of equipment for the methods labs should be
delayed until the laboratories are almost complete, so that any changes made
in the curriculum can be reflected in the equipment purchased for the
laboratories.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
In-service Training
1.       The major objective of in-service training is to improve the quality
of instruction delivered in the schools through training on curricula, the use
of textbooks and other instructional materials, teaching skills, the subject-
matter knowledge of teachers, student assessments, examinations, and the
performance evaluation of school personnel. For in-service train:ng to be
effective, well coordinated efforts are needed among the various entities
which provide the service.
2.       Variot-s MOE departments are in charge of in-service training in
Yemen. The General Directorate for Teacher Training is the main such entity,
but other departments have the responsibility for providing inputs in their
subsectors. For example, training for textbooks, teacher guides, audiovisual
aids, and curricular review lies with the section on curriculum, textbooks,
and audiovisual aids under the General Directorate for Teacher Services. The
examination section, also within this directorate, is responsible for student
assessment. The Division for Inspection and Supervision of schools, directly
under the Minister, is also responsible for providing short in-service
training programs. Supervisors identify problems of individual schools or
groups of schools and conduct short school-based remedial programs, which last
two or three days. Despite the number of entities responsible, little in-
service training is taking place. It appears that: (i) coordination among
various directorates is suboptimal; (ii) little information is available on
the activities of various agencies; (iii) clear policies on in-service
education are lacking; (iv) funding for in-service training activities has
been inadequate; and (",) no specific facilities exist for in-service training.
3.       Whatever in-service activities have taken place in Yemen thus far
have been limited to primary education teachers. No preservice or in-service
training is given to inspectors, supervisors, school principals, head
teachers, PTTI teachers, secondary-level teachers, or to in-service trainers
themselves. To develop an effective program for this population of educators,
the Project would support:
(a) MOE policy review on career paths, promotions, and incentives to
undertake in-service training (MOE has, in principle, agreed to do
this);
(b) the strengthening of institutional capability through the
rationalization of organizational structures, the refinement of
roles, and the formulation of policies for an effective in-service
training network and a management information system (MIS) to
facilitate program planning and review;
(c) improved professional preparation of in-service trainers,
particularly in the context of proposed revisions of school curricula

and improvements to the exdmination system; emphasis would be on
systems needed to hlelp create functional multiplier effects;
(d) the construction and equipping of an ITI in Sana'a;
(e) the development of training systems and materials for targetted key
trainiee populations (Table 1) and the professional development of
trainers;
(f) the provision of training resources at the 12 regional offices of the
division of inspection and supervision; secretarial and
transportation facilities for inspectors and supervisors who are
expected to conduct school-based in-service programs; and
(g) the development of the professional capability of key personnel in
the curriculum, audiovisual aids, and examination sections of MOE.
4.       Project financing would include:
(a) Strengthening Institutional Capability.  The Project would provide
six staff-months of specialist services for a study, in conjunction
with MOE staff, on alternative organizational structures, modes of
delivery of in-service training programs, and policy changes and
initiatives needed for making the in-service training network more
effective. Up to 24 staff-months of fellowships would be provided
for developing expertise in iTI for installing, opprating, and
updating the MIS.
(b) ITI. This center, in conjunction with the regional centers and the
regional offices of the Division for Supervision and Inspection,
would offer in-service training to diverse target groups:
inspectors, supervisors, in-service teacher trainers, headmasters,
head teachers, and teachers of preparatory and secondary schools.
However, in its initial pnase of operations, ITI would give priority
to the training of teacher trainers, headmasters, inspectors, and
supervisors (Table 1). To meet the changing needs of the target
groups effectively, and to adopt innovative approaches in the
development of in-service training programs and materials, ITI would
have adequate autonomy, functioning directly under the Deputy
Minister for Training and Qualifications, with an interministerial
advisory committee to assist in policy development and other
development activities. It would have departments/sections in each
of the following areas of operation: educational management, the
developn.ent of instructional materials, evaluation (.cudent, teacher,
program and school), guidance and counselling, and applied
educational rcseatch. ITI would be managed by a director and two
assistant directors and would have 10 trainers--two in each area--
and other secretarial and technical support staff. It would have the
capacity to conduct in-service training programs for two groups of 40
persons each. The civil works for ITI w;.uld include seminar rooms,
areas for small-group discussion, a library, a computer room, and a
dormitory for 100 person.. including 3U women. The facilities would
incl_ud  auI'li  js  t & .       *C co:tp'.ier facilities linked to MIS
at MCE zind       '        .      cordingly.

h&QI( )'"t'flt o: 1n.;t ., oi'..Mlteial     W Withi project assistance, ITI
would dvvelop traininig s'.stems arid training mater-ials in modular form
in each of t ho abovee-mentLioned areas.  Each area would have three or
more modulte,s, as appropriate.  Each module would also provide
alternative delivery sY.Istemrs to facilitate studv at ITI, regional
centers, PTTIs, or identified schools with the guidance of a
proftessional teacher trainer.  Up to 30 staff-months of specialist
services for developing training materials would be financed.  Also,
five fellowships would be financed to enable professional development
and the acquisition of professional diplomas to meet ITI needs
through study in speciallv designed courses.  The Project would
support 20 fellowships of up to 12 staff-moniths each:  10 for the ITI
and 10 for the regional centers.
(d) Resources for Regional Centers. Inspectors are responsible for
identifying the development needs of school staff on administrative/
management aspects, and supervisors are responsible for identifying
such needs on academic/teaching and learning aspects. Both would
engage in-service training activities at the regional offices or
identified schools. The Project would provide two vehicles
appropriate to the terrain and office furniture and equipment to each
of the regional offices of the Division for Inspection and
Supervision.
(e) Professional Development of MOE Staff. Improving the quality of
teaching-learning processes in schools would also require improved
curricula, teacher guides and textbooks, audiovisual materials, and
an effective system of student assessment. The Project would provide
international fellowships--twelve fellowships of six staff-months
each and six fellowships of 12 staff-months each, for a total of 144
staff-months--to identified personnel of the curriculum, audio visual
aids, and examination sections of MOE. The specialist services and
fellowships, including those mentioned in (c) above, would be planned
through a twinning arrangement with an identsjied overseas
institution or institutions which would have the capahility to
provide the required services and fellowships. In order to identify
such institutions, three senior administrators from MOE, responsible
for in-service training, would form a study group and :ecommend
appropriate institutions.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Improvements in Planning and Management
The Problem
1.       The recruitment and deployment of teachers is a dynamic process which
must each year be adapted to the realities of supply of the candidates for
teacher training, the existing supply of teachers, and projections of future
needs. Not only must numbers be decided, but policies designed to implement
programs for teacher training and deployment must be reviewed regularly to
assure that they are still realistic and appropriate. What mechanism should
be adopted to provide overall guidance on the complicated issue of setting
policies for teacher recruitment and deployment? The following paragraphs
outline the situation in more detail, concentrating mainly on secondary
teacher requirements and deployment, although much of the discussion applies
to primary teachers as well.
2.       How many teachers will be reguired?  Until the present, and for the
foreseeable future, Yemeni teachers are in such short supply that it has not
been necessary to look carefully at supply and demand. However, as a result
of many investments directed towards supplying teachers, it is now possible to
aniticipate a time when such planning will be necessary, and the groundwork
should be laid now.  Efficient and effecti._ decisions will require:  (i) more
systematic planning about the rate of expansion of schooling at all levels;
(ii) better data on overall teacher requirements, including attrition rates
and estimates of teacher mobility from one area to another; (iii) all data on
teachers to be disaggregated by gender; and (iv) agreement on a systematic
annual process for reviewing the available information and making decisions
about enrollments and deployment and policies to further agreed objectives.
3.       How many students should be admitted to FOEs?  This decision must be
based on projected needs and the capacity of FOEs to provide good quality
training. Allowing larger enrollments than can be effectively handled is a
short-term solution that will cause long lasting problems which will be
difficult and expensive to solve. Looking at teacher needs by subject will
become increasingly important as requirements for some subject teachers become
saturated. Many countries produce excess numbers of some subject teachers and
have significant shortages in others. Two important reasons for this
situation are: (i) enrollment numbers in different departments are based on
the capacity of the department rather than the need for the graduates; and
(ii) no attempt is made to set limits on enrollments, so allocation among
subjects largely reflects student preferences. Yemen is in an excellent
position to avoid these problems by adopting appropriate policies for
recruitment and training at an early stage of system development.
4.       How many students should be admitted to the one-year training
program? The one-year training program should be an effective route for
training teachers for many years. Because the training time is short, the
program can be used to alleviate specific shortages of subject teachers, as
well as provide an alternative career path for university graduates with

5.       vi;it Ss pcific policies and programs ara needed to encourage rural
StudLntItS .ind v;)mon to be-m'ine teachers?  An overriding aim of the Government,
at pr.esvnt and in the future, will be to fully staff iural schools and girls
schools with Yerrneni teachers Specific policies to attract students to
training progratns and qualified teachers to rural areas will be needed.  As
circulrstatces changj,,e, these po' icies will need to be modified.  Thus, an
annual review of the need for specific policies, and their effectiveness, will
be required to address the continuing need to recruit and deploy women and
teacihers in rural areas.
6.        For each of these broad areas, many specific decisions are required.
While some decisions can be expecced to be appropriate over the long term,
others will need regular review. Some examples: (i) In the one-year program,
should graduates be hired before training, or given a stipend? (ii) Who should
get stipends and what should be the amount? (iii) What regulations should
govern when students lose their stipends? (iv) How can special recruitment
programs be made more effective? (v) What should be the nature of the
employment obligation of students who receive stipends, and how are such
requirements to be enforced? (vi) Do present employment regulations create
problems for women and, if so, how should they be changed?
Coordinating Structure
7.       Many governmental agencies and institutions in Yemen have a
legitiimate interest in teacher recruitment and deployment policies, including
the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Education, Higher Education, the Civil
Service, and the universities. During appraisal, the Government agreed to
establish a structure to coordinate the formulation and review of an
appropriate policy framework within which the Project would function. The
structure would have three tiers: (i) the secretariat or the MOE working
group; (ii) the Education Subcommittee, a new interministerial committee; and
(iii) the Advisory Group for Trained Manpower (AGTM) under the newly created
Ministry of Manpower Planning. Each tier is described below.
8.       The secretariat or MOE Working Group would be chaired by the Deputy
Minister for General Education and would include the Deputy Ministers and
Directors representing Teacher Training, Planning, and Finance and Statistics;
the Department for contractors and expatriate teachers, administration, and
perscnnel: the technical bureau; and any other relevant MOE offices.
9.       The Education Subcommittee would be chaired by the Minister of
Education and would include the Ministers of Higher Education, Planning and
Development: the Civil Service or their designated representatives;, the Vice
Rectors of the Universities; and two Deans of FOEs (on a rotating basis).
10.      The Advisory Group for Trained Manpower (AGTM) - uld be chaired by
the Deputy Prime Minister for Manpower Development and *.ould include the
ministers of key ministries that need trained manpowctr (education, health,
agriculture. inductrV, canning and development, ci-ol service, and the
rectors of the universities),

III.    'rhi  w main purpose of the AGTM would be to review the requirements of
yplil ifi.(d mnanipower oil .1n aannual basis and to provide direction to the tertiary
e(w.,lt ion svstem  to meet thiese needs.  With reference to secondary teacher
trainlling supported under the Project, the AGTM would: (i) agree annually on
appropriate enrollments in the universities to meet national teacher needs, by
s;ujtect specialties; (ii) adopt or recommend to the Cabinet, as appropriate,
policies regarding incentives, including stipends, to encourage the output of
graduates in short supply, both for specific subject specialties and to meet
specific regional and gender needs; and (iii) review the existing policy
framework on an annual basis to adjust policies to meet changing needs.
12.      The Education Subcommittee would be responsible for:  (i) agreeing
annrilly on a plan for university admissions for secondary teacher training in
the f(ur- and one-year programs. The plan would provide target numbers of
students by specialties; (ii) making adjustments in the stipend and
recruitment policies and other incentives in order to recruit into high
priority specialties and support students who agree to teach in girls' schools
and regions in short supply of teachers; (iii) submitting a report to the AGTM
on compliance with the previous year's decisions; and (iv) seeking
Government/Cabinet approval on new policy measures by recommending such
measures to AGTM.
13.      The MOE Working Group would each year:  (i) analyze the implications
of the policies of the MOE regarding expansion of secondary education, student
teacher ratio, and other issues related to teacher needs, and projections of
students completing basic education; (ii) collect and analyze data from each
governorate regarding teacher supply and projected needs in each
specialization; (iii) analyze the effectiveness of stipends and other
incentives and recommend changes in targeting policy as necessary to meet
existing shortages; (iv) on the basis of policies and information, develop
recommendations to be presented to the education subcommittee regarding
admissions to the FOEs in four-year and one-year programs; and (v) report on
the implementation of decisions made the previous year. To support the
Working Group, the Project would finance 38 staff-months of specialist
services and 24 staff-months of fellowships.
14.      As the coordinating structure gains experience and establishes
working mechanisms, its terms of reference would be broadened from secondary
teacher training to other subsectors. This would also require the setting up
of seperate working groups in respective subsectors. The implementation plan
for all of the above actions are detailed in the attachment.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Development Projects
1.       A Development Project Fund would provide financing for proi:..cts to be
carried out by educational researchers and practitioners in the Republic of
Yemen. The aims of the Fund would be to:
(a) stimulate innovation through cooperative action between school
personnel and other professionals;
(b) demonstrate Government interest in, and concern for, educational
change; and
(c) provide an information base of tested evidence and practice on which
to base future education policies and innovations.
2.       The Fund would finance two types of projects.  Some would be
research-oriented and would be expected to produce reliable evidence about
problems facing education in Yemen. Others would be more practical
development projects that would test new ideas for solving problems at the
school or community level. All projects would be expected to satisfy the
following criteria:
(a) the problems studied would be directly relevant to everyday problems
of education in schools and classrooms;
(b) project teams would involve both professionals and practitioners (for
example, trained researchers or university faculty and teachers or
inspectors); and
(c) the Project would be expected to produce results that could be used
in many parts of Yemen beyond the school or site of the original
work.
3.       The Fund would also include financing for annual conferences within
Yemen to disseminate the results of projects supported by the Fund and other
educational research work undertaken in Yemen during each year.
Possible Project Topics
4.       The number of possible project topics is very large.  A few are given
here for purposes of illustration. Studies or projects could be designed to:
(a) improve curriculum and teaching methods, including investigations
about how subjects are now taught; pilot projects to test new methods
or the use of different kinds of educational technology, including



- 70 -                         Annex 8
Page 2 of 3
the effective use of tthe blackboard; or the use of local materials to
carry out scienlce experiments;
(b) address the social problems of women teachers to improve their
effectiveness in the classroom and of girls, to assure that they
receive an education equal in quality to that of boys;
(c) help inspectors and headmasters to become more effective in giving
instructional support to teachers;
(d) improve instructional strategies, for example how to teach Arabic
grammar more effectively, or how to make better use of community
members with special talents;
(e) help communities to maintain school buildings better and headmasters
to run their schools more efficiently and effectively; and
(f) develop more effective methods for evaluating student learning.
Organization of the Fund
5.       The Fund would be headed by a high-level committee, called the High
Supervision Committee (HSC) and managed on a day-to-day basis by a
secretariat. HSC would be chaired by the Deputy Minister for Inspection and
Evaluation. Members would be a high-level representative of ERDC, a high-
level representative from the University of Sana'a FOE, the Assistant Deputy
Minister for Inspection and Evaluation, the Director General of the
Inspectorate Department, and the Director General for Information of the MOE.
As unification proceeds, appropriate additional members would be added to the
HSC. The ERDC representative would serve as the executive secretary of HSC.
HSC would set policy for the fund, select topics for projects, establish
detailed criteria for the evalua.ion of project proposals, review project
results, and make recommendations to the Minister for further action, where
approxriate.
6.       The secretariat would be headed by the Executive Secretary of HSC and
would comprise one or two staff of ERDC and one or two staff from MOE.
Members would be selected by HSC and housed in ERDC. The secretariat would:
(i) coordinate all aspects of the program; (ii) advertise for and receive
applications for grants; (iii) disburse and monitor funds to grantees; (iv)
provide support to grantees if required; (v) receive reports and provide
technical review; (vi) publicize the program and disseminate products; (vii)
manage the annual conference; and (viii) provide regular reports to the HSC.
7.       Suggested procedures for selecting projects would include (i) for
projects identified as "designated project," HSC would identify the topic and
good candidates to carry out the work; and (ii) for other projects, any
interested people in ROY could submit proposals which would be reviewed by the
secretariat and the HSC; and the best would be selected for funding.
Proposals could come from school personnel (headmasters, teachers,
inspectors), from researchers at the research centers or from university
faculty.



- 71 -                        Annex a
Page 3 of 3
8.       About five projects a year would be funded.  Projects would be
expected to cost between US$5,000 and US$10,000. Any project costing more
than US$10,000 would need to be reviewed by the Bank. IDA funds would be used
to finance costs of travel, data collection and analysis, report preparation,
and travel and subsistence to attend the conference at which the results would
be reported. IDA funds would not be used to provide honoraria or other
compensation for those undertaking the projects bevond their expenses as
identified above. Those undertaking projects woulu be expected to contribute
their time or find other sources of support. Contracts between project teams
and HSC would follow standard government procedures and would conform to local
regulations established for IDA Credits.
Budget
9.       Projects would be costed at an average of US$10,000.  About 20
projects would be funded. An additional US$50,000 would be budgeted to
support the cost of four annual conferences to review project results.
Tentatively, the total cost is set at US$250,000. Additional funds could be
used to finance additional studies.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECONDARY TEACHER TRAINING PROJECT
Terms of Reference for a Study of Postsecondary Education
1.       Two institutions provide higher education in Yemen: the University of
Sana'a (UOS). with its main campus in Sana'a and four provincial campuses; and
the University of Aden (UOA), with three regional campuses. The two
universities are relatively new (UOS opened in 1972, UOA in 1973), but in
their short existence, enrollments have grown dramatically; in 1986-87,
enrollments at UOS were 21,000, and in UOA, 4,800. Policies regarding
enrollment were quite different in the North and the South. UOS opened its
doors to all students who qualified for entrance, and the Government
guaranteed jobs in the public sector to all its graduates. In the South,
student numbers were prescribed by the Government and distributed among
faculties based on analyses of manpower needs. Entrance was through
competitive examination.
2.       Recently, the open-entrance policy at UOS has resulted in an
increasing number of graduates who are not needed by the civil service: in
some fields this is because the numbers are becoming too large and in others
because there is a mismatch between graduates' fields of study and
requirements. Some of the overflow has been absorbed by students going
overseas for training, but financial resources place a limit on the number for
whom that is a viable option. UOA, while also guaranteeing employment to
graduates, has avoided the overproduction of graduates by strictly limiting
enrollment. With unification, the Government faces the problem of developing
policies that meet needs and expectations in both the North and the South.
Furthermore, there is growing pressure to examine the instructional programs
at the two universities and decide in what respects they should remain
different and in what respects they should adopt common objectives and
requirements. The proposed study would address the problems arising from
these changes.
3.       Nonuniversity postsecondary education in Yemen is provided in COEs in
th, South and in diploma programs offered by NIPA and specialized ministries,
for example, Telecommuniations, in the North. Total enrollments are less than
10 percent of university enrollments. The Government plans to expand training
middle-level skilled manpower through the establishment of community colleges
with two-year postsecondary programs. The establishment of a polytechnic is
also planned, to be financed by an IDA credit.
4.       Until rezently, most employment in Yemen has been in the public
sector, but the private sector, though small, is growing rapidly. Thus, the
past weak linkages between the private sector and postsecondary training must
be strengthened. The results of the present study would be expected to lead
to greater understanding of the trends in the need for skilled manpower.
Purpose and Objectives
5.       The purpose of the study would be to analyze past enrollment policies



-73-                           Annex 9
Page 2 of 3
and practices and their consequences, examine future requirements for educated
manpower, and make recommendations to the Government with the objective of
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing postsecondary
education system and diversifying the training system so that the needs for
educated mannower in Yemen can be better met in the future. Specif4cally, the
study would examine:
(a) existing evidence on present and anticipated employment patterns and
the implications of these for the types of postsecondary education
Yemen should provide in the near-and medium-term;
(b) expected governmental and nongovernmental demands for university
graduates and the implications for the numbers of students enrolled
and the disciplines that are taught;
(c) regulations regarding qualifications for entrance and promotion, and
the duration of study in postsecondary institutions, and how these
would need to be changed to improve the efficiency of the system;
(d) the role of the Government as an employer and the regulatory changes
that would be needed to rationalize hiring into the civil service;
(e) employer perception of the relevance and quality of education
provided by existing postsecondary educational institutions and the
implications for improving the quality of instruction;
(f) the effectiveness of university planning, management and budgeting
procedures, and the sources and uses of university finance, including
levels and methods of cost recovery; and
(g) the trade-offs between in-country and overseas postgraduate training
and the implications for phasing the establishment of postgraduate
programs in Yemen.
Methodology
6.       To accomplish its objectives, the study team would:
(a) examine intake, repetition and dropout, and graduation data for the
past decade, at all postsecondary institutions;
(b) review instructional programs at both universities with regard to
program or course requirements, the flexibility of study programs,
graduation requirements, regulations governing transfer from one
program to another, and other structural aspects of the instructional
programs;
(c) review all policies and practices regarding tuition, fees, financial
incentives, housing, and subsistence costs;
(d) conduct a tracer study, using samples of graduates large enough to
generalize about employment patterns after graduation from different
institutions;



- 74 -                          Annex 9
Page 3 of 3
(e) interview key policymakers in both the North and South and
representative major employers; and
(f) gather such other data as deemed necessary to meet the objectives of
the study.
Resources Required
7.       The study would be conducted by a team of foreign and local
consultants. Six person-months oF foreign consultant time, twelve person-
months of local consultant time, avd support for local travel and expenses
have been budgeted for this purpose. The consultants would work closely with
a counterpart team , constituted by January 1992, consisting of experts from
MOHE, UOS, UOA, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Development. The team
would work under the direction of the Vice Rector of UOS.
Schedule
8.       The study should be completed by January 1994.  Preliminary studies
should, however, be completed by June 1993 to provide justification for
support to future lending operations in post secondary education.

/a   Although student/staff ratios will increase from 100:1 to 60:1 by 1996,
salary increases would be minimal due to expatriate faculty replacement.
/b   Increases result from use of better equipment, building maintenance and
additional costs of teaching materials due to improving curricula and
teaching methods.
/c   Savings result from introduction of one-year program.  Further savings
possible with stipend targeting.
/d   Increases result from increased training activity in ITI.
NOTE: Since there is an overall decrease in recurrent costs, annualized
capital costs have not been shown above.
