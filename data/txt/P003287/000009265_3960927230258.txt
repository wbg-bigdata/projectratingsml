concentrated with two companies controlling about 65Z of the industry's
output.   PC, a parastatal organization that markets through the private
sector, is the only other main supplier of industrial wood.
4.  FP was established in 1954 as a publicly-owned parastatal organization
with two distinct roles: commercial operations and government-directed
activities. FC's commercial operations are financed by its earnings and
loans while the government-directed activities are financed by annual
advances from Government. The loans for initial plantation development (about
Z$50.0 million) were advanced to FC as loans rather than as equity capital.
Government acknowledged that these loans should have been advanced to FC as
equity and has agreed to convert them into equity within the context of a
financial restructuring program for all of its revenue earning parastatal
organizations. PC's commercial operations are efficiently managed. It has
a sound operating policy and its commercial activities are profitable. As
of June 30, 1989, FC had a net income of Z$3.4 million oI 26.82 return on
capital and 3.5? return on total assets which are higher than FC's
competitors in the private sector.   FC's competitors meet most of their
foreign exchange requirements through official allocation and some assistance
from foreign-based parent companies; privately owned small-scale enterprises
(furniture and wood carving) have access to foreign exchange through a Bank
funded foreign exchange loan facility in the Zimbabwe Small Enterprises
Development Corporation; FC only has access to an official allocation which
is generally insufficient.
5.     The goverumeni-ditected activities of FC include implementing and
enforcing the Government's forest conservation programs and regulations in
the forestry subsector.   FC promotes rural afforestation and indigenous
woodland management, provides forestry extension services and regulates the
exploitation of forest reserves in close cooperation and coordination with
various government and private agencies (women's groups and NGOs) involved
in forestry or related activities.   FC currently charges stumpage fees
ranging from Z$24 to Z$52 per m3 depending on the species and these are
considered adequate. The IDA-financed Rural Afforestation Project (RAP), a
pilot operation, was designed to strengthen the FC's capacity to administer
indigenous forest conservation by financing forestry extension services and
manpower development. The performance of RAP in achieving its objectives was
mixed but it succeeded in establishing 72 nurseries, producing 17 million
seedlings and improving PC's capacity to implement the afforestation program.
It also supported indiv,iduals, schools and groups in CAs to engage in tree
planting and nursery development.
6.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Bank involvement is necessary to
continue the development of FC as an effective national institution for
forestry research, for woodland management and conservation of indigenous
forests, and for efficient utilization of forest resources. Continued Bank
support to PC would also minimize the chances of a further increase in the
market concentration of the wood industry which could adversely affect the
industry's efficiency. With RAP just ended, the institution-building and
afforestation program initiated under RAP need to be maintained, particularly
strengthening FC's capacity in environmental monitoring and conservation.



MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO ZIMBABWE
FOR A FOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Zimbabwe for US$14.5 million are submitted for your approval. The proposed
loan would be repayable over 20 years, including a grace period of five
years, at the standard variable interest rate.   It would help finance a
program to improve the efficiency and management of Zimbabwe's forest
resources. The project would be co-financed by BADEA for US$9.4 million,
DANIDA for US$9.4 million and CIDA for US$1.0 million.
2. Background. The forestry sub-sector contributes about 3Z to Zimbabwe's
total GDP. It provides all of the country's timber and construction poles,
and about 60Z of its total energy requirements. Together with agriculture,
it directly provides employment and income to more than two-thirds of the
country's population.   Forests, which cover about 23 million ha (59S of
Zimbabwe's total area), also generate considerable income through recreation
and tourism, and protect the environment.   About 10.5 million ha of the
forests are located in the Communal Areas (CAs) where the majority of the
country's smalTholder farmers live, 5.6 million ha are protected forest areaa
and reserves, and the remaining 6.9 million ha are owned by commercial
farmers. Industrial plantations comprise about 100,000 ha, of which 35,000
ha are owned by the Forestry Commission (PC) and the balance (65,000 ha)
belong to the private sector.
3.        The Government's objectives for the forestry sub-sector, as stated
in its National Conservation Strategy, are to promote sustainable resource
use, rehabilitate degraded resources, preserve the environment, and make
forest utilization more efficient.  To achieve these objectives, policies
which are being pursued include planning and regulation of land use,
provision of incentives for rural afforestation (nursery and woodlot
development, seedling dise.ribution, etc.), conservation and control of
exploitation of indigenous forests through effective woodland management and
stumpage rates, and development of an efficient wood processing industry for
domestic and export markats. However, the forestry sub-sector is presently
beset with some problems. Forests are being depleted, particularly in CAs
(due to tree cutting for fuelwood and poles, and clearing of forest lands for
agriculture).   If this is not managed properly,  it will have serious
envitonmental consequences.   The wood processing industry  (logging and
sawmilling) is oligopolistic with considerable barriers to entry because of
access to raw material.  The major raw material for sawmill operations is
timber from plantations and these plantations are owned by the few existing
sawmilling firms.  Consequently, the market for industrial wood is highly



- 3 -
The Bank is also supporting government programs (ongoing and in the pipeline)
which are designed to reduce land pressures and preserve the environment.
These include: (i) the Research and Extension Project which is developing
appropriate technology and disseminating it to farmers to enhance efficient
utilization of land and forest resources; (ii) the Population Sector Report
and Family Health Project which are assisting Government to develop and
implement appropriate population policies, especially strengthening family
planning programs; (iii) the review of land policies, including land tenure,
land redistribution and resettlement schemes aimed at efficient utilization
of land resources; and (iv) the preparation of a Tropical Forestry Action
Plan by FY91 which would rationalize  forestry policies.   The proposed
project, by improving forest resources management, would be consistent with
the Bank-supported program of environmental protectlon.  In addition, the
Bank support is needed to complement and help coordinate ongoing and future
activities by other donors such as DANIDA (rural forestry), GTZ
(agroforestry), CIDA (wildlife and forest grazing management), ODA (forestry
research), FINNIDA (commercial forestry), and Italian Aid (industrial
forestry education).
7. Proiect Obiectives. The project has three closely related objectives:
(i) conserving indigenous forests and the environment as well as sustaining
the production of fuelwood and other wood products by promoting tree planting
and woodland management in CAs; (ii) improving forest management and control;
and (iii) improving the efficiency   of the wood-processing industry and
product quality by expanding and upgrading FC's logging, extraction,
sawmiliing and manufacturing operations from its own established industrial
forest plantations.
8. Project Description. The project, which would be implemented over seven
years, comprises: (i) a Rural Forestry Component (US$23.8 million) which
would redress forest depletion and implement sound environmental practices
by financing afforestation programs in CAs nationwide (production and
distribution of 32.6 million seedlings, involving women's groups and NGOs in
tree planting, and institution strengthening) and providing support for a
woodland management program (developing models for village participation in
woodland management) and agroforestry development (testing indigenous tree
species for agroforestry and on-farm testing of agroforestry models); (ii)
a Wildlife and Forest Grazing Component (US$1.4 million) which would provide
for the conservation of natural resources thrcugh a pilot scheme in forest
and wildlife resource management (creation of 64,000 ha of wildlife buffer
zones in two critical locations and development of models for involving
villagers in adjacent areas in management and benefit sharing); and (iii) a
Commercial Forestry Component (US$38.9 million) which would help increase
efficiency in the commercial wood processing industry by providing FC with
equipment to expind and rehabilitate its sawmills. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$64.1 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$38.2 million (60Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown  in  Schedule  A.    Amounts  and  methods  of  procurement  and  of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Zimbabwe are in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7824-ZIM dated February 26, 1990,
is also attached.

9.   Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government agreed to take
actions which would strengthen FC's financial viability and enhance its
efficiency in woodland management.   These includes   (a)  converting its
outstanding loans to FC into equity by not later than October 1, 19901 (b)
fully reimbursing FC for all government-directed activities through annual
grants; (c) establishing a forest researcS program for indigenous species
by December 31, 1990; and (d) reviewing stumpage fees annually, commencing
not later than July 1, 1991, and adjusting them to ensure tbat they remain
at appropriate levels.
10.   Justification and Risks.  The project would contribute positively to
the preservation of the environment in CAs ar.d wildlife through its tree
planting program, and through the involvement of farmers in forestry
management.    About  220,000  families would  benefit  from  the  seedling
distribution program.   Furthermore,  strengthening of FC would lead to
increased efficiency in the management and utilization of forest resources
in the future. The project, by working through schools, women's groups and
NGOs. would also increase people's awareness of the importance of trees in
conserving  the environment.    The project benefits would  also  include
increused fuelwood, pole, sawnwood and pulpwood production as a result of
expanded tree planting and effective management of indigenous woodland,
increased capacity of timber processing and better recovery of lumber. The
main project risk would be lower than anticipated response of individual
farmers and target groups (project beneficiaries) to tree planting for
fuelwood, poles and other wood products which they would otherwise obtain
free of charge from indigenous forests.   Although experience during the
implementation of RAP indicated that tree planting is becoming popular among
farmers in CAs, close monitoring and review are essential. For this purpose,
the design of the project includes an action program to systematically
monitor the involvement of project beneficiaries in project implementation
and to enable FC to make necessary remedial adjustments during project
implementation.
11.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
