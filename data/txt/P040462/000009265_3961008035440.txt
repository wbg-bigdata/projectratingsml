MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A PROGRAM OF ESSENTIAL SOCIAL SERVICES
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) with the guarantee of the United
Mexican States, for the equivalent of US$500.0 million to help finance a Program of Essential
Social Services (PROSSE). The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 15 years, including three years of grace. NAFIN would be the Borrower and the
Secretariats of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), Public Education (SEP), Health (SSA), Labor
and Social Welfare (STPS) and Social Development (SEDESOL) would be the executing
agencies.
2.    Background: Facing near-depletion of its foreign reserves, the Government of Mexico
(GOM) was compelled to float the peso on December 20, 1994. A currency crisis ensued and, as a
result, the economy is contracting sharply this year. The origins of the crisis, the Government's
economic program for dealing with it, and an assessment of medium-term prospects are detailed
in the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which is being distributed concurrently with this
Memorandum.
3.    The crisis in Mexico has prompted the Bank Group, in coordination with the Intemational
Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United States and other G-10
countries, to respond with a major program of support. The proposed PROSSE initiative is an
important component of the assistance efforts of the IBRD and the IDB, in response to the crisis.
4.    Social Implications and the Social Sectors. Economic conditions are expected to
remain extremely difficult in Mexico over the next 18 months. Open unemployment has already
risen sharply and is expected to increase further, with estimates of up to one million job losses in
1995 (the unemployment rate had reached 5.3 percent by February 1995, its highest level since
1987). Real wages will also decline sharply and poverty, which already affects about 34 percent
of the population in varying degrees, is likely to increase. The GOM's economic program calls
for a very strong fiscal adjustment, which necessarily requires major real cuts in aggregate public
expenditures and defers a number of important investment programs and projects.
5.    The GOM is deeply concerned about the possible dual impact of increasing poverty and
the reduced budgetary resources available for essential social services targeted to the poor, and is
therefore committed to protecting key social expenditures and to strengthen existing safety net
measures. For that reason, in its revised programmable federal budget for 1995, the GOM has
increased the allocation to social sector expenditures from 52.6 percent (1994) to 55.4 percent in
1995. The costs of the key social sector and safety net programs amount to 7.7 percent of total
social sector expenditures programmed for 1995. To help finance these programs, the GOM is
requesting US$500.0 million from the World Bank, and US$500.0 million from the IDB, to be
disbursed over the two year period 1995-96.
6.     In the education sector, failure to protect essential basic education (preschool, primary
and lower secondary) expenditures could undermine the very high net enrollment rate of 98



percent, particularly for children in poor and isolated rural areas and indigenous populations,
prevent attainment of increased access for these groups, and reverse the improvement in the
quality and efficiency of basic education made so far in the 1990s. The GOM is seeking to
protect investments in essential inputs to the sector, such as textbooks, so that educational
quality, cognitive achievement, and thus the efficiency of expenditures across the sector, can be
maintained, and so that the basic educational opportunities for the vulnerable poor can be
expanded.
7.    In the health sector, further cuts in expenditures on essential health services for the poor,
who do not have health insurance coverage and therefore rely upon the SSA for their basic health
care, could widen the existing large disparities in health status between geographic regions and
income groups. Already life expectancy stands at 55 years in rural areas, versus 71 years in urban
areas; and 53 years among the poor, as compared to 73 years among the wealthy. Similarly, infant
mortality ranges from 20 per 1,000 in richer states to more than 50 per 1,000 in the poorer
southern states. The budget for cost-effective preventive and curative interventions targeted to the
poor need to be protected to prevent an exacerbation of these disparities. The GOM is seeking to
protect the budget allocations for the basic health care for the poor and to raise the efficiency of
service delivery.
8.    With respect to key social safety net schemes, the GOM expects a markedly increased
demand due to the economic crisis. Therefore, it is seeking external support for selected
programs which it considers to be relatively effective and to address the most acute priorities.
These include: (i) retraining and employment generation, expansion of the ongoing Labor
Retraining Program (Programa de Becas de Capacitaci6n para Trabajadores: PROBECAT) for
unemployed workers and for a temporary employment program (Programa Especial de Empleo:
PESE), announced by President Zedillo on March 17, 1995, which would generate approximately
555,000 temporary jobs in 1995 in priority regions confronting the highest indices of open
unemployment and poverty; and (ii) the high priority food and integrated nutrition program,
which is well targeted to vulnerable population groups, such as young children, pregnant and
lactating women, in the poorest states and integrates food, nutrition and other basic social
services.
9.    Program Objectives: The PROSSE has three objectives, to: (a) protect essential social
services for the poor, through the provision of textbooks to all students, and on a targeted basis,
teaching materials, maintaining access to pre-school, primary and lower secondary education in
isolated rural areas, provision of a basic health care package, vaccines, pharmaceuticals and
medical supplies, and community health outreach campaigns to the uninsured population; (b)
strengthen existing social safety net measures, to cushion the poor from the effects of the
economic crisis through retraining, the creation of short term employment opportunities for the
unemployed and underemployed, and a nutrition program targeted to vulnerable groups in the
poorest areas; and (c) lay the foundation for measuring and implementing efficiency gains in
the social sectors over the medium term through technical assistance and program monitoring.
10.   Program Description: The PROSSE has been designed as a time slice operation to
finance ongoing high priority social sector programs within the existing budget allocations. It
consists of five sub-programs: (a) basic education services; (b) basic health services; (c)
retraining and employment generation; (d) an integrated nutrition program for vulnerable
groups; and (e) monitoring and evaluation of social sector programs. In each sub-program, the



GOM will seek to improve the efficiency of public expenditures, within the constraints of the two-
year implementation period, using agreed monitoring and evaluation indicators. Each of these
sub-programs is summarized below:
11.   The basic education services sub-program (total cost US$593.5 million or about 29.7
percent of total costs), to be implemented by SEP through dependent agencies, includes:
*  the provision of pre-school and primary school education to children in remote rural areas,
indigenous populations and in low income urban areas, through the National Council of
Educational Development (Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo: CONAFE);
*  the production and distribution of 91.5 million textbooks for primary education and 7 million
teacher guides, through the National Textbook Commission (Comisi6n Nacional de los
Libros de Texto Gratuitos: CONALITEG) and a productivity study on CONALITEG
operations; and
*  the improvement of access to rural preschool and primary education (serving rural, indigenous
and low income urban children), and rural lower secondary education utilizing television
(Telesecundaria), through improvements to and construction of new facilities constructed by
the Federal School Construction Committee (Comite Administrativo del Programa Federal
de Construccion de Escuelas: CAPFCE).
The IBRD loan would finance the costs of production, acquisition and distribution of textbooks.
The IDB loan would finance the other costs noted above.
12.   The basic health services sub-program (total cost US$746.5 million or about 37.3
percent of total costs) to be implemented by the SSA, would benefit mostly the population of 33
miillion uninsured through:
.  priority preventive programs, which are cost effective public health interventions, by: (a)
immunizing 20 million children annually against the most common preventable diseases; (b)
control and treatment of endemic and communicable diseases; (c) screening for early detection
of cancer, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, involving over 4 million patients annually; (d)
family planning and reproductive health for about 2.5 million new users per year; (e) maternal
and child health, pre-and postnatal care, benefiting about 9 million individual patients annually;
and (f) health and nutrition education and social marketing of public health programs;
*  basic curative health care, for the uninsured population, delivered through the basic health
care and mobile outreach units; and
*  health infrastructure, equipment and maintenance for first and second level health facilities and
public health laboratories, scheduled to be initiated in 1995 and concluded by the end of 1996.
The IBRD loan would finance the civil works program, the acquisition, storage and distribution of
vaccines, essential drugs, medical supplies and basic equipment to the first level care network, per
diem and travel for supervision personnel, and community outreach.



- 4 -
13.   The employment generation sub-program (total cost US$644.2 million or about 32.2
percent of total costs) includes two elements: (a) retraining and stipends for 800,000 unemployed
and underemployed workers during 1995 and 1996 through PROBECAT, managed by STPS; and
(b) a civil works program to generate approximately 550,000 short-term jobs in 1995 in
infrastructure development targeted to poor areas with high unemployment through the PESE. In
the case of PROBECAT, at least 150,000 of the trainees would benefit from a new training
modality under PROBECAT, receiving on-the-job basic skills training in areas such as plumbing,
electricity, brick-laying and receiving a stipend to work in rehabilitation and public works
programs in low income areas whilst others would receive training to establish their own small
businesses. The remaining trainees would follow the more traditional PROBECAT modality of
training center and in-plant training. The average stipend would be for three months set at the
level of one minimum wage (currently ranging from N$15 to 18 per day) plus a small transport
allowance. In the case of the PESE, workers would receive compensation set at the level of 80
percent of the minimum wage. Utilizing these two programs, the GOM is seeking a balanced
response to tackle rising urban unemployment and chronic rural underemployment, which is
exacerbated by the contraction of the formal sector. Hence 70 percent of the beneficiaries under
PROBECAT would be urban; whilst 70 percent of the short-term employment under SEDESOL
would be generated in rural areas for works such as road, bridge and canal rehabilitation. The
IBRD loan would finance the cost of training, stipends and up to 10,000 tool-kits required for the
on-the-job training modality, under PROBECAT. The IDB loan would finance the scattered civil
works under PESE.
14.   The integrated nutrition sub-program (total cost US$8.7 million or about 0.4 percent of
total costs) would be based on basic nutrition and health interventions to improve the nutrition
status of vulnerable groups. The sub-program would provide a package of interventions for poor
rural families with vulnerable groups (i.e. with children under age 5, pregnant and lactating
women) consisting of: (a) distribution of a basic food basket containing maize flour, beans,
iodized salt, sugar and vegetable oil; (b) distribution of micronutrients; (c) growth monitoring of
children; and (e) basic nutrition and health education. The community would participate in the
program by assisting in the food distribution process and developing activities such as
construction of latrines, improved water supply, and establishment of vegetable gardens. At the
central level, the SSA and DIF (Integrated Family Development) would be the apex organizations
which would devolve to the states and municipalities the implementation of the program. The
program would be implemented through SSA in 1995 in the state of Hidalgo, and would be
financed by the IBRD loan. The extension of the program to other priority states would be
implemented in 1996 and would be financed by the IDB loan through similar programs under
SEDESOL.
15.   The monitoring and evaluation sub-program (total cost US$2.1 million or about 0.1
percent of total costs) will strengthen the capacity of SHCP to measure and monitor the outputs
of social sector expenditures thus providing the foundation for a system to increase efficiency in
such expenditures over the medium term. Priority would be given to developing the system for
those programs offering the greatest scope for efficiency gains, namely: (a) hospital care; (b)
secondary technical education; and (c) food and nutrition programs. An outline of the
methodologies and work program for this sub-program is attached in Annex 1. The LBRD loan
would finance technical assistance to establish such a system and the costs of physical and
financial auditing and qualitative beneficiary assessments of the PROSSE sub-programs.



16.   Program Costs and Financing: Total costs of the PROSSE are estimated at about
US$2.0 billion. The proposed program would be financed by a Bank loan of US$500.0 million,
and an IDB loan of US$500.0 million, both to be disbursed over the two year period 1995-96,
with the target of disbursing 60 percent of these resources in the critical year of 1995. By
financing and strengthening existing programs both implementation and disbursements will be
accelerated. Retroactive financing in the order of 20 percent of the IBRD loan amount is
proposed to support the GOM's eligible expenditures incurred since February 19, 1995. The
proposed IBRD and IDB loans would finance 50 percent of total program costs, or 54.3 percent
of program costs net of taxes and duties. The two loans would finance 100 percent of foreign
exchange expenditures and 38.9 percent of local expenditures, net of taxes. The loans would be
made to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), which would make the funds available to
executing agencies for the implementation of the program. For the IBRD loan, special account in
US dollars with an authorized allocation of US100.0 million (20 percent of the loan amount)
would be established at the Banco de Mexico. A breakdown of estimated costs and financing are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 14392-ME, dated May 22, 1995, is also attached.
17.   Program Implementation: The program would be overseen by the SHCP through the
existing Technical Committee for Budget Integration (Comite Tecnico de Integracion
Presupuestal: COTEIP). The COTEIP is chaired by SHCP (Politica Presupuestal) and includes
NAFIN, other elements of SHCP (such as Credito PuTblico) and would include high-level
representatives of the other PROSSE implementing agencies for this purpose. COTEIP would
monitor overall implementation and oversee the process of physical and financial auditing of
PROSSE activities as a means of laying the foundation for future efficiency gains in social sector
expenditures. SHCP would ensure that the budgetary resources for the programs supported by
the PROSSE would be released in a timely manner. NAFIN would be responsible for ensuring
that the executing agencies adhere to the Banks' procurement guidelines and that the requisite
documentation is prepared promptly for disbursement by the Banks. SEP, together with its
subsidiary organizations - CAPFCE, CONALITEG and CONAFE - would implement the basic
education sub-program. SSA will implement the basic health services sub-program. STPS would
implement the labor training sub-program and SEDESOL would implement the short-term
employment generation sub-program through the state and municipal governments. SEDESOL,
SSA and DIF would implement the priority nutrition sub-program through the state and municipal
governments. SHCP would implement the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.
18.   Program Sustainability: The program will be fully sustainable as it seeks to finance
ongoing high priority Government programs which will revert to full GOM financing after the
anticipated economic recovery.  Furthermore, the efficiency gains anticipated over the
implementation period under the monitoring and evaluation sub-program would help to increase
the cost-effectiveness of the GOM's recurrent expenditures, thus further enhancing sustainability.
19.   Lessons Learned: The relevant lessons which have been learned from the implementation
of Bank-financed projects and incorporated into this program are as follows:
(a)   Education: Quality and Non-personnel Expenditures. The channeling of resources to
non-personnel costs has been instrumental in improving the quality of primary education in
targeted areas. Access to textbooks has been one of the most cost effective education



-6 -
inputs to increase students' academic performance. There is vast empirical evidence,
including studies financed by the Primary Education Project (Loan 3407-ME), indicating
that textbooks improve student knowledge of science, mathematics and language.
PROSSE builds upon this experience by financing textbooks, infrastructure and other
educational materials in rural areas. Access to Basic Education in Rural Areas. Low
access in rural areas is due in part by the poor living standards of the family, and by the
lack of adequate schooling system and infrastructure.  SEP regular services are not
provided in many small rural communities, but a low cost alternative education modality,
with strong community participation, has been successfully developed by CONAFE.
PROSSE would expand infrastructure, mainly in rural areas, and ongoing CONAFE rural
education programs. Targeting. The most effective way to reach the economically and
educationally disadvantaged is by specifically targeting the poor. Both CONAFE and
CAPFCE focus most project activities to the poorest areas of the country.
(b)   Health: The ongoing Bank-financed First Basic Health Project (Loan 3272-ME) was the
first Bank experience with a health related project in Mexico and provided the most
valuable source for lessons to consider in designing the proposed project. Drawing from
the First Basic Health Project, the features that are critical for the SSA to accomplish its
mandate to provide health benefits for the uninsured population are: Targeting. While
the First Basic Health Project targeted poor states,  resources often did not reach
populations most in need within the state. Therefore, it is necessary to target delivery of a
cost-effective basic health care package to the most disadvantaged municipalities within a
poor state. This is the approach being followed under PROSSE. Improve Access to
Basic Health Care. The First Basic Health project supported infrastructure rehabilitation
of first level health centers and second level hospitals in order to provide an environment
suitable for basic services of high quality for the uninsured. It has been demonstrated that
the use factor of rehabilitated facilities increased significantly. PROSSE will continue to
finance the rehabilitation of the first and second level care network to provide quality
services to the uninsured. Rural staffing. The First Basic Health Project supported the
training and recruitment of community health care workers which are selected by the
community where they will serve. They were utilized in the project for staffing health
posts in communities where no medical doctor was available. The PROSSE will build on
this experience and finance training for community health workers to serve remote
communities.
(c)   Employment Generation: Positive Impact of Training Programs and the Need for
Targeting. The Bank's experience with both pre-service and in-service training has
demonstrated their positive impact both in increasing the earnings profile of trainees and
meeting the needs of private and public sector skilled employees. Careful use of the
selection criteria agreed under the Bank-financed Labor Market and Productivity
Enhancement Project (Ln. 3542-ME) will be continued under PROSSE for the regular
PROBECAT programs. However, those trainees with lesser educational attainments and
work experience would be able to participate in the on-the-job training modality. Public
and Private Sector Linkages. Experience has shown that close collaboration is required
between publicly funded training institutions and the private sector to ensure that course
content and graduate output match employers' needs and hence employment opportunities
available. PROSSE will promote a stronger linkage between public and private sector for
the regular PROBECAT program. Flexibility and Adaptability. The economic crisis in



- 7 -
Mexico has focused attention on the need to shift training and education programs away
from rigid courses not directly related to available employment opportunities. PROSSE
responds to this by supporting combined basic skills and direct employment in
rehabilitation programs. Unemployment versus Underemployment. Experience in
Mexico has shown that open unemployment is the tip of the iceberg. A more serious
problem is underemployment, with the need being to increase the productivity of
employees. Under PROSSE, PROBECAT will be opened up to the underemployed in the
informal sector to acquire skills, enhance their productivity an obtain more secure
employment.
(d)   Nutrition: The evaluation of the pilot nutrition-project conducted under the Mexico
Second Agricultural Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3357-ME, FY91) found that: (a)
measurable results should not be expected before two years of program implementation;
(b) the program should be targeted to the places with the highest rates of malnutrition; (c)
the food basket should contain no rnore than a few commodities and yet address
micronutrient deficiencies; (d) implementing agencies at the state level and community
levels should be clearly defined; (e) the nutrition education, including growth monitoring,
needs careful design and integration with the rest of the intervention package; and (f) the
community volunteers need close supervision and monitoring. These lessons have been
incorporated into the integrated nutrition sub-program to be supported under PROSSE,
which will be closely monitored and objectively evaluated.
20.   Rationale for Banks' Involvement: The proposed loan is consistent with the IBRD's
CAS which will be discussed by the Board on June 15, 1995 and the IDB's Country Programming
Paper (CPP) which will be discussed with the GOM later this year. The strategy focuses on the
revival of growth, poverty reduction and human resources development, and environmental
sustainability. The proposed loan is critical to the IBRD's CAS and the IDB's CPP over both the
short and longer term. The loan is one of three proposed IBRD operations responding to
Mexico's current financial crisis. It provides a safety net to the most vulnerable groups affected
by the crisis and helps maintain the gains achieved in social indicators in recent years. Over the
longer term, this project continues the work of both Banks in poverty reduction and human
resource development, which remain key to achieving growth, equity and sustainable development
in Mexico.
21.   The IBRD and the IDB are the major institutions that have financed social sector
investment in recent years and are the only institutions which can provide the magnitude of the
external financial resources to support essential social service programs in Mexico during its
current fiscal difficulties. The Banks have built up an in-depth knowledge of the social sectors in
Mexico through their extensive operations and sector work. The Banks' experience in supporting
project activities in the social sectors, provides the foundation for program improvements which,
although limited due to the short duration of this program, are supported under the PROSSE.
Moreover, the experience gained by the executing agencies with the Banks' policies and
procedures, will facilitate the rapid disbursement of the loan funds, which is essential for purposes
of the overall macroeconomic stabilization program.
22.   Agreed Actions: During negotiations, the Banks and the GOM confirmed that the GOM
would: (a) endeavor to execute budgetary policy in the social sectors, including mechanisms to
protect budgetary allocations to the PROSSE during the financial crisis and measures to increase
efficiency of social sector expenditures, according to the agreed letter of policy intent; (b) release



- 8 -
budgetary amounts in a timely manner to the executing agencies under PROSSE in 1995 in
accordance with the agreed 1995 budget allocations and physical targets included in Annex 2 of
the SAR and that the GOM may substitute an alternative budget, if satisfactory to the Banks, for
the PROSSE prior to June 30, 1995; (c) review the results of the CONALITEG productivity
study and present an action plan to the Banks by July 31, 1996; (d) execute the PESE through
SEDESOL according to the agreed operational modalities; (e) establish a satisfactory system of
social sector expenditure efficiency monitoring indicators no later than June 30, 1996 and that the
system would be implemented throughout the remaining life of the PROSSE; (f) through SHCP,
NAFIN, SEP, SSA, SEDESOL and STPS, would: (i) have the records and accounts for each
fiscal year audited by independent and qualified auditors with a separate opinion provided on
SOEs, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and procedures, and with the
specific current understanding with the Mexican authorities; (ii) furnish to the Banks, no later than
six months after the end of each year, a certified copy of the agreed audit reports; and (iii) furnish
to the Banks such other information concerning the records and accounts as well as the audit as
the Banks would from time to time reasonably request; (g) the GOM would undertake the
Quarterly Reviews of the budgetary releases and physical implementation progress of PROSSE
with the Banks; and (h) prepare a preliminary action plan (including physical targets and budget,
using Annex 2 of the SAR as a basis), for the programs to be supported by PROSSE in 1996 as
part of the November 1995 review, and confirm a definitive action plan for the programs to be
supported by PROSSE in 1996, satisfactory to the Banks, as part of the February 1996 review
and that no changes would be made in the allocations for such programs without prior
consultation with the Banks. There are no conditions for loan effectiveness other than the
standard contractual arrangements and legal opinion conditions applicable to Mexico.
23.   Program Objective and Poverty Category: The PROSSE forms a central part of the
program of targeted interventions for Mexico by protecting essential social services to the poor
and strengthening a low-cost social safety net, through short-term employment generation to
those adversely affected by the economic crisis and food and nutrition programs to the most
vulnerable groups of the population. It thus falls under the Poverty Reduction category. The
essential social services included are focused on the poor in the following manner: CONAFE
works only among the poor (mainly in isolated rural areas); civil works covered under PROSSE
are exclusively in poor rural and peri-urban areas; and the SSA services are self-targeted to the
poor, as they cover only the population without access to the social security system or without the
financial means to utilize the private sector. The labor retraining and employment promotion
program is self-targeted exclusively to the unemployed and underemployed as they are registered
by the state employment services, in the case of STPS, or self-targeted to the poorest, by the
payment at only 80 percent of the minimum wage, in the case of the short term employment
program under SEDESOL. The nutrition program uses nutritional indicators, which have an
extremely high correlation with poverty, and the CONAPO poverty index (based upon 10 census
indicators of poverty) to identify the beneficiary municipios in the selected poor states.
24.   Environmental Aspects: No major environmental issues are foreseen. However, due to
the inclusion of the scattered small civil works physical projects under the employment generation
sub-program, PROSSE is rated category "B" for environmental purposes. The environmental
impact of sub-projects is expected to be handled according to the criteria and procedures agreed
in the IDB financed Mexico Municipal Development Program (Loan ME-0051, FY 95).
25.    Participatory Approach: A number of elements of PROSSE involve strong community
participation, namely: (a) under the education sub-program, the community provides food and



- 9 -
accommodation for the CONAFE community teachers in rural areas, whilst indigenous
populations participate in the development and design of textbooks for indigenous education; (b)
under the health sub-program, community participation is mobilized during the health campaigns;
(c) under the employment sub-program, within the on-the-job training modality of PROBECAT
and in PESE, communities would form committees and make proposals to the municipio for small
infrastructure projects to be managed by themselves (with technical support from the states and
municipios); and (d) the priority nutrition program involves close community participation in:
health and school activities; food distribution logistics; and improvement of rural sanitation.
26.   Program Benefits: The project would help reduce likely increases in poverty brought
about by the economic recession, through preserving essential social services for the poor,
providing training and employment enhancement opportunities for 800,000 unemployed and
underemployed workers over the two year period through PROBECAT, plus approximately
550,000 short-term jobs annually for the unemployed poor through the SEDESOL program,
providing enhanced food and nutrition supplements to women and children in priority areas.
Indigenous populations will benefit in particular from the services provided under the basic
education, health and nutrition sub-programs as these programs are targeted to the poorest areas
where the indigenous populations are concentrated. The primary benefit of the PROSSE for the
selected services and programs is that it commits SHCP and the executing agencies to support
priority programs targeted to the poor.
27.   Risks: The PROSSE is subject to four potential risks: (a) the uncertainty regarding
budgetary allocations; (b) program diversity; (c) that PROSSE programs fail in their targeting
arrangements and efficiency; and (d) failure to disburse adequately as a result of inexperience of
some implementation agencies with the two Banks' procurement procedures.
28.   Dealing with the first risk, uncertainty regarding budgetary allocations, is an essential
element of PROSSE. Mexico continues to face a high degree of uncertainty in terms of the
macroeconomic variables which determine the budgetary ceilings. The GOM has undertaken to
protect high priority social service programs from further cuts under the PROSSE. The Banks
will monitor budgetary releases carefully during implementation on a quarterly basis.
29.   The second risk, program diversity, is being mitigated by concentrating upon a smaller
number of agencies, most of which already have experience with IBRD or IDB procedures.
Cofinancing has also greatly facilitated simplification: for example the IBRD will exclusively
finance the SSA, building upon the MBRD's long operational experience with the SSA; whilst the
IDB will finance the entire PESE under SEDESOL, where the IDB procedures are well adapted
to the realities of a highly decentralized program.
30.   The third risk, is that the PROSSE programs failing either their targeting arrangements or
efficiency gains. All of the PROSSE supported programs are targeted to the poor to varying
degrees, however, there are leakages with even the best targeted programs.  Targeting
effectiveness will be monitored carefully during supervision and through the physical auditing
arrangements. Increasing the efficiency of the programs supported by PROSSE, along with other
social sector programs, will need to be worked out over the medium-term. PROSSE will lay the
foundation and develop methodologies to measure, and provide incentives to increase efficiency
through the monitoring and evaluation sub-program.



- 10 -
31.   Within the fourth risk, a potential problem that could impede disbursements is the
inexperience of agencies such as CONALITEG, DIF, some health directorates and state health
secretariats in Banks' procurement procedures. To minimize this risk, training of procurement
staff in these agencies will be organized as part of the Banks' supervision programs, and technical
assistance will be provided by staff at the Banks' Resident Missions.
32.   Recommendation: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Improving Efficiency in the Social Sectors
I. Introduction
1.   In an effort to improve the efficiency of public expenditure, the Secretaria de Hacienda
y Credito Publico (SHCP) has requested the technical and financial assistance of the Banks to
help link budgetary allocation decisions to performance in the social sectors. This task would
involve: (a) defining output indicators and criteria for success; (b) measuring performance; and
(c) creating incentives to promote efficiency and accountability. The Banks' support would
begin as a sub-program of the PROSSE to be presented to the Board of Directors in June 1995,
but would be expected to be carried out over several years as a technical assistance loan or as a
sector investment program.
II. Rationale
2.    The effort is being undertaken because the GOM perceives there to be potentially large
efficiency gains that could be realized in the social sectors. The need to realize the efficiency
gains is especially important now that there is no longer as much scope for increasing social
sector expenditures by reallocating resources from nonsocial to social sectors and now that
social sector spending accounts for such a large proportion of the total government spending
(more than 55 percent of the federal programmable budget).
3.    During the previous administration, an explicit policy decision to reallocate
expenditures towards the social sectors allowed the operating expenditures of the social sectors
to grow at an average real rate of 11.5 percent at a time when the share of total public sector
operating expenditures in GDP stayed roughly constant (18.9 versus 19.2 percent) and real
GDP grew slowly. Over this time period, the shares of the energy and industrial sectors
shrank from 27.4 and 12.9 percent of the total operating budget in 1988 to 20.0 and 0.3
percent of the budget in 1994, while the share of the social sector budget climbed from 33.2
percent in 1988 to 52.6 percent in 1994.
3.    Already before the recent economic crisis, it was apparent that the period of major
reallocation of the budget was over and, as a result, the rate of increase in social sector
expenditures could probably not continue at the same level as it had in the past. What happens
to the output of the social sectors over the immediate future will now depend more heavily on
the behavior of the real price of the inputs and on increases in the efficiency with which the
inputs are translated into outputs.
4.    As efficiency is defined as the output achieved per unit of input, it is impossible to
analyze efficiency without knowing what outputs are being produced.  A preliminary
assessment suggests that, in Mexico, output indicators are not currently being used to provide
feedback to management in the operation of a program and are not used effectively to help
allocate the budget in the social sectors. The lack of attention to outputs in the social sectors is
not unique to Mexico and reflects, in part, the difficulty inherent in measuring outputs and
establishing causal relationships between program inputs and outputs.



- 20 -                              ANNEX 1
5.    Several countries (notably New  Zealand2, the U.S.3 the U.K., and other OECD
countries4) are attempting to incorporate indicators of output and performance in their
budgetary allocation decisions. Some of the early lessons from this experience are:
(a)    The task is more than just a measurement problem. Explicit attention must be
paid to how the information would be used to help allocate resources;
(b)   It is not enough to identify what indicators are to be used. Explicit criteria for
success should also be established;
(c)    Performance indicators need to be defmed differently at different levels of
government. The performance indicators that would be used as a basis for
budget negotiations between the SHCP and the SSA would be different than
those used for negotiations between the central level and the state levels within
the SSA. Aggregating up indicators used at a lower level does not necessarily
yield a useful indicator at a higher level; and
(d)   Performance targets should be subjected to a reality check.  All too often,
performance targets are chosen without working through what are the
operational implications of meeting them.  If the initial targets were not
achievable in the best of circumstances, the discussions that take place during
annual or midterm reviews of progress tend to be less fruitfil.
6.    Mexico can expect to benefit from  the experience in other countries.  Of course,
Mexico's decision of how much to invest in a system that links performance to budgetary
allocation decisions depends on its specific opportunity costs of investing in information and its
perceived value of the information in making decisions, or conversely the acceptable degree of
uncertainty in decision making. The decision also depends on how public administration is to
be managed in the future. The information required to operate a top-down command-driven
bureaucracy may not be adequate for a system where services may be publicly financed but
privately provided, where central administrative levels set policies and lower levels carry them
out, and where principal-agent problems characterize many intragovemmental relations. In
these circumstances, the principal and agents must reach agreement on what output is desired
and what constitutes adequate performance. If greater flexibility in decision making within the
governnent is to be introduced, the problem of establishing accountability must be confronted.
mI. Approach
7.    Developing a system  that links budgetary allocations to performance in the social
sectors will require efforts over the medium term, but would begin as a component of the
PROSSE project. The effort would be led by the SHCP, with extensive collaboration with the
2 See State Services Commission, New Zealand's Reformed State Sector (Wellington: State Services Commission,
1994).
3 See National Performance Review, From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government that Works Better and
Costs Less (Government Printing Office, 1993) and Kettl, Donald and John J. Dilulio, Jr. (eds.) Inside the

undersecretaries in charge of planning and budgeting within the social sector secretariats. The
Government would receive technical assistance from an advisory team to be formed of experts
drawn from within and outside the Bank.
The activities be conducted in this component are described below.
Analysis of current practices
8.    The first step will be to examine how the process of setting targets and measuring
performance currently operates in Mexico. While this will be explored in more detail later, a
preliminary conclusion is that administrators do set targets for their programs, but little attempt
is made to explore variations in output indicators across similar programs or variations over
time in the same program.
1.    Comparing the targets that have been set for the same peso amount draws attention to
the allocation choices that implicitly are being made. For example, existing budgetary data
suggest that in 1994, N$100,000 could be used either to provide educational services to 102
students through the community primary school, or to 979 students through the PRONASOL
schools. However, the indicators currently in use provide an incomplete picture. In order to
conclude that resources should be reallocated to the PRONASOL schools and away from the
community primary schools, the government would have to have some information on what
students learn in the two programs and whether different population groups benefit from the
two programs.
2.    The targets per N$100,000 for the same program  change over time and vary
considerably from one program to another. In education, community primary schools set a
target of 128 students attended in 1995, versus 102 students in 1994 for the same real
expenditure. Community preschools set lower targets in 1995 than in 1994. In health, the
apparent productivity of general external consultations is proposed to increase by 50 percent
from 1994 to 1995. It is not clear whether the variation in apparent productivity reflects true
differences in productivity gains, differences due to the nature of the clientele served in the
two years or, as is likely in the case of health, problems with the quality and use of the data.
3.   In the near future, the review of the use of output indicators would be extended to
social and rural programs outside PROSSE. In addition, an analysis of the extent to which
budgetary data capture the true costs would be undertaken for a select group of programs. The
programs would be selected based on the relative importance of the program in the overall
budget and on the government's assessment of the potential for efficiency gains.
Identification of Output Indicators
4.    Part of the explanation for an ineffective use of output indicators is that the wrong
indicators are being used. For example, the target used for CONALITEG is how many
textbooks are distributed to warehouses.  A more appropriate measure would be what
percentage of students receive their textbooks and with what delay. In health, it would be
more meaningful to measure immunization coverage than just vaccine doses distributed.
Instead of the number of consultations, it would be better to measure the percentage of visits to
public health clinics that were viewed by the clients as being resolved adequately. As a further



-22 -                             ANNEX 1
example, if the GOM decides that it would like to guarantee the consumption of a package of
essential clinical services, measures would have to be developed to ascertain how close the
government is to providing that guarantee now and to allow the government to track progress
towards meeting that goal.
5.    The GOM, together with the advisory team, will identify a limited set of indicators to
be used in each sector by the June 30, 1996.
Establishment of Criteria for Success
6.    Setting realistic targets for the indicators against which performance can be measured is
as important as selecting the right indicators. In the near future, discussion of performance
relative to the targets and the setting of targets over the next planning period should be part of
a process of negotiation of the budget between SHCP and the social service delivery
secretariats. This discussion should also take place between the central level of the secretariats
that are responsible for setting policy and the lower operational entities charged with carrying
out programs.
7.    A practical approach would be to define the criteria for success broadly, by defining
ranges of acceptable values for each of selected indicators. From a policy perspective, it is
more important to know whether performance is acceptable, rather than whether an indicator
has a particular value. Given the costs and strong assumptions that are sometimes required to
estimate the exact value of an indicator of performance, it will be useful to explore the
possibility of expressing knowledge about the indicator in the form of bounds. In certain
instances, determining bounds on the values of specific indicators may be all that is needed to
take policy decisions. In other instances, stronger maintained assumptions may be required to
yield more informative bounds.
8.    If actual performance (measured by bounds on the indicator) were to overlap or fall
within the acceptable range, this would suggest that there is no pressing problem that requires
management attention. If performance falls outside the range, then there is a problem that
requires further analysis.  If the corrective action fails to improve the situation, the
government may have to conclude that the nature of the intervention is inadequate to deal with
the problem. It may be better to tackle a lower priority problem with a program that works
than a high priority problem with a program that does not work.
9.    Initially, it may be necessary to set wide ranges of acceptable performance, reflecting
considerable uncertainty about what is achievable and measurable. Over time, the ranges
should narrow as new information is acquired. It may also be possible to calibrate the
performance standards with experiences obtained from other countries.
Analysis of Operational Implications of Meeting the Targets
10.   Before ranges for the targets are set, a reality check needs to be undertaken including
the operational implications and productivity implications of meeting such targets. Are the
targets consistent with the resources available to meet them? Are the targets roughly in line
with what has been achieved in other countries?



- 23 -                            ANNEX 1
11.  It is also important to consider the possible adverse consequences of setting specific
targets. In particular, it is important to avoid creating incentives to improve indicators by
restricting services to those at the lower end of the distribution of a specific indicator.
12.   With the participation of operational staff of the social sector secretariats and the
Banks, PROSSE would analyze the operational implications of achieving different targets.
Simulation models of the production processes would be developed to help the government
analyze different scenarios.
Measurement
13.   A critical issue if output or performance indicators are going to be used to help allocate
resources is to define which agencies are responsible for measurement. If the same agency
that carries out the program is responsible for measuring performance, there is a potential
moral hazard problem.
14.   Given that some of the new indicators are likely to be collected at the household level,
INEGI would be used in data collection. This will involve a careful analysis of the data
already collected by INEGI and possibly, reorienting their activities to make the data collection
more useful for policy makers.
15.   A  second issue is to determine the relative efforts directed towards monitoring
outcomes as opposed to measuring the impact of program inputs on outcomes. In some
instances, decision makers may be willing to make decisions based only on monitoring
outcomes. In other instances, policy makers may be interested in attributing the outcomes to
specific program inputs. An example from the education sector reflects this. If, after two
years of being in the program, students do not meet minimum standards, it is difficult to argue
that the program has been successful even if the children may be better off than they were
without the program. From a policy makers perspective, meeting the standards might be
viewed as a necessary condition to establish the program's success. This could be observed by
monitoring the outcomes.
16.   While monitoring the outcomes is useful as a management tool, it does not establish
that the program was instrumental in achieving the results for it is not known how the students
would have fared without the program. Although this is not observable, it is possible to
estimate what the effects would be by comparing the outcomes of participants with a control
group. It is especially important to take advantage of a planned expansion of a program to
learn what the impact of the program is. If a program must be expanded gradually to different
communities, then how the expansion is handled can strongly affect how easy or difficult it is
to draw  conclusions about the program  impact.  If there are 1,000 equally eligible
communities, but only 250 are to be introduced to the program each year, then selecting the
250 communities who will receive the program first by a lottery is not only fair, but also
generates an ideal control group. The last communities to receive the program can serve as a
perfect control group for the first communities to receive the program. However, because
measuring impact is more complicated and costly, it should be done selectively, when the
expected gains from the information would be greater.
Modification of Budgetary Allocation Process

17.  It is not possible to move away completely from budgetary allocations based on
historical trends, especially in the short term. However, if an increased emphasis on output or
performance indicators is to have any effect on the efficiency of the social sectors, what
happens to the indicators must affect budgetary allocations. It is also important to review the
regional allocation of the budget to ensure that budgets are being allocated across states in such
a way as to ensure that targets are met.
IV. Organization
18.   The PROSSE program would finance an institution building sub-program set at US$2.0
million to identify appropriate indicators, establish base lines, formulate strategies for using
performance indicators in negotiating budgets and undertake a program of evaluations,
fmancial and physical audits to measure actual performance. The work should begin in the
very short term as the first draft of the 1996 budget is due to be presented in July 1995. To
the extent possible, the work on improving efficiency should be connected to the budgetary
support provided to the 1995 and 1996 budgets. However, it is important to recognize that the
timing for the two activities may not coincide and that the work on improving efficiency
should go on for a longer period.
Government
19.   This program would be under the general supervision of the Subsecretaria de Egresos
within the SHCP, which would name a full-time coordinator. Extensive participation would
be required of the sector specialists within SHCP as well as representatives of the social sector
secretariats and of INEGI.
Advisory Group
20.   The Bank would form an advisory group, consisting of experts in evaluation and the
use of performance indicators, drawn from within and outside the Bank. The advisory group
would be divided into teams to cover specific areas. Staff from the Banks with operational
experience in Mexico would be paired with the experts in evaluation. The work would also be
expected to benefit from the experience gained from analysis of case studies under the research
project "Evaluation of Social Sector Investments" being managed by the World Bank.
