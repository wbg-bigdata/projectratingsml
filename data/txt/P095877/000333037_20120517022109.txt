1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.A. Integration of Principles of Sustainable Development in Key Sectors

1.       At the outset of the Sustainable Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program (designed as a
series of three operations, the First Programmatic DPL for Sustainable Development, the Second
Programmatic DPL for Sustainable Development, and the Third Programmatic DPL for
Sustainable Development), Colombia had made very significant progress in addressing key
environmental challenges, but still faced serious environmental problems. As estimated by the
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA), carried out concurrently with the preparation of the first
operation in this DPL series, the costs of environmental degradation amounted to 3.7 percent of
Colombia’s GDP. Urban air pollution, and inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene were
identified as priority areas, associated with the most significant costs, which compromised
Colombia’s potential for sustainable economic growth.

2.      Colombia is highly urbanized with 72 percent of its population living in cities. The
consequences of environmental degradation affect the urban poor who often live in makeshift
structures that are temporary in nature, and begin deteriorating virtually from the moment they
are constructed. At the time of appraisal of the first operation, approximately 9 percent of the
population did not have access to an improved water source, and 20 percent of urban centers
lacked sewerage, leading to crowded and often unsanitary conditions. At the outset of the DPL
Program, Colombia had achieved substantial reductions in child mortality, including child
mortality from intestinal diseases, and the progress in this area continues; however, the costs
associated with intestinal morbidity from contaminated water and inadequate hygiene in both
children and adults remain high.

3.      Air pollution is one of the most widespread and serious problems in Colombia’s cities
and industrial corridors. Approximately 50 percent of the population lives in cities with more than
100,000 inhabitants. Outdoor air pollution, especially fine particulate matter such as sulfur in
transport fuels, is an important cause of respiratory illness and deaths from pneumonia.

4.      Air pollution levels in Bogotá, Medellin and Bucaramanga are comparable to those of
Latin American cities with severe air pollution problems, including Mexico City and Santiago.
Measured by average particulate matter (PM) concentration levels, pollution levels in those
Colombian cities—between 50 and 70 µg/m3 of PM10—are nearly twice the levels observed in
Los Angeles, Madrid and Rome, and more than twice the levels in New York and Paris. As
estimated by the World Bank’s 2006 Country Environmental Analysis for Colombia, every year
6,000 people died in Colombia prematurely (nearly half of them in Bogotá); and there were 7,400
new cases of bronchitis each year as a result of urban air pollution. The annual cost of urban air
pollution from PM alone was estimated at 0.8 of Colombian GDP; and air pollution in Bogotá
alone accounted for half of those costs. Another 1,100 fatalities each year were associated with
exposure to indoor air pollution, largely affecting women and children, and resulting from the use
of fuel wood, charcoal, and other solid fuels as primary sources of cooking fuels. High
vulnerability to natural disasters and degradation of water resources—scarcity in hotspot areas
with arid conditions and pollution from urban and rural wastewater and agricultural sources—had
also been identified as priority issues on the environmental agenda.




                                                1
5.       To address these environmental challenges, the Government of Colombia (GOC) has
introduced broad-based reforms and policies to mainstream environmental management and
integrate principles of sustainable development in key sectors. This is in line with the
commitment of the GOC to meet Millennium Development Goal 7, namely to “integrate the
principles of sustainable development into national policies and programs, and reverse the loss of
environmental resources.? The 2002-2006 National Development Plan (Ley 812, Plan Nacional
de Desarrollo 2002-2006: Hacia un Estado Comunitario) issued by the GOC did not include a
specific chapter on the environment; rather it stressed the integration of environmental issues into
national priorities in each sector. Government commitment to achieving the environmental
objectives was further strengthened in the subsequent 2006-2010 National Development Plan
(Ley 1151, Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2006-2010: Un Estado Comunitario) which includes an
extensive chapter on the environment and incorporates the findings and recommendations of the
CEA and the underlying analytical studies that quantified the costs of environmental degradation
and identified priorities in the areas of air quality and water resource management. The
government of Colombia has demonstrated a strong commitment to the achievement of the
environmental objectives of the National Development Plan and the implementation of its
recommendations and made remarkable progress in a series of reforms that strengthened
environmental management, particularly in the area of urban air quality management. The World
Bank support through the Sustainable Development DPL series and the related Technical
Assistance Loan (i.e., the Sustainable Development Investment Project), designed to strengthen
the capacity of the GOC to implement these reforms in the area of environmental management,
proved catalytic for helping the GOC achieve many of those objectives.

6.       At the time of the appraisal of the first operation in the DPL series, the GOC merged
most of the functions of the Ministry of Economic Development (e.g., housing, water and
sanitation, and zoning) with the Ministry of the Environment to create the Ministry of
Environment, Housing, and Territorial Development (Ministerio de Ambiente, Vivienda y
Desarrollo Territorial, MAVDT). This institutional reform has contributed to the integration of
the principles of sustainable development in key thematic areas (e.g., water supply and sanitation,
air quality, urban planning).

1.1.B. Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of SINA

7.       The Constitution of 1991 and Law 99 of 1993 defined the consolidation of the National
Environmental System (SINA), including MAVDT at the national level, 33 Regional
Autonomous Corporations (CARs), and urban environmental authorities (AAUs)—largely
responsible for addressing urban air quality and water quality issues—as well as four research
institutes.

8.      As part of the 2006 Country Environmental Analysis (CEA), institutional assessments
found that SINA would be significantly strengthened through the establishment of a systematic
mechanism for priority setting across environmental programs and subsectors. Despite high levels
of expenditures by SINA to promote linkages between national and regional priorities, the CEA
found no direct correlation between CAR investments and national environmental priorities. One
of the key measures to help strengthen the linkages between those priorities, as recognized by the
GOC and recommended by the CEA, was establishment of systematic monitoring, provision of
environmental information in a transparent manner, and establishment of a consistent set of
environmental indicators.

9.       Another priority identified in institutional strengthening was the improvement of inter-
sectoral and inter-institutional coordination, especially between MAVDT at the national level and

                                                 2
CARs and AAUs at the regional levels. To overcome the coordination problems among CARs,
AAUs and national and other regional agencies, Presidential Decree 1200 of 2004 has established
six sustainable development objectives and 15 impact indicators; these indicators are aimed at
promoting a better linkage between national and regional priorities, strengthening the focus on
results and impacts, and facilitating an evaluation of environmental management by CARs and
AAUs. In accordance with the Decree, the environmental priorities were to be addressed through
10-year Regional Environmental Management Plans (Planes de Gestión Ambiental Regional,
PGARs) and Three-year Action Plans (Planes de Acción Trienal, PATs) that specify the
implementation of the strategic objectives set by PGARs.

1.1.C. Macroeconomic Context at Appraisal

10.     At the time of appraisal of the first operation in the DPL series in 2005, the near
stagnation of Colombia’s economy during the late 1990s gave way to sustained economic growth
and a strengthening of consumer and investor confidence (Table 1). The acceleration of global
economic growth, the falling costs of international credit and the rising prices of Colombia’s
primary exports were part of the reason for the recovery of growth. Domestic factors, such as
improved security and stable macroeconomic policies also contributed to Colombia’s economic
recovery. Due to the rapid expansion of public spending throughout the 1990s and the resulting
high fiscal deficit and the burden of domestic and external debt, vulnerabilities in the fiscal
balance remained despite the progress achieved in the early 2000s. The GOC has significantly
tightened macroeconomic policy since 2006; and public sector debt began to fall sharply as a
share of GDP. The improved economic conditions resulted in rising incomes, a reduction in
poverty, and greater social sector coverage.

11.     At the time of appraisal of the second operation in 2007, Colombia’s economic growth
was expected to slow from 7 to between 4 and 6 percent over the next three years. Inflation had
accelerated and the current account deficit had widened moderately. The main external risk was
thought to be the global economic downturn and a contraction in demand for Colombian exports
from its major trading partners, the U.S. and Venezuela. Together, they purchase almost half of
Colombia’s merchandise exports. The fiscal outlook remained positive, however, and the stock of
public debt remained at a high level, although below its peak level in 2002.

12.      At the time of appraisal of the third and the largest DPL operation in the series during the
fall of 2008, global economic growth began to sharply decelerate as a result of the international
financial crisis, and growth was expected to slow even further in 2009. Despite relatively strong
economic fundamentals, Colombia could not avoid the negative impact of the international crisis.
Colombia’s GDP contracted by 0.3 percent from mid 2008 to mid 2009. There has been a rapid
fall in external demand, with exports declining by 13 percent as of March 2010 compared to the
previous year, in part because of trade restrictions imposed by neighboring countries. Another
inevitable result has been the deterioration of the fiscal and external positions, with the non-
financial Public Sector and the Current Account deficits now projected to exceed three percent of
GDP in 2010. The weakened economic environment played a role in influencing the size of the
third DPL in the series, as the US$450 million requested was more than double the combined
amount of the first two operations.

13.     The Bank has been well positioned to help Colombia improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of the National Environmental System and integrate the principles of sustainable
development into key sectors. Since the mid-1990s, the government and the Bank have been
closely collaborating on a variety of environmental issues, ranging from urban environmental
management to biodiversity conservation in forest ecosystems. This collaboration has taken
various forms, ranging from a comprehensive Country Environmental Analysis to significant
investments in water supply and sanitation and transport. The government appreciates the value
of the Bank’s continued support, as expressed in the Letter of Development Policy and in the
government’s favorable views expressed in the Urban Environmental Management
Implementation Completion Report (ICR).

14.     On January 16, 2003, the Bank’s Board of Executive Directors approved the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Colombia. The CAS proposed continued support on environmental
management issues through a Programmatic Sustainable Development Structural Adjustment
Loan to the environmental reform agenda of the GOC, as outlined in the government’s National
Development Plan. The government and the Bank agreed that a Programmatic Sustainable
Development Structural Adjustment Loan (now Programmatic Development Policy Loan for
Sustainable Development) would be the most appropriate tool to provide reliable financial
support for the implementation of a medium-term strategy for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), particularly Goal 7.




                                              4
15.      To support the government’s efforts to alleviate poverty and help Colombia meet the
targets for the MDGs, the Bank’s strategy, as laid out in the 2003 CAS, pursues the following
goals: (i) achieving fast and sustainable growth, (ii) sharing the fruits of growth, and (iii) building
efficient, accountable and transparent governance. The proposed project adopted a pragmatic
approach to directly support the government’s efforts in the first and the third of the above areas.
Specifically, the DPL program (SusDevDPL) has been designed to help the GOC achieve the
MDGs through: (i) Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Environmental
System (SINA); and (ii) Integrating principles of sustainable development into key sectors, with a
particular emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable groups.

16.    Importantly, the proposed SusDevDPL, along with the complementary Sustainable
Development Investment project, also incorporated key lessons learned from the Colombia Urban
Environmental Management project, which was approved by the Board in FY96 and closed in
FY03. Lessons learned from that project that have been incorporated into the development of the
SusDevDPL, include:

       Projects need to include a mechanism for regular inter-institutional coordination and a
        periodic redefinition of roles and competencies of environmental agencies.

       Results and impact indicators are important for both project follow-up and ex-post
        evaluation, as well as for managerial decision-making.

       Project impacts and their various components depend not only on the availability of
        resources, but also on the leadership and technical capacity of the executing agency.

       Project design needs to include a mechanism for periodic consultation with stakeholders,
        allowing them to evaluate the impact of the agency’s operations and to also provide a
        channel for broader discussion on environmental priorities.

17.     The SusDevDPL also built on the lessons learned from other programmatic adjustment
operations. The “Good Practice Notes for Development Policy Lending? (Internal Report,
October 2004), which reviews the experience with recent adjustment lending, identifies issues of
design and implementation, and suggests a number of good practices for such operations. In
practice, however, the actions that the SusDevDPL supported were only a part of a larger
government reform program that was driven and supported at the Presidential level.

18.      During preparation of the SusDevDPL series, the Bank coordinated with other key actors
in the sector in order to avoid overlapping of activities and program priorities. The DPL Program
was developed in parallel to a grant-financed environmental program supported by the
Government of the Netherlands which focuses on sustainable natural resources management,
conservation, and institutional strengthening of SINA. In addition, the Bank program was
designed to complement the IDB’s work in the sector which focuses on (i) reforestation linked to
watershed management and protected areas, and (ii) cleaner production for the manufacturing
sector. As these activities addressed issues such as natural resource management, protected areas,
and conservation, the Bank funded DPL program chose to focus on those issues which were not
already addressed such as air, water, and urban pollution management.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

19.      The PDO of the SusDevDPL Program has been to support the government of Colombia’s
efforts to move toward achievement of the MDGs, particularly Goal 7 which seeks to ensure
environmental sustainability. Specifically, the program has the following objectives: (i)
Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA); and
(ii) Integrating principles of sustainable development into key sectors, with a particular emphasis
on protecting the most vulnerable groups.

20.      These objectives were to be met through a series of actions, including developing a
results-based framework for planning and monitoring progress of the SINA towards goals directly
linked with sustainable development and achievement of the MDGs; improvements in inter-
institutional coordination and increased public participation in environmental decision-making;
preparation of critical policies and laws that embody sustainable development; and preparation of
critical policies and laws related to air quality, water quality, solid waste management, and
environmental licensing.

21.      Several key indicators were used to track progress throughout the entire SusDevDPL
Program. These indicators included: (i) Improved functioning of the existing intersectoral forum
(namely the National Environmental Council) to set priorities and goals related to sustainable
development, as evidenced by preparation of policy packages which are based upon consensus
among key stakeholders; (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation system established and operational,
providing timely input into environmental decision-making; (iii) National priorities approved on
water and air quality, environmental health, and climate change; (iv) Improved identification of
national environmental priorities, as verified in annual review of PATs; (v) Increased access to
information, as evidenced by public disclosure of progress toward achieving sustainable
development objectives defined in PATs; (vi) Improved identification of environmental priorities
as a result of increased used of SEAs and other instruments to mainstream environmental and
social considerations into the policy formulation process; (vii) Approval of policies by CONPES
based on results of policy-based SEAs; (viii) Improved accountability and clearer definition of
responsibilities among CARs and AAUs; (ix) Improved environmental governance, as evidenced
by increased transparency, accountability, and public participation in the process of issuing
environmental licenses under the new licensing scheme; (x) MAVDT and DNP have
institutionalized instruments for improved environmental management, such as procedural
manuals and monitoring systems of (a) environmental expenditures, (b) sustainable development
indicators linked to MDGs, and (c) water accounts and availability, to improve monitoring,
environmental monitoring systems also adopted by municipalities; (xi) Increase in percentage of
municipalities with medium and high water scarcity indexes that have implemented POMCAs;
(xii) Increase in percentage of children and mothers with appropriate hygiene behavior, compared
with baseline; (xiii) Decrease in the number of open waste dumps by 25 percent, compared with
baseline; (xiv) Decrease in heavy metals and toxic compounds in leachates from solid waste
dump sites that are discharged into urban and peri-urban water bodies by 25 percent; (xv)
Regulatory instruments in place that promote reduction in transport-related TSP, PM2.5, and
ozone levels in cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants; (xvi) Air quality monitoring network
for PM2.5 fully operational, with at least 7 cities measuring PM2.5; (xvii) Sulfur reduction
program implemented, reducing sulfur content in diesel from 1,200 ppm to 500 ppm in Bogotá.

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

22.     The program objectives remained unchanged.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

23.      To support the government’s efforts to alleviate poverty and help Colombia meet the
targets for the MDGs, the Bank’s strategy pursues the following goals: (i) Achieving fast and
sustainable growth; (ii) Sharing the fruits of growth; and (iii) Building efficient, accountable and
transparent governance.

Achieving Fast and Sustainable Growth

24.      Putting the economy back on a rapid, sustainable growth path requires: (i) Exploiting the
synergies between economic growth and environmental management; and (ii) Strengthening
institutional and regulatory arrangements for provision of basic services. The SusDevDPL has
supported policies that help mainstream environmental considerations in key sectors, improve
coordination and strengthen consensus among key stakeholders, while supporting the
development of appropriate fiscal instruments to help facilitate the attainment of environmental
goals.

Building Efficient, Accountable and Transparent Governance

25.      Numerous studies have documented the crucial importance of strengthening
environmental institutions and governance within the SINA in order to enable the attainment of
the GOC’s environmental sustainability objectives. The SusDevDPL has supported actions
which: (i) Strengthen the SINA with respect to environmental decision-making, setting policy
priorities and policy implementation, and monitoring; (ii) Improve the collection, management
and use of environmental data to assist in prioritizing actions and evaluating investment efforts at
the national and regional levels; (iii) Improve coordination between MAVDT, DNP, and CARs;
and (iv) Enhance public participation in decision-making.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

28.     The strong commitment by the GOC to the policy reforms and technical measures
supported by the DPL series, and the timely completion of the specific measures negotiated to be
prior actions with the GOC, have resulted in a timely release of each of the three tranches on or
around the expected release date. The importance of the actions supported by the DPL series is
discussed in the following section on the DPL’s outcomes.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

2.2A Strong Government Commitment

29.      The success of this series of programmatic lending is due to the strong ownership of the
Program by the Government of Colombia (GOC). At the outset of the SusDevDPL Program, the
Bank had to persuade the GOC that some issues, such as urban environmental problems, deserved
priority attention. In the course of the dialogue on the Program, the GOC began to act as the
primary force behind the reforms in the environmental sector, and the Bank has become a partner
in that process. The environmental reform program was integrated in the National Development
Plan 2006-2010, which further reinforced the government’s commitment to implementing and
achieving those reforms.

30.     In addition, the Ministry of Finance, MAVDT, and the DNP have provided stable
leadership and oversight from the outset of the Program and ensured the active participation and
coordination between all ministries and agencies involved in the Program. The commitment of
MAVDT and DNP as key partners for the Program was solidified through a low turnover rate of
key staff within the ministries. Key staff saw the Program through from preparation of the first
DPL in the series to completion of the last, which allowed for a continuity of leadership, vision,
and follow through throughout the entire Program.

2.2.B Sound Analytical Work to Support the Program

31.     The policy reforms undertaken by the GOC in support of the Program were based on a
solid analytical foundation that includes the policy notes prepared by the World Bank for the
GOC (Colombia 2006-2010: A Window of Opportunity) and other economic and sector work, in
particular the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA).



                                                10
32.      The CEA was carried out in parallel with the preparation of the first Sustainable
Development DPL to provide the Colombian government with an analytical framework to
support its efforts toward achieving the MDGs, with its findings expected to support the design
and implementation of policies focused on protecting the most vulnerable groups, especially
children under the age of five in poor households. By achieving this objective, the CEA has
provided a basis for the structure of the SusDevDPL Program. The SusDevDPL Program has
supported the CEA’s key recommendations which include: (i) an assessment of the cost of
environmental degradation in Colombia; (ii) a broad assessment of the institutional capacity for
environmental management in Colombia; and (iii) an assessment of the effectiveness and
efficiency of existing policy, legislative and regulatory frameworks to address environmental
concerns (See Table 1 below). In addition a broad survey of societal perceptions was carried out
to assist the government in identifying the country’s priority environmental concerns, as well as
the sectors from which they stem.

2.2.C Investment Lending to Support Preparation of the Program

34.     The Sustainable Development Investment Project (SusDevInv, a US$7 million loan), has
financed targeted actions and investments to support the development and implementation of the
DPL Program’s policy reforms. Specifically, the Sustainable Development Investment Project has
supported policies and programs that address environmental problems affecting the quality of life
and well being of Colombians, such as air pollution and inadequate hygiene, and that have
strengthened the process of formulating, coordinating, and overseeing regional and local
environmental management and policies.




                                                             12
35.      Among the SusDevInv Project’s most notable achievements are the support it has
provided for developing the national Air and Water Pollution Control Policies and the
implementation of strategies specified in the Urban Development Policy, which are both linked to
the development objectives of the SusDevDPL series. Specifically, the SusDevInv Project has
helped (i) establish an air quality monitoring network and a uniform reporting system for air
quality data; (ii) prepare a national water resources diagnostic study that has informed the
National Water Policy (presented to the National Environmental Council in December 2009 and
approved in March 2010); (iii) support the accreditation of water quality laboratories (66 instead
of only 5 laboratories as agreed in the results framework); and (iv) helped develop the
methodologies and procedures for reporting the progress on the achievement of the MDGs at the
national and regional levels. The hand washing campaign, also supported by the project—still to
be evaluated—appears to have been very successful through widely viewed television ads (with
approximately 10 million viewers in total), radio announcements (on 327 channels), and a series
of workshops and community outreach campaigns. Strategic Environmental Assessments in three
priority sectors (fuels, control of water pollution and environmental health), financed by the
project, have helped formulate such important policies as prevention and control of air pollution,
the National Water Policy and Environmental Health Policy, which are also linked to the
development objectives of the SusDevDPL program.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E Design

36.      A set of outcome indicators for measuring the program’s achievement of development
objectives was agreed with government counterparts during preparation of the first SusDevDPL
operation. Since the original indicators did not formally define baseline and target values and
often reflected procedural actions rather than outcomes, these indicators have been refined during
preparation and implementation of the DPL series. The series has made substantial progress in
achieving program indicators. MAVDT is responsible for overall monitoring and evaluation and
for collecting the appropriate data to follow the indicators. Data availability for most indicators
has been sufficient and timely.

37.      At the outset of the SusDevDPL series, the government had aimed to carry out actions
that would support the reduction of the cost of environmental degradation associated with air
pollution, inadequate hygiene, inadequate water resources management and with natural disasters
(sub-objective B.3 of the original Policy Matrix). During the course of implementation, however,
the government and Bank recognized that the natural disasters sub-objective required special
attention. Therefore, the government requested a Disaster Risk Management Development Policy
Loan with a Catastrophic Risk Deferred Drawdown Option to strengthen its program for reducing
risks resulting from adverse natural events. A reduction of the costs of environmental degradation
associated with the vulnerability to natural disasters was to be achieved by supporting actions
related to (i) improving risk identification and monitoring; (ii) increasing prevention and
mitigation measures for risk reduction; (iii) strengthening the National System for Disaster
Management and Prevention; and (iv) reducing the fiscal vulnerability of the State to natural
disasters. The government and the Bank, therefore, did not plan explicit prior actions or triggers
for natural disaster risk management within the Sustainable Development DPL series, and this
sub-objective is not included in the final list of objectives.

38.     During the preparation of the SusDevDPL III operation, the Bank and the Colombian
Government agreed that approval of the Environmental Health Policy would be made a condition
of loan effectiveness, as approval of this policy was experiencing unanticipated delays and was

                                                13
one of the operation’s prior actions. The Environmental Health Policy was successfully approved
and the loan subsequently became effective on January 19, 2009.

(b) M&E Implementation and Utilization

39.     An in-depth follow-up of the SusDevDPL I and II took place in workshops at the close of
each operation, in which key government stakeholders and the Bank Task Team assessed the
status of the operations’ outcome indicators as well as the target values for the next operation.
These workshops provided an opportunity to determine if any modifications to the targets were
required, and helped identify lessons that could be applied to improve the design of and
implementation arrangements for the following operation, and operations in the future.

40.      A similar workshop was held in May, 2010 to discuss the outcomes of the SusDevDPL
III, as well as to assess the success of the overall Program in meeting its objectives. During this
workshop the Bank Task Team met with key government counterparts, as well as research
institutions and other relevant actors in order to discuss the key results of the program, the lessons
learned, and potential next steps for further strengthening of the sector.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

41.      The DPL series has supported first generation reforms, such as enacting policies,
strengthening institutional capacity, and establishing pollution standards, which have provided the
necessary institutional and regulatory conditions for improved environmental outcomes. Despite
these achievements, there is a need for further investment in more complex reforms and actions
that build upon the foundations of the SusDevDPL program. The Bank is working with the GOC
to prepare an analytical work program which will inform the next generation of environmental
reform priorities in Colombia, including the biodiversity management agenda which has not been
addressed by the DPL series to date.

42.      In the short-term, the GOC has requested a new Knowledge Product as a follow up to
the 2006 CEA, which will focus on incentives to achieve reductions in emissions from mobile
sources, biodiversity management, institutional strengthening, the development of sustainability
indicators, and other areas to be agreed with the GOC. The Bank team will continue the dialogue
with the Government to specify the topics of this Knowledge Products program (studies and
technical advisory services through capacity building and South-South cooperation).

43.      The Government has also requested the scaling up of the SusDevInv Project through an
additional financing of $10 million, currently under preparation. The additional financing would
provide continued support to three of the Project’s four original components: (i) environmental
health; (ii) integrated water resources management; and (iii) planning and oversight of
environmental management. Specifically, the additional financing is expected to support: (i) the
installation of a homologation (accreditation and certification) program for vehicles and
promotion of clean vehicle technologies; (ii) development of an inventory of anthropogenic
sources of mercury and evaluation of the risk of exposure to mercury and lead to provide the
analytical basis for the implementation of the National Environmental Health Policy (PISA),
supported by the SusDevDPL III; (iii) the continued implementation of the hand washing
campaign and the monitoring and evaluation of its impacts, which was supported by the
SusDevDPL III; (iv) development of a series of activities to support integrated water resources
management in Colombia, in line with the National Water Policy, approved in March 2010 and
supported by the SusDevDPL III, including the strengthening of the capacity of regional
environmental authorities to implement watershed protection plans and water resources

                                                 14
information systems at the national and local levels; and (v) strengthening the environmental
planning, policy evaluation, and inter-sectoral coordination functions of the National Planning
Department (DNP).

44.    The areas of future Bank support will be finalized after the new administration is in place
in Colombia beginning in August 2010.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.     Based on the CAS approved in 2003, the government and the Bank agreed that a
Programmatic Sustainable Development Structural Adjustment Loan (now Programmatic
Development Policy Loan for Sustainable Development) would be the most appropriate tool to
provide reliable financial support for the implementation of a medium-term strategy for achieving
the Millennium Development Goals, particularly Goal 7.

46.      This initial government and Bank support for the program was sustained in the Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for 2008-2011, which identified the Third Programmatic Sustainable
Development Policy Loan as the instrument for supporting the government’s 2006-2011 National
Development Plan (PND) and MDG goals of ensuring environmental sustainability. The DPL
Program is aligned with the strategies and reforms included in the PND, which aim to integrate
principles of sustainable development into the planning process and harmonization of various
branches and levels of government in order to safeguard quality of life and create conditions for
sustained economic growth and social development. In addition, actions supported under the
SusDevDPL Program’s expected outcomes are fully aligned with the outcomes to which the CPS
contributes: providing input to national policy and helping the government strengthen the
institutional capacity for managing environmental services and mainstreaming the principles of
environmental sustainability in sectoral policies.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Significant Achievements in the Overall Outcomes of the SusDevDPL Program

47.      The SusDevDPL Program contributed to significant achievements in several areas,
including the approval of air, water, and urban environmental policies and reforms, and improved
institutional coordination and strengthening of the CARs.

Air Quality Management

48.     The legal framework for Colombia’s air quality management system dates back to the
1974 National Code for Renewable Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and
Colombia has a fairly long history of air quality monitoring. More recently, the GOC
implemented a series of regulatory reforms, accompanied by the adoption of policies, strategies,
and the creation of inter-sectoral coordination mechanisms which have built upon the strategic
component on air quality management of the 2006-2010 NDP and helped achieve notable
reductions in air pollution in the country’s most contaminated cities.

49.     Significant achievements have been made by the GOC in the area of strengthening air
pollution management, particularly through the passage of the Fuel Quality Law and successful
implementation of low sulfur quality standards, which the GOC had been unable to pass despite

                                               15
thirteen previous attempts. The support provided by the Bank through the DPL and the
accompanying SusDevInv Project have contributed to this success by generating the economic
and social justification for the implementation of these standards and by strengthening the
political commitment to the law’s implementation. The strengthening of air quality monitoring
networks, development of guidelines and technical manuals for emissions monitoring and
inventories, and air pollution-health studies carried out in the hotspots of contamination, with
support from the DPL and the SusDevInv Project, are expected to further strengthen air quality
management through improved priority setting, monitoring, and evaluation of the impacts of
polices, investments and technical measures aimed at improving urban air quality and reducing
the associated health costs.

50.     These striking findings helped shape the strategic component of Colombia’s 2006-2010
National Human Development Plan (PND) on air quality and strengthened the emphasis on the
need to tackle this challenge. One of the major factors of success has been the passage of the Law
on Fuel Quality in 2008, which has set stringent standards on sulfur content in transport fuels, and
was drafted with attention to the ability of the regulated community to comply with those
standards.

51.     The government’s success in implementing more stringent fuel quality regulations, after
thirteen previous failed attempts over the course of ten years, is partly attributable to the
SusDevDPL series. Specific triggers for disbursement helped to bring the issue of air pollution
and environmental health to the forefront of the GoC’s agenda and focus the efforts of sectoral
agencies on developing a viable action plan to ensure successful enforcement of the new law.
Table 2 highlights the triggers, implemented between appraisal and effectiveness of the respective
DPLs, which have helped strengthen air quality management and eventually achieve the
implementation of the Fuel Quality Law.


               Table 3: The SusDevDPL has helped achieve benchmark reforms
                                 in air quality management.

               which mandates the development of an

52.      The other key elements of success with the passage and implementation of the Fuel
Quality Law, apart from the assistance provided through the SusDevDPL and the SusDevInv
project, are:

   Information about the costs of health damage from urban air pollution provided in the
    Country Environmental Analysis, and disseminated through multiple newspapers, leading
    public manifestations, and pressure for reform;
   Strategic direction for air pollution management set by the 2006-2010 Human Development
    Plan (and strongly influenced by the findings of the CEA in the area of air quality);
   Champions in support of the reform and investment program and the strong political
    commitment to implement a series of institutional and regulatory reforms, and the awareness
    of the policy makers and congressmen that prepared the draft Fuel Quality Law of the
    findings and recommendations of the CEA (as evident from the CEA Impact Evaluation
    Study);
   Strong analytical foundation and evidence-based policy setting, with reliance on scientific
    assessments; air quality monitoring that has already facilitated follow up epidemiological
    studies to assess the health impacts in contamination hotspots; emission inventories; and the
    use of Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) as the basis for policies;
   Reliance on cross-sectoral involvement via innovative intersectoral coordination mechanisms
    and consultative bodies.

53.      Measurable improvements in air quality in Bogotá have already been observed. Sulfur
content in diesel fell from 1,200 ppm in January of 2008 to 500 ppm in July and further to 50
ppm in January 2010. The concentration of particulate matter in Bogotá, based on air quality
monitoring data, fell by 8% in 2008 and continued to further decline by an additional 4% in 2009.
The numbers of consecutive days with PM levels out of compliance with the norms fell from 50-
59 in 2007 and 2008 to only 12 in 2009, and much of that reduction has been attributed by the
District Secretariat of the Environment for Bogotá to the reduction in sulfur content in transport
fuels.

Water Resources Management

54.      Notable improvements have occurred in the area of water resources management in
Colombia since the beginning of the implementation of the SusDevDPL series. The SusDevDPL
II originally sought to support the drafting and passage of the water resources management law;
however, although the draft law was prepared (and the corresponding prior action was complied
with), the draft law did not gain congressional approval.2 Despite this setback at the political
level, the government has confirmed its commitment to meeting the objectives of the law through
a series of water resource management reforms supported under SusDevDPL II. Among those
reforms is the issuance of a series of Presidential Decrees (e.g., for the planning and creation of a
registry of water users and uses, and the Decree mandating the establishment of an information
system on water resources). The efforts to strengthen water resources management in Colombia
were sustained through the creation of the Water Resources Group in MAVDT, which oversaw
the completion of a national level diagnostic study on water resources and the preparation and
successful approval of the National Water Policy. Furthermore, the Water Resources Group has
provided technical assistance to the CARs in the design and development of watershed
management plans, which was one of the specific objectives of the 2006-2010 National
Development Plan in this sector. As a result, at least 25 municipalities with medium to high levels
of water scarcity out of the total of around 106 municipalities in that category of water scarcity
have adopted watershed management plans, while none had them in 2005. The SusDevInv
Project has provided technical advisory services in support of these efforts and financed the
preparation of the Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) on water quality, the diagnostic
study on Water Resources in Colombia, and financed a series of workshops to discuss the draft
versions of the water policy with a broad range of stakeholders.

Strengthening Coordination between MAVDT and Regional Environmental Authorities

55.      The DPL program has supported a series of steps to strengthen coordination between
MAVDT, CARs, and AAUs. In response to a trigger for releasing disbursements on the third
DPL in the program, in 2008 the GOC developed and approved an Urban Environmental Policy
that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of CARs and AAUs, and which also creates
mechanisms for improved transparency. The third DPL further supported the formulation of
indicators to monitor the implementation of the Environmental Urban Management Policy, in
order to ensure that the roles of CARs and AAUs are properly clarified and do not overlap, and to
further promote transparency in the system. The DPL series strengthened and improved the
consistency of the regional and national environmental priorities and the quality of the reporting
and information provision on sustainability indicators by the CARs and AAUs. Previously,
priorities at the regional level were not linked to those at the national level, and there were no
established guidelines for setting yearly priorities or for reporting on activities. The DPL series
supported the identification of priorities and goals, which are linked to the MDGs and the NDP,

2
  Congressional approval of laws in Colombia requires ratification in four debates, which must be concluded within the
span of two consecutive legislative periods. The draft water resources management law was presented to Congress in
April 2005 and was ratified in its first debate in June 2005; and the law required three more debates during the 2005-
2006 legislature. However, the government withdrew the draft law in May of 2006 when it became clear that these
additional debates would not be completed due to factors beyond the project’s control during the legislative period.
These factors included the congressional and presidential elections that took place in 2006, as well as the long debates
and approval process centered on the Forestry Law (Source: World Bank (2007). Project Appraisal Document for
SusDevDPL II.)




                                                          18
and the creation of a system for regular management reporting for the CARs. In order to improve
transparency and accountability of the CARs in achieving these goals, MAVDT has published an
evaluation of integrated management of the CARs, including performance in meeting their goals,
on their website. In addition, the first DPL in the series included as a trigger for disbursement the
issuance of a Presidential Decree that establishes an open process of election of the Directors of
the CARs. Transparency in the management of the CARs was also improved through the passage
of a law in 2008, which extended the term of CAR directors to four years to coincide with the
terms of mayors and governors.

Overall Strengthening of Environmental Policy Formulation and Implementation

56.      The DPL series has significantly contributed to the strengthening of policy formulation in
the environmental sector. One of the triggers for disbursement under the first DPL in the series
was the issuance by DNP and MAVDT of a plan for strengthening the design, implementation,
and evaluation of environmental policies. The GOC met this goal, and in 2008 a monitoring and
evaluation system was established, and a Ministerial directive was put into place requiring that
the system be used during policy preparation, in order to ensure the consistency of policies with
the GOC’s sustainable development agenda, as detailed by the NDP and the National Sustainable
Development Policy. The GOC has built upon these achievements and is currently in the process
of developing guidelines for the formulation, design, evaluation, and monitoring of policies at the
sector level. These guidelines will be tested through a pilot evaluation of the design process of the
new Biodiversity Policy in 2010, and by 2011 they will be used to evaluate the formulation and
implementation process of other policies as well.

Other Areas Supported by the Program

57.     Other significant policies and tools supported by the DPL series are the Environmental
Health Policy, the Urban Development Policy, waste management-related decrees and regulations
and technical measures such as the program to close open dumps.

Overall Outcomes

58.     The achievements of the program reflect the SusDevDPL’s support to the two pillars of
the country’s environmental policies: (1) Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the
National Environmental System (SINA); and (2) Integrating Principles of Sustainable
Development into Key Sectors, and within those pillars, the program focused on more specific
sectors: (1.A) Strengthening the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development; (1.B)
Improved Interinstitutional Coordination and Increased Public Participation in Environmental
Decision-Making; (2.A) Integrated Water Resources Management; (2.B) Improving Urban Air
Quality; and (2.C) Improving Integrated Urban Environmental Management.

59.     The same Development Objectives were shared by each of the DPLs in the series, with
each DPL having its own baseline and target values, but with the idea that all of the activities
supported throughout the series were working toward meeting the overall Development
Objectives.

Overall outcomes of SusDevDPL I (single tranche of $150.0 million):
GoC met all goals for the disbursement of the single tranche of SusDevDPL I in FY06. Notable
activities supported by the SusDevDPL I included building a results-based framework for
monitoring sustainable development goals, improving inter-institutional coordination
mechanisms, and preparing critical decrees to promote sustainable development. Significant
achievements are described below.

1 Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA)
1.A Strengthening the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development

     (i)       Guidelines for a National Sustainable Development Policy were approved by
               CONPES (CONPES No. 3343). The CONPES policy document serves as the
               umbrella document for the SusDevDPL Program and sets into motion a series of
               actions to improve environmental governance and urban environmental management
               planning.
     (ii)      An assessment determined the institutional strengthening needs of both MAVDT and
               DNP to improve the design, implementation, monitoring, and execution of
               environmental policies. The results of this assessment included: (i) the need to
               improve integrated management of environment, housing, water and sanitation, and
               regional development; (ii) improved formulation and articulation of strategic policies;
               (iii) implementation and oversight of environmental and territorial development
               policies; and (iv) improved coordination with the entities responsible for
               implementing policies and reforms. These recommendations were incorporated into a
               plan for strengthening environmental policies, in accordance with Decrees 195 of
               2004 and 216 of 2003, respectively.
     (iii)     Developing a system of indicators to measure performance of environmental
               investments in the ten-year Regional Environmental Management Plans (PGARs)
               and Triennial Action Plans (PATs) that each CAR is required to submit to MAVDT
               (Presidential Decree 1200 of 2004). The PGARs provide each CAR’s analysis of the
               principal challenges facing the region, each CAR’s strategy for managing
               environmental resources, investment priorities, financial requirements, and sources,
               and tools used by a CAR for monitoring and evaluation.3

1.B Improved Interinstitutional Coordination and Increased Public Participation in
Environmental Decision-Making

     (iv)      Improved functioning of the Technical Advisory Council (CTA) to serve as a forum
               for cross-sectoral coordination and public participation in environmental decision-
               making (Decree 707 of 2005).
     (v)       Modification of the environmental licensing scheme to improve transparency,
               accountability, and public participation; this includes clarification of the procedures
               for environmental impact assessments and the process for obtaining environmental

3
  Decree 1200 of 2004 specifies six sustainable development objectives and 15 impact indicators to evaluate the CARs’
environmental management. These sustainable development objectives are linked directly to the MDGs and balance
both urban and rural concerns. Of these six objectives, four support improved natural resources management (e.g.,
forest conservation, diminishing water shortage risks, optimizing the use of renewable natural resources, and increasing
income and employment using sustainable production methods), while the other two aim to reduce environmental
health impacts and vulnerability to natural disasters. These objectives and their corresponding indicators promote better
linkages between national and regional priorities and strengthen the focus on results and impacts linked to the
environment.

            licenses, and definition of steps for monitoring and evaluation of licenses and
            environmental management plans (Decree 1220 of 2005).
   (vi)     Formation of a SINA working group, via Resolution 0449 of 2004, to establish
            institutional mechanisms for periodic discussion of the congruence between national
            and regional priorities, continuous consultation and organizational learning,
            assessment of the effectiveness of CARs, and conflict resolution between CARs and
            MAVDT. The working group represents MAVDT within the Board of Directors of
            the CARs, coordinates the provision of technical assistance and financing from
            MAVDT and other SINA actors to the CARs, supports the development of the
            regional Triennial Action Plans, and reports back to MAVDT on CAR performance
            vis-à-vis the progress made toward PAT objectives. Presidential Decree 3345
            supported improvements in environmental governance by improving procedures for
            the election of CAR Directors and provides more accountability in SINA by
            enhancing public participation and transparency.

2 Integrating Principles of Sustainable Development into Key Sectors 2.A Integrated Water
Resources Management

   (vii)    Preparation and presentation, for Congressional approval, of a draft water resources
            management law which was ratified in June 2005. The draft law defined institutional
            responsibility, planning instruments, and rights and responsibilities for water usage
            and management. The necessary debates surrounding the draft law were delayed due
            to Congressional and Presidential elections which took place in 2006, as well as the
            long debates and approval process centered on the Forestry Law; therefore the
            government withdrew the draft law in May 2006.

2.B Improving Urban Air Quality

   (viii)   Approval of a national action plan for air pollution control (CONPES 3344),
            including an emphasis on measurement of key pollutants that are associated with
            significant health impacts, such as PM 2.5, among others.

2.C Improving Integrated Urban Environmental Management

   (ix)     Development of a national policy and an action plan for integrated urban
            environmental management (CONPES 3305).

Overall Outcomes of SusDevDPL II (single tranche of $200 million):
The GoC met all goals for the SusDevDPL II by FY08. The second operation focused on the
development and passage of sustainable development policies. Significant achievements are
described below.

1 Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA)
1.A Strengthening the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development

   (i)      Establishing a system of indicators to monitor and evaluate implementation of the
            National Policy on Sustainable Development (CONPES 3343 of 2005). In particular,
            this indicator system monitors the impacts of environmental degradation on public
            health, the development of instruments for integrated water resource management,



                                               21
           improvements in environmental governance, establishment and functioning of the
           SINA working group, and improvements to the environmental licensing scheme.
   (ii)    Establishing a monitoring baseline for the six sustainable development objectives
           under Decree 1200 of 2004 in order to improve data collection and management by
           the CARs and other national and regional institutions which are responsible for
           monitoring the 15 indicators associated with the sustainable development objectives.
           These indicators include hectares of protected areas, deforestation rates, percentage
           of population at risk of water shortages, water scarcity index, energy intensity, water
           consumption in productive sectors, tons of solid waste adequately disposed of in
           landfills, morbidity and mortality due to acute respiratory infections, morbidity and
           mortality due to severe diarrheal disease, morbidity and mortality caused by dengue,
           and number of people affected by natural disasters each year, among others. To
           ensure that the CARs’ data is consistent with data currently collected by the country’s
           research institutes, information sharing agreements were established between these
           institutes and the National Institute of Health (in the Ministry of Social Protection).
   (iii)   Preparation of policy-based SEAs on water quality, mining, and fuel quality in 2007.
           Formation of inter-ministerial and inter-sectoral working groups to ensure broad-
           based support for these policy recommendations, supported directly by the
           SusDevDPL program, and including participation from the Ministry of Social
           Protection, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and the Ministry of Transportation.
   (iv)    Implementation of plans to strengthen the design, monitoring, and execution of
           environmental policies. MAVDT developed manuals for internal procedures and
           guides for the formulation and oversight of policies, strengthened its information
           system for monitoring the water and sanitation sector, and conducted five internal
           training workshops on its environmental management information system. As part of
           this plan, DNP developed guidelines for conducting SEAs and strengthened the
           management and oversight of investments in the environment sector. In addition,
           DNP created an Intersectoral Coordination Committee for Environment and
           Sustainable Development Policies. Implementation of the DNP and MAVDT
           institutional strengthening plans was a coordinated effort by both agencies, along
           with research institutes such as IDEAM.

1.B Improved Interinstitutional Coordination and Increased Public Participation in
Environmental Decision-Making

   (v)     Coordination, by the SINA working group, of a national environmental policy
           between MAVDT, the 33 CARs, 6 AAUs, and 5 research institutes. The SINA
           working group helped the CARs develop their Triennial Action Plans (PATs) and
           ensure that they are consistent with the PGARs and Territorial Development Plans
           (POTs). The working group also helped the CARs develop a uniform budgeting
           system so that they can provide information on environmental investments and
           expenditures in a standard and consistent format. The SINA working group also
           played an important role in helping the CARs develop councils to jointly manage
           areas that span multiple CARs or that require collaboration between CARs and other
           government entities.
   (vi)    Implementation of the government’s modified licensing scheme to improve
           transparency, accountability, and public participation in environmental licensing
           under Decree 1200 of 2005, Decree 2762 of 2004, and Decree 50 of 2006. The
           government conducted regional workshops to disseminate these new licensing
           procedures. As a result, a broad consensus was achieved among regional and urban


                                              22
            environmental authorities as well as sectoral ministries on the benefits of the new
            licensing scheme.

2.A Integrated Water Resources Management

   (vii)    Implementation of an action plan to improve laboratory accreditation and
            dissemination of water quality monitoring protocols, including technical assistance to
            environmental authorities to strengthen the analytical capacities of laborites and to
            identify accreditation requirements and needs.
   (viii)   Implementation of Decree 838 of 2005 and the associated Resolution 1390 of 2005
            which facilitates the planning and operation of sanitary landfills and establishes
            norms for closing and or/technically transforming inadequate disposal sites. As a
            result, at least 232 open waste dumps have been closed as of 2010, far surpassing the
            agreed target of closing 75 of the country’s 700 open dumps.

2.) Improving Urban Air Quality

   (ix)     Issuance of Decree 244 of 2006 to establish the National Intersectoral Technical
            Commission for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution (CONAIRE) to ensure
            intersectoral coordination of policies, plans, and programs to prevent and control air
            pollution. Resolution 0601 of 2006 established air quality standards with pollution
            limits for TSP, PM 10, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO, while Resolution 0627 of 2006
            establishes national emission standards for noise pollution with a view to minimize
            the public health risks associated with ambient air pollution. In addition, an air
            quality monitoring protocol was validated and applied to four city air quality
            networks (Bogotá, Pereira, Sogamoso, and Bucaramanga).

Overall outcomes of SusDevDPL III (single tranche, $450.00 million):
The third operation focused on the development and passage of sustainable development policies.
Significant achievements are described below.

1 Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the National Environmental System (SINA)
1.A Strengthening the Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development

   (i)      Implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for both national and regional
            environmental management based on the sustainable development objectives
            described in Decree 1200 of 2004, established in 2008 with a Ministerial directive in
            place requiring that the system be consulted during policy preparation, including the
            consideration of official baseline information to orient policies toward sustainable
            development (Norm GP1000).

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Ratings: Satisfactory

60.     The SusDevDPL I operation supported initial actions to set into motion a series of actions
to improve environmental governance and urban environmental management planning, which
were further supported by SusDevDPL II, which deepened reforms, policies, and frameworks.
The SusDevDPL III concluded the DPL series by drawing on the plans and frameworks laid out
in the first two operations to finalize improvements in the functioning of SINA, especially
through the intersectoral forum; establish and operationalize the monitoring and evaluation
system for the formulation of policies; approve national policies that integrate principles of
sustainable development into key sectors; and enhance transparency and reporting systems and
increase public access to key information, among others.

61.      Out of 17 outcome indicators for the SusDevDPL III operation, at least 14 have already
been fully achieved, and an additional indicator—the target of six sessions of the National
Environmental Council—is very likely to be achieved as the sixth session has been planned for
July, 2010. The last two indicators have been nearly achieved: (i) the performance of the hygiene
campaign cannot be evaluated definitively as no target value had been established at the
program’s outset, and the results of the pilot survey—which suggest that the national hand
washing campaign in mass media has had a very high impact—are likely to be biased, resulting in
partial fulfillment of indicator # 12, and (ii) the system of water accounts has not been adopted by


                                                24
25 out of 33 CARs, resulting in partial attainment of the target value of indicator # 10. Thus, it is
expected that 15 out of 17 outcome indicators will be fully achieved by August, 2010.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

1. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.      The SusDevDPL Program supported many activities that were aimed to improve the lives
of the poorest and most vulnerable social groups through a focus on sustainable development in
several sectors. By addressing the urban environmental issues that affect the most vulnerable
segments of the population (air pollution and inadequate water supply, sanitation, and hygiene),
the program supports achievement of MDG Goal 4 which seeks to reduce child mortality by
addressing the principal threats to children under five (morbidity and mortality related respiratory
illnesses and diarrheal diseases).

63.     More specifically, the Program supported the preparation, dissemination, and approval by
MAVDT, the Ministry of Social Protection (MPS), and the DNP of a National Policy on
Environmental Health for approval by CONPES. The National Policy on Environmental Health
focuses on lines of action, which most directly affect the health, and productivity of the most
vulnerable, such as strengthening (i) institutional capacity within MAVDT and MPS, (ii)
information management, (iii) responsibilities for inspection and enforcement and, (iv) technical
and scientific capacity.

64.      To address problems with urban air quality, the SusDevDPL supported the government in
designing a National Policy for Air Pollution Control. Ambient air pollution is one of the most
serious environmental problems in urban areas, and is linked to approximately 6,000 premature
deaths per year. Although levels are moderate in most cities, the fact that close to 50 percent of
the population lives in cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants creates substantial aggregate
health effects, associated mainly with particulate matter. These effects include cardiopulmonary
diseases, lung cancer in adults, and acute respiratory illness, particularly in children, as well as
death from related diseases such as pneumonia. Indoor air pollution, mainly affecting households
in rural areas, and especially the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the population that use
solid fuels for cooking without adequate ventilation, and women and children, was estimated by
the 2006 CEA to result in another 1,100 deaths every year.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

65.      The SusDevDPL series has focused on improving institutional strengthening and
interinstitutional coordination through several activities.

66.     Institutional needs assessments and cross-sectoral coordination. The SusDevDPL
I supported the institutional strengthening needs assessment of both MAVDT and DNP in
order to improve the design, monitoring, and execution of environmental policies. The
recommendations of this assessment were realized through the subsequent operations in
the series. The SusDevDPL III supported the approval of the Urban Environmental
Policy, including promotion of interinstitutional coordination and cooperation, such as
defining the responsibilities as well as the resources and instruments of relevant actors in
the sector. The National Planning Department (DNP) has also strengthened its
Environmental Policy and Sustainable Development Unit to better meet the environment
objectives of the PND, with seven positions created in 2008 in order to meet this goal.

                                                 25
67.     Water resources, air quality management and climate change. In addition, the
SusDevDPL series has supported strengthening the organizational capacity of the Vice Ministry
of Environment to develop and implement environmental policies and meet the environment
goals of the 2006-2010 PND. For example, the Vice Ministry has formed a Water Resources
Group to prepare, implement, and oversee a National Water Policy, strengthened its Sectoral
Sustainable Development Directional Office to improve air quality management, strengthened its
Climate Change Group to target options for reducing GHG and operationalize the country’s
climate change strategies by developing a National Climate Change Policy, strengthened the
SINA Working Group to improve coordination of national environmental policy between the
ministry, the 33 CARs, 6 AAUs, and 5 research institutes, and strengthened the Planning,
Information, and Regional Coordination Directional Office by providing it with tools to oversee
and evaluate national and regional environmental management.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

68.      Improved public participation and accountability. The priorities and actions identified
during the CEA were consulted with the public and civil society groups. The SusDevDPL
Program has built on these consultations and has supported the inclusion of public participation,
civil society, and a general environment of transparency during policy formulation processes, and
through the better provision of information on monitoring and performance indicators to the
public. Thus, the benchmark policies supported by the DPL series, such as the Air Quality,
Environmental Health, and Water Policies, have been prepared in a participatory manner and
included a series of consultations with key stakeholders and civil society organizations.

69.     In addition, the SusDevDPL Program and the associated SusDevInv Loan have directly
supported the creation of environmental information systems, such as the SISAIRE system with
consolidated air quality data from all monitoring networks, and the monitoring and publications
of environmental indicators, and data on the progress of meeting environmental objectives by the
CARs and AAUs, which are now accessible to the public on-line. The research institutes that are
part of SINA, such as IDEAM, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Environment, have
developed these network and information systems. With funding from the Spanish Trust Fund
(SFLAC), pending donor’s approval, the Bank expects to provide continued support to the efforts
of the Ministry in further improving the disclosure of environmental information by the CARs
and AAUs through technical assistance for the implementation of the “Government-On-Line?
(GEL) strategy; and it is expected that SFLAC will provide additional support in the areas of air
quality and water resources management. With support of the Water Partnership Program (WPP),
the Ministry of Environment and the Bank are initiating an accredited university course on
hydrological modeling for decision makers, which will provide training for decision makers and
experts from 33 CARs and help facilitate the formulation of a water protection plan and the
implementation of other key aspects of the National Water Policy.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

70.      The Stakeholder Workshop was held in May, 2010 to solicit the participants’ comments
on the achievements of the program. The participants have included the key staff and technical
experts of MAVDT, DNP, IDEAM, DANE, the Health Department of Bogotá, and other
agencies. In a series of meetings with the teams in charge of implementing interventions and
making the regulatory changes in each area or otherwise engaged in that process, the Bank team
asked the participants to (i) describe the most significant achievements of the program, (ii) assess
the role of the DPL in attaining those achievements, as well as the role of the underpinning AAA

                                  In line with the Decree 1200, the GoC is currently developing a new
                                  Quality Evaluation System to ensure stronger policy design and support
                                  integrated policy evaluation with a focus on impacts and results, and
                                  helping ensure that action plans and programs intended to implement
                                  those policies are in line with the policies’ objectives.

                                  The Bank is continuing support in this area through the Bank-financed
                                  Knowledge Product “Deepening Environmental Management in
                                  Colombia,? which has supported the development of a methodology for

                                    creation of the Water Resources Group at MAVDT, tasked with the
                                    preparation of the Diagnostic Study and the National Water Policy. In
                                    view of the staff of the Water Resources Group of MAVDT, the DPL has
                                    played an important role by helping strengthen the convening power of the
                                    Ministry of Environment, increasing a sense of urgency for the passage of
                                    this complex policy by the agreed date and by helping the Ministry staff
                                    focus on the key priorities. The ongoing and planned Bank support will

Overall contribution of the Bank’s program to the strengthening of environmental management in Colombia

Evidence based policy setting       According to the DNP, the DPL series have had a very positive impact on
with clear assignment of            environmental management in Colombia. The DPLs have helped lock in
resources and commitment at         the commitment to reform at the inter-sectoral level. The CEA, carried out
high levels and across sectors.     at the start of the program, has helped focus the attention on identifying
                                    priorities in each area—particularly true in the area of air quality
                                    management where the cause-and-effect chain is complex—and then
                                    developing concrete action plans and regulations addressing those areas,
                                    and investing in specific measures to achieve progress in the areas
                                    identified as priority. By helping define a set of clear priorities, the Bank
                                    program has (i) helped join the efforts of different agencies and
                                    stakeholders focusing on the priority areas, (ii) created a temporal
                                    framework for attaining those objectives, and (iii) provided the financing
                                    through the SusDevInv project for actions in those priority areas and
                                    helped assure the fiscal space (budgetary allocation) to finance those
                                    actions at MAVDT and other implementing agencies. In particular, in the
                                    area of air quality management, the program owes its success to the ability
                                    to establish a clear framework from the prioritization of interventions
                                    based on integrated analysis of air quality problems in the CEA, to the

                               establishment of the corresponding policy priorities, and through to the
                               allocation of budgets to carry out priority actions to attain progress in
                               those priority areas.


71.     In the course of the workshop, the Bank team recorded a series of brief interviews with
Claudia Patricia Mora (Vice Minister of Environment, MAVDT), Cesar Buitrago (Director of
Sustainable Sectoral Development, MAVDT), Xiomara Sanclemente (Director of Ecosystems,
MAVDT), Dorian Munoz (Coordinator for Institutional Strengthening, Planning Department,
MAVDT), Giampiero Renzoni (Deputy Director of Sustainable Environmental Development,
DNP), Monica Rodriguez (Environment Program Manager, DANE), which will be available as a
documentary in Spanish. These government officials and technical experts were asked to talk
about their view of the main achievements in the area of strengthening of environmental
management in the last few years and the role that the Bank program, and specifically the
SusDevInv DPL series, has played in attaining those achievements.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Low

Macroeconomic Risks

72.      The most significant macroeconomic risks arose during the preparation of the third
operation in the SusDevDPL series in the fall of 2008. Colombia faced a turbulent external
environment, but the government was taking the necessary steps to mitigate external risks. For
example, the Government had reduced the foreign currency share of its public debt and overall
external debt of both the public and private sector to the level of about 23 percent of GDP. In
addition, international reserves had increased substantially, and stood at over US$23 billion. The
authorities had a sound fiscal and monetary policy in place, with an inflation targeting mechanism
established, and with a medium term fiscal framework that targeted a declining public debt to
GDP ratio. Overall external indebtedness was low (21 percent of GDP), and the current account
deficit was more than fully financed by net FDI-including during the first half of 2008. Overall
annual external financing requirements are on the order of $12-15 billion, but much of this is
driven by the current account deficit, with the excess of imports influenced by flows of FDI itself.

Coordination Risks

 73.     The Program Document for SusDevDPL I identified coordination as a potential risk,
which has persisted for the second and third operations, given the relative weakness of the
Environment Ministry. This risk did not materialize during program implementation, with the
coordination carried out between MAVDT, DNP, and sector line ministries in the development of
policies that support sustainable development (e.g., air quality, environmental health, and an
urban environmental policy) and a well-funded and effective capacity building program within
MAVDT and DNP. Further, the coordination processes supported by the DPL series have helped
institutionalize coordination efforts through the development of inter-ministerial agendas to
support both the development and implementation of policies, as well as through MAVDT’s
development of guidelines on the consultative processes to be followed for policy development.
The benefits are widely recognized, and the 2006-2010 PND also calls for inter-institutional and
multi-sector coordination efforts to integrate sustainable development considerations into
additional sector-specific policies, such as transportation and tourism.



                                                  29
 74.    The SusDevDPL I Program Document also pointed to the program’s reliance on CARs to
participate actively in the implementation of reforms. It was noted that their relative autonomy
posed an additional risk to ensure alignment of actions between the national government and
regional agencies. This risk did not materialize and was alleviated through the implementation of
a SINA working group that helped ensure that CARs’ Triennial Action Plans are consistent with
approved Territorial Development Plans as well as to promote horizontal cooperation between
CARs, along with the development of an Urban Environmental Policy that has clarified the
responsibilities of CARs and AAUs. A similar approach to addressing the coordination risks will
be adopted in the future, and broad-based dialogue and coordination with the CARs and AAUs
will be supported by the ongoing compelementary SusDevInv project, particularly in such areas
as water resources management and air quality management, which are supported by that project.

Political Risks

75.      The SusDevDPL I Program Document identified the risk of possible attempts to derail
the reform process by special interest groups affected by it. This risk did not materialize, given
the DPL series’ successes in implementing the program’s consensus-building mechanisms. The
series has supported consultation efforts that ensure a broad discussion of the issues among
government and civil society and promote buy-in with respect to strategy proposals from the
sectors. These actions have enhanced the credibility, sustainability, and effectiveness of policy
actions, and have materially contributed to overcoming resistance from special interests.

76.     The transition process to a new administration, expected to take place in August, 2010,
may pose political risks to the continuity of the reforms supported by this DPL series, as the
champions of these reforms are likely to change. But the transition period is also a window of
opportunity to take stock of the important achievements supported by the government and by this
program, and to begin dialog on a long-term strategy for making further progress in the areas
where the reforms have already occurred and for beginning to address the remaining critical
environmental priorities. The Bank team plans to mitigate this risk by starting renewed
comprehensive dialog on environmental issues with the GOC as soon as the new administration is
in place.

Administrative Risks

77.      The SusDevDPL I1 Program Document pointed to the risk of high turnover of senior
officials within MAVDT. Although this high turnover has subsided in the last three years, it was
recognized that a return to the historical turnover rate could create a moderate to high risk of loss
in momentum to complete the reforms supported by this program. This risk has been mitigated by
the design of the program, which anchors the formulation of sustainable development strategies
on consensus building among different stakeholders, as well as on official agreements among
institutions. Further, it did not materialize during the implementation of the DPL series. The risk
of high turnover in the future will be mitigated in a same manner—through the continued
consensus building and support for the development of broad-based environmental policies with
the engagement of a range of government and non-government institutions in the consultations
process surrounding the preparation of those policies.

Sustainability Risks

78.    An overall risk of the SusDevDPL series is the sustainability of reforms and
implementation of policies, in that reforms would not be carried out or they would not be
followed by other measures that would strengthen the reforms and further their objectives in the

                                                 30
future. This risk was minimized during preparation of the program, as the SusDevDPL series has
built upon a foundation of strong analytical work and government support. The GOC has shown
commitment to the program and is already developing follow up activities that will build upon the
reforms and policies supported under the DPL series, thereby strengthening the sector and making
reforms more sustainable into the future. To minimize the future risks to the sustainability of the
reforms supported by this program, the Bank has adopted a similar approach; and several
analytical studies are ongoing in the areas that are likely to be critical to the new administration’s
environmental policy agenda.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Ratings: Satisfactory

79.      The SusDevDPL program was prepared by a multidisciplinary Bank team composed of
specialists in environmental and natural resource economics, economics, environmental
engineering, chemical engineering, environmental management, water resource management,
environmental science and policy, Bank operations management, as well as other specialists in
legal issues, procurement, and financial management.

80.    Consultations were held in preparation for both the SusDevDPL and the Country
Environmental Analysis with a range of civil society organizations, academics, and other
concerned stakeholder groups in addition to government institutions and private sector groups.

81.     In addition, the Bank carried out studies as part of the CEA, as well as during preparation
of the SusDevDPL series (such as the preparation of the SEAs), all of which have informed the
project’s preparation and design (Table 2).

82.     During the preparation of the SusDevDPL Program the Bank coordinated closely with the
Andean Development Corporation and the Inter-American Development Bank. The DPL
Program is designed to complement the IDB’s Urban Social Housing Project and the IDB’s
second program to support the National Environmental System (SINA II), which aims to support
sustainable development by strengthening national and regional environmental institutions. Based
on joint World Bank-IDB discussions with the government on synergies between SusDevDPL
and SINA II, it was agreed that the IDB project would focus specifically on (i) reforestation
linked to watershed management and protected areas and (ii) cleaner production for the
manufacturing sector.

83.     In addition, during the preparation of both the SusDevDPL II and III, the Bank closely
coordinated with officials from the Embassy of the Netherlands in Colombia, who have prepared
a grant-financed environmental program that supports institutional strengthening within SINA as

                                                      32
well as the Colombian government’s conservation efforts. Joint team meetings were held
throughout preparation with MAVDT, DNP, the embassy, and Bank officials to ensure that
activities under the SusDevDPL Program and the sectoral program supported by the Netherlands
were complementary. While the SusDevDPL Program places emphasis on strengthening SINA’s
effectiveness and efficiency, supporting environmental health improvements, and addressing
urban environmental challenges, the Netherlands program focused on sustainable natural resource
management.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Ratings: Satisfactory

84.      The SusDevDPL program was supervised by a multidisciplinary Bank team composed of
specialists in environmental economics, economics, natural resource management, and Bank
operations management.

85.     Several missions took place to supervise the progress of the projects, and to evaluate the
technical support needed in order to achieve the development objectives of the SusDevDPL
program. For example, in order to facilitate the completion of the approval of the Environmental
Health Policy by CONPES, the Bank team recommended preparing an SEA targeted toward
environmental health. The SEA helped to better formulate the Environmental Health Policy,
which was approved by CONPES in 2008.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

86.      As Quality at Entry and Quality of Supervision are rated Satisfactory, overall Bank
performance is also rated as Satisfactory. Throughout the period of Program implementation, the
Bank team was highly involved in an active policy dialogue with government authorities,
identifying priorities and future challenges. The policy dialogue paved the way for the
development of a possible new DPL operation in the future, as well as a Country Environmental
Assessment which is currently under preparation, and which will help ensure the continuity and
sustainability of reforms supported under the SusDevDPL series.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

87.      The political will demonstrated by the Government of Colombia, in particular the leading
roles taken by the Ministry of Finance, MAVDT, and the DNP was a critical factor in achieving
the goals set out for each of the operations in the series. During Program implementation, the
Ministry of Finance, MAVDT, and the DNP not only successfully coordinated with each other,
but also encouraged other agencies to participate more actively in order to ensure the program’s
success.

88.    The environmental reform program outlined in the 2006-2010 National Development
Plan pursues the GOC’s interdisciplinary sustainable development program, has been supported

                                               33
by the activities developed in the SusDevDPL series. The DPL is aligned with the strategies and
reforms included in the PND, which aim to integrate the branches and different levels of
government in order to safeguard quality of life and create conditions for environmentally
sustainable economic growth and social development. In particular, the DPL series helped to
increase the capacity of the DNP and MAVDT through support for implementation of a plan to
adapt their structures in order to better meet the environment goals of the 2006-2010 PND, and to
better manage environmental policies. For example, a new Water Resources Management Group
was created at MAVDT and put in charge of the preparation of the National Water Policy and the
underpinning studies. With the support of the DPL series, the government has made steady
progress in meeting the environmental goals. The DNP has demonstrated strengthened capacity to
set goals and coordinate policies and planning through the approval of several CONPES policy
documents related to the SusDevDPL series, and in the overall goal of mainstreaming sustainable
development into key sectors.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

89.      As mentioned above, the Ministry of Finance, MAVDT, and the DNP played critical
roles in ensuring cross-sectoral coordination in the development and implementation of reforms.
In addition, the implementing agencies took full advantage of the Sustainable Development
Investment Project used to support the preparation and implementation of the DPL Program,
which helped to ensure the Program’s success. Another critical factor influencing the high
performance of MAVDT in implementing the program was the low rate of turn-over for key staff
members who had participated in the planning, development, and implementation of the program
over the course of the five years of the DPL series. Committed staff ensured continuity in meeting
the overall Program objectives throughout the life of the Program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory

90.      The Government of Colombia, in particular the Ministry of Finance and MAVDT,
participated actively in the preparation and implementation of the SusDevDPL Program,
facilitated and coordinated actions with other responsible agencies, closely followed the policy
matrix, reported to the Bank on progress in the Program’s implementation, and successfully met
goals and achievements, in addition to proposing future activities to follow from the work
accomplished in the Program.

6. Lessons Learned

91.     Extensive analytical work should be the basis of building a reform program. The
analytical work conducted as part of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) and in
preparation for the first operation provided a thorough examination of environmental priorities
and an understanding of the country’s institutional framework for environmental management.
The actual process of carrying out the analysis was equally as important, as it helped to build
consensus among stakeholders on reforms to the SINA. The preparation and dissemination of the
CEA benefited from close client engagement and wide stakeholder consultation, from the
government officials responsible for setting environmental policies and programs to poor and
marginalized groups that are most vulnerable to environmental degradation.


                                               34
92.      Additional resources can provide technical assistance to advance the reform program
and strengthen coordination among key stakeholders. Resources provided under the Sustainable
Development Investment Project financed key analytical work, workshops, and instruments that
supported cross-fertilization and buy-in between institutions in different sectors (e.g. SEAs)
which have been instrumental in developing and implementing reforms under the SusDevDPL
Program. Through SEAs, a number of interministerial agendas have been signed to support the
joint development of policies in the areas of environmental health, air pollution control, and water
quality. In addition, the policies supported by these SEAs have formalized this interinstitutional
coordination, by defining respective responsibilities for the improved management of these areas.

93.      Interinstitutional coordination is essential for strengthening the reform program.
Interinstitutional coordination, in particular DNP's participation in the DPL Program has been
instrumental in enhancing coordination among key SINA actors as well as other line ministries.
This coordination among line ministries, as well as vertically between national and regional
authorities, has enriched policy development in the areas of air quality, water quality, and
environmental health, as well as data collection required for the monitoring of SINA’s progress
toward goals linked with sustainable development and the MDGs.

94.      Having champions is imperative to oversee the achievement of the program’s reforms.
The Minister of Environment took a leading role in overseeing the achievement of the
SusDevDPL Program’s reforms; and the director-level staff have demonstrated firm commitment
to the program. The Minister’s commitment, as well as MAVDT’s strengthened capacity to
define and manage environmental priorities, creates an opportunity for the promotion of policy
changes beyond the actions defined in the Program (e.g., in the areas of water resource
management, indoor air pollution, climate change, and enforcement). In addition, the
commitment of MAVDT to the program was solidified through a low turnover rate for key staff
within the ministry, which allowed for continuity of leadership, vision, and follow through during
the entire Program.

95.       Flexibility in project design is important to responding to shifting political priorities. The
SusDevDPL II included an original prior action for Congressional approval of a new water
resource management law. However, although the draft law was prepared (and the corresponding
prior action was complied with, as part of the SusDevDPL I), the draft law did not gain
congressional approval.4 Despite this setback at the political level, the government confirmed its
commitment to meeting the objectives of the law through approval and/or issuance of key reforms
to improve administration, planning, and management of water resources, including: (i) approval
by Presidential Decrees for Watershed Management and Planning, a Water Uses and Users
Registry, and Establishment of an Information System; (ii) ratification of a national Development
Plan in at least the first of three debates, required for Congressional approval of the Plan as law;
(iii) issuance of a directive by MAVDT requiring CARs to establish a water accounts system; and

4
  Congressional approval of laws in Colombia requires ratification in four debates, which must be concluded within the
span of two consecutive legislative periods. The draft water resources management law was presented to Congress in
April 2005 and was ratified in its first debate in June 2005; and the law required three more debates during the 2005-
2006 legislature. However, the government withdrew the draft law in May of 2006 when it became clear that these
additional debates would not be completed due to factors beyond the project’s control during the legislative period.
These factors included the congressional and presidential elections that took place in 2006, as well as the long debates
and approval process centered on the Forestry Law (Source: World Bank (2007). Project Appraisal Document for
SusDevDPL II.)




                                                          35
(iv) MAVDT’s submission of a proposal to create a Water Resource management Office within
the Vice Ministry of Environment.

96.     Although the Bank team followed good practice principles on conditionality, such as
aligning policy reforms with the sustainable development goals included in the 2006-2010 PND,
the team could not foresee certain changes in the political environment that were beyond the
control of the program’s key government counterparts. Lessons learned from this experience
include avoiding the inclusion of the passage of laws as prior actions, as they do not necessarily
depend on the government’s commitment to reforms, but rather external politics. In addition, the
Bank should be flexible in adapting prior actions to a changing political environment, and to
reacting quickly to work with government counterparts in order to redefine actions which
maintain the original objectives of the reform, but which are implementable. For example, the
GOC was committed to continuing reforms in the water sector and worked with the Bank to
develop a package of decrees and other reforms which would be able to accomplish more than the
water law as a single instrument. The GOC has a proven history of maintaining reforms in the
water sector, despite changes in government administrations, thus ensuring that the actions
supported by the SusDevDPL program would be durable.
