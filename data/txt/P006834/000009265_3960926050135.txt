MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A
PROPOSED L(AN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$15 MILLION
TO THE
CAJA DE CREDITO AGRARIO, INDUSTRIAL Y MINERO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR THE
CAJA AGRARIA INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria) for
US$15.0 million equivalent, with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia,
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would he repayable over
17 years, including four years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would help finance the Caja Agraria Institutional
Development Project.
2.        Background.  Agr`culture is the largest sector in the Colombian
economy accounting for 22% of GDP and 63% of registered exports in 1985.
Agricultural activities provide employ!aent for two million people, a quarter
of the national labor force. The country is a net agricultural exporter: of
the US$3.8 billion total exports in 1985, coffee accounted for 47%, with
bananas, cut flowers, cotton and beef accounting for less than 5% each; agri-
cultural imports, mainly wheat, soybeans and fish products, represented 7% of
Colombia's USS4.2 billion registered imports in 1985. Agriculture expanded
steadily at rates above 4% p.a. during the 1970s, led by increasing non-
coffee agricultural exports in the first half of the decade. In the early
198ns by contrast, depressed international commodity markets kept agricul-
tural growth at 1.3% p.a. until 1984. Other factors contributing to the slow
sector performance of the early 1980s were: (a) the overvalued exchange rate
and sector policy shortcomings which imposed export restrictions on key com-
modities and import barriers for agricultural inputs; (b) reduced government
investments in agricultural infrastructure since the mid-1970s; and (c) rapid
real increases in the rural minimum wage, leading to higher production costs.
The exchange rate problems have been addressed by the Colombia Government
through a successful stabilization program undertaken during 1985-86. In the
same period, the Government also introduced measures to liberalize trade
and strengthen the institutional framework of the agricultural sector while
increasing the level of public sector investment in the sector, particularly
in 1987. The macroeconomic program and policy measures have been supported
by two Bank operations, the Trade Policy and Export Diversification (TPED)
loan and the Trade and Agricultural Policy (TAP) loan. These issues are
important elements in the Bank's continuing policy dialogue with Colombia.



3.        The primary source of funding for agricultural credit in Colombia
is the Agricultural Financing Fund (FFAP), established in 1973 as a
rediscount window of the Central Rank. FFAP provides, through public and
private financial intermediaries, more than half of the total supply of
agricultural credit in Colombia. FFAP, in turn, funds a large share of its
rediscounting operations with low-vielding bond issues, which banking
institutions acquire in proportion to their portfolio and volume of deposits
on a compulsory basis. This system, which places undue pressure on the
profitability and liquidity of the banking system, has been reviewed under
the TAP. Progress has been achieved in raising average interest rates, and
for some credit lines, these have been brought to levels close to market
iates. This has improved the profitability of the banking system and the
allocation of financial rsources. Further liberalization of the financial
system including the use of more market-oriented mechanisms for financing
FFAP continues to be an integral part of the Bank's macroeconomic dialogue
with the Government.
4.        The proposed project would focus on strengthening Caja Agraria, the
most important financial intermediarv for agriculture in Colombia, accounting
for 56% of the agricultural portfolio in 1984. Caja Agraria has assets
equivalent to US$1.4 billicn, a network of 878 branches and a staff of
13,000. Its main function is to provide credit and financial services to
agriculture-related activities, particularly medium- and small-scale
farming. Until the early 1970s, Caja Agraria was reasonably efficient, but
since then, non-banking functions it has assumed on behalf of the Government
as well as a deterioration in the quality of management have weakened its
operational effectiveness and quality of services. Caja Agraria has high
staff costs, largely as a resuit of its cumbersnme procedures, lack of
automation, and relatively high benefits package. Its extensive branch
network, established to reach large numbers of small farmers in remote areas,
contributes to the institution's high operating costs. Caja Agraria's loan
arrears are high at 17% of the total loan portfolio. Branch personnel spend
over half their time on administrative Functions to the neglect of customer
service and securing new business. Caja Agraria's performance since 1980 in
mobilizing deposits has been weak compared to other financial intermediaries,
largely due to its inability to offer savings instruments that are
competitive with those available in the market as a result of the high
administrative costs it incurs in its operations.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project supports the
Bank's strategy of assisting the growth and diversification of the key
agriculture sector and of improving the welfare of small farmers in CGAombia
in the context of the current Government's increased emphasis on poverty
alleviation. The Bank considers the strengthening of sector institutions as
a fundamental means of achieving such objectives. Bank participation in this
project would provide an important impetus to needed structural reforms in
the most important institution for agrtcultural credit to small farmers, Caja
Agraria.
6.       Project Objectives.  The project aims at rebuilding Caja Agraria
into a more efficient and self-sustaining financial intermediary, more
dependent of financial market mechanisms to support its activities, thereby
helping to improve the overall efficiency of rural financial markets. More
specifically, the project would help Caja Agragria to stengthen the quality



- 3 -
of its loan portfolio and reduce arrears, introduce automated data management
systems and simplify credit administration, stengthen resource mobilization,
rationalize the branch network and strengthen staff capabilities.
7.         Project Description.  The proposed project would comprise:  (a) an
estimated 370 staff-months of consultant services to assist Caja Agraria in:
(i) completing a loan portfolio review and improving portfolio management to
reduce loan ar:ears; (ii) defining and implementing measures to enhance its
accounting, data processing, and management information systems, and to
streamline administrative and credit procedures; (iii) revising the staff
remuneration package; (iv) rationalizing the operations and costs of its
branch network; (v) increasing the effectiveness of marketing and customer
service activities; and (vi) strengthening resource mobilization; (b) a
training program to upgrade the management, technical and marketing skills o;
Caja Agrari.i's personnel; (c) provision of data processing, office
administration and training equipment; and (d) renovation of branch
facilities, including civil works and furniture. The project is expected to
be carried out over 3 years at a total cost of US$35 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$15 million (43%). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Colombia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6571-CO of
January 15, 1988, is also attached.
8.         Agreed Actions.  Caja Agraria has agreed to:  (a) hold total
administrative costs through the Life of the project below th- 1986 level in
real terms; (b) reduce annual administrative costs expressed as a percentage
of loan portfolio by 34% by the end of 1990; (c) increase branch office staff
relative to total staff by 6 percentage points by the end of 1990; (d) reduce
loan portfolio arrears from 17% of the loan portfolio to 12% 'y the end of
1990; and (e) increase growth of deposit mobilization from the present 6.5%
p.a. in real terms to 8% p.a. by the end of 1990 (with annual intermediate
targets in the case of (b), (c) (d) and (e) above).
9.         In support of project implementation, Caja Agraria has agreed to:
(a) submit an annual training program to the Bank for approval two months
prior to the start of eacr: year of the project; (h) complete a review of the
loan portfolio and introduce a system to improve its management by June 30,
1988; (c) maintain a remuneration package satisfactory to the Bank which
would enable Caja Agraria to attract qualified staff; (d) design by June 30,
1988, and subsequently implement, improved accounting, management
information, and data processing systems; (e) prepare by December 31, 1988,
and subsequently implement, a plan for Caja Agraria to become a financially
self-sustaining institution; (f) undertake a mid-term review of the project
by June 30, 1989, together with the Government and the Bank, to evaluate
progress of the institutional strengthening and achievement of the agreed
performance targets and make mid-course corrections as necessary; (g) by
December 31, 1988, prepare and subsequently implement a plan for
rationalizing the branch network ('ncludiag a specific program to red,ce the
number of, or increase the efficiency of branches showing continuous losses);
and (h) by June 30, 1989 ar.d June 30, 1991, furnish to the Bank, tinder terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank, the conclusions of a public opiiion
survey on the quality of services it renders.  As conditions of loan



- 4 -
effectiveness, Cala Agraria also agreed to: (a) select the lead Consultant
to assist the Project Director; (b) prepare a statement, satisfactory to the
Government and to the Bank, on its objectives and strategies for achieving
them; (c) present Caja's financial statements for FY 86 audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (d) appoint a Deputy Project
Director acceptable to the Bank. The Government has agreed to pursue the
necessary meastures to enable Caja Agraria to achieve financial
self-sufficiency.
10.       Benefits.  Since Cala Agraria supplies half of all agriculture
credit in the country and virtualLy all the credit and financial services to
small farmers, more eff'cient financial intermediation will have a
substantial impact on agriculture. Furthermore, a self-sustaining and
profitable Caja Agraria operation would lessen the need to finance the sector
through FFAP's non-market mechanisms (para. 3), and eliminate the drain on
the national budget to cover Caja Agraria's operating deficits.
11.      Risks.  The main risks are associated with the schedule for the
implementation of institutional refornis. The size of Caja Agraria and its
long-established institutional practices may slow the pace of change.
However, the Government and Caja Agraria's recently appointed general manager
are strongly committed to the reforms envisaged in the action program.  This
project will be carefulLy moniitored through close supervision and a mid-term
review.
12.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
