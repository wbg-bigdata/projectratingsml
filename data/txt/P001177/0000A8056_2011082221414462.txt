                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to re-establish and improve road access and safeguard road infrastructure assets across the country by
                         rehabilitating/reconstructing the bridges along the main roads, notably in Northern Western and Regions where the road maintenance activities were suspended
                         since the beginning of the war.

                         The project's activities were frozen for five months (December 2010 to April 2011) because of the post electoral crisis which led to massive destruction of infrastructure. The project's
                         offices were completely looted and partially destroyed. A reallocation of Credit Proceeds has been requested by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire in a letter dated May 24, 2011 and
                         approved by the Bank on June 27, 2011. This reallocation will allow the project to repair the damaged infrastructure in the project's offices as well as support the sustainability of the
                         project through the acquisition of new IT equipment, furniture and vehicles. In addition it includes the financing of a study to define a strategic vision of the transport infrastructures
                         development (ports, airports, roads and railways), for future projects and to ensure consistency with all the projects aimed at improving transport efficiency within the Economic
                         Community of West African States (ECOWAS) zone. These activities (about $5 million) will be financed on the remaining resources. As of May 31, 2011, 94.8% of the Credit amount
                         has been disbursed and about US$ 10.35 million remains undisbursed.
