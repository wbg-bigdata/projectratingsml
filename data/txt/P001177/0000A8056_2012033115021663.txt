                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to re-establish and improve road access and safeguard road infrastructure assets across the country by rehabilitating/
                         reconstructing the bridges along the main roads, notably in Northern Western and Regions where the road maintenance activities were suspended since the beginning
                         of the war.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         broken into three key periods: (a) the first period until the major restructuring of 2003; (b) the second period until the restructuring/reactivation of 2008; and (c) the third and final
                         period until project closing in August 2011. The project was reactivated and restructured in September 2008 after the political crisis reached a positive outcome and the country was
                         reunited in a run up to new presidential elections. However, those elections were delayed until November 2010 and followed by a new crisis and a violent armed conflict which was
                         finally resolved in April 2011. The project was again suspended from December 2010 through May 2011.
                         As of August 31, 2011 the project closed with a disbursement rate of about 99%, and the following activities were implemented:
                         Component A: maintenance, rehabilitation and construction of road infrastructures
                         - 76 bridges were delivered out of a target of 60,

                         Component B: road safety activities
                         - Rehabilitation of the training center of OSER (Road Safety Office) and training/sensitization of 300 truck drivers;
                         - Rehabilitation of the bus station of Grand Bassam.
