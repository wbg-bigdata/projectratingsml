FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Government of Ivory Coast.
Beneficiaries:      Socifte PALMINDUSTRIE; Fonds d'Extension et de
Renouvellement (FER).
Amount:             US$13.4 million.
Terms:              20 years, including 5 years of grace; standard
variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:    Government would on-lend US$9.7 million of the loan
proceeds to PALMINDUSTRIE at the Bank's variable
interest rate plus 3% with the same maturity and grace
period as the Bank loan to the Government, with
Government bearing the foreign exchange risk; and
US$3.7 million to FER at 9Z p.a. interest rate at the
same maturity and grace period as the Bank Loan with
the Government bearing the foreign exchange risk.
ProJect
Description:        The proposed project would be IBRD's fifth operation
in the sub-sector. It would: (i) help the Ivory Coast
meet the increasing demand for fats and edible oils
through both replacement of existing ageing oil palm
plantings aqd development of new plantings in selected
areas of smallholdings, medium-sized plantations, and
industrial plantations; (ii) further diversify and
strengthen the Ivory Coast agricultural sector through
investment in a crop with an important comparative
advantage and good long-term growth prospects; and
(iii) assist in maintenance of a tree cover in an area
where the forest cover is being depleted at an
alarming rate. The project would consist of the
following components:
(a) establishment of 11,600 ha of new PALMINDUSTRIE
industrial oil palm plantations and replanting of
about 15,000 ha of ageing plantations; (b) development
of smallholder oil palm plantings through expansion
and replanting of existing areas by about 29,100 ha
and new planting of 6,900 ha; (c) establishment of a
pilot scheme of 2,100 ha medium-sized private oil palm
plantations; (d) construction of two oil mills for
PALMINDUSTRIE with eventual capacities each of 40 tons



- viii -
PTB/hour; (e) installation of effluent treatment
systems at all PALMINDUSTRIE oil mills; (f) support of
accompanying research on oil palm agronomy and
pathology; and (g) technical assistance to
PALMINDUSTRIE.
Benefits and Risks:
The principal project benefit would be the expansion of th, oil
palm sub-sector through the production of a diversification crop In which
Ivory Coast has a clear comparatlve advantage. Apart from the
establishment of two new agro-industrial complexes In a thinly populated
area with good climatic and soil conditions, the project mphasizes
replanting, densification and new planting adjacent to existitg
agro-industrial complexes which will put existing excess processing
capacity to economic use. The project vould strengthen PALMINDUSTRIE's
financial and managerial position and, by building up a record of
profitability for PALMINDUSTRIE and outgrowers, would pave the way for
future expansion of the oil palm sub-sector based on private
entrepreneurial initiative. The project would also provide benefits by
providing employment for some 8,000 smallholders and workers In the forest
region of the country.
The major project risk would be an inadequate standard of
management of existing operations and of the large planting program at
head office and at the agro-industrial complexes. The project provides
for technical assistance to strengthen magement, training and evaluation
of the implementation of the plantlng program. Moreovers a "Program-
contract" between Government and PALMINDUSTRIE would clearly delineate the
roles and responsibilities of each party during project Implementation.
The risk of unfavorable climatic conditions and lower than expected prices
of oil palm products exists, but the economic and financial viability of
the project would only be jeopardised by substantially lower prices and
yields.

IVORY COAST
FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMEKT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the RepuJlic of Ivory Coast has requested Bank
assistance in financing its Second Oil Palm Plan, a five-year project for
replanting and expansion of the oil palm sub-sector. The estimated
project cost is US$184.9 million equivalent of which PALMINDUSTRIE and
small and medium-sized outgrowers would contribute US$ 118.1 million. The
Bank and the other cofinanciers: Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique (CCCE) (France), Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)
(UK), the European Development Fund (EDF) and the European Investment Bank
tEIB) would finance the balance of US$ 66.8 million. The Bank would
contribute US$ 13.4 million equivalent. The proposed Project would be the
Bank's fifth intervention in the sub-sector.
1.02      Oil palm has a high comparative advantage in the forest zone of
the Ivory Coast. It is one of the diversification crops (including
rubber, coconut, cotton and fruit) which must take up the growth role in
agriculture previously occupied so dominantly by cocoa and coffee over the
last two decades. For various reasons, growth of oil palm stopped in the
late seventies. Its revitalisation commenced two years ago following
action taken by the Government to introduce management improvements which
would be consolidated under the proposed Project.  Expansion of oil palm
has a signifigant part to play in the Government's Structural Adjustment
Plan to restore economic growth. Production under the proposed Second
Oil Palm Plan would help remedy the neglect of the past eight years to
meet growing local demand and increase exports. If the Plan proceeds
well, the comparative advantage of the crop would be exploited to a
greater extent than envisaged at present and the rate of planting further
increased in line with the potential for the crop. In view of the
importance of the oil palm sector to agricultural growth, the Bank's
presence is desirable to help ensure that (a) the greatly expanded program
meets its objectives; (b) the full potential of the sector is being
exploited as rapidly as prudence allows (including the examination of
different mechanisms to permit more autofinancing and less dependence on
Government resources); and (c) the industrial and agricultural reforms
being supported by SALs are effectively applied to the sector.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      The Economy.  The impressive growth in gross domestic product
achieved during the two decades up until 1980 has been reversed during the
past four years. Since 1980, real per capita GDP has fallen with GDP
stagnating in current terms in the agricultural sector.  This
deterioration was due to a fall in the rate of volume increase of
agricultural products and alse in part to external factors such as a



- 2 -
return to more normal levels in the world market prices of primary
products such as cocoa, coffee and wood following the boom of 1978-80 as
well as a steep increase in the price of oil. The debt service burden of
the country increased as more local currency was required to service the
heavy borrowing program the Government had instigated in the 1970's,
because of the depreciation of the CFA franc and the increase in interest
rates on t'ne exterral debt. The country's growth potential has also been
affected in recent years by a combination of the following factors: (i) a
sharp deterioration in the quality of public investment programs since the
middle 1970's (large projects with high unit costs were embarked upon with
low and even negative rates of return); (ii) distortions in the system of
industrial incentives, giving little encouragement to the development of
domestic industries capable of competing with traditional foreign import
sources; and (iii) inadequate support to agricultural development,
agricultural projects receiving only a small part of the public investment
program in recent years (19X in 1984). Population in 1984 was estimated
to be 9.8 million with an average growth rate of almost 5% per annum over
the past 10 years, accentuated significantly (approximately 1.9% p.a.) by
the influx of immigrants from neighbouring countries, who today constitute
between 25-30% of the country's total population.
2.02      Economic Prospects.   In the second half of the 1980s, GDP
growth is not expected to match the rates achieved in the 1960s and 1970s.
Short term prospects have been affected by the drought of the last two
years on agricultural output. Export crop price forecasts are lower than
those attained in the boom years of the 1970s, and reserves of oil
discovered in offshore drilling are lower than expected. Financial
constraints on development over the next few years are tight, requiring
the maintenance of restrictive fiscal, investment and monetary policies.
In 1985, the debt service ratio (after rescheduling) is estimated at 28Z
of the country's export earnings, while the figure for 1986 is expected to
be around 48% in the absence of a rescheduling, underlining the critical
need for public finance restraint. To achieve sustained growth in the
medium to long term, a comprehensive adjustment strategy is required,
based on a major shift in incentives towards the production of tradeables
for export and for efficient import substitution. In this perspective, it
will be necessary to reverse the lasting discrimination against
agriculture in the system of incentives and to extend to agriculture the
industrial incentive reform launched under SAL II. This will be achieved
through the extension of the tariff and export subsidy scheme to all
agricultural activities with the exception of coffee and cocoa, given the
position of the country in international markets for these two
commodities. In particular, the overall level of incentives to
agriculture will be set so as to reflect the medium to long term
opportunity value of foreign exchange to the economy, thereby encouraging
the allocation of resources towards areas of comparative advantage for the
country. Accordingly, among agricultural activities, high priority should
be given to crops enjoying low domestic resource cost coefficients such as
oil palm, rubber, and cotton, which also allows for increasing diversifi-
cation, away from traditional coffee and cocoa. After the poor
performance of 1983 and 1984, agricultural growth is expected to improve
in 1985 and to continue increasing during the second half of the decade
witL improved productivity of public sector Investments.

B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      The past growth of the Ivory Coast economy has been due in large
part to the development of the agricultural sector. For at least the next
decade, the country's future growth is expected to remain tied to the
continued progress made by this sector. Agriculture is the key to more
balanced regional and income development policies with presently about 60%
of the population depending directly on farming as a source of livelihood.
The bulk of agricultural production comes from some 900,000 smallholder
farms. While the number of cash crops which have been encouraged over
recent years has increased - with new emphasis on oil palm, coconuts,
rubber, cotton and sugar - cocoa and coffee production, which represent
23% and 5Z of total world supply respectively, still dominate the
agricultural economy and together contribute 75% of total foreign exchange
earnings from the sector. The two crops still represent 90% of the annual
new tree crop plantings (80,000 ha). Agricultural development based on
export crops in the 1960's and early 1970's was characterised by (a) the
exploitation of favorable world markets; (b) the establishment of
appropriate extension and research infrastructure under the coordination
of well-staffed development agencies; and (c) the stimulation of cash crop
production by realistic producer price policies. Over recent years,
however, agricultural development agencies have become less efficient with
(a) growing fixed costs and heavy staff budgets; (b) marketing of the
crops for which they are responsible turned over to separate Government
agencies; and (c) generally, an increasing remoteness from the research
agencies. Regulated producer price policies have also generated
increasingly larger margins for the Treasury at the expense of the farmer.
2.04      In recognition of certain disadvantages inherent in a policy of
development dependent upon a limited number of export crops, and the
regional disequilibrium within the country which this entails, the
Government announced, in 1980. a new orientation for its agricultural
development. The principal points included (i) a renewed intention to
increase diversification of export crops to ensure an improved stability
in export earnings; (ii) a search for ways to achieve food crops
self-sufficiency; (iii) promotion of smallholder agriculture and
encouragement to young farmers to remain on the land through improved
productivity incentives and the introduction of more modern agricultural
production techniques, including mechanisation; and (iv) encouragement of
the agricultural cooperative movement. This new policy was to be
accompanied by a harmonisation of price, tax and subsidy policies, credit
reforms and a reorganisation of development agencies so as to provide the
farmers with a greater direct participation in the development process.
The impact of this new orientation has still to make itself felt. During
a Government reshuffle in late 1983, a new Ministry of Rural Development
was created, one of whose major objectives was the promotion of food crop
self-sufficiency. Export and plantation crops, including oil palm, remain
under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forests.
Recent increases in producer prices have improved returns for cocoa.

coffee, cotton. oil palm, rubber and rice producers. A positive decision
of significance taken in 1983 returned responsibility for local and export
marketing of palm products from the Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien
des Prix des Productions Agricoles (CSSPPA) to PALMINDUSTRIE, the
parastatal company responsible for oil palm and coconut production (para
2.11). This was accompanied by the recruitment of the services of a
consortium of private firms to strengthen the management of the company
(para 2.12).  Similar actions are now under consideration for the state
owned sugar industry.
C. The Forest Region
2.05      The country comprises two distinct agricultural regions, the
drier savannah in the north and the humid forest region in the south where
oil palm plantations are located. The characteristics of the latter are
given below.

Dominant food crops                               Yams, Plantains, Taro,
Rice, Maize.
The forest region has a richer resource base than the savannah, a denser
and more rapidly growing population, predominantly perennial crops, and
emerging land constraints in most areas. Dense tropical forest is the
natural vegetation (at the turn of the century it used to cover 16 million
ha) but has been largely replaced by secondary forest, bush and tree crops
leaving only about 3 million ha. The main crops are cocoa and coffee,
with a combined total of 2.3 million ha and comprising 68% of the cropped
area; food crops such as maize, rice, plantains, cassava, taro and yams
make up a quarter of the planted area. Along the coast, industrial and
smallholder plantations of oil palm (90,000 ha), coconut palm (47,000 ha),
and rubber (41,000 ha) are locally important, but still comprise only
about 5% of the total cropped area.

D. The Oil Palm Sub-Sector
2.06      The palm oil produced in Ivory Coast was, until the early
1960's, obtained from natural oil palm stands in the forest areas and from
the few plantations of selected oil palm varieties operated by the
Institut de Recherche des Huiles et Oleagineux (IRHO). From the
mid-1960's, under the First Oil Palm Plan and following the creation of
SODEPALM (para 2.11), several industrial plantations were created along
the coastal strip of Ivory Coast. The creation of smallholder plantings
around the industrial plantations started in 1966-69 and continued at a
slightly lower rate thereafter until 1976 when a new surge in smallholder
planting began. Due to tLe internal problems of PALMINDUSTRIE (para
2.11), this expansion was short-lived, lasting only to 1978 after which
planting ceased until 1983. The accelerated program now necessary is the
direct consequence of this backlog in planting.

2.07      The oil palm sub-sector now ranks fourth among the country's
major sources of agricultural products after cocoa, coffee and forestry,
providing a living to some 200,000 people. In 1983, the area under oil
palm industrial plantations was approximately 50,000 ha (1963: 3,000 ha),
with 10,000 smallholder plantlngs covering approximately 32,000 ha (1965:
approx. 3,200 ha). These plantings were established by the nucleus
estate/suallholder system at nine agro-industrial complexes. The past
planting program of industrial and smallholder plantations is suumarized



-6-
in the graph above. Palm oil production in 1983/84 was approximately
146,000 tons (1968: 3,600 tons), of which some 25-30,000 tons were
exported. In the absence of the proposed project, it is projected that
Ivory Coast will become a palm oil importer by 1993, with imports rising
to 50,000 tons or 35Z of demand by 2000 (para 5.07).
2.08      The oil palm sub-sector falls into three groups: (i)
PALMINDUSTRIE, which operates nine nucleus estates/agro-industrial
complexes averaging 6.000 ha per complex, and a few other smaller
plantations which produce crude palm oil and kernel oil; (ii) small and
medium-sized outgrowers which sell their fresh fruit bunches (FFB) to
PALMINDUSTRIE; and (iii) a local processing industry which purchases the
raw material from PALMINDUSTRIE and produces refined palm oil and soap
stock derivatives. The farmgate price of FFB paid to outgrovers is fixed
annually by Government decree and has, with few exceptions, been below the
border price equivalent of the FFB, even assuming the official exchange
rate for the CFA Franc (see the graph below).

2.09      Until 1983, CSSPPA was responsible for the marketing of
PALMINDUSTRIE's output which it sold on the export market or to the local
processing industry at a slight discount. CSSPPA surrendered a part of
the sales revenue to PALMINDUSTRIE which was sufficient only to cover
operating costs and services to smallholders. In October 1983, the
marketing function was transferred to PALMINDUSTRIE. PALMINDUSTRIE's
sales to the domestic market are now being transacted at a price which is
fixed by the Government and which, during the last two years, was mostly
between 10 and 40Z below world prices, even assuming the official rate of
exchange for the CFA Franc. The recent excess of export over domestic
crude palm oil prices has placed PALMINDUSTRIE in a conflict of interest
situation: it is more attractive for PALMINDUSTRIE to export crude palm
oil than to sell it to the local processing industry which has, in fact,
complained about inadequate supplies. Since 1983, the processing
industry's purchases from PAIMINDUSTRIE have been subject to negotiated
quotas of about 80% of the quantities purchased prior to the introduction
of such quotas. The differential between domestic and export market
prices has in addition caused a speculative demand by individual exporters
purchasing crude palm oil from PALMINDUSTRIE for sale in the export market
at the higher world price. However, the official domestic price of
refined palm oil to the consumer is substantially above world market
levels which are currently artificially low due to Malaysia's subsidies
for the export of refined palm oil. The domestic wholesale price of
refined palm oil has, in the period 1970 to 1984, been about 15-20% above
a notional world price of refined palm oil calculated from the
international crude palm oil price.
E. Institutions
PALMINDUSTRIE
2.10      The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forests is responsible
for plantation and export crops, including cocoa, coffee, forestry, oil
palm, coconut, cotton and rubber. PALMINDUSTRIE is a State Corporation
(Societe d'Etat) responsible for developing the oil palm and coconut
sub-sectors and the marketing of the primary products from the industrial
and smallholder plantings. Day to day management of PALMINDUSTRIE is the
responsibility of the General Manager (Directeur General) who reports to a
Board which includes representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance, Industry, Trade, the Economic and Social Council, CSSPPA and the
privately owned Blohorn Company (the major local processing company, a
subsidiary of Unilever).   The Board of Directors meets three times a year
to determine the general policy of the company and approve the accounts,
budget and investment program. PALMINDUSTRIE's annual budget is reviewed
and approved by the Ministry through the Directorate for Budget. PLanning
and Management Control (DPBCG). PAIMINDUSTRIE employs 14,500 persons; 41
of whom are expatriate staff, 31 being directly employed and 10 provided
through contracts with UNIPLANT and IRHO (para 2.12). The book value of
its capital is CFAF 35.5 billion (US$72.4 million).

2.11      Evolution of PALMINDUSTRIE.  PALMINDUSTRIE in its present form
is the result of 15 years of almost continuous restructuring in the
industry. The State Corporation originally in charge of the oil palm
sector, SODEPALM vas established in 1963 and underwent an important
restructuring in 1969. The result was the creation of PALMINDUSTRIE as
owner and operator of the palm oil mills. Further restructuring, in 1977,
transferred the responsibility for marketing from SODEPALM to CSSPPA and
resulted in continued reduction in the responsibilities of SODEPALM, which
is now a food crop extension agency in the coastal and forest zone with no
involvement in oil palm or coconuts. During this period PALMINDUSTRIE
progressively assumed the oil palm and coconut plantation responsibilities
of SODEPALM. In 1978, PALMINDUSTRIE took charge of management of the
industrial plantations and, in 1983, the marketing responsibility of
CSSPPA (para 2.04). PALMINDUSTRIE had by this time very much the same
functions as SODEPALM 20 years earlier. Until 1974/75, SODEPALM had
functioned well, either meeting or exceeding production forecasts.
However, after this date, as pointed out in a recent joint evaluation by
OED and CCCE 1/, the above restructurings had a very damaging effect on
its management and financial performance and on the morale and quality of
its staff. Transfer of the marketing function from SODEPALM to CSSPPA was
a major cause of its financial difficulties since surpluses were not used
on a priority basis to meet the corporation's financing needs. The
transfer also led to rigid budgeting and financing procedures forcing
SODEPALM and its successor, PALMINDUSTRIE, into unsound pre-financing
arrangements. Head Office management became ineffective and financial
control was poor. The deterioration of the financial position is
demonstrated below by the evolution of net operating results and working
capital funds over the period 1975-82:

2.12      The return of marketing responsibility to PALMINDUSTRIE, the
change in its top management and provision of management staff under a
technical assistance contract (para 2.04) were major factors in the
improvement of PALMINDUSTRIE's performance (para 2.16). The technical
assistance contract with UNIPLANT, a consortium of three French companies,
(Plantations des Terres Rouges, SOCFIN and SODECI International) commenced

Coconut Development Projects, May 7, 1984.

in 1983. Under the contract, the services of seven expatriates are
provided for the headquarters positions of Technical, Financial, Marketing
(part- time) and Personnel Managers and for the positions of Managers of
the Vridi Oil Seed Crushing Plant and the Central Workshop. In addition,
three expatriates from IRHO occupy the positions of Deputy General
Manager, Chief of Studies Division, and Field Inspector. These
expatriates will have a key role to play in the proposed project and an
assurance was obtained at negotiations that PALMINDUSTRIE will continue
the present arrangements for employment of personnel from an oil palm
management company and an oil palm research institution during the
implementation period (para 7.01(a)). In addition, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that (i) the Bank will be consulted on
substantial changes in PALMINDUSTRIE's organizational structure and (ii)
that the quality of senior management will be maintained (para 7.01(b)).
2.13      In connection with plans for privatization, the Government is
considering conver*ing PALMINDUSTRIE into a Societe d'Economie Mixte
(SEM), a Joint Public/Private Enterprise, which would allow private
participation in its equity. However, PALMINDUSTRIE has only recently
begun to perform satisfactorily in financial terms and it will have to
consistently show positive results and a record of increasing dividend
payments over a longer period before private investors can be expected to
take a meaningful stake in the company. The proposed project does not
therefore focus directly on privatization, but on creating conditions
conducive to privatization while addressing the most pressing need: the
implementation of the proposed planting program to cover domestic
vegetable oil requirements and increase oil exports. At negotiations, an
assurance  was obtained that Government will consult with the Bank on the
proposed arrangements for participation by any private investor in the
equity of PAMIXNDUSTRIE (para 7.01(c)). The conversion to a SEN is
desirable but not essential, provided a "Contrat Plan" (Program-contract)
can be worked out between the Government and PALMINDUSTRIE that would set
the technical and financial parameters under which the company would work
(para 4.02). Furthermore, an assurance was obtained at negotiations that
Government will provide the Bank with details of proposals for the future
legal and corporate status of PALMINDUSTRIE (para 7.01(d)).
2.14      Organisation and Management. Headquarters consist of  a central
office, central workshop, stores, and a seed crushing plant. Each of
Palmindustrie's nine agro-industrial complexes consists of an industrial
plantation and a palm oil mill and a development and extension service for
smallholders within a radius of about 20 km of the mill. The management
of Palmindustrie's plantations is generally good. The plantations have an
average yield of FFB of 10 tons/ha (range 8-14 tons/ha) and labor and
management norms compare satisfactorily with those in S.E. Asia, although
yields are 50% lower than those found in Malaysia because of less fertile
soil and more uneven distribution of rainfall. Research now taking place
with vegetative propagation of elite material promises to increase yields
by 25%.  During the past 3-4 years, PALMINDUSTRIE has developed a
management structure with a satisfactory capacity for planning,
supervision and control at the central office. The manager of each
agro-industrial complex is responsible for timely and economic

office establishes policy and overall plans and provides supervision,
support and control of field operations through regular visits by the
Manager of Agricultural Production and the three Production and two
Processing Inspectors. Control is also obtained through an increasingly
computerized system of annual budgets and monthly progress reports.
Decentralization measures still under implementation will further transfer
administrative responsibilities for each plantation or groups of
plantations to managers in the field, leaving at Head Office the
formulation of corporate policy, internal audit, consolidation of estate
budgets, monthly preparation of technical and financial comparative
summary reports and consolidation of annual results. Technical support,
central workshop and stores, and marketing will remain centralised.
2.15      PALMINDUSTRIE's short and medium term goals are the
consolidation of an efficient organisation able to cultivate, harvest,
process and market palm and coconut products. Further development and
refining of the management systems already instituted will take place ovor
several years under a Management Development Action Program which has
recently been developed for the establishment of management
information/cost control systems, training and personnel management. A
summary of the program is found in Annex 2-1; it shows the elements of the
program, the steps that have already been taken, those that remain to be
carried out, and the time frame within which they are expected to be
completed. A time-table for completion of the major elements of the
Action Program was submitted at negotiations and is satisfactory.
Assurances were obtained that the Action Program will be implemented in
accordance with the agreed time-table (para 7.01(e)).
2.16      Recent PALMINDUSTRIE Performance.  Following the transfer of
marketing responsibility to PALMINDUSTRIE and the radical measures taken
with regard to management and financial control, there has been a major
iuprovement in the performance of PALMINDUSTRIE. The establishment of
technical standards, strict cost control and comparative cost analysis has
led to plantations and mills being operated with increased efficiency.
Cost data prior to 1983 are unreliable but, since that date, stronger
control by Head Office over physical targets and costs has reduced
overhead and field costs. In current terms, the f.o.b. cost of production
per ton of crude palm oil was CFAF 117,150 in 1983 and CFAF 115,780 in
1984. This represented a reduction of 8% in real terms. Agricultural
costs were reduced by 15Z. Revenue and net earnings have both increased
as shown below:

Sales proceeds In 1980-83 were retained by CSSPPA and the revenues in
those years were therefore not related to selling prices. In 1984,
PALMINDUSTRIE sold 352 of its palm oil on the world market at an average
price of CFAF 332,800/wt. If the entire production had been sold at that
price, PALMINDUSTRIE net revenues would have been about CFAF 20.0 billion.
Also in 1984, additional charges to operations amounted to CFAF 19.5
billion due to the adoption of a more conservative depreciation policy,
recognition of exchange rate differences to-date and other factors
detailed In Annex 2-2. In 1983 and 1984, PAIMINDUSTRIE achieved without
difficulty planting programs of 3,620 and 5,525 ha for smallholdings and
industrial plantations respectively in a project financed by the EDF. The
Intensity of smallholder harvesting has increased following price
increases for FFB and the wider adoption of the Malaysian harvesting pole.
Some 2,000 ha of 6,000 ha previously abandoned smallholdings are in the
process of rehabilitation under supervision of the PALMINDUSTRIE extension
services. Data relating to recent financial performance and mill
efficiency are presented In Annex 2-2.
Smallholders
2.17        In addition to oil palm industrial plantations, PALMINDUSTRIE
plays a major role in the operation and expansion of the smallholder
program, at present accounting for 40% of the total area planted with oil
palm. The smalibolder extenslon service is weak in terms of the
regularity of farm visits, the diffusion of technical messages and the
training of extension agents. As a result, average yields (6 tons/ha) are
some 40Z lower than those achieved on the estates (10 tons/ha), although
some oil palm fruit is sold in the local markets and therefore not
accounted for. Modifications to the organisation of the extension
services designed to alleviate the above weaknesses are described in para
4.05.



- 12 -
Medium-sized Plantations
2.18      The development approach employed so far has been that of the
classical nucleus estate and smallholder model. As a variant to this
approach and as in the Fourth Rubber Project (Ln. 2323-IVC of 1983), the
Government wishes to promote. as does PALMINDUSTRIE, medium-sized
plantations of between 50 and 150 ha as compared to the large size
plantations of 1,000 to 4,000 ha. The objectives of this new approach
would be (1) to provide an alternative to PALMINDUSTRIE as the sole
development agent of the sub-sector and to harness entrepreneurial
initiative; (ii) to provide an outlet for private investors interested in
the sub-sector; and (iii) to develop, in view of the limited amount of
land available for further large industrial plantations, an efficient
medium-sized plantation sub-sector with (a) lower overhead costs than
large plantations and (b) higher productivity but lower extension costs
than with the average smallholder. Unlike the smallholders, the
medium-sized plantations would be expected to be independent entities with
their own harvest and transport equipment and their own social and housing
facilities for staff and labor. Processing would be carried out in
PALMINDUSTRIE mills.
2.19      Prospective entrepreneurs would fall into four groups:
'i)    private investors who previously focussed on the urban sector,
but now seek investment opportunities in organised areas of the
rural sector;
(ii)    civil servants, singly or in groups, interc ited in involvement
in farming, after retirement at 55 years;
(iii)   young agricultural graduates;
(Iv)    groups of smallholders.
Under the Project, this new approach would be implemented over
an initial area of some 2,000 ha and is described in more detail in
Chapter III. PALMINDUSTRIE has carried out a feasibility study,
satisfactory to the Bank, on the development of this area.
The Expansion and Replanting Fund (FER)
2.20      Existing Situation.  The objective of the Expansion and
Replanting Fund is to provide short, medium and long term financing for
the production or processing of oil palm and coconut products, including
both industrial and smallholder plantings. PER past and ongoing
operations include the financing of: social infrastructure on
PALMINDUSTRIE industrial plantations; the establishment and maintenance of
suallholder and industrial oil palm and coconut plantations; and, to a
lesser extent, studies associated with the development of oil palm and
coconuts. In the past, interest rates charged by FER have been ad hoc and
generally at subsidised levels. The present policy of FER is that loans
be passed on at the rate at which the necessary funds were received by
FER. FER was created in 1964 as a Fund under Decree 64-223. In 1969,



- 13 -
under Law 69-246, FER was granted a legal existence and financial
autonomy. Decree 69-264 of the same date created a Management Committee
of three members representing the M4nistries of Agriculture, Finance and
Planning.
2.21      Under Decree 69-264 the Management Committee, which includes in
addition the Directeur General of PALMINDUSTRIE as an observer, is obliged
to meet at least once a year. Until end 1984, the Committee was served by
a Secretary General, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture who
resigned at that date and has not yet been replaced. At present, the
Director General of PALMINDUSTRIE represents the Ministry of Agriculture
on the Management Committee. The Committee is responsible for the
approval of annual budgets, activity plans, and annual reports. It is
served by a small staff which includes the Secretary General, a part-time
secretary and an official of the Ministry of Finance, paid by FER,
ma4ntains the accounts and another official from the same Ministry
supervises budgets and accounts. The budget, activity plans and annual
reports are prepared by the Secretary General of the Committee. Proper
financial statements of FER have been prepared and a satisfactory audit of
FEM's accounts up to end 1984 is available.   However, the existing
accounting system is not fully satisfactery and requires improvement, as
do the organisational, management and operating arrangements. On the
other hand, transactions between FER and PALMINDUSTRIE are adequately
recorded in the PALMINDUSTRIE accounts.  Repayment of loans from FER to
PALMINDUSTRIE is on schedule.
2.22      Proposed Measures. Government intends to endow FER  Lith a legal
status which vould allow Government to onlend externally raised funds to
the PER and allow the FER to build up reserves. Under the future legal
structure, the FER would be maintained as a small, simple organisation but
independent in its policy formulation, accounting and control from
PALMfIDUSTRIE. Establishment of FER under new statutes satisfactory to
the Bank would be a condition of Loan effectiveness (para 7.02(a)).
The National Agricultural Development Bank
2.23      The National Agricultural Development Bank (BEDA) was created in
1968 to become the major source of credit to the agricultural sector.
BNDA's active participation in the development of the agricultural sector
is however impeded by severe problems at management level, a deficient
management information system and an unsatisfactory record nf credit
recovery.  Management of BNDA has recently been taken over by t.'e Central
Bank. At this stage, BNDA cannot satisfactorily participate in the
Project. However, the Bank is already involved with BNDA in the Ivory
Coast Fourth Rubber Project (Ln. 2323-IVC of 1983) and, once the present



- 14 -
troubles of BNDA are resolved, will be actively working with Government on
the preparation of a project for the development of agricultural credit
institutions.
The Ministry of Education and Scientific Research
2.24       The Ministry is in charge of research in the oil palm
sub-sector. The main research station is at La Me, with substations at
Dabou and Sassandra. The quality of research is high and impressive
progress is being made in the advanced field of vegetative propagation.
Due to the present difficult economic situation, the research stations in
Ivory Coast ar^ suffering from a shortage of operating funds. A National
Agricultural Research Project now under preparation for assistance by the
Bank would deal with this and other problems of the research system.
Long Term Sub-sector and Institutional Strategy
2.25      Given the potential for further expansion of oil palm and
coconuts and the need to export their products in the context of national
economic growth and diversification away from cocoa and coffee, Government
and PALMINDUSTRIE propose that a study be undertaken to define the best
strategy to reach these objectives. The present organisational pattern
and arrangements of the sub-sector could continue but other alternatives
could also be examined. So far, expansion has depended almost entirely on
Government intervention in the sector. Greater private involvement in
both large and medium-sized plantations would permit the sub-sector to
mobilize more capital than is likely to be available from Government
sources, and the possible forms of private capital investment in the
sub-sector should be identified. Privatising existing Government
investments in PALMINDUSTRIE is one possibility. Splitting up
PALMINDUSTRIE into smaller, more flexible and dynamic units able to
undertake further expansion programs is another alternative. Finally, the
feasibility of establishing joint ventures between Government and private
plantation operators and investors operating in parallel to PALMfIDUSTRIE
could be examined. The selection of areas and soils for future expansion
would also require careful consideration, particularly in relation to
environmental effects where clearing of forest is proposed. The
unfavorable trend in rainfall distribution over the past 20 years is such
that expansion should be concentrated on alluvial and low lying soils with
high water tables. North Tamabo included in the project would be the
f' st development of this type.  The above study should therefore include
a soil survey to determine the location and suitability of soils with a
high oil palm and coconut yield potential, taking into account the
suitability for rubber, also an important diversification crop for vhich
it is proposed that the Bank provide further financing in the future. The
study would be the basis for Government plans for the future development
of the tree crop sector overall.  Arrangementr for the implementation of
the study are in para 3.17.

F. Bank Involvement in the Oil Palm Sub-Sector
2.26      Between 1969 and 1978 Bank contributions to the oil palm/coconut
sub-sector in the Ivory Coast totalled US$46.7 million providing partial
financing for four projects with a global estimated cost of US$96.0
million. In addition to the Bank and parallel CCCE interventions in the
sector, EDF is currently contributing US$12.2 million to the financing of
a three-year project (1983-85) aimed at replanting and extension of 14,000
ha of both industrial oil palm plantations and smallholdings. The above
four Bank-financed projects made an important contribution to the
agricultural infrastructure on which the oil palm and coconut programs
were based. Generally, the OED Evaluation Report (para 2.11) acknowledged
the physical achievements under the four Bank supported proj ects but
identified important smallholder problems, particularly with coconuts,
related to unsatisfactory smaslholder selection, poor extension and
inadequate prices. The present project will address these issues.
III.   THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      The major objective of the proposed project, which covers Ivory
Coast's Second Oil Palm Plan, is to increase the country's palm oil
production to meet the rapidly increasing domestic demand for fats and
oils and to diversify the export revenue base of the country, both through
replacement of ageing oil palm plantations and development of new
plantings in selected areas cf smalIholdings, medium-sized plantations,
and industrial plantations. Successful implementation of the Plan would
pave the way for an increased rate of planting in line with the potential
for the crop.    Furthermore, the forest area of the country is being
rapidly depleted and environmental considerations require maintenance of
the forest and tree crop area to the extent feasible. The oil palm is a
tree crop of major Importance which can be grown economically by both
industrial plantations and outgrowers, small and mediun'-sized.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.02      The period during which the Project will be executed is a
critical one, upon which depends the future capacity of the sub-sector to
generate sufficient production of a key food item for the domestic market
and to develop a third major export crop besides cocoa and coffee in the
forest zone. Although PALI4NDUSTRIE has achieved major improvements during
the early 1980s, the achievement of the proposed larger project is very
dependent on a core group of nationals and expatriates at head office. A
major program of Ivorianisation has been carried out over the past two
years and many of the Ivorians in senior positions, although dynamic and
motivated, do not yet have a long experience. That PALMIIDUSTRIE has
recovered dramatically over the past few years does not necessarily mean
that it has achieved full efficiency nor that this improved performance
would continue without the Project. Experience in the 1970's shows how
quickly PALMflDUSTRIE can deteriorate. Furthermore, the expansion



- 16 -
envisaged is a much bigger task than the rehabilitation and area expansion
of the early 1980s, although similar to that of the 1960s. The technical
support and discipline associated with a Bank proj ect are considereu vital
for the implementation of the project within the tight time frame
necessary. The Government desires Bank participation for this very
reason. Apart from the question of project discipline, it will be
necessary during project implementation to define the strategy for future
development of the sub-sector (para 2.25). The Project will be a vehicle
for (i) an adequate dialogue on strategy for this important sector between
Government, PALMINDUSTRIE and the Bank; and (ii) ensuring continued
compatibility between agricultural and industrial policies in a leading
area of agro-industrial activity. The preparation of this Project was
financed from the Project Preparation Facility.
C. The Project Area
3.03      The project will be located in the tropical forest zone of the
southern Ivory Coast (see Map). The new plantings in the project will be
mostly confined to the south-eastern and south-western parts of the
country which are well suited to oil palm development. The new industrial
and smallholder plantings in the south-west will be located at Blidouba
and Neka. These are on the Tabou to Ta. Government road, which will be
upgraded under the proposed Second HR'ghway Sector Loan. Tabou is
connected with San Pedro por  aGa palm oil bulking facilities by a
Government road of 104 km, which will be rehabilitated and improved under
the ongoing First and proposed Second Highway Sector Loans. Because of
their importance to the project, assurances were obtained at negotiations
that Government will maintain these roads in a condition which will allow
transport of the produce of Blidouba and Neka all year around (para
7.01(f)). The main technical characteristics of the area are summarized
in the table below. Details are in Annex 3-1.

3.04     Despite less favorable climatic and soil conditions in the
central south near to Abidjan, modest planting will continue there, mainly
in the context of the smallholder program. Because of a substantial
demand for fresh fruit for artisanal production of fresh "red palm oil"
for domestic consumption, there is a need for oil palm plantings in the
central south area. SmAllholders in these areas sell part of their
production to PALMINDUSTRIE and a smaller part to the parallel markets for
fresh fruit and for artisanal fresh oil production. Without these central
south plantings, the suallholder, even in areas far from Abidjan, would be
tempted to sell to the parallel market for FFB instead of to
PALMINDUSTRIE. Not only would this situation reduce PALKINDUSTRIE's
supply of FFB, it would undermine the current smallholder credit system
based on a cess on the FFB sold to and collected by PALMINDUSTRIE.
3.05     Land Tenure. PALMINDUSTRIE has negotiated land rights with both
Government and the local population in the south-west where new plantings
are planned at Blidouba and Neka. At North Tamabo the land has already
been declassified for the use of Societe pour le Developpement des
Plantations Forestiares (SODEFOR). Arrangements for transfer from SODEFOR
have been made. At negotiations, PALNIUSTRIE provided documetation
satisfactory to the Bank, demonstrating for each land area, (i) the status
of occupation; (ii) the rates of compensation to be provided in the case
of acquisition; and (iii) evidence that the land is available for use by
PALMINDUSTRIE.
3.06     Labor. The availability of labor will be adequate for areas to
be replanted, where labor will be released from former maintenance and
harvesting activities. The labor requirement for the new industrial
plantings is expected to reach a peak of 3,700 man years in 1989 and is
not anticipated to be a problem. Criteria for smallholder selection will
include labor availability.
D. Project Description
3.07     The proposed project will finance a five year program of
planting and also the associated additional oil palm processing capacity.
The project will consist of the following components:
Industrial Plantations
(a) establishment by PALMINDUSTRIE of 11,600 ha of new industrial
oil palm plantations in the south-west, at Blidouba (3,000 ha),



- 18 -
Neka (6,000 ha), and in the center at North Tamabo (2,000 ha)
and Bolo (600 ha);
(b)  replanting of about 15,000 ha of ageing industrial oil palm
plantations spread over the entire PALMINDUSTRIE area;
Smallholder Plantings
(c) expansion and replanting of existing smallholder oil palm
plantings by about 29,100 ha around all the existing
PAIMINDUSTRIE plantations;
(d) establishment of about 6,900 ha new smallbolder oil palm
plantings at Ehania, Dabou, North Tamabo, Blidouba and Neka;
Medium-sized Plantations
(e) establishment of a pilot scheme of medium-sized oil palm
plantations, amounting to 2,100 ha at Blidouba, Neka and North
Tamabo;
Oil Mills
(f)  construction of two palm oil mills with eventual capacities each
of 40 tons FFBIhour;
Effluent Treatment
(g) establishment of effluent treatment systems at all PALMINDUSTRIE
oil mills;
Research
(h) support for accompanying research on oil palm agronomy and
pathology;
Technical Assistance
(i) technical assistance to PALMINDUSTRIE for project
implementation, the evaluation of project progress and the
development of a training program.
E. Detailed Features
3.08      The Planting Program.  The total planting program amounts to
close to 65,000 ha, equivalent to about 75% of the present planted area of
oil palm. The detailed planting program is in Annex 3-2. The program
consists of (i) new planting in new areas; (ii) new planting within
existing areas (densification); and (lii) replanting. The program is
summarized graphically below according to project year and type of

planting. These physical targets are considered feasible since (i) the
overall program will be spread among twelve sites where - with the
exception of the two new locations at Neka and Blidouba - infrastructure,
staff, facilities and equipment already exist; (ii) the actual area
planted either through new plantings and/or replantings vill not be more
than 10-15X per annum of the present hectarages at the ten existing sites;
(iii) the number of smallholder participants which, at 8,000. is
relatively small from a management view point in relation to the number of
sites; and (iv) the agricultural techniques are well established.
Technical aspects are in Annex 3-1. The target of 12,000 ha planting in
the current EDF project will be surpassed by over 15% (para 2.16).
Nursery facilities have been established for a 5,400 ha planting program
in 1985 and the planting material will be available on schedule.
3.09      Industrial Plantations.  New industrial planting is constrained
by the availability of land close to existing collection and processing
centers. The proposed area of 11,000 ha for new industrial planting under
the project will be limited to two sites in the south- west, Neka and
Blidouba. and to new areas near existing sites at North Tamabo and Bolo in
the center (see Map). New oil mills of eventual 40 tons FFB/hour capacity
will be established only at Neka and Blidouba (para 3.13).
3.10      The industrial plantation replanting program has been drawn up
to cover the next 25 years. The short term objective is to compensate for
the backlog in replanting resulting from the failure to replant in
1977-81, by replanting 15,00) ha of ageing plantations. The longer term
objective is to even out the age composition of the plantations, to reach
a relatively constant annual rate of replanting. These objectives will be
achieved by the proposed replanting program, which has been designed to
balance the rate of replanting on the one hand and the level of production
on the other. The replanting program also comprises densification on some
plantations. Densification will increase the hectarage within an area
served by existing infrastructure, and the capacity utilization of
existing oil mills (on such plantations), which are presently
underutilized.
3.11      Smallholder Plantings. The total smallholder program proposed
covers 36,000 ha of which 29,100 ha of replantings and extensions will be
planted in areas served by existing infrastructure. Smallholder plantings
in new areas, amounting to 6,900 ha, will be established at Ehania, Dabou,
North Tamabo, Blidouba and Neka. At Dabou, palms will not be planted In
the low yielding areas, termed savannah. Some 8,000 smallholders, with an
average of 4.5 ha of new palms each, will participate in the program of
whom some 50% will be farmers who had honored the terms of their contract
with PALMINDUSTRIE in the previous projects and 50% will be new
participants.
3.12      Medium-sized Plantations. Medium sized plantations of between
50 and 150 ha will be established at Blidouba, Neka and North Tamabo.
Because this type of operation has not been tried on a large scale, the
proposed program of 6,600 ha will be implemented in two phases. Planting
of the first phase involving about 15-20 planters and 2,100 ha will be



- 21 -
carried out over three years (1986-88) and vill be followed In late 1988
by an in-depth review. The efficient establishment and development of the
above plantings will be a pre-condition for the subsequent Implementation
of the full program. The financing of this second phase is not included
in the project, but CCCE would be prepared to consider providing the
necessary additional financing should the pilot component prove
successful.
3.13      Oil Mills. Two new oil mills of eventual 40 tons FF5/hour
capacity and equipped with effluent disposal systems will be established
on the Blidouba and Neka sites. Construction of the first phase of 20
tons to be financed under the project, will start In 1988 and be
completed by 1991. The second phase of an additional 20 tons If
necessary, would be completed in 1994. The average peak month production
at the PALMINDUSTRIE mills Is 12.3Z of the annual production. However,
capacity requirements of the Blidouba and Neka mills have been calculated
for reasons of prudence, on the basis of a peak month production of 151.
Mill operation during this month was assumed to be 25 days at 20 hours per
day (500 hours). The existlg oil mills will cope with the expected
production at all other stes.
3.14      Effluent Tretment. Liquid effluents are discharged from the
mills Into the surrounding natural water systems,  The effluent traps
inetalled at the mills are ineffective with the effluent effect at the
average mill amounting to approximately 15 kg SOD/ton m, which is high.
The problem has been intensively studied by PALXMINUSTRIIE tho Ministry of
Industry's Environmental Protection Directorate and the Bank's Environment
Adviser and proposals have been made for treatment of effluent using the
anerobic/facultative pond system or equivalent process (Annez 3-3).
Finae will be provided under the project for construction over the
project period, of effective effluent treatment systes at all existing
mills under a phased program. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that PALMINDUSTRIE will installs during the project implmeantation period,
tretamnt systems at the new and existing mills according to a suitable
tlmetable to be presented to the Bank for agreoent before December 31,
1986 (para 7.01(g)).
3.15       A prototype pond system will be installed at one of the
existing mills with a critical effluent problem and will provide the
design data for the system at Blidouba and Neka and at the existing
PALMINDUSTRIE mills. Designs with estimates of capital and operating
costs will be provided to the Bank.
3.16      Agricultural Research. A omll program of research directed to
project needs will be implemented by 1110 over a period of five years. If
necessary, the program will be continued under the proposed National



- 22 -
Agricultural Reararch Project (para 2.24). Under the project, finance
will be provided to investigate problems of maintenance of soil fertility
in replanted oil palms and Pusarium root wilt disease. Satisfactory
technical proposals from PALNINDUSTRIE and IRHO have been received for the
above two areas of research envisaged. A contract specifying the work to
be done, personnel to be employed and the budget, will be approved by the
Bank before disbursement against eligible costs of this research (para
7.03).
3.17      Study of the Oil Palm and Coconut Sub-sector.  The study of the
sub-sector (para 2.25) will be carried out during the project
implementation period by the planning staff of Government and
PALMINDUSTRIE. Draft terms of reference for the study are presented in
Annex 3-4.
3,18      Training of PALMINDUSTRIE Staff. Training will be an integral
part of PALMINDUSTRIE's Management Development Action Program (para 2.15).
Under this program, the emphasis on training will be greatly increased,
the scope of training will be expanded and training organised on a
systematic basis with the assistance of the training consultant (para
3.19). At present, training is largely restricted to technical aspects
of agriculture. It will be widened to include crop processing,
administration, finance, commercial operations and management (Annex 3-5).
The rate of Ivorianisation in recent years has been rapid, with the number
of expatriates declining from 110 in 1979, 70 in 1982 to 41 in 1984.
There is no expectation that a major proportion of the presently
expatriate staffed higher management positions will be Ivorianised during
the implementation period, and certaiu expatriates may be required to
assist with the Third Plan which, it is anticipated, will be proposed
following the Strategy Study (para 2.25). The objective of the training
program, however, will be to develop Ivorian staff capabilities to the
standards required to fill most of the expatriate held
positions over the next 5-10 years.
3.19      Technical Assistance.  The project will provide financing for
the proposed technical assistance under the existing contracts with an oil
palm plantation management company and an oil palm research institution,
satisfactory to the Bank (para 2.12). Thore are two main objectives in
the provision of this technlcal assistance: (a) to assist in the planning,
direction and control of project implementation; and (b) to assist in the
implementation of the Action Program for the Management Development
Program (para 2.15). The total man months provided under the tec'znical
assistance contracts will be 546 (Annex 3-6). In addition, short-term
assistance will be provided in specific technical areas required to
support sub-sectoral and project activities for: (a) two visiting
advisers, one technical and one financial required for evaluation of
project progress (Annex 3-7); (b) establishment of PALMINDUSTRIE's
training programs and for training of trainers, a training consultant
(para 3.18); and (c) other purposes as the nued arises and as agreed



- 23 -
between PALINDUSTRIE and the Bank. This short-term assistance will total
68 man months. At negotiations an assurance was given that Bank approval
will be obtained prior to appointment of each of the speciallets for short
term technical assistance. In addition, assurances were given that
PALMINDUSTRIE will consult with the Bank before introducing modifications
into its medium-term technical assistance contracts (para 7.01(h)).
P. Project Cost and Financing
3.20            The total project cost including taxes is estimated at CFAF 90.7
billion (US$184.9 million), of which CFAF 37.7 billion (US$76.8 million),
or 41% represent foreign exchange requirements. Taxes amount to CFAP 19.5
billion (US$39.7 million). The total project cost is ummarized below,
and a breakdown by project component between investment and recurrent
costs is given in Annex 3-8.

In view of the Bank's interest in the entire sector, the Bank
will participate In the financing of most of the components of the
project. The fullfilment of all conditions of effectiveness of the CCCE,
CDC and BIB loans vill be a condition of effectivensos of the Bank loan
(para 7.02(b)). Funding from EDP would be made available by the end of
calendar year 1986 following the eLpected ratification of its new lending
authority under the Loul III convention. Any expenditures to be covered
by EDP before this date would be funded by PER from its own resources,
while the EDP's contribution would be spread over the remaining period -if
the project. The distribution of financing according to the table beiow
has been agreed with the cofinanclers.

3.23      US$40.9 million of the financing will be onlent to PALMINDUSTRIE
for the following components: industrial plantations, oil mills, technical
assistance, effluent treatment, research and PPF. Government will take
the foreign exchange risk. US$25.9 million will be onlent to FER for the
financing of small and medium sized plantations. The Government will bear
the foreign exchange risk. The Bank loan will be made to Government and
onlent: (i) to PAUIINDUSTRIE at the same maturity and grace period as the
Bank loan and at the Bank's variable rate plus 3Z; and (1l) to PER at 91,
and the same maturity and grace period as the Bank loan. Cofinanciers
will lend to Government and to PER on their standard terms. The weighted
average of Bank and cofinanciers (CCCE, CDC and EDF) loans to PER will be
about 5Z. The conclusion of subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to
the Bank between Government and PALMIUDUSTRIE and Government and FER will
be a condition of effectiveness (para 7.02 (c)).
3.24      Total external financing will amount to 43% of project costs net
of taxes and duties and 362 of gross project costs. PALKENDUSTRIE will
finance 76Z of the industrial plantations and 55% of the oil mills, for a
total of CPAP 38.6 billion (US$78.7 million). This amount corresponds to
35Z of PALMINDUSTRIE's projected net positive cumulative cash flow in the
period 1985-90 before project investment costs, allocation to dividends,
free funds and external financing (para 5.19). Smallholders will
contribute CFAF 13.3 billion (US$27.1 million) with own and hired labor
and small tools; FER will contribute to the smallholder plantations In the
amount of CFAP 5.2 billion (US$10.6 million), out of its current
resources; and medium-sized planters will contribute CFAF 0.8 billion
(US$1.7 million) in cash (about 25% of estimated plantation cost under the
pilot scheme) with FER channelling about CPAP 2.5 billion (US$5.1 million)
of external funds for the necessary complementary financing. The project



- 26 -
will finance the eligible project cost of this category up to 1990.
Beyond this date, promoters of these plantations would be referred to the
BNDA or commercial banks for their financing needs.
3.25      Although not included as a project cost, the Government will be
required to pay about US$13.2 million in interest payments on external
financing during the five project lmplementation years, 1986-90.
C. Procurement
3.26      All goods and services financed under the project will be pro-
cured in accordance with Bank guidelines excepting specific items being
financed by co-lenders which will be procured under their own procedures.
Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below, with the
figures In parentheses showing respective amounts to be financed by the
Bank. A more detailed breakdown is presented In Annex 3-9. These pro-
curement arrangements have been agreed with the co-financiers.

3*27       All procurement will be grouped and combined with requirements
for PALMINDUSTRIE's existing plantations where applicable. Contracts
valued at US$200,000 equivalent or more will be procured through
international competitive bidding. Such contracts will comprise mainly
fertilizers, chemicals, plastic bags, wire netting, land cleartng
equipment, vehicles and oil mills. Contracts worth less than US$200,000
equivalent but more than US$75,000 equivalent will be procured by local
competitive bidding and will comprise inputs, building and construction
materials, fuel, effluent treatment plant and recurrent cost expenditures.
Because of the dispersed nature of the program bcth geographically and
time-vise local competitive bidding procedures or local shopping for
contracts less than US$75,000 equivalent will be employed. Where local
shopping is required a minimum of three quotations vill be obtained or, in
the case of germinated seeds a contract will be negotiated with the only
supplier, IRHE0. Road construction, land clearing and building work will be
carried out on force account which PALMINDUSTRIE has demonstrated it can
achieve more effectively than by contracting out. The total value of goods
and services to be procured through ICB will be about US$62.0 million (34Z
of total project costs); through LCB, about US$28.0 million (15%); and
through other methods, about US$95.0 million (51X) of which about US$66.0
million for staff and labor costs, for which bidding procedures are
Inapplicable. Research will be carried out by IRHO under a contract
satisfactory to the Bank negotiated between PALMINDUSTRIE and the Ministry
of Research. Short term technical assistance (68 man months) will be
recruited through procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Procurement for elements financed by the other donors will be
according to Bank procedures with the following variations:
CCCE -    restricts procurement to elements produced in the franc
zone if comparable items exist with origin in the franc
zone;
CDC  -    requires that UK producers be given an equal
opportunity to bid;
EDF  -    normally requires procurement from EEC or ACP states,
and       but prepared to follow Bank procurement guidelines when
EIB       co-financing, subject to final contract being from an
eligible source;
Financing of procurement elements by co-financiers will be as
follows:
CCCE -    agricultural tractors, planting costs, research,
technical assistance and effluent treatment plant;
CDC  -    planting costs, and oil mills;
EDP  -    for smallholders only, planting costs;
EIB  -    for industrial plantations only, land clearing
equipment, planting costs and oil mills.



- 28 -
Assurances that the procurement arrangements presented above would be
followed were obtained at negotiations.
H. Disbursements
3.28      The schedule of disbursements is based on the Ivory Coast
agricultural projects disbursements profile amended for factors known to
cause divergence. Project disbursements show much the same pattern as the
standard profile (Annex 3-9), but start at a higher level because of
retroactive financing of land clearing equipment amounting to US$1.4
million. Retroact1ve financing is required to cover: (i) part of the cost
incurred during the initial 1986 pre-planting period, between April 1, 1985
and loan effectiveness anticipated for December 1, 1985; and (1i) the PPF.
Disbursements will also end one year earlier than the profile in view of
PAIMIDUSTRIE's demonAstrated Implementation capacity.  The Bank loan
disbursed over a seven year period, will be as showv below.

technical assistance will be made against contracts for these ltems, which
would be fully documented. Research and technical assistance will be
financed jointly with CCCE. Disbursement for planting costs for



- 29 -
plantations will be made according to a standard amount per hectare
planted, to be claimed once for each specific area planted under the
project at the end of the first planting year of each area. Payment
certificates for the areas planted each year will be prepared by
PALMINDUSTRIN and verified by PALMINDUSTRIE field inspectors. Planting
costs will be financed in parallel with CCCE, CDC, EDF and EIB.
Disbursements for expenditures whose value is less than US$20,000 will be
made agarist statements of expenditure, the documentation for which will be
retained in PALMThDUSTRIE's offices for inspection by supervision missions.
To improve the efficient and timely implementation of the Project, the Bank
will deposit, after loan effectiveness, an initial sum of US$750,000 in a
revolving fund to finance eligible expenditures corresponding to Bank's
share of the average four month's Project financing needs. The Bank funds
will be deposited in CFAF in a special account with the Caisse Autonome
d'Amortissement (CAA) and will be channelled as needed to the Project
through PALMINDUSTRIE's and FER's individual accounts with CAA.
PALMINDUSTRIE's, FER's, planters' and cofiuanciers' counterpart funds will
be timely secured through appropriate allocations. The Bank vil. replenish
the revolving fund as requested upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that
expenditures made from it were eligible for financing out of the loan. A
replenishment request will normally be sent by CAA to the Bank when about
502 of the revolving fund has been distributed, i.e., every two months.
Should any disbursement made from the special account not be acceptable to
h-e Bank, PER or PALMINDUSTRIE will be requested to deposit the
corresponding ineligible amount into the special account or, if the Bank so
requests, refund to the Bank, through CAA, an amount equal to the amount
not eligible. No further deposit into the special account will be made by
the Bank when the total unwithdrawn amount of the part of the loan that is
expected to be disbursed at loan closure will be equal to US$1.0 million.
If it is determined that any amount outstanding in the special account is
not required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Government will refund to the Bank such amount outstanding in the special
account. Assurances on the above points have been obtained at
negotiations. Opening of the Special Account with CAA will be a condition
of effectiveness of the Loan (para 7.02 (d))
I. Reporting, Accounts and Audits
3.30      PALMINDUSTRIE accounts are well kept; accounts have been received
for the year to September 30, 1983 and audited accounts up to September 30,
1984 are under preparation. PALMINDUSTRIE will submit to its Board of
Directors for approval and to Goverment and the Bank for information,
consolidated annual budgets at least three months before the start of the
financial year (para 7.01(i)). PALMIIDUSTRIE will submit quarterly reports
to the Bank including detailed financial progress reports for each of the
project sites comparing planned and actual results. FER will submit
quarterly statements including detailed financial progress reports.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that PALMINDUSTRIE and FER will
(i) maintain appropriate records and accounts; (ii) have their accounts
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) submit
to the Bank, audited annual accounts within six months of the end of their
financial year (para 7.01(j)).  The auditors will provide a long form
report to management of PALMINDUSTRIE and of FER and to the Bank with



- 30 -
detailed comments on the filnacial, general and cost accounting systems.
In addition, the auditors will provide a certificate to the effect that
all goods and services acquired under the loan were acquired from qualified
countries, that they have been paid for and have been used for purposes of
the project and that statements of expenditure have becn verified. Within
six months after the loan closing date, PALMINDUSTRIE will prepare or have
prepared a completion report covering all components of the project for
submission to the Bank. (para 7.01(k)).
IV. ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. General
4.01      The project will be implemented within the present institutional
framework of the Ivory Coast under the auspices of the Kinistry of
Agriculture which has overall responsibility for the sub-sector. The
industrial plantings and mill construction will be executed by
PALMINDUSTRIE, the smallholder plantings by smallholders themselves under
the supervision of the PAIMINDUSTRIE extension service and the medium-sized
plantations by the owners. The existing arrangements for the organisation
and management of PALMINDUSTRIE are operating satisfactorily and will be
continued. The General Manager of PALMINDUSTRIE will be responsible for
project implementation. The existing technical assistance provided by an
oil palm plantation management company and an oil palm research institution
will be continued (para 2.12). The PALMIXDUSTRIE organisation chart and
details of organisation and management are in Annexes 4-1 and 4-2
respectively.
B. Industrial Plantations
4.02      The Contrat Plan.  The technical and financial parameters within
which PALMINDUSTRIE will conduct its Industrial operations during the
project implementation period will be established in a contract between
PALMINDUSTRIE and Government termed "Contrat Plan".  Terms of reference for
the "Contrat Plan" are in Annex 4-3. The establishment of objectives and
conditions of execution under the "Contrat Plan" will (i) provide
Government with the means to monitor PALMINDUSTRIE's performance; and (ii)
ensure PALMINDUSTRIE's managerial and financial autonomy. Government will
carry out jointly with PALMINDUSTRIE an annual review of execution of the
"Contrat Plan" not later than four months following the end of the
PALMINDUSTRIE financial year. Minutes of the review meeting will be made
available to the Bank for comment. The draft "Contrat Plan" between
PALMINDUSTRIE and Government was submitted for review by the Bank at
negotiations. Signature by the parties concerned of a "Contrat Plan"
satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of Loan effectiveness (para
7.02(e)). Any substantive change in the "Contrat Plan" will require the
Bank's prior agreement (para 7.01(1)).
4.03      Management.  The Improved management system. already introduced
are satisfactory and will be further developed during the implementatiou
period under the Management Development Action Program (para 2.15).
PALMINDUSTRIE head office staff will continue to prepare annual land
clearing and planting programs specifying the precise areas to be planted



- 31 -
and the calendar to be followed in conjunction with the Managers of the
Agro-Industrial Complexes.
C. Smallholders and Medium-sized Plantations.
4.04      Suallholder Plantings.  Smallholders will be selected on the
basis of criteria which vill include age, land tenure, family composition,
availability of labor, presence on the holding, distance from the mill (20
km or less) and suitability of soil and terrain (thus benefitting from
previous project experience and overcoming criticisms made in the OED
Report). In the case of candidates who had already participated in
previous projects, a record of efficient oil palm managament will be
required. Government policy is that smallholders should have six ha of oil
palms. New participants will therefore plant up to six ha generally over a
three-year period. Previous participants will plant an area sufficient to
bring their total oil palm plantings up to six ha. On average such
smallholders will plant three ha each. Participants will sign the standard
agreement with PALMINDUSTRIE stating the obligations of both parties. The
role of PALMINDUSTRIE will be extension, supply of lnputs, collection of
FMB and payments to the smallholders for their FFM. Smallholders will be
expected to provide their own labor as they have done in the past.
4.05      Extension organisation will be modified to Incorporate, where
suitable, the principles of the Training and Visit System but adapted to
the technical requirements of the oil palm. Emphasis will be placed upon
Improvement of the tachnical capability of extension agents and the
systematic organisation of their field visits. Attention will be given to
the accurate recording of farmer yields. Four subject matter specialists
(SM) will be appointed and will receive regular training from the research
staff of IRBO. The time of SMS will be divided between training and
exposure to research, field visits and training of extension agents.
4.06      Medium-sized Plantations.  Each prospective operator of a medium-
sized plantation vill be requested to submit a project plan and will be
required to mest at least the following criteria:
(i) there should be no less than 50 ha available for the plantations;
(ii)  a satisfactory title must be produced providing evidence of
ownership of the land by the prospective operator;
(III) where the promotor is not h1imself technically qualified or
available to operate the plantation, employment of a suitable
technician would be required;
(iv) prior to entering lito a development agreement with PER and
PALMINDUSTRIE for each area to be planted, the owner must supply
evidence that he can provide at least 25Z of the total
establishment and development cost for each area;
(v) the proposed planting site must be within a 20 km radius of
existing oil mills.



- 32 -
Successful candidates will be required to sign a development
contract in accordance with the draft contract prepared by PALMINDUSTRIE
which is satisfactory to the Bank. The role of PALMINDUSTRIE will be
supply of inputs, purchase of FFB at the farm or mill gate and provision of
technical advice.
4.07      Credit Arrangements.  Credit to smallholders and medium-sized
plantations will be provided through FER (para 3.23). The PER will be
established with a legal status satisfactory to the Bank (para 2.22). An
assurance was obtained at negotiations that smallholders and medium-sized
plantation operators will sign a development contract with PAIMINDUSTRIE
for participation in their respective planting programs (para 7.01(m)).
Terms and conditions of FER's loans to smallholders and medium sized
plantation operations are presented in paras 5.30 and 5.32.
D. Implementation
4.08      The main elements of the project will be implemented over a five
year period as shown in Annex 4-4, the planting program, the technical
assistance and research components being achieved over five years and the
first phase of mill construction (financed by CDC and EIB) being completed
after seven years. Project disbursements are spread fairly evenly over the
first five years and thereafter decline. Procurement documents for land
clearing equipment were prepared during the second semester of 1984 with
delivery during 1985 for clearing areas for 1986 planting. Nursery
facilities for 1986 field planting have been established. Preparation of
procurement documents for oil mills will be initiated in the first semester
of 1988 so that the first mill at Neka can be operational at the end of
1990. Implementation of the proposed research program will be
straightforward as the work is largely a continuation of existing programs.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.09      The management information and cost control systems for
PALMINDUSTRIE's industrial plantations, which are already well established,
will be further refined generally and developed to allow cost comparison
and analysis of man day utilisation in accordance with the agreed
time-table for the Action Program (para 2.15). The Ministry of Agriculture
will have responsibility for monitoring PALMINDUSTRIE's performance through
the two project-supported visiting advisers (3 months/year) (para 3.19) and
the independent auditors (para 3.30).
4.10      Monitoring of sualiholder performance will be carried out by the
extension service who will record the progress of smallholder plantings
established under the project in terms of technical standards achieved with
respect to establishment success, cover crop establishment, weeding
standards and standard of pest control measures. Yields of FTB will be
recorded on a per hectare basis for each smallholding. The PALMINDUSTRIE
field inspector will be required to report on the efficiency of monitoring
as carried out by the extension service.

V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, PRICES AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Technical Aspects
5.01      The planting program will include new planting and replanting.
The technique of land clearing to be used will depend upon the nature of
the existing vegetation and the type of operator. With industrial
plantations, forest, bush and old oil palms will be pushed over by
bulldozer and heaped in vindrows, along the contour, where appropriate, and
burnt. In the case of medium-sized estates forest will be felled by chain
saw and then pushed into windrows by bulldozers. Smallholders will clear
by manual means.
5.02      All areas will be planted with selected Dura x Pisifera hybrid
polybagged plants protected from rodents by wire netting guards. The
germinated seed for nursery planting will be purchased from IRHO. Palms
will be field planted at a density of 143 per ha (9 m x 9 m). A leguminous
cover crop will be established and maintenance will be carried out by hand
weeding during the immature period. In replanted areas emphasis will be
placed upon achieving rapid cover crop spread over the felled oil palm 1ogo
to reduce the level of breeding of Oryctes monoceros or coconut beetle, an
Important pest of young palms. On industrial plantations during the mature
period, maintenance will be effected by alternating rounds of manual and
chemical weedIng.
5.03      Manuring during immaturity will be based upon the application of
N, K, P and Mg as single fertilizers. Detailed schedules are in Annex 3-1.
After commencement of production, nutrient needs will be identified by leaf
analysis and are likely to be generally restricted to superphosphate in the
west and muriate of potash on the tertiary sands of the centre and east.
5.04      Harvesting will generally be carried out in weekly rounds.
Smallholders would deliver cut bunches to the roadside for collection by
PALMINDUSTRIE trucks prior to processing in the central mill. Harvesting
at the correct stage of ripeness will be emphasized by the extension
service so as to maximise the oil/bunch extraction rate.
B. Project Production
5.05      Yield estimates  are based on PALMINDUSTRIE's own recorded
experience over their total planted area as well as on comprehensive
analyses by IRHO. During the three years 1981-83 the mean yield per
hectare per annum was 10 tons. Industrial plantation yields havt been
assumed to be at about historical levels and yield profiles are summarized
In the graph below. The yield level projected is closely related to the
average moisture deficit of an area. Production is projected to commence
in the fourth year after field planting. Smallholder yields are generally
estimated at 70Z of the adjacent industrial plantation, medium-sized
plantation yields at 90%. Oil extraction rates are assumed to be 20.7% on
average from replantings of industrial plantations and smallholder
plantings and 22.5% for new industrial and medium-sized plantations. The
kernel extraction rate is assumed to be 4.5X. Details of the basis for
yield projections are in Annex 5-1.

C. Markets and Prices
The Domestic and Export Market for Edible Oils and Crude Palm Oil
5.07      The world and Ivorian market for palm oil as well as
international and domestic prices are discussed in Annex 5-3 and briefly
summarized below. The graph below summarizes the domestic market situation
for edible oils. It shows domestic demand for edible oils of industrial
origin and the production of crude edible oils expressed in equivalent
refined, edible oil terms. In 1985, total production of vegetable oil in
terms of edible oil is expected to amount to 109,000 mt (all time high
1980: 138,000 mt) which would exceed domestic demand for edible oil by
26,000 mt. Apparent per capita consumption in Ivory Coast of traditional
and industrial vegetable oils was in 1982, 13.6 kg/year (Cameroon 15.4
kg/year; Nigeria 13.0 kg/year; Ghana 6.2 kg/year). Assuming unchanged per
capita consumption of industrial edible oils, the domestic demand for
edible oils is projected to exceed domestic supply without the project by
1993.

The same assumption of demand with the project implies an excess supply
available for export in 2000 of 56,000 mt. Production of edible oils with
the project would cover domestic demand through 2000 with per capita
consumption up to 38% higher than the 1984 levels. Ivory Coast would have
no difficulty selling a surplus of crude palm and palm kernel oil in the
world market in which the country's market simtre In 1983 was less than 1%.



- 36 -
Pst and projected world prices of palm oil are shown in the graph below.
The Bank forecasts the world price of palm oil in constant 1983 dollars to
decrease from US$590/mt in 1985 to US$535/mt in 1995, a 10 decrease over
the period.

The Pricing Reform
5.08      The objective of the pricing reform In the oil palm sub-sector Is
to ensure the payment to PAKIXNDUSTRIE and outgrovers of the full world
market equivalent value of their produce, adjusted to reflect the
opportunity value of foreig exchange and the effects of tariffs on
production costs. This would mean gradually progrossilg towards a net
effective protection coefficient of unity.
5.09      The Price of Refined Palm Oil.  The Governmnt has agreed, under
the structural adjustment program supported by the Bank, to Implement a
reform of Industrial incentives implying tho harmonization of tariff
protection across the various sub-sectors. Within this framework, the
Government has been *Aked to present a plan for the implementation of the
tariff reform in the local vegetable oil processing sector. This plan will
include the elminiatiLon of all quantitative restrictions on Imports and
exports at all levels of the palm oil processing chain and the deregulation
of palm oil consumer prices (para 5.12).
5.10      The Price of Crude Oil Palm Products.  When CSSPPA was in charge
of the marketing of the crude palm oll, the domestic price was largely
equal to the export equivalent spot price. PALMINDUSTRIE still exports



- 37 -
part of Its production at pravailing world market prices, but since
PALXINDUSTRIS took over the marketing of the crude palm oil products from
CBSPPA, the transfor price of crude palm oil to the doms tic refining
Industry for domestic consumption purposes ham been determined on the basis
of an indicativa formula. Tha forzuula links the domestic price with
long-term world market price trends, but also Includes domsatic price
developments as a major component. Since the Introduction of tho
Indicative formula domestic prices have in general been below export
equivalent prices, sometimes as low am 401 below. According to the
proposed pricing arrangements, the current price fixing formula will be
eliminated (Annex 5-4). Imports and exports of crude palm oil will be
totally free. The transfer pries of crude palm oil from PALMNDUSTRIS to
the domestic refining Industry will be determined by the two concerned
parties through cormercial contracts freely negotiated.  This should  esoult
In a transfer price negotiated at a level between the Import and xport
parity price of crude palm oll. The Govermnmet has agreed to the pricing
arrangement proesnted above. Its Implementation has already started end
Its various components are spolt out In a supplmntal letter to the Loan
Agreoment.
5.11      The Parmiate Price of m.  Producer prices for fresh fruit
bunches have been revised at long intervals and uneven rates as shown by
the data In the table blowm                    -

5612      Following the model from the rubber sector, the farzgate price of
m, for  mallholder's and lMXUs' production will, in the future, be
dtermined by PALXIDUSTRIEZ on the bsis of the not proceeds from the sales
of crude palm oil and kernel oll. To determine the not value of the M,
all costs asociated with the snallholder sector will be deducted from the
sales proceeds of crude palm and kernl oLls. The pricing reform will also
include a floor price for outgrovar's FFB production. The floor prices
fixed through a Goverment decree, will guarantee outgrowesc a minimum net
Incom per mmnday of labor. Its evolution will be linked to the long term
evolution of the world price of crude palm oil. In case an exceptional
drop In world market prices of crude palm oil would trigger the floor price
mecbhaism and induce a deficit in PALMOUNSTRIZI' outgrower' account,



- 38 -
PALNINDUSTRIE vill be alloved, after providing full justification, to apply
for a temporary import surcharge on crude oil imports, which would be
reflected in the transfer price of crude palm oil to the domestic refining
industry.
5.13      The net value of the PFB will be the basis of a producer price
structuro with several steps, including a base price and productivity
promium.  A base price will be paid to outgroweru below a certain minimum
yleld of PFB per hectare (5 tons/ha/year). The premium, paid at regular
Intervals, will be paid increasing with sales to PALMINDUSTRIE (Annex 5-5).
This price structure will provide the stimulus to production, encourage
intensification, and facilitate price adjustments and price stabilization.
The same farmgate price will be paid to both smallholders and medium-sized
plantations. However, since medium-sized plantations will service their
debt individually and PALMINDUSTRIE's services to the medium-sized
plantations will be substantially less than to the smailholders, the
medium-sized plantations will receive periodical compensation.
Implementation of the Pricing Reform
5.14      The projected effects of the pricing reform for the farugate
price of FFB, crude palm oil, and refined palm oil are illustrated in the
table below. The assumed 1990 protection level Is consistent with medium

5 15      It is essential that the proposed pricing reform be Implemented
in unison at all levels of the processing chain to avoid that elthar
outgrowers, PALMINDUSTRIE or the refining industry be hurt due to price
increases upstream. The transition from the present to the proposed
pricing system will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the
price of FFB and crude palm oil will be directly linked to world market
prices as indicated in p4ras 5.10 to 5.12 above. In the second phase, a
tariff-cum-subsidy schame will be gradually introduced in the palm oil
sector to provide outgrowers, PALMINDUSTRIE and the domestic refining
industry with a net effective protection equal to unity. Implementation of
the first phase of the pricing reform will be carried out under the
project. Implementation of the second phasa vill be an integral part of
the proposed SAL III conditionality, to be nagotiatad by the end of 1985.
It will be carried out, during the project period, in full synchronleation
with the changes in incentives for other crops to ensure consistency within
the agricultural sector.
D. Financial Analysis of PALMINDUSTRIE
5.16      The principal assumptions underlying the economic and flnancial
analysis of PALMINDUSTRIE ara shown In Annex 5-6. The company's projected
consolidated financial statements, are found in Annexes 5-7 and 5-8.
5.17      Capital Structure.  The present financial structure of
PALMINDUSTRIE is sound. Current assets compara favorably with short term
liabilities at a ratio of 2.3:1. The balance sheot for September 30, 1954,
shows long term debt at CFAF 25.9 billion with equity at CPA? 35.5 billion,
a debt-equity ratio of 40/60. At negotiations an assurance was obtained
that PAIMINDUSTRIE will seek the Bankts agreement befora Incurring any new
medium or long term debt which would raise the ratio of debt to equity above
60/40 or would increase its annual debt service to more than half its
projected annual revenues and that no dividends will be paid that reduced
the working capital ratio below 1.5:1 (para 7.01(n)). Professional valuers
reported in June 1984 on the value of PALMINDUSTRIE at September 30, 1983.
Based on a valuation of assets and liabilities, not assets, or equity, are
estlmated at CFAP 96 billion. An alternativa valuation based on projected
earnings set the value of PALMINDUSTRIE at CPAF 76 billion.  The
methodology and assumptions of these evaluations conform with comon
practice, and they set the range for the approxlmate value of PALMINDUSTRIZ
as a going concern.
5.18      Profit Structure.  Oil palm provides about 8OS and coconut 20X of
PALMINDUSTRIE's net contribution. This distribution will change In favor
of oil palm when the production of the now plantings start as no expansion
of coconut production is envisaged in the project period although a coconut
expansion project would be prepared. Provision has been made for the
maintenance of the existing coconut plantations.

f plpsontation period 1986-90 to CFAF 55.* billion (US$113.9 million).
Not cumulative casb flow by 19903 after the proposed dividends and project
invostment costs, is a negative CFA? 4.4 billion (USO9.0 million) before
external financing and a positive CTA? 15.6 billion ($31.8 million) after
external finacing.
5 20      The cash flow and profit situation summarized above. which
assums the Inplementation of the pricing reform (scenario I) Is smoitiva
to output prices and agricultural yields. In a scenario (1I) where crude
palm oil prices are assumed at the world market level with no compensation
for the overvalud CIA?, the not cumulative cash flow after dividdos and
project Investment costs would, In 1990, be a negative CFAF 16.5 billion



- 41 -
(US$33.7 million) before external financing and a positive CFAF 3.9
billion (US$7.1 million) after external financing. In another scenario
(III) where crude palm oil prices would be 10% lower than assumed above
and where, in addition, FFB yields would be 5% 1o. than projected and
coconut not contribution 15X less than projected, the net cumulative cash
flow after dividends and project lnvestment costs would, in 1990, be a
negative CFAF 15.0 billion (US$30.6 2dllion) before external financing and
a positive CFAF 5.0 billion (US$10.2 million) after external financing.
5.21      This sensitivity to prices underscores the importance of the
implementation of the pricing reform for the financial profitability of
PALMNIDUSTRIE and for the prospects of attracting private capital to the
further expansion of the oil palm sector. In addition, the combined
sensitivity to prices and agricultural uncertainty calls for prudence in
the estimation of PALMIUDUSTRIE's fund generating capacity to finance its
proposed development plan. In view of the uncertain environment In which
PALMINDUSTRIE operates, the latter should maintain a conservative
debt-equity ratio policy. In view of the company's currently low
debt-equity ratio, the propsed external financing of ClAP 20.0 billion
MOS$40.9 million) will be sufficient to allow PALMINDUSTRIE to finance its
proposed development program and sufficiently low to avoid excessive
leverage. It will allow PALMINDUSTRIE to face potential adverse
agricultural (yields) or financial (prices) conditions such as those
depicted in Scenarios II and III above.
5.22      Financial Policy. The proposed financing plan Intends to ensure
that strict technical and financill managemet policies be mantained and
reinforced, that funds for the Implementation of the Project will be
available throughout the project execution period, and that an appropriate
policy for allocation of free funds bo pursued. It in one of the main
purposes of the "Contrat Plan" (para 4.02) to provide the framework for
control of the potentially substantial free funds remaining after meeting
the project investment costs. The "Contrat Plan" will specify the
allocation of funds to ensure replanting and expansion of the surface
planted with oil palm beyond the project, and allocation of the free
funds, if any. The "Contrat Plan" will also provide for Government
financing of any finacing gap that might occur during the project
Implementation period due to any short-fall in PALMINDUSTRIE's
self-financing capacity not covered by the proposed external financing.
5.23      Assuming that 10% of not profits after tax and after allocation
to statutory reserves be allocated to a further reserve, incrasing to 40S
In 1992, free funds amounting to a total of CFAP 56.6 billion would be
available in the period 1986-90. Subsequently, the amounts avallable
Increase sharply. These free funds should in priority be directed to
Investment in the epansion and diversification of tree crops by
PALMINDUSTRIE or an affiliated institution, or they could be disbursed as
dividends to Govenment. In the base case (scenario I), cash flow
projections show net cumulative cash after allocation to free funds rising
from CFAF 8.9 billion in 1985, to CFAF 20.8 billion in 1987 decreasing to
ClAP 11.7 billion in 1989. The negative effect of adversb agricultural
and market conditions on PALMINDUSTRIE's fund gonerating capacity would be



- 42 -
attenuated by a reduction in corporate income tax and could be further
offset by reductions in the substantial allocations to free funds. Given
the proposed external financing, the financing of PALMINDUSTRIE's share of
the proposed project as well as the allocations to free funds indicated
above would be assured even in the low case scenarios.
E. Financial Analysis of FER
5.24      PER will be funded from four sources: (i) a fixed cess of CFAF
1.5 per kg (1985) paid by all producers (industrial plantations,
smallholders and medium-sized plantation holders) deducted by
PALMThDUSTRIE from the purchase price of the fruit at the farm gate or oil
mill; (ii) external funds onlent to PER by the Government; (iii) a
variable cess on FFB harvested by sallholders which would be
progressively Increased during the project so as to cover their debt
service to PER and increase the Fund's reserves; and (iv) repayments of
their loans by owners of medium-sized plantations at a rate which would
also allow the constitution of reserves. The coconut sector does not at
present contribute to the funding of FER as no immediate expansion program
is In view. Details of the FER forecast cash flow are in Annex 5-9.
5.25      FER will channel external funds to smallholders ard medium-sized
plantations. In addition, PER's current own funds from the proceeds of
the replantiug cess (less the funds needed for the financing of the
completion of the EDP project (para 3.08)) will contribute to the
financing of the smallholder and medium-sized plantations in rhe amount of
CFAF 5.2 billion (US$10.6 million).  FER's contribution to the financing
is calculated under the assumption that the rep.aunting cess be revised
annually. A shortfall in production of FFB affectIng FER's
fund-generating capacity is assumed to be met by an increase in the
replanting cess.
5.26      The use of FER as the major instrument of channeling funds to
the oil palm outgrower sector requires that the future status of FER
(para 2.22) provides for the possibility of PER building up reserves to
meet upcoming financing needs. Under the current status, any net cash
surplus must be surrendered to CSSPPA. The adoption of adequate statutes
Is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed project (para 7.02(a)).
PALMINDUSTRIE will be in charge, through a management contract with FER,
of disbursing PER loans, supervising plantation establishment and
recovering FER loans. The signing of a management contract between
PALMINDUSTRIE and PER satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of loan
effectiveness (para 7.02(f)).
P. Smalholder Income and Return
5.27      The principal financial data on the smallholder's investment are
presented in the table below. Details are given in Annex 5-10.

5.28      The smallholder will provide the total cost of labor and small
tools for the creation of the plantations. The value of his inputs
accounts for 52% of the total development cost. PALKMINDUSTRIE will
provide the development Inputs at full cost: seedlings, wire netting,
cover crop seeds, fertilizer, and insecticidet, financed through a loan
from PER. At farm level, assuming a planting program of two ha per year
for three consecutive yer., the uAallholder would obtain a positive
return per manday as from year four of th. planting program. The return
per manday in years 4 and 10 would be CFAP 2,000 and ClAP 7,700
respectively. For comparison, the returns per manday for traditional
coffee and cocoa in full bearing is CFAP 2,816 and CFAP 3,340
respectively.
5.29      Smallholder Debt Recovary.  Smallholder debt is currently
recovered by a ces an the FIB production collected by PALMINDUSTRIE based
on the collective debt of .mallholders. The system vas Introduced in 1984
in ortdr to simplify previous unsatisfactory systems based on standard
credit principles, i.e. individualized debt paid by fixed annuities until
extinction. The main advantage of the cess system is its operational
simplicity, vhich more than compensates for the disadvantages of (i)
havinS the good producer contribute more to the collective debt than the
poor producer; (ii) the smallholder's reduced awareness of his individual
debt burden and net worth; (iii) the debt recovery depending on the
smallholder surrandering his production to PALMINDUSTRIE and not selling
to the secondary market.
5.30      Current Interest rates for preferential activities in the Ivory
Coast, including agriculture, range between 9-11 p.a. In addition, a
service tax of 25% is normally added. Under this project the combined



- 44 -
fixed and variable cess for the smallholder will be equivalent to a loan
to be repaid over the life of the plantation at an interest rate of IlZ
p.a which is equivalent to the estimated opportunity cost of capital to
the economy (11.5Z p.a.). The development loan covers the cost of Inputs,
extension cost and access roads. The difference in the two rates 11% and
5%, the estimated average cost of PER's resources, would allow the fund to
build up reserves to an appropriate level. The cost recovery index
discounted at 11.5%, the opportunity cost of capital, is 0.94 with full
charging for exten:-ion and access road costs.
G. Medium-sized Plantations - Income and Return
5.31      The principal financial data on a per hectare basis for the
medium-sized plantations are presented in the table below. Details are
given in Annex 5-11.

5.32      As the medium-sized plantations are be expected to constitute
independent enterprises, the investment budget comprises housing for
employees as well as vehicles for collection and transport to the mill of
the FFB harvest. The rate of return shown in the table above assumes that
the medium-sized plantation would be paid the same price as the
smAllholder with no compensation for any differences in the service
extended to smallholders and the medium-sized plantation in question.
However, the expected higher yields obtained by medium-sized plantations
would allow them to benefit from the scaled price structure. The loan to
medium sized plantations owners will be an individualised loan with a rate
of interest of 11% on the basis of repayment over 20 years including 6
years grace.

VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Project Benefits and Economic Analysis
6.01      The project's quantifiable benefits would be the crude palm and
palm kernel oil extracted from the FFB produced over the life of the palms
on the 64,700 ha of the project. This production would have a cumulative
world market value of about US$1,500 million at constant 1985 export
parity prices. The net cumulative foreign exchange earnings (export
revenue less cost of imported inputs) in constant 1985 terms amount to
US$200 million, while foreign exchange earnings/savings after external
debt service and assuming import substitution for local consumption total
US$212 million (constant 1985). Other benefits are the contribution of
the project to the provision of raw materials to the local fats and oil
industry and the increased diversification of the agricultural sector.
The project would generate 55,000 man years of incremental employment of
which 40,000 man years outside the industrial plantations.
6.02      Economic costs include all investments, maintenance, operating
and overhead costs associated with the plantation establishment (including
access road development and maintenance) as well as harvesting and
processing after plantation maturity. The value of the foregone
production due to the felling of ageing but still producing trees under
the replanting program has been included. An opportunity cost of land has
not been included as the areas to be planted with oil palm are generally
covered with degraded bush with limited commercial value. Labor would be
drawn from local markets, which are competitive, and in which wages
adequately represent the economic cost of labor. Throughout the analysis
a shadow exchange rate of US$1 - CFAF 588 has been used. The principal
assumptions of the economic and financial analysis are in Annex 5-6 and
the project cash flow and economic and financial rates of return are in
Annex 6.
6.03      The economic and financial rates of return under these assump-
tions are summarized in the table below. The economic rates of return
exceed the opportunity cost of capital in Ivory Coast, currently estimated
to be 11.5%. The net present value per ha discounted at the opportunity
cost of capital is also shown in the table and illustrated graphically for
the project as a whole overleaf.

The differences between the ERRs of the three components of the
project as a whole are explained mainly by differences in establishment
costs due to methods of land-clearing and the density and age of the
vegetation in the designated areas: medium-sized plantations are
established in areas with no previous oil palm plantings, vhereas the
smallholder project component to a large extent comprises planting in
areas with degraded vegetation. The wide difference between the



- 47 -
industrial plantations component and the outgrover components is due to
the additional cost of the former arising from the foregone production
from felled oil palm (para 5.06). Economic and financial returns of the
three components at a new nucleus estate show a smaller difference between
the three components. Investment costs at this new site include the
establishment of oil mill and other basic infrastructure, and the data
demonstrate that the economic and financial viability of new oil palm
plantations does not depend on a large amount of sunk costs of investment
in Infrastructure.
B. Project Risks
6.04      The principal sources of project risk are:
Agricultural risks        -    oil palm yields; depend on climatic and
soil conditions, the use of fertilizer,
insect attacks, harvesting organization and
processing efficiency;
-    smallholder interest and response, affects
potentially the project development period.
Financial risks          -    world palm oil prices;
-    wage rates, labor availability;
-    management and control of operating and
overhead costs.
The potential effects of these elements of risk have been
quantified in a sensitivity analysis which is summarized graphically
overleaf . Each graph has on the X-axis the percentage change of the
appraisal value of the parameter and on the Y-axis the resulting economic
rate of return. The switching values at 11.5% are as follows:
Switchiog Value at 11.5%

Medium-Sized Plantations           +  67        - 35
6.05      The project is clearly sensitive to variations in benefits, i.e.
FFB yields or world price of oll palm products. In particular, failure to
introduce the proposed tariff on crude palm oil would reduce the economic
return of the project to 14.1%. The graph below illustrates the project's
sensitivity to the combination of decreases in bensfits and increases in
costs. The line in the graph is drawn between pairs of values of cost
increases and bmnefit decreases compared to appraisal values that combined
would reduee the ERR of the Project to 14.8X.

6.06      The project's economic viability is relatively insensitive to
delays in implementation. Except for the research and technical
assistance component, investment expenditure and project operating costs
follow the implementation of the planting program so that delays in the
program delay project expenditure. The cost of delay in implementation is
limited to the foregone return for the duration of the delay of a
profitable investment. As to the coverage of domestic demand for edible
oils, Ivory Coast would remain a net exporter of vegetable oils through
year 2000 despite a delay in the entire program of up to two years.
C. Environmental Considerations
6.07      Ageing oil palms, bush and logged forest would be replaced with
oil palms which provide satisfactory soil protection due to their crown
formation and the use of cut fronds as mulch, as practised on
PAIMINDUSTRIE plantations. In addition, leguminous cover crops would be
sown to build up soil fertility and where necessary in a few areas,
contour bunds would be established to control erosion. Intercropping on
smallholdings would be restricted to flat and gently undulating land.
With regard to effluent, alternative treatment systems would be studied
and appropriate systems established (para 3.14).

VII. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01   Assurances obtained at Negotiations were that:
(a) PALMINDUSTRIE will continue the present arrangements for
employment of personnel from an oll palm management company and
an oil palm research institution during the implementation
period unless PALMINDUSTRIE and the Bank agree otherwise (para
2.12).
(b) Government will consult with the Bank on substantial changes in
PALMINDUSTRIE's organizational structure and will ensure that
the quality of its senior management will be maintained (para
2.12).
(c) PAIMINDUSTRIE will consult with the Bank on the proposed
arrangements for participation by any private investor In the
equity of PALMINDUSTRIE (para 2.13).
(d) Government will undertake to inform the Bank of its proposals
for the future legal and corporate status of PALMINDUSTRIE
(para 2.13).
{e) PALMINDUSTRIE will implement the Action Program in accordance
with the agreed timetable (para 2.15).
(f) Government will maintain the existing San Pedro-Neka road in
a condition which will allow year round transport of the produce
of Blidouba and Neka (para 3.03).
(g) PALMINDUSTRIE will Install during the project period effluent
treatment systems at the new and existing mills according to a
timetable to be presented to the Bank for agreement before
December 31, 1986 (para 3.14).
(h) PALMINDUSTRIE will obtain Bank approval prior to appointment of
the specialists for short term technical assistance and will
consult with the Bank before introducing modifications into its
medium term technical assistance contracts (para 3.19).
(i) PALMINDUSTRIE will submit to its Board of Directors for
approval and to Government and the Bank for information
consolidated annual budgets at least three months before the
start of the financial year (para 3.30).
(j) PALMINDUSTRIE and FER will (i) maintain appropriate records
and accounts; (it) have their accounts audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (iii) submit to the Bank,
audited annual accounts within six months of the end of their
financial year (para 3.30).
(k) PALMINDUSTRIE will prepare a completion report for submission
to the Bank six months after the loan closing date (para 3.30).



- 52 -
(1)  Any substantive change In the "Contrat Plan" will require the
Bank's prior agreement (para 4.02).
(m) Smallholders and medium-sized plantation operators vill sign a
development contract with PALMINDUSTRIE for participation In
their respective planting programs (para 4.07).
(n) PALMINDUSTRIE will obtain the Bank's agreement before Incurring
any new medium or long term debt which would raise the ratio of
debt to equity above 60/40 or which would increase Its annual
debt service to more than half its projected annual revenues and
that no dividends will be paid that reduced the working capital
ratio below 1.5:1 (para 5.17).
7.02   Conditions of Effectiveness would be:
(a) that the PER will have been established under new statutes
satisfactory to the Bank (para 2.22);
(b) the fulfillment of all conditions of effectiveness of the CCCE,
CDC, and EIB loans (para 3.22);
Cc) the conclusion of subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the
Bank between Government and PAIMINDUSTRIE and Government and PER
(para 3.23);
(d) the opening of the Special Account (para 3.29);
(e)  that Government and PALMINDUSTRIE have signed a "Contrat Plan"
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para 4.02).
(f)  that PALMIDUSTRIE and PER have entered Into a management
contract satisfactory to the Bank (para 5.26).
7.03 A Condition of Disbursement would be:
that PALMINDUSTRIE had signed a contract satisfactory to the
Bank for agricultural research (para 3.16).
7.04      With the above assurances and conditious the project vould be
suitable for a loan of US$13.4 million to Government of Ivory Coast on the
Bank's standard terms.

The increased capital in 1984 is due to the reclassification of
an E.D.F. loan in the amount of CFAE 4.1 billion from Long Term Debt to Capital.
Payment of the annual cess will fullfil the liability. In addition, CFAF 1.4
billion, the remainder of B.S.I.E.'s support for 19^,3, was received in 1984 and
B.S.I.E. provided CFAF 1.3 billion voiking capital to the reorganised company.

PALMINDUSTRIE OPERATING RESULTS 1984 - COMMENT
Following the transfer of marketing from CSSPPA and the
rationalisation of principles and policies by the strengthened management
team, PALMINDUSTRIE took up many charges which should have been
recognised in earlier years or were previously settled by CSSPPA. The
major items are listed below:
Incremental Charges in PALMINDUSTRIE 1984 Operations
CFAF billion
Items not recurring in future years:
Recognition of exchange differences
on long term debt to September 30, 1983                           6.3
Increased fin.rcial charges                                       2.5
Repayment to CSSPPA for stock taken over in 1983                  1.5
10.7
Items which will recur in future years:
Export freight and insurance previously paid by CSSPPA            2.2
Payment to FER previously charged to long term loan               0.8
Profit on oil palm/coconut smallholder operations due to CSSPPA 0.6
Exchange difference on long term debt - 1984                      1.4
Increase in FFB price paid to smallholders                        1.0
More conservative depreciation policy                             2.8
8.8
Total                                                    19.5
The figure of CFAF 19.5 billion accounts for the unexpected
difference in operating results in 1984 as compared to 1983. If 1984 had
been treated in the standard manner, the profit for the year would have
been, CFAF 9.2 billion plus CFAF 10.7 billion - CFAF 19.9 billion.

IVORY COAST
PIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPME   PROJECT
TECHNICAL ASPECTS
1. The ProJect Area
1.1.      The project area stretches from the Liberian border in the west
to the frontier with Ghana in the east. The project would be located in
the tropical forest zone of the southern Ivory Coast at a latitude around
69 North.
2. Climate
2.1.      Rainfall and water deficit.  The monthly rainfall distribution
over the period 1979-84, is given for the main planting sites in Annex 5-1,
page 5. Generally rainfall is concentrated in two wet seasons - March to
June and August/September to October/November. Availability of soil
moisture is best expressed as annual water deficit and is given in Annex
5-1, page 3 for the period 1978-81. Apart from the year 1983, when severe
drought conditions were found all over West Africa the mean annual water
deficlt is of the order of 350 mm which is comparable to that found at the
IRBO La Mg Oil Palm Research Station. At a deficit of this level the mean
yield potential in the mature peak yield period would be some 12-13 tons
ffb/ha. In the south-west and south-east, the deficit is much lower (less
than 100 mn in the former area and 200 mm in the latter) and such
conditions are very suitable for oil palm development.
2.2.      Sunshine and temperature.  The mean annual sunshine hours varies
from 1700 to 1900 in the project area. The monthly average of daily
minimum temperatures is above 18'C which is considered the threshold.
3. Topozraphv and Draiza.Ae
3.1.      Generally the project area has a gently rolling topography.  At
certain locations such as Boubo there are substantial low lying areas
(bas-fonds) with a water table at 1-2 m from the surface depending on the
season. Yields in these areas are higher than would be expected in
relation to the water deficit. In the new areas of the south west the land
surface shows a pattern of finger like parcels of rolling topography
interspersed with low lying areas which should be planted wherever the soil
texture is satisfactory and effective drainage can be installed. The
Tamabo Nord area is a riverine alluvium and represents a new departure in
land utilisation for PALINDlUSTRIE. Such land has a higb yield potential
provided that appropriate drainage (wet season) and water control (dry
season) measures are taken.

Annex 3-1
Page 2 of 6
4. Soils I/
4.1.      The majority of the project area is occupied by upland soils
generally classified as "Sols Ferrallitiques Fortement Dessatures". These
are either soils of the "socle", derived from gneisses, schists or
granites in the areas to the west of Boubo or tertiary sands at Boubo and
the areas to the east. The texture of these soils varies from loamy sand,
sandy loam, sandy clay loam to clay loam. The lowland or hydromorphic
soils vary in texture from sandy clay loam to silty clay (Tamabo Nord).
4.2.      Soils which would be excluded from planting either contain
excessive quantities of lateritic gravel, have shallow hard pans or
suffer from waterlogging. With regard to gravel, the criterion which is
practised is 1.10 m free of gravel concretions.
5. Vegetation
5.1.      In about 33% of the project area, old palms will be replanted.
In a further 33Z, where densification of smallholder plantings will be
carried out, the vegetation is a mixture of light forest, forest
regrowth, perennial crops and annual crops. In the remaining area forest
which has been logged would be converted to oil palms.
6. Oil Palm Technology
6.1.      General. There is a wealth of readily available technical data
in the Ivory Coast arising from the work of the long established IRlO and
the 20 years of experience of PALMINDUSTRIE. The ITHO are technical
advisors to PALMINDUTRIE and publish a regular technical bulletin,
0leagineux. PALMINDUSTRIE are in process of updating their planting
manual which is the standard guide to planting techniques. Technical
information is diffused through inspection visits, extension agents
(smAllholders) and training courses.
6.2.      Technical Issues. The main technical issues which will arise in
the project relate to land clearing techniques, drainage and water control
of low lying areas, the leaf miner, Coelaenomenodera Elaeidis and Fusarium
wilt disease. In the lowlying areas of Tamabo Nord with heavy clay soils,
the use of heavy tractors for land clearing would be avoided. Instead,
trees would be felled wlth chain saws. After burning, felled timber would
be pruned, stacked and re-burned by manual means. Timber would be cleared
from planting points and harvesters paths as necessary by chain saW
operators supported by laborers. The drainage system would be carefully
constructed and operated, so as to maintain adequate drainage in the wet
season and allow the water-table to be kept at an appropriate level in the
I/ Detailed specifications and soil maps are available in the project
working paper Al.l.

dry season. The leaf miner would be monitored and controlled using the
existing systems of population census and chemical control. Fusarium wilt
is not a widespread problem in Ivory Coast. There is some evidence however,
that the incidence of the disease is likely to increase in the second
generation of plantings. It is intended therefore, to plant as much
Fusarium tolerant planting material as possible (about 1750 ha per year) in
the areas for replanting, during the project period.
6.3       The planting program would include new planting and replanting.
The technique of land clearing to be used would depend upon the nature of
the existing vegetation and the type of operator. With industrial
plantations, forest, bush and old oil palms would be pushed over by
bulldozer and heaped in windrows, along the contour, where appropriate, and
burnt. In the case of medium sized estates forest would be felled by chain
saw and then pushed into windrows by bulldozers. Smallholders would clear
by manual means.
6.4       All areas would be planted with selected Dura x Pisifera hybrid
polybagged plants protected from rodents by wire netting guards. The
germinated seed for nursery planting would be purchased from IRhO. Palms
would be field planted at a density of 143 per ha (9 m x 9 m). A
leguminous cover crop would be established and maintenance would be carried
out by hand weeding during the immature period. In replanted areas
emphasis would be placed upon achieving rapid cover crop spread over the
felled oil palm logs to reduce the level of breeding of Orvctes monoceros
or coconut beetle, an important pest of young palms. On industrial
plantations during the mature period, maintenance would be effected by
alterlating rounds of manual and chemical weeding.
6.5       Manuring during immaturity would be based upon the application of
N. K, P and Mg as single fertilizers. Detailed schedules are on page 5.
After commencement of production, nutrient needs would be identified by
leaf analysis and are likely to be generally restricted to superphosphate
in the west and muriate of potash on the tertiary sands of the centre and
east.
6.6       Harvesting would generally be carried out in weekly rounds.
Smallholders would deliver cut bunches to the roadside for collection by
PALMINDUSTRIE trucks prior to processing in the central mill. Harvesting
at the correct stage of ripeness would be emphasized by the extension
service so as to maximise the oil/bunch extraction rate.
6.7.      Intercropping of smallholder oil palms would be permitted during
year NO and Ni provided that a minimum distance of 2 metres between oil
palms and intercrops is maintained. In accordance with PALMINDUSTRIE
practice, bananas/plantains would not be accepted as an
intercrop in view of the possible serious competition for light and
nutrients. At the end of the intercrop period, Pueraria cover crop would be
established. Where maize is used as an intercrop the practice is to sno
Pueraria at the same time.

6.8.      The Research Copmonent. IRHO has prepared a small research
component to be implemented over a period of three years. This is fully
described in the two documents, "Projet de Renforcement des Recherches
d'Accompagnement a PALMINDUSTRIE, IRHO February 1984" and "Programme de
Recherches, PALMINDUSTRIE, April 1984". The research component would
investigate (i) problems of soil fertility and (ii) Fusarium wilt disease and
was supported by the mission of co-financiers. Under the former
investigation, research would be conducted into the maintenance of soil
fertility in replanted oil palms - tecbniques of land preparation, soil
fertility improvement through use of different cover crops, study of palm
nutrition and the economy of water use. In the latter investigation,
research into Fusarium would be intensified using the latest
technological advances principally, (i) the recently developed ORSTOM
test, which allows the identification of planting materials with bigh
tolerance (902) to Fusarium, compared with the existing tests which
guarantee 60Z tolerance and (ii) the cloning of palms derived from
crosses demonstrating tolerance.

IVORY COAST
FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DETAILED PLANTING PROGRAM
1. Principles in determination of the size of the proLram
1.1.      The major principles taken into consideration were :
- the replanting strategy as related to palm height, age and
yield,
- the domestic demand for palm oil,
- the availability of experienced staff for implementation,
- the success of ongoing planting, development and exploitation
programs,
- the smallholder demand for oil palm planting
- the availability of suitable land
- the availability of project infrastructure such as the
existing EAI facilities, processing capacity and road
networks.
1.2.      The replanting strategy is fully explained in the PALMINDUSTRIE
Preparation Report of April 1984. Major emphasis was placed upon the need
to even out progressively, over time the age composition of plantings, so
as to provide financial stability for future operations.
1.3.      Generally the Agro-Industrial Complexes are adequately staffed
under a classical plantation organisatioD structure. Additional staff
needs for the project are marginal in relation to overall operations and
mainly concern (i) the new plantings for the industrial plantations and
(ii) extensions (largely new plantings) within existing smallholder oil
palm plantings. The latter need will be dealt with through improved
organisation of extension (Annex 4-2). Where estate replanting takes
place there are no additional staff requirements.
1.4.      The recent 1983-85 FED programs wbich will amount to 14,000 ha
over the period were visited by the mission and found to be well
established. The original program of 12,000 ha will be exceeded by 2,000
ha.
1.5.      Smallholder demand and interest for oil palms is high in terms
of the applications for 50,000 ha of planting received by PALMINDUSTRIE
and the satisfactory condition of the 1983-84 plantings. In certain areas
such as Ehania and the south west, interest is enhanced by the ageing of
the cocoa smallholdings, the disease problems experienced in these wetter
areas, more suited to palms than cocoa and the relatively poor
performance of cocoa as opposed to oil palms, as perceived by
smallholders during the severe 1983 drought.
1.6.      The detailed planting program is on pages 3 to 6 of this Annex.



- 66 -
Annex 3-2
Page 2 of 6
2. The feasibility of the proaram
2.1.      The total five year project of some 65,000 ha is considerable
in relation to the present planted area of PALMINDUSTRIE (89,800 ha of
oil palms and 27,600 ha of coconuts) l/. The project would however be
implemented at some 12 management units all of which, except the new area
of Neka, are already adequately provided with staff and facilities.
2.2.      Some 50X of the plantings would be concentrated at Ehania and
in the south-west with 15,000 ha at the former and 21,000 ha at the
latter area. An additional senior staff member has been posted to Neka in
the south-west to take charge of land clearing operations.
2.3.      With the exception in para 2.1 above, the project would be
carried out within the existing infrastructure of PALEINDUSTRIE. The
terrain is straightforward without any important constraints to
development, technical problems are well known and the technology for
their resolution well applied (Annex 3-1).
2.4.      The major area of smallholder activity would be in the
plantings within existing oil palm areas. The approximate number of
smallholders involved in the project would be 8,000 compared with the
existing number of 10,000. Some 50Z of the project participants would be
participants from the previous projects, whose performance was judged
satisfactory. They would receive up to 3 ha of palms so as to bring their
total oil palm holdings to 6 ha. New smallholders would receive 6 ha
spread over 3-4 years provided that their performance continued to be
satisfactory. The above approach is suitably gradual and lays stress on
proven performance.
2.5       The recent experience with the FED program has adequately
prepared PALMINDUSTRIE to launch a project of this magnitude.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
EFFLUENT TREA T
Introduction
1.        PALMINDUSTRIE have carried out considerable research and
development into the disposal of mill effluent. Effluent treatment
measures should be designed for new and existing mills.
Background
2.        PALMINDUSTRIE operate 12 oil mills on the Agro-Industrial
Complexes. Recommendations for pollution control at these mills are in
Working Paper 1.5. Effluent disposal facilities would be installed at
the mills according to a phased program over a period of 6-8 years. The
first step would be to establish an effluent treatment system at the
existing mill which has the most serious effluent problem. The
experience gained in operation would be used in the design of the system
for the new mills at Blidouba and Neka which will be constructed in 1988.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PREPARATION OF A STRATEGY FOR THE OIL PALM AND COCONUT SUB-SECTOR
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
Introduction
1.        In preparation for the Third Oil Palm Plan, the Government of
Ivory Coast wishes to develop with the assistance of PALMINDUSTRIE, a
strategy for the oil palm and coconut sub-sector.
Background
2.        About  60X of the land area of Ivory Coast is classified as
agricultural (200,000 kWn), out of a total of 320,000 km2. However, the
area actually under cultivation at a-y one time is estimated to be only
64,000 km2 or some 20Z of this agricultural area. Smallholder
agriculture predominates, contributing some 95% of total agricultural
production, with industrial plantation agriculture which is largely oil
palm, coconut, and rubber making up the remaining 5%. Cocoa and coffee,
almost entirely planted on smallholdings, occupy some 2.2 million
hectares and together contribute two thirds of agricultural foreign
exchange earnings. The total area planted with the industrial plantation
tree crops is coconut 47,000 ha, oil palm 90,000 ha and rubber 41,000 ha.
The area within the forest zone amounts to 13.6 million ha. On the
assumption that about 20% of this area would be suited to coconut, oil
palm and rubber, there is therefore a large area of some 2 million ha
potentially suitable for their cultivation. This includes some 800,000
ha of "bas fonds" and up to 100,000 ha of alluvial soils with high water
tables with high potential for smallholder oil palm and coconut
cultivation. Land suitability therefore should not be a constraint.
3.        The oil palm sub-sector largely comprises PALMINDUSTRIE with
some 50,000 ha of industrial plantations and 30,000 ha of timallholdings.
Under the proposed Second Oil Palm Plan, to be implemented during
1985-1990, these areas would be increased to 62,000 and 54,000 ha
respectively. Other oil palm industrial plantations include BLOHORN with
3,500 ha and IRRO with 4,000 ha. In addition there are a few hundred
hectares of oil palm smallholdings planted by individuals outwith
organised programs. The coconut sub-sector consists mainly of
PALMINDUSTRIE with 19,000 ha of industrial plantations and 9,000 ha of
smallholdings. In addition, some 20,000 ha of coconut smallholdings -were
established prior to the establishment of PALMINDUSTRIE. So far
expansion has depended almost entirely on Goveroment intervention in the
sub-sector.



- 74 -                    Annex 3-4
Page 2 of 4
4.        PALMINDUSTRIE represents a major investment by Government in
oil palm and coconut infrastructure, housing and social facilities and in
the training of staff, labor and smallholders. Plantations are under
efficient management, and the financial position of the company is sound.
Smallholder performance has recently Improved following price increases
for fresh fruit bunches. The immediate demand for smallholder
participation in the Second Oil Palm Plan amounts to some 50,000 ha and
further demand is likely to remain strong in view of the attractiveness
of the crop for both cash and domestic consumption purposes.
5.        It was agreed by Government and the co-donors at negotiations
that a strategy and investment plan for the development of the sub-sector
would be prepared during the project peried by the planning staff of
Government and PALMINDUSTRIE. The strategy would be required to be
consistent with Government's overall strategy for the entire tree crop
sector including cocoa, coffee, coconut, oil palm and rubber.
Strategy for Oil Palm and Coconut
6.        The objectives of the study for development of the strategy
would be to:
Xi)    determine the location of soils with high production potential;
(ii)   briefly review the performance and prospects of the oil palm
and coconut sub-sector, given world and domestic market
conditions;
(iii) examine the economic and financial feasibility of oil palm and
coconut production at different levels of management and in a
range of agro-climatic conditions;
(iv)   determine the constraints in the development of the sub-sector,
in particular those relating to availability of capital and
management;
(v)    recommend measures for alleviation of these constraints.
(vi)   draw up an investment plan with realistic targets for
investment.
Detailed Requirements of the StIAX
7.        The study would be carried out in two parts.



- 75 -
Annex 3-4
Page 3 of 4
Part I
8.        The requirements of Part I would be the following:
(i)    briefly review the different units of agricultural production
in the sub-sector and evaluate their performance;
(ii)   on the basis of existing land resource and climatic data,
determine the location, suitability and area (ha) of soils with
a high oil palm and coconut yield potential; if necessary, draw
up terms of reference for further studies that may be required
to support any recommendations;
(iii)  assess the economic and financial potential of further oil palm
and coconut development at different levels of management and
technology and in an appropriate range of agro-climatic
conditions, taking into account the agronomic potential in para
8 (ii) above, as well as existing and planned processing and
marketing facilities and infrastructure;
(iv) estimate export market prospects and market needs, taking into
consideration comparative advantage and options for meeting
domestic vegetable oil needs through importation and
substitution between palm oil, coconut oil and other vegetable
oils;
(v)  determine the major constraints to production and investment in
the sub-sector;
(vi) propose a national long term planting and replanting program
for oil palm and coconut on the basis of economic potential and
Government objectives for the tree crop sector;
(vii) examine the organisational and financing arrangements of
PALMINDUSTRIE and FER, the main agencies for oil palm
development, and assess the suitability of these arrangements
as vehicles for further development of the sub-sector.
Consideration should be given to measures which would optimise:
(a) the returns to investment in PALMINDUSTRIE (to (i) include
the advantages/disadvantages of privatisation and/or splitting
PALNINDUSTRIE into smaller entities, and (ii)the possibility of
PALMINDUSTRIE developing other crops such as rubber within the
sphere of influence of existing plantation Infrastructure); (b)
the involvement of the private sector (smallholder, medium
sized and large scale plantations).
(viii) draw up a strategy and investment plan for the phased
development of the sub-sector over the period 1990-2000 to
include physical areas for development, organisational
arrangements and financing requirements.

Part II
9.        The requirements of Part II would be to carry out detailed
feasibility studies and draw up investment plans for particular sites,
selected by Government and PALMINDUSTRIE following the work of
PALMINDUSTRIE under para 8 (ii). The feasibility study would include
survey of physical resources, definition of land tenure status and
formulation of a project for tree crop development. Detailed terms of
reference would be drawn up nearer the date.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ESTABLISHMENT OF TRAINING PROGRAMS
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
Introduction
1.        PALMIND1USTRIE intends to greatly increase the emphasis on
training, to expand its scope and to organise it on a systematic basis.
The services of a training consultant are required to establish the
proposed training programs.
Background
2.        PALMINDUSTRIE employ some 14,500 persons of whom 14,000 are
located at the Agro-Industrial complexes and 452 are at headquarters in
Abidjan. The numbers of management staff (Directeurs, Cadres) at
headquarters and on the complexes are 135 and 27 respectively. Staff at
supervisor and overseer level amount to about 1,000 and there is a
similar number of specialised workers.
3.        Training has largely been on the job with tecbmica'. instruction
given by IRRO.  In view of the major development program proposed and the
policy of Ivorianisation which is underway, PALMINDUSTRIE has decided to
employ a consultant during 1985, to  (i)  identify training needs and
draw up an outline training syllabus and (1i) review existing training
facilities and determine the mecessity for further lnhouse facilities.
The Personnel Department is currently preparing job descriptions for all
posts along with an analysis of the skills required. The consultant
would prepare a training program to meet these requiremezits.
4.        During project implementation (1986-1990) a training consultant
would also be required for a total period of 24 man months to train the
trainers and establish the training programs. The consultant would
report directly to the Personnel Manager of PALMINDUSTRIE who is
responsible for implementation of the personnel policies of the company.
5. Detailed Requirements
These would be:
(i)     coordination of the preparation of training programs by
PALMINDUSTRIE senior staff in relation to the training needs
already identified (para 3); these programs would cover
agriculture, processing, administrEtion, finance, commercial
operations and senior management;

(ii)    implementation of the training programs to be given lnitially
by (a) senior management staff of PALNINDUSTRIE; (b)
non-PALMINDUSTRIE specialists located in the Ivory Coast; and
(c) eventually largely by PALMINDUSTRIE speciallst trainers;
training of local trainers would be an important element of

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PROJECT ORGANISATION AND MANAGEMENT
1. Background
1.1.      In 1963, the state corporation, SociEte pour le Diveloppement et
l'Exploitation du Palmier a Huile (SODEPAI) was established by Government
decree, and given responsibility for the implementation of the entire first
oil palm plan (Plan Palmier) and then from 1967, for the coconut plan.
Following a series of corporate restructurings which commenced in 1969,
PALMINDUSTRIE, originally a semi-public entity which owned the oil mills,
was in 1977 converted into a state corporation. PALMINDUSTRIE's
responsibilities have gradually increased and it is now in charge of the
oil palm and coconut industrial plantations, the smallholder oil palm and
coconut program, processing and marketing. The detailed background to the
institutional changes which have accompanied the oil palm and coconut
developments is given in the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Impact
Evaluation Report 1/.
2. Organisational Structure a.d Staffing
2.1.      The organisation chart of PALMINDUSTRIE is in Annex 4-1.
PALMINDUSTRIE comprises the headquarters at Vridi near the port of AbidJan,
the nine Agro-Industrial Complexes (Ensemble Agro-Industriel) where the
industrial and smallholder oil palm and coconut plantings are located, 12
oil palm mills, an oil seeds mill at Vridi and a palm oil bulking
installation at San Pedro. PALMINDUSTRIE employs some 14,500 people of
which some 14,000 are In the Complexes and 452 at headquarters (page 6 and
7). The numbers of management staff (Directeurs, Cadres) at headquarters
and the Complexes respectively are 135 and 27. At the former location, 110
are local staff and 25 are expatriate. In the field, of the nine Managers
of Complexes, eight are local. These Managers are assisted by a total of
15 expatriates of which 12 are in the mills and three in the field.
2.2.      Expatriates are employed through three separate arrangements :
(i) under a contract with UNIPLANT; (ii) under a contract with IRHO and
(iii) by direct employment. UNIPLANT comprises a consortium of three
international, long established plantation companies, SOCFIN, PLANTATIONS
TERRES ROUGES and SODECI.
2.3.      The staff provided under the above contracts have executive
authority in the following seven positions : (i) UNIPLANT; Technical
1/ Impact Evaluation Report Ivory Coast : Oil Palm and Coconut Development
Projects. OED, May 1984. paras 1.09 - 1.15; paras 2.16 -2.23.

Manager, Financial Manager, Personnel Manager, Oil Seed Kill Manager and
(ii) IRRO; Assistant General Manager, Manager of Programming and Studies
and Field Inspector (existing plantings). Under the UNIPLANT contract, it
is intended that the following three additional appointments will be made
in early 1985; Visiting Manager Marketing Department; Central Worshop
Manager and a Reserve Manager for the Agro-Industrial Complexes.
3. Role and Functions of Headquarters
3.1.      PALMINDUSTRIE Headquarters is responsible for (i) policy
formulation with respect to administration, finance and technical
operations (ii) the overall planning and phasing of industrial plantation
and smallholder programs and (iii) the direction and control of the
Agro-Industrial Complexes which are charged with the implementation of
these programs at field level. The headquarters has also the
responsibility for overall personnel and financial management, for
procurement, marketing and for surveys and studies.
3.2.      The effective implementation of field programs ultimately depends
upon the standard of management at field level. To achieve a high level of
efficiency field management must be fully supported by specialists in the
spheres of management, personnel development, production and processing and
there must be a well organised system of inspection, accounting and
reporting. During the past 3-4 years, PALMINDUSTRIE has created a
headquarters structure with a satisfactory capacity for planning,
direction, support and control. The maintenance of this structure during
the envisaged project is essential to the continuing efficiency of
PALMINDUSTRIE.
3.3.      Direction, support and control of field progrAms are provided
through regular visits by the Manager of Agricultural Production (Directeur
Production Agricole) and the PALMINDUSTRIE Production and Processing
Inspectors. Control is also obtained through a system of annual budgets
and monthly progress reports and accounts. This system, which provides the
management information necessary for the running of the company is in the
process of being refined and computerised. In addition, external control
is carried out by inspectors of the Ministry of Agriculture for technical
programs (Cellule Palmier) and by an independent company of external
auditors for financial matters. Finally, under the project, independent
supervision of technical aspects of the proposed program would be carried
out by an Agricultural Adviser and a Financial Adviser.
3.4.      PALMINDUSTRIE is now placing major emphasis on personnel
development; having recently recruited a Personnel Manager through UNIPLANT
for this purpose. A personnel policy is being developed. This includes a
well devised system for staff performance evaluation and for provision of
performance incentives. Programs for career development and manpower
planning and control are being worked out. Training in technical aspects is
provided by IRHO. There is a need however for more comprehensive training
programs to include estate management and administration, estate accounting

and smallholder administration. Such training programs would be developed
during 1985 and 1986. The need for additional training facilities would
also be studied. These facilities, if required, would not be financed
under the project, but would be financed separately by PALMINDUSTRIE.
4. Role and Functions of Agro-Industrial Complexes
and Relations with Headquarters.
4.1.      The organisation of a typical Complex is on page 9. The Manager
of a Complex is responsible for ensuring that the headquarters plans for
production and development are implemented In a timely, efficient and
economic manner. It is also his responsibility to assemble all essential
information relating to development and production in the form of reports
and accounts and transmit this information to headquarters for evaluation
and action.
4.2.      The satisfactory operation of a Complex depends upon the
effective delegation of responsibility. The organisation chart of a
PALMINDUSTRIE Complex is designed to meet this objective. The Manager
concentrates upon planning, organisation, co-ordination, general control
and supervision. He also ensures that adequate attention is given to the
training of his subordinate staff and labor. Responsibility for the direct
control of field operations rests with the Plantation Mbanger and his
assistants; each assistant being responsible for an area of about 1,000 ha.
Assistants are supported by supervisors and overseers, the latter in a
ratio of one per 25 laborers.
4.3.      The two main spheres of operation at the level of a Complex in
production are the harvesting and transport of fruit on the one hand and
processing on the other. These are the responsibility of the Plantation
Manager and the Mill Manager respectively. The co-ordination of harvesting
and processing operations being under the close control of the Manager of
the Complex.
4.4.      Since 1983, PALMINDUSTRIE has adopted a gradual policy of
decentralisation, taking into account the management capabilities of
senior staff at field level and where appropriate providing increasing
responsibility to the Managers of the Complexes. The objectives of this
policy are to limit overhead costs and increase autonomy and efficiency at
field level at a time of major expansion of PALMINDUSTRIE. This allocation
of mote responsibility to Managers has been accompanied by strong
headquarters control over physical targets and costs which would be
continued throughout the project period.
4.5.      High standards of industrial plantation require a well trained
and healthy labor force. During the four previous oil palm and coconut
projects, PALMINDUSTRIE has continued to Improve the living conditions of
the labor force on the industrial plantations to a level which is generally
satisfactory. The housing program currently accomnodates 12,000 workers

Annex 4-2
Page 4 of 9 pages
while the project will add 1,000 houses of various types. There are
currently 5 hospital(s) and 50 dispensaries which allow for the treatment
of both plantation workers and smallholder participants. The education
facilities include 50 schools which accommodated 4,000 pupils In 1984.
Finally, PALMINDUSTRIE has also built markets, TV showrooms, soccer fields,
churches and mosques at each complex.
5. PALMINDUSTRIE Extension Services
5.1.      Background.  In addition to oil palm industrial plAntations
PALMINDUSTRIE has a major role In the implementation of the Important
smallholder program. The latter currently represents 40 Z of all oil
palm plantings in the Ivory Coast. The success of the large suallholder
program to he Implemented during the project will be directly related to
the organisation and quality of PALMINDUSTRIE's extension services.
5.2.      Extension services in the oil palm and coconut sub-sector
remained under the responsibility of SODEPALM from 1963 till 1981/82 when
they were transferred to PALMINDUSTRIE. The ratio of extension workers per
area of oil palm had been anticipated, in 1963, to be no less than 1 per
500 ha. However, operations commenced at the much lower rate of one
extension worker per 170 ha, in 1965. It then, rapidly increased to 1 per
300 ha in 1970, 1 per 500 ha in 1974 and 1 per 550 ha In 1977. Meanwhile,
In 1978, the distribution of inputs and the collecting of farueru'ffb were
suddenly passed on from SODEPALM to PALMINDUSTRIE. As a result of this
precipitous transfer of responsibilities, both the extension staff and the
farmers became less motivated. By September 1982. the average ratio of
extension worker par area of oil palm had reached 1 per 650 ha with
extremes of over 1,000 ha in some locations. Thus the total number of
extension agents dropped from 86 to 57 between 1973 and 1982.
5.3.      Because of the lack In both quantity and quality of extension
services, it was recommended in the early 1980's to (I) increase
the number of extension workers in the fitld, significantly (it)
reorganize the extension services and (1i.) Improve the competence of the
extension agents. As a first consequence, there were again some 71
extension agents looking after 35,000 ha of oil palm smallholdings or an
average of 500 ha per agent, in May 1984.
5.4       At headquarters, the smallholder program comes under the
Agricultural Production Department or Direction de la Production Agricole
(DPA). The program Is headed by the Chief of Suallholder Services (Chef
Service Plantations Villageoises) and his deputy. At the field level there
are currently four Regional Coordinators - (Responsables Rfgionaux) - each
acting as advisor to the Manager of a particular Agro-Industrial-Complex on
matters related to smallholders Including extension and the collectlng of
farmers' ffb. The Regional Coordinators are directly answerable to the
DPA.
5.5.      While each industrial plantation is headed by a plantation
manager, there is not yet a corresponding position for similar areas under
smallholdings. Instead the extension agents are supervised by Assistants
in an average ratio of one assistant for 4-5 extension agente.

Extenlon Agents
Orgaisoation under the Proioct
5.8       Extenion Oraniation. Suitable prnctples of the Training and
Visit System would be introduced under which exteion agents ()
would visit each field areary two weeks on the m  day of the week.
The total are  to be visited by one oxtesion aget would be divided Into
eight to ten thus alloing four to five days each week for field v1slts.
Ratlos of extension agents to farmrs would be 1:100-150 and of assistants
to extesion agents 1:10. In the case of la1g   alholder developmts
such as Zhani. a smmllbolder mnager (chef do zone) would be anointed
above the level of assistant and rportng to the _moar of the complex.
With smaller developmtet the mt senior of the aistants would perform
the functions of a amllholder manager. Four subject mtter specialists
one to serve "ech Igional Co-ordinator would be appointed. Their tim
would be equally dlvded betwen  tradning of extension agets, field vits
and exposure to research.
5.9      Qualifications of Extension Staff. The senior headquarters staff
and the regional co-ordiators are tec"-1ly wall qualified, with ENSA
degrees In agronomy. Smllbolder manaers and SS would hold a similar
qualification. Assistants would be either "Technician  Supiriurs de
1'Institut Asricole de Jouak" (in) or "Assistants do Production Vig&tale
at Animle de Iigervlle" (AIVA). Exteulon agets would have followed at
last eight yars of school holding the "Bret d'Etudes du Prmier Cycle
(Ul!C). All extension staff would receve appropriate In service training
under the trainin  progras to be organisd b PALIMDJIE (Annex 4-2
para 3.4).
5.10     Reviw. The organlzation of the extmion services would be
rwevied two years after iplentatio of the T and V Systm, In the light
of experien   both with t  Projet and with the National Extesion
Project, due to camazce in late 1985.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CROP YIELD PROJECTIONS
1. The basis for yield prolection
1.1       There are considerable data on yield behaviour in the Ivory
Coast, from PALMINDUSTRIE itself, where production commenced in 1967 and
from the IRHO Research Station at La Me. Recently, (1978) IRHO carried
out a yield analysis of PALMINDUSTRIE, (SODEPALM, Palmier a guile et
Cocotier: Analyse des Resultats de la Production obtenue).
1.2       Project yield projections are based primarily on the past
yields of a particular Industrial plantation. Yields have been projected
at about historical levels. In new areas yields are based on the
relationship established by IRHO between yield and annual water deficit.
(The annual water deficit, the rainfall data and the yield/water deficit
relationship are in pages 3 to 7 of the Annex.
2. The projections
2.1       Yields of ffb on the industrial plantations are projected
conservatively, (page 8) generally at the same levels as in the past.
During 1981-83 the OED Report assessed the mean industrial plantation
yield at 10 tons/ha per annum. Allowance has not been made for the
likely increase in yield of some 25Z, to be expected from the genetic
improvement of the IRHO planting materials to be used for the project as
compared with the materials produced in the sixties. Yields of new
plantings and replanting are estimated to be at the same level.
2.2       Smallholder yields per hectare have not been recorded
accurately in the past. In the OED Report they were considered to have
reached 9-10 tons ffb/ha in year 10 followed by a gradual fall of 1
ton/ha per year. This poor performance in the later years was related to
poor prices, inadequate extension (in particular the late introduction of
the Malaysian harvesting pole) and poor selection of farmers. Yields of
smallholdings are estimated at 70Z of the adjacent industrial plantation
except in the case of Toumanguie, where present smallholder yields are
exceptionally high and at the other end of the scale, at Bolo/Soubre
where a divergence larger than 30% would be expected on the basis of
poorer past smallholder performance.
2.3       Yields of small/medium enterprises are taken to be 90X of the
industrial plantations.

Annex 5-1
Page 2 of 8
2.4       At the maJor new areas of Blidouba and Neka-Grabo, the extent
of gravelly soil is considered insufficient to warrant yield adjustment
on this account. Furthermore the gravel is fairly loose and well
dispersed.
2.5       In 1984 oil extraction rates were 21% for the mixture of
production from both industrial plantations and smalIholdings. At Iboke
plantation with fruit bunches derived only from the industrial
plantation, the extraction rate was 24%. Conservatively, oil extraction
rates are set at 20.7% for the mixture of industrial plantation and
smallholding production which will be derived from the replanting of
plantations and extensions of smallholdings and at 22.5% for the new
areas which largely comprise industrial plantation and small/medium
enterprises.
2.6       The kernel extraction rate is assumed to be 4.5% which is again
conservative.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MARKETS, PRICES AND DEMAND
World Market for Pats and Oils
1.        An important characteristics of the World fats and oils economy
is the large number of oil-bearing raw materials. On the basis of their
source, fats and oils can be grouped into vegetable oils and animl fats
(including marine oils). Vegetable oils can be further broken down into
oils from annual oilseeds (such as soybeans. groundnuts and
sunflowerseeds) and those from perennial tree crops (such as coconut oil,
palm oil and palm kernel oil). Oils of the first group are liquid at
room temperature (in temperate climates) and are referred to as "soft"
oils. Oils of the second group, known as "hard" oils8 have a higher
melting point and are usually solid. Hard oils contain a higher
percentage of saturated fatty acids than soft oils.
2.        Demand. Worldwide, the apparent consumption of fats and oils
grew steadily at an average rate of 3.4Z p.a. in the period from 1961 to
1982. In 1982 Industrial countries accounted for just over 332 of world
consusption, down slightly from more than 342 in the early 1960s. During
the early 1960s, developlig countries consumed about 152 of total world
production of fats and oils. By 1982 this share had increased to 56Z of
world consumption. Within the developing region, Asia's share of fats
and oils consumption in 1982 was about 612 of total regional consumption;
the corresponding shares for Africa, Latin America and Southern Europe
were approximately 162, 16X and 6Z respectively.
3.        Regional consumption patterns of fats and oils generally
reflects regional production patterns and natural storage conditions.
Economic protection and transportation costs play an important role in
the preference for locally produced fats and oils. In temperate zones,
soybeans and other annual oilseed crops supply most of the oils needed in
the manufacture of margarine, shortening and other fat products. In
tropical and semi-tropical zones, coconut oil, palm oil and groundnut oil
dominate vegetable oil consumption.
4.        Per capita consumption of fats and oils depends largely on
income, Table 1. Statistical analysis indicates that, at low income
levels, demand for fats and oils increases rapidly vith increasing
incomes. At high income levels - roughly those now reached in the
United States, Canada and some West European countries - demand becomes
much less responsive to increases in income and per capita consumption
levels off at about 30 kg per year.

5.        In many industrial countries, therefore, no large increase in
overall demand is likely unless new products and end-uses are developed.
As the potential for expanding consumption declines in industrial
countries, an increasing share of world production of fats and oils have
to be marketed in developing countries where average per capita
consumption is only about one-third of that in industrial countries.
6.        World consumption of vegetable oils is expected to grow at
about 3.2Z p.a. in the period 1985-95, slightly below the historical
trend rate of 3.4Z p.a. during the 1970-82 period. In recent years, the
demand for vegetable oils has grown the fastest in developing countries
and this trend is expected to continue. Vith their expected population
growth rate, higher expected Income growth rate, and higher income
elasticity of demand for vegetable oils, their share of total consumption



- 117 -
Annez 5-3
Page 3 of 12
is expected to increase from 55.8Z in 1982 to 59.6S in 1990 and to 62.5Z
in 1995. The share of total consumption of the industrial countries is
expected to fall from 33.6Z in 1982 to 30.2Z in 1990 and 27.8Z in 1995.
The share of the CPEs is expected to decline marginally, from 10.6Z in
1992 to 10.2Z in 1990 and 9.7% in 1995.
7.        In per capita terms, consumption of vegetable oils in
developing countries is projected to increase from 8.1 kg in 1982 to 9.4
kg in L990 and 10.6 kg-in 1995.
8.        suppl    The supply of fats and oils, as a group, is highly
price-inelastic in the short-run because of the long gestation period and
economic life-span of tree crops   Also, many fats and oils are obtained
as by-products when oil-bearing materials, such as oilseeds. are
processed. The demand for oilseed meal and the demand for fats and oils
which are recovered simultaneously are governed by different market
forces. Thus, the supply of vegetable oils will increase if there is a
strong demand for oilseed meals, irrespective of the prices of vegetable
oils.
9.        Since the-early 19609, world production of vegetable oils.has
grown at an average rate of about 3.4Z. During this period, supplies of
vegetable oil grew faster than those of Aniol fats and marine oils.
Several factors accounted for the increase in vegetable oil supplies.
First, the growing demand for soybean meal led to a sharp increase in
soybean oil supplies. A second factor was the surge in pals oil
supplies. The high yields of palm oil under favorable growing conditions
in Malaysia and some West African countries such as the Ivory Coast made
oil palm one of the most commercially attractive tree crops.
10.       Production of fats and oils is projected to grow at an average
annual rate of 3.21 over the 1985-95 period, slightly below the
historical rate of 3.9% in 1961-82. The United States and Brazil should
continue to dominate soybean production, although a number of other
countries such as Argentine and Paraguay are expected to increase their
market share. Malaysia and Indonesia are expected to increase their
share of world palm oil production.
11.       Trade. Trade in vegetable oils is expected to increase faster
in developing countries because per capita oil consumption is still
relatively low and also because of their higher expected population
growth rate, higher expected income growth rate, and higher income
elasticity of demand for vegetable oils.
12.       Soybean oil and palm oil are likely to continue to dominate
trade in vegetable oils. Both are generally cheaper than other vegetable
oils in the international market and they constitute by far the largest
portion of the ingredients In the manufacture of vanaspati. With the
expected continued large increases in palm oil production, particularly
from Malaysia and Indonesia, the market share of palm oil is expected to
increase even faster than that of soybean oil.

13.       Prices.  When the prices of vegetable oils that are important
in world trade are compared on the basis of their average prices, three
distinct group can be delineated: groundnut, cottonseed and lauric oils
(coconut and palm kernel oils) are the highest-priced oils; soybean,
palm, sunfloverseed and rapeseed oils are the medium priced oils; marine
or fish oils are the cheapest available.
14.       Technological improvements in the refining and use of fats and
oils have increased their interchangeability. This has affected prices
in three ways: (a) prices have become more important in the
manufacturer's choice of fats and oils, (b) price differentials among
fats and oils have narrowed; and (c) the increased possibility of
substitution has encouraged the use of cheaper oils, such as soybean oil
and palm oil, at the expense of higher-priced oils.
15.       Barring any major reduction in projected supplies, long-term
real prices of vegetable oils are projected to fall from their current
relatively high levels. Although demand prospects for vegetable oils,
particularly in developing countries, are expected to remain quite
favorable, supplies (especially of soybean and palm oils) are likely to
be more plentiful - leading to a general softening of vegetable oil
prices.
16.       Table 2 below provides recent data on world production and
exports of palm and palm kernel oil. Clearly, Ivory Coast's market share
is minimal and even considerable expansion of exports would be unlikely
to affect world market prices.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
REFINED AND CRUDE PALM OIL PRICE STRUCTURE
1.        Until the transfer of the marketing of crude palm oil and palm
kernel oil from CSSPPA to PALMINDUSTRIE, crude palm oil was sold to the
local processing industry at world market price with adjustment for cif,
port charges and handling costs. At the time of the transfer of the
marketing responsibilities to PALMINDUSTRIE, an indicative formula was
devised by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Whereas
PALMINDUSTRIE's export sales of crude palm oil have been effected at
world prices, the formula has been used in fixing the transfer price of
crude palm oil to the local refining industry. The formula combines the
estimated trend of world palm oil prices in the very long run and local
producer and consumer price developments. The prices fixed by means of
the indicative formula have in the period since its introduction resulted
in distortions between world and domestic transfer prices with the
transfer price being as low as 402 below export equivalent world prices.
2.        It is par; if the structural adjustment program currently being
discussed between the Government and the Bank to ensure a close and
automatic link between world and domestic prices of the major
agricultural commodities. In the context of this pricing reform, the
cofinanciers of the proposed project and the Government have agreed on a
reform of current pricing mechanisms in the oil palm sector along the
lines indicated below:
i)     de facto quantitative restrictions to importing or
exporting crude paLm oil would be removed;
(ii)    the transfer price of crude palm oil between
PALMINDUSTRIE and the domestic refining industry to be
fixed within the framework of freely negotiated
commercia.'.. contracts between the two concerned parties;
(iii) provision of a floor price for smallholders to ensure a

Page 2 of 2
minimum return per manday of work and their continued
interest in the crop in case of short-term adverse
international price fluctuations.
3.        This mechanism would ensure that the transfer price of crude
palm oil from PALMINDUSTRIE to the domestic refining industry would
closely follow international prices. The broader problems of
deregulation of consumer product prices (in particular refined oil) and
of appropriate levels of tariffs to grant the required net effective
protection to each stage of the production/processing chain would be
dealt with in the general context of SAL III negotiations to be held by
the end of 1985.

FIFTH OIL PALM DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
OUTGROWER PRICE POLICY
1.        Producer prices for fresh fruit bunches (FFB) have been revised
with long Intervals and uneven rates unlike producer prices on other tree
crops (see Table 1). Following the doubling of prices in 1974 from 4 to
8 CFAF/kg. a major increase in prices came about only in 1980 when the
price Increased by 50Z from 10 CFAF to 15 CFAF/kg".
2.        The price structure is illustrated on page 4 and 5.  From the
price of crude palm oil converted by the extraction rate into m
equivalent and with the value of the palm kernel added, the costs of
collection, processing, extension, overheads are deducted. In addition,
a lump-sun debt service and a contribution to the Expansion and
Replanting Fund (FER) are deducted.
3.        PALMINDUSTRIE paid in 1983/84 the outgrowers an average price
of CFAF 18.5/kg. Apart from the base price of CFAF 15/kg, all planters
were paid a supplement of CFAF 2/kg to reflect the favorable world market
price of pals oil. In addition, all planters with sales to PALMINDUSTRIE
in excess of 5 t/ha for the year received a premium of CPAF 2/kg. For
maxImum effect the supplement and the premium were paid to the planters
at the beginning of the school-year where demand for liquidity is
greatest.

4. The revised pricing system
The producer price system represents essentially a
consolidation and an extension of the current system. The fundamental
principles are:
(a)       the outgrower should be paid the net value of his
produce at world prices plus any tariff protection of
the sub-sector;
(b)       the price structure should provide incentive to
intensive production;
(r.)     roadside prices to the various groups of outgrowers
should be uniform;
(d)      smallholders service their debt by a cess.
5.        In the future a formula for the determination of the FFB
outgrover price would be applied. The formula would have four elements:
(i)      the value of the final output expressed in FFB
equivalent terms. This value would be calculated as
the average of the ex factory revenue from domestic
and export sales of oil palm products (crude palm
oil, kernel oil, and cake). The revenue would be
converted to equivalent FFB terms by technical
conversion factors (extraction rates);
(ii)     the agricultural, processing and transport costs and
overheads connected with FFB collection, processing
and the output marketing.
The cost will be determined on a yearly basis from
PALMINDUSTRIE's account and budgets;
(iii)    a profit margin to PALMINDUSTRIE.
This margin would be calculated as a percentage of
the difference between the revenue (i) and the
operating costs (ii);
(iv)     a guaranteed floor price;
(v)      a system of production premia.
Every Month:
The outgrower would be paid the value of this harvest at the
floor price.



- 131 -
Annex 5-5
Page 3 of 5
Every 6 or 12 months:
The difference between the net price calculated by deductions
(ii) through (iv) from (i) and the floor price would be paid to the
outgrowers, as well as a premium on production. The premium system would
be based on an average yield per ha. Production (collected by
PALMINDUSTRIE) below this average would lead to a price of the entire
production below the average net price for the period; production above
average would be paid a price above average. The production premia would
be paid in connection with a trimestrial payment of the difference
between the net and floor price.
6.        Smallholders and medium-sized plantations will be paid the same
price per kg FFB at plantation road side. However, the type and level of
services provided by PALMINDUSTRIE to the medium-sized plantations will
differ from those extended to smallholders (assistance with
land-clearing, provision of planting material, fertilizer, insecticide,
roads and road maintenance, collection of harvest, extension), and will
differ among medium-sized plantations. To the latter, the road-sized
price is essentially an instalment on the total payment of the FFB
delivered to PALID USTRIE. The individual accounts will be settled
periodically by PALMINDUSTRIE. Since the net price to medium-sized
plantations will exceed the price paid to smallholders to the extent
services differ, and transfers of FFB from one outgrower to the other is
a possibility, PALMINDUSTRIE will assure by close supervision and control
that the level of FFB sold to PALMINDUSTRIE by medium-sized plantations
corresponds to the expected level of production.

ECONOMIC AND_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS
A. Economic Analy8is
1. General
(a) Period: 25 years Including 5 years plantation establishment
and 20 years of production.
(b)  Exchange Rate:         US$1 - CFAF 490.
Shadow Exchange Rate: US$1 - 588.
2.  Cost Assumjtions
(a) Project Costs: includes costs of equipment, plantation
establishment, incremental local personnel and operating costs
of plantations and PALMINDUSTRIE and loss of production due to
felling of trees under the replanting program; costs include
physical contingencies of 0 to 10 Z. (Details: Project
Working Papers; Project Cost Tables).
(b) Inputs would be purchased under predominantly competitive
conditions and no shadow pricing of domestic resources has been
done.
3. Benefits Assumptions
(a) Production: Production would commence PY4. Yield profiles
are in Annex 5-1; Production Summary in Annex 5-2.
(b)  Prices:  Economic prices of palm oil and palm kernels are
export equivalent prices based on world market prices (CIF)
less Insurance, freight and port handl.ing, and storage charges.
World market prices are forecast by IBRD (January 1985 forecast) up to
1995; beyond 1995 prices are assumed to stay constant in real terms.
B. Financial Analysis
1. General
(a) Period: 25 years Including 5 years plantation establishment and
20 years of production.

Page 2 of 2
(b)  Inflation factors:  as In project costing (par& 2) 1986:7.5Z,
1987-90: 8X, 1991, and thereafter: 5Z.
(c) Exchange Rate: US$1 - CFAF 490.
2.  Outflow Assup tions
(a) Payments for goods and services through the life of the project
include taxes, and are presumed to be made when cost Is
incurred for project execution.
(b) Debt service on foreign loans are estimated as follows:
IBRD: 20 years term at 9.29% p.a. variable, 5 years grace, 0.75X
commitment fee on indisbursed amount.
CCCE:  20 years term at 101 p.a.. 5 years grace*
CDC:    15 years term at 9% p.a., 5 years grace.
EDF:    40 years term at 12 p.a., 10 years grace.
EI:    15 years term at 6.6% p.a., 5 years grace.
3. Inflow Assumptions
(a) Disbursement of IBRD loan, schedule in Annex 3-9: Schedule of
Disbursement.
(b) Tax revenues are assumed to accrue on project expenditures
(Project Working Papers: Input and Project Costs).
(c)  Sales revenue is estimated assuming the timing and volume
used in the economic analysis. Prices of crude palm oil and palm
kernels are derived from world CIF prices plus export subsidy and
less insurance, freight, port, handling, and storage charges.
(Details: Annex 5-4: Markets, Prices and Demand). Price
increase assumptions are the same as those of the economic
analysis.
