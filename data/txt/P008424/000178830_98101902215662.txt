REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE HELLENIC STATE
FOR THE NESTOS AND YANNITSA IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Hellenic State for the equivalent of US$30 million to help finance a
project for irrigation. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including
5-1/2 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Greece" (EMA-49a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 31,
1972 (R72-73). An economic mission visited Greece in December 1973, and is
preparing its report; its basic findings are incorporated below. Country
data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Following the election of Colonel George Papadopoulos as President
in the summer of 1973, a slow process of political liberalization was announced
and an all-civilian government was formed. Student demands escalated, however,
and led to serious disturbances in late October. On November 25, the six-year
old regime of President Papadoupoulos was overthrown and a regime backed by
the armed services and the police was installed. The political changes in
1973 created a hiatus in economic policy-making which now appears to have ended.
4.        Throughout the 1960's the Greek economy enjoyed rapid economic
growth averaging 7.5 percent per year. Since 1968, growth has averaged 8.5
percent per annum with marked increases in manufacturing output, while agri-
culture lagged. Receipts from tourism, workers' remittances and Greek-owned
shipping grew significantly. There were large increases in private fixed
investment, especially housing, and in public investment, mainly infrastruc-
ture. Private consumption rose at a rate of 8.1 percent per annum, and gross
capital formation grew at 12.7 percent. Prices were relatively stable. How-
ever, by the end of 1972, the economy reached almost full employment of capa-
city and manpower; with emerging production constraints, pressure on domestic
prices developed in the middle of 1972. Consumer prices, which had increased
at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent per annum in the previous four years,
increased by 4.4 percent in 1972 while wholesale prices rose 6.3 percent. In
1973, average consumer prices increased about 15 percent.
5.        Although the industrial sector has grown rapidly in the past decade,
agriculture in 1973 still accounted for 20 percent of GDP. The Government's
objective was to raise agricultural productivity, pursue diversification and
increase the production of higher yielding crops especially those for export.
However, the average annual net growth (value added) of agriculture in 1968-72



- 2 -
was 2.2 percent (against the Plan target of 5.2 percent). Nevertheless,
agricultural underemployment, at one time pervasive, declined as a result of
continuing non-agricultural employment opportunities both at home and abroad.
6.        Industry has been a dynamic sector.    Average annual growth between
1968 and 1972 was 13.0 percent, and the contribution of manufacturing to GDP
rose from 19.3 percent in 1968 to 23.0 percent in 1973. Gross private and
public industrial investment in the 1968-72 period rose at an annual average
rate of 13.1 percent. Primarily as a result of the addition of new capacity
in the ferro-nickel, steel and aluminum industries, the share of manufactured
goods in total exports increased sharply from 23 percent in 1968 to 38 percent
in 1972 (40 percent January-September, 1973). Full utilization of existing
capacitv led to shortages and bottlenecks and was an important factor in the
Government's decision to liberalize price controls in 1972.
7.        Greece's rapid economic growth has been accompanied by increasing
imports which, during the period 1968-72, rose at an average annual rate of
about 16 percent while export:s expanded by an average of only 13.6 percent.
The trade deficit rose from $784 million in 1968 to $1.6 billion in 1972,
with an increasing share of this deficit being financed by receipts from in-
visibles such as workers' remittances, transportation and travel. As a re-
sult, the current account def'icit which reached $404.5 million in 1970 re-
mained at about that level in 1972. Tog-ether with increased net capital in-
flows, this led to a substantial balance of payments surplus in 1971 and 1972
and brought about an increase in net foreign exchange reserves to $968 million
at the end of 1972, equivalent to about five months of imports. By the end of
1973, official reserves were $1,047 million.
8.        Price increases which took place in the second half of 1972 and
throughout 1973 ended a period of sustained growth with price stability.
This was partly the result of increased internal demand in a situation of
near full employment and partly imported from abroad. It prompted the Gov-
ernment to take restraining measures in December 1972 and on several occasions
in 1973. These included a reduction in the budgeted expenditures of the
central Government and other public entities, an increase in the reserve
requirements of banks, an upward revision of up to 2 percentage points in
lending and deposit rates, a ceiling on commercial bank credit as well as
other measures to mop up liquidity and tighten credit, particularly in the
booming housing industry. Import and price controls were further liberalized.
9.        Despite these measures, bottlenecks which emerged in plant capacity
as well as in the labor market suggest adjustment difficulties for the Greek
economy compotunded by price increases for imported raw materials and fuels.
Growth expectations may hav- to .be revised from a rate of 7.5 percent per
annum to 6 percent or less per annum. It also appears tthat average price
increases may well exceed 8 percent in the years to come. The 1973/77 Plan,
not yet approved, is being revised to reflect the changed outlook. According
to the un-official indicative Fifteen-Year Plan, investment in agriculture,
tourism and shipping will continue to be encouraged. However, the foremost
objective of development policy would remain rapid industrialization aimed to



- 3 -
enable the Greek economy to adjust and expand within the framework of asso-
ciate membership within the EEC. The indicative plan expects that in the
longer run economic growth will continue to stem from the private sector, with
the Government role continuing to center on supplying economic and social
infrastructure.
10.       Despite the rise in reserves in 1972, shortage of long-term capital
may become a constraint to growth in the medium-term. The current account
deficit is likely to be increased sharply by the rise in the cost of oil
imports by an estimated $350-400 million in 1974. This would be equivalent
to about 15 percent of current account earnings or one-third of foreign ex-
change reserves. Since 1967, Greece has had only limited access to long-term
foreign capital, and the availability of concessionary funds has been reduced.
The Government continues efforts to reduce short-term borrowing, and there
have been signs recently of somewhat easier access to longer term funds.
11.       Public external debt outstanding at the end of 1972 amounted to
$1,744.0 million of which $432.7 million was undisbursed; Bank loans at that
date amounted to $115.7 million of which $83.0 million was undisbursed.
Major reported additions during 1973 amounted to $126.8 million. Debt service
pavments in 1972 amounted to $164.3 million (of which only $4.0 million for
Bank loans) and represented 6.7 percent of receipts from export of goods,
non-factor services and workers' remittances. Service payments on existing
debt peak in 1976, at $280 million, and would on reasonable expectations re-
garding the growth of exchange earnings, then represent 7 to 8 percent of
such earnings. New borrowings may raise the over-all public debt ratio to
about 9 percent in 1976 and 13 percent in 1980, when only about 3 percent of
total service payments would be due to IBRD. Considering the prospects for
future economic growth, even if at a diminished rate, Greece continues to be
creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GREECE
12.       Greece has to date received seven loans, totalling $133.9 million
(net of cancellations), of which $77.1 million was undisbursed as of February
28, 1974. Bank lending to Greece started in 1968 after disputes in connec-
tion with the country's pre-war external debt had been substantially settled.
There have been four loans to a development finance company (NIBID) tota'ling
$71.6 million (net of cancellations), two loans for education in 1970 and 1972
totalling $37.3 million, and a $25 million loan for a groundwater irrigation
project in 1971. Except for initial difficulties in implementing t'ie educa-
tion and groundwater projects, the execution of Bank financed projects has
generally been satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IFC investments as of December 31, 1973 and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
13.       IFC has made investments totalling US$15 million in five Greek com-
panies. An equity and loan investment of $600,000 was made in a fertilizer



- 4 -
factory in 1962 (sold in 1970); an equity investment of $720,000 in NIBID in
1965; loan and equity investment of $5 million in two cement companies in 1965
and 1966; and loan and equity investments totalling $8.7 million in an alumi-
num company in 1970 and 1972. IFC has been asked to help finance and is now
reviewing an agri-business project in Larisa for processing of tomatoes, and
at later stages, asparagus and peaches to be produced by individual farmers
in the area where irrigation is being developed by the Groundwater Development
Project assisted by the Bank (Loan 754-JR).
14.       Although Greece's economy is approaching a more advanced stage of
development, significant regional and sectoral disparities persist. Further-
more, the economy has to prepare itself to face increasing competition from
EEC imports, particularly in the industrial sector, where tariffs and other
protective barriers are being gradually reduced under the Association Agree-
ment with the European Economic Community.   Bank assistance to Greece aims at
supporting the modernization of institutions, introducing reform measures in
kev sectors and reducing regional disparities, particularly in agriculture,
goals which the Government seeks to promote. Bank lending to the National
Investment Bank for Industrial Development (NIBID) has been instrumental in
building up a sound long-term lending institution which is assisting Greek
industry in becoming more efficient and competitive. Two previous education
projects have already assisted the Government's efforts to reform and re-orient
the educational system. The first introduced the concept of multi-disciplinary
sub-professional training in fields such as engineering, agriculture, food
processing, business administration, and health. The second is expected to
assist in improving the quality of education and stimulating educational reform.
The only previous Bank loan in the agricultural sector was for the Groundwater
Development Project in the Thessaly Plain.
15.       Over the next few years, the limited amount of Bank lending is to
be concentrated primarily on assisting development in the agriculture and
education sectors. A third irrigation project is now under consideration.
A third education project is currently being prepared by the UNESCO/IBRD
Cooperative Program. Infrastructure projects for highways and sewerage are
also being considered for later years. The Bank is acting as executing agency
for a UNDP financed highway reconnaissance and feasibility studies project
which is expected to lead to a road construction project and support the Gov-
ernment's on-going effort to improve the national highway maintenance system.
A sewerage project currently being prepared by the Government would have a
strong emphasis on institution building and administrative improvement as well
as improving living conditions in towns outside the highly developed Athens
area.
PART III - ACRICULTURE IN GREECE
16.       Agriculture continues to play a central role in the Greek economy.
About 3.4 million ha are cultivated, with about 20 percent irrigated and an
additional 20 percent suitable for irrigation. A majority of the land is



- 5 -
devoted to traditional production of cereals:, mainly wheat and barley, al-
though in recent years there has been a trend toward higher value cash crops.
Cotton, tobacco, fruits and vegetables are the main agricultural exports.
Agricultural imports exceed agricultural exports in value by about 50 per-
cent. The most important imports are beef, mutton, milk and feed grains.
17.       Agriculture accounts for employment of about 40 percent of the
country's economically active population of 3.3 million. It generates about
45 percent of all exports, provides important quantities of raw materials to
industrial enterprises, and contributes about 20 percent to GDP (compared to
about 25 percent in 1960).
18.       The growth of the agricultural sector has consistently lagged be-
hind the rest of the economy during the past five years. Although the volume
of production has been increasing, there has been a very small increase in
value added in the past three years mainly because of the increase in produc-
tion costs. While real GDP rose by more than eight percent per annum overall
since 1968, agricultural production increased only three percent per annum.
Net growth declined to zero in 1973. Per capita income in the agricultural
sector is only 40 percent as high as in the economy as a whole, and less than
30 percent as great as the rest of the economy excluding agriculture; and the
disparity is growing. The Government has encouraged agricultural production
for many years through price support, input subsidies and other measures.
;9.       Four main constraints hinder growth of the sector:    (1) Water for
irrigation is scarce and potential resources are not being developed rapidly
due to the high cost of water exploitation.    The total area under irrigation
is less than 0.3 million ha which represents half of the potential irrigable
land; the increase in the irrigated area has averaged 30,000 ha or about 4.5
percent per annum.   (2) Small and fragmented farm holdings resulting from a
limited area of arable land and laws of inheritance form a structural obstacle.
Average holdings are 3.3 ha and consist of 8 or more parcels of land. (3)
The labor situation is anomalous. Hired labor employed in agriculture is
scarce while there is underemploymennt among farm families. This reduces
the savings and the use of improved technologies and farm inputs. (4) Ex-
tension services provided for the sector have not been adequate.
20.       Irrigation is one of the chief means of agricultural growth as it
enables diversification, yield improvement, and consolidation of fragmented
farm holdings which is compulsory in irrigated areas. Government has been
giving priority to irrigation expansion in its development programs, with
about 90 percent of public sector expenditure on agriculture during 1968-72
going to irrigation, drainage, reclamation and flood protection schemes.
However, progress has been slow in relation to investments due largely to
scattered investment and inadequate project preparation and implementation
leading to long gestation periods.
21.       Government agricultural policy has been, and continues to be, to
encouirage production of feedgrains, fodder crops, livestock products and
sugar for import substitution; and to promote production of crops with better



- 6 -
export prospects such as cotton, fruits and vegetables. Due to Greece's as-
sociate membership in EEC, which gives its products access to the Common
Market, the export production policy has been quite successful, but expansion
and better utilization of irrigation facilities need to be accelerated if
similar success is to be realized in import substitution.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project is designed to provide irrigation and drainage
facilitie; to about 23,600 ha in two areas of Macedonia, which are among the
least developed in the country. A loan and project summary is attached as
Annex III, together with two maps of the sub-project areas. A report entitled
"Appraisal of Nestos a-d Yavrnitsa Irrigation Project, Greece" (308a-GR), dated
April 17, 1974, is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
23.       The project is based on engineering studies carried out by Creek
consultants for the Ministry of Public Works, and on agro-economic and soils
surveys prepared by the Land Reclamation Service of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture. The FAO-IBRD Cooperative Program assisted in identification and prep-
aration. The project was originally appraised in October-November 1972 and,
after delays resulting from events described in paragraph 30 below, was re-
appraised in October 1973. Negotiations were held in March 1974. The Greek
delegation was headed by Mr. Petros Papadakis, Director General of the
Ministry of Coordination and Planning.
24.       The proposed project would provide irrigation and improved drainage
for about 23,600 net ha in two sub-project areas: Nestos (8,200 ha) is part
of a large development in the delta of the Nestos River, which divides the
Provinces of Macedonia and Thrace, about 200 km east of Thessaloniki, and
Yannitsa (15,400 ha) which is a former lake located about 40 km west of
Thessaloniki.
25.       The areas for the proposed project are primarily agricultural areas
cultivated by small landowners with limited opportunities for alternative
employment. The per capita income of farmers in the project areas are only
about one-third the level of farmers elsewhere in the country. In the Nestos
sub-proiect between one-fifth and one-quarter of the farmers belong to the
Turkish-speaking Moslem minority. The project aims to double net income in
one sub-project area (Nestos) and triple income in the sub-project location
with the lower income (Yannitsa). It is designed to remove the major con-
straints to agricultural growth by providing improved irrigation and drainage
facilities, consolidation of fragmented farm holdings, employment for family
labor, and improved extension services. It would also lead to an expansion of
exports and substitution of imports. Specifically the project would comprise:
(a)  construction of about 140 km of main and 220 km of secondary
concrete-lined irrigation canals and structures and distribu-
tion pipelines;



- 7 -
(b)  construction of drainage channels, to connect existing gravity
main drains, and of drainage pumping stations in water logged
areas;
(c) construction of farm access roads;
(d) installation of an electrical network within the project area
to provide power for irrigation pumps;
(e) supply and installation of electrical pumps for sprinkler
irrigation;
(f) supply of portable sprinkler equipment, and
(g) supply of operation and maintenance equipment.
26.       The project would also provide for the consolidation of land hold-
ings and for consultant services. All project works would be completed in
five years with construction beginning in 1975.
27.       The Nestos sub-project would complete development of the Nestos
River delta. Although the Nestos River originates in Bulgaria, water from
the catchment area in Greece alone would be sufficient for irrigation of this
subproject. A multi-purpose dam is in the detailed design stage which will
further increase water availability within Greece, the only downstream ripar-
ian. The Government of Bulgaria was informed of the project and raised no
objection. A diversion weir and flood protection dikes have already been
constructed, and most of the western portion, and upper third of the eastern
delta, have been provided with irrigation and drainage facilities. About
2,700 families live in the area, the average holding is about 2.5 ha, and
many are fragmented. Land consolidation would be required under the proj-
ect. About 20 percent of the area is public land, which would be used to
settle landless farmers, and to compensate farmers for land used for project
structures.
28.       The Yannitsa sub-project area is the former Lake Yannitsa, which
was drained prior to World War II and began being developed in 1950. Initial-
ly a portion of the sub-project area (about 15 percent) will draw water from
the Axios River, most of whose watershed is in Yugoslavia. The rest of the
area will be served bv water from the Aliakmon River whose watershed is
entirely in Greece. Upon completion of. a canal linking the Axios and
Alinkmon River, all of the sub-project area will be served by the Aliakmon
River. The Government of Yugoslavia was informed of the irrigation develop-
ment of the Axios basin and has expressed no objection. The proposed project
would essentially complete development of irrigation and drainage facilities
in the region. The reclaimed lakebed is owned by about 14,800 landowners,
with holdings of only about 1 ha each. To create a viable farm size of about
2 ha, about one-third of the landowners cultivate land rented from the other
two-thirds. The latter work as farmers outside the project area or as labor-
ers. As the land was only recently reclaimed, fragmentation of holdings is
not a problem.



- 8 -
29.       Both sub-project areas are adequately served by research and agri-
cultural credit services. The Agricultural Bank of Greece administers several
Government subsidy programs for the agricultural sector. The interest on
short-term loans varies between 4 percent and 5 percent, for medium- and long-
term loans about half as much. No change in these interest rates is envisaged
under the proposed loan since the subsidies, which cover the entire country,
are particularly justified in the project area because the farmers are poor.
In any event the Bank would not participate in. providing credit under the
project.
Organization and Management
30.       Project planning, design, and construction of civil works would be
done by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) with assistance in the design
sta,e from consultants.   Supervision would be entrusted to two project of-
fices to be established within the PiW specifically for the two subproject
areas. Land consolidation soil surveys, land reclamation and on-farm works
would be carried out by the Land Reclamation Service (LRS) of the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Public Power Corporation (PPC) would install an electrical
distribution system to supply power for the irrigation pumps. To ensure proper
coordination among the project executing agencies, a steering committee would
be established in Athens under the chairmanship of the Director of Planning
and Public Investments of the Ministry of Coordination and Planning. Two
project coordinating committees would also be created, one in each subproject
area to coordinate the work of the local branches of the participating agencies.
Upon completion MPW would continue to operate and maintain the main irrigation
canals and drainage channels in both sub-projects, as well as the Schena pump-
ing station in Yannitsa. All other project works would be operated, maintained,
and administered by the local water users' organization, under the overall
supervision and control of LRS.
Project Costs
31.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be $72.7 million.
The price contingency allowance takes into account the expected general in-
crease in prices growing out of the increase in petroleum prices. The pro-
posed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost, estimated at $30 million,
including civil works, equipment, consultant services and physical and price
contingencies. The balance of project costs ($42.7 million) together with
interest during construction and commitment charges ($6.5 million) would be
financed through the Government budget for the Ministry of Public Works and
Public Power Corporation. The Bank loan would be for a period of 20 years,
including five and one-half years of grace.
32.      IUnder the project the full operation and maintenance costs (O&M) of
the irrigation and drainage works, and a portion of the investment cost, would
be recovered from project beneficiaries. The proposed total charges have been
estimated at $90/ha/annum in Nestos and $100/ha/annum in Yannitsa and would be
in line with charges currently applied under the Groundwater Irrigation
Prolect (754-GR). Farmers in the project area are accustomed to paying for



-9-
O&M, but in December 1972, the Government enacted legislation exempting farm-
ers from payment for the capital costs of land improvement projects. This
conflicted with the agreement reached during negotiations of the Groundwater
Project that farmers would pay Drachmas 1000 ($33.33)/ha/annum toward recovery
of the capital costs. Following discussions between the Bank and the Govern-
ment in September 1973, a new arrangement was agreed upon whereby beneficiaries
would pay a fixed sum of Dr. 500 ($16.67)/ha,/annum towards repayment of in-
vestment costs of that project. A similar charge, Dr. 600 ($20)/ha/annum (about
27% of O&UT costs), is included in the above charges of $90 and $100 respect-
ively, which will apply in the proposed project (Section 4.03 Loan Agreement).
The amount, to be revised and collected annually would be paid into a separate
central account and would at no time be equivalent to less than 27 percent
of O&M costs. IJnder this formula, approximately 23 percent of investment
costs (measured by discounting over 50 years at 10 percent) will be recovered,
and payments from the typical farm's incremental income are expected to be
20 percent and 16 percent in Nestos and Yannitsa respectively.
Production and Marketing
33.       The project would permit desirable changes to take place in cropping
patterns, cropping intensity and production. The net cropped area would in-
crease by about 3,0000 ha as a result of improved cropping intensity -- from
88 percent without the project to 112 percent with the project due to partial
double cropping. The current level of farming is high in the project areas,
although incomes are low due to the small size of farms and irrigation and
drainage constraints. Improved inputs, machines, and credit facilities are
widely used. Incremental production would result primarily from the increase
in the cropped area, diversification, improved irrigation and drainage and
increased market opportunities. Production of high value crops such as sugar
beets, maize, cotton, fruits and vegetables, fodder crops, and nuts would
double or triple in most instances, replacing traditional crops such as wheat
and barley. Most of the products would be marketed or processed locally.
Export crops would be tobacco, cotton, peaches and some vegetables.
Disbursement and Procurement
34.       The proposed Bank loan of $30 million would be disbursed over four
years. It would finance: (i) 33 percent of total civil works contracts (re-
presenting the estimated foreign exchange component), (ii) the CIF cost of
imported equipment or 90 percent of the ex-factory cost (the remaining 10
percent covers taxes which are not financed by the Bank) of locally-produced
equipment should local bidders be successful under international competitive
bidding. It is expected that only a part of the equipment will be produced
locally; and (iii) the foreign exchange cost of consultant services.
35.       All civil works (with the exception of the electrical network which
will not be financed by the Bank) and equipment totalling $45.2 million ex-
cluding contingencies, would be tendered on the basis of international compe-
tition in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works
would be carried out under not more than three contracts of about $10-12 mil-
lion each to attract sufficient competition. Equipment supply contracts would



- 10 -
consist of irrigation regulators, pumping units for sprinkler irrigation, and
portable sprinkler equipment, pumping equipment for drainage, transformers,
and operation and maintenance equipment. Bidding for equipment would allow
local manufacturers a 15 percent preference margin or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is lower. Small items of less than $10,000 each (and not
exceeding $400,000 in aggregate) would be procured through regular government
procedures. The electrical network estimated at $1.6 million would be cons-
tructed by PPC through local contracts, as part of its overall development
program.
Consultant Services
36.       The Ministry of Public Works would engage consultants to help pre-
pare final designs of the project works, revise and redesign the tertiary ir-
rigation systems, prepare equipment specifications and help evaluate bids.
Economic Justification
37.      'At full development (about 1982), the annual gross value of production
of the project area (about 23,600 net ha) at economic prices would be $27 mil-
lion equivalent, more than twice the expected value without the project. After
deduction of production costs, the incremental value of annual production at
economic prices would be $10.2 million equivalent.
38.       The economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 13.7
percent. Sensitivity tests made with adverse assumptions of costs, prices
and outputs indicate that the rate of return is not likely to fall below 10
percent for either of the subprojects.
39.       The project would improve the balance of payments through increased
exports of all incremental production of tobacco and cotton as well as of cer-
tain vegetables and peaches, and through import substitution of maize (after
allowing for a reduction in winter cereal production), sugar, hazelnuts, and
groundnuts. At full development in 1982, estimated incremental gross foreign
exchange earnings could be almost $8 million/annum and annual foreign exchange
savings could approach $7 million.
40.       The project would increase annual labor requirements by about 3,300
man years. This would be met by doubling the use of hired labor, and the bal-
ance by increasing presently underemployed family labor by about 50 percent.
The average net income of farm families would also more than double in the
Nestos area and more than triple in the Yannitsa area as a result of the proj-
ect, which makes a major contribution to improving the lot of the particularly
poor farm population in the project area, and would bring their income closer
to the national level.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Hellenic Republic and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreement conforms generally to the normal pattern for loans for irrigation
projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
43.       in formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed loan remains fully justified.
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 711 - First Education Project; $13.8 million Loan of November 5, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Civil works contractors have been prequalified on international
basis. Bids were called several times and contracts have been awarded and
signed in late July 1973. Bids for furniture took place in October 1973,
but rebidding will be necessary because of the limited number of bidders
who submitted ofifers due to the complex requirements of the original tenders.
Despite these delays, the project is expected, based on its present status,
to be completed by the Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Loan No. 754 - Groundwater Development Project (Irrigation): US$25 million
loan of June 21, 1971. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project has had a slow start because of de-
lavs in awarding contracts; changes in designation of project areas prompted
bv the on-going consultants' study; and generally poor planning. Although
planning is still weak, satisfactory progress is now made with drilling opera-
tions and disbursements are picking up. A controversy between the Government
and the Bank over farmers' contributions toward recovery of the capital costs
of the project has been resolved satisfactorily (see paragraph 30). The proj-
ect is now exrected to be completed by the Closing Date.
Loan 859 - Second Education Project: $23.5 million loan of October 2, 1972;
Closing Date: July 31, 1977.
The Loan was declared effective on March 30, 1973. Key personnel
for the Central Prolect Unit has been appointed and the Unit is operating.
Most of the technical services units of the participating agencies have
been staffed and are also in operation. Architectural consultants have
been selected for most of the project components. Draft bidding documents
are now being finalized for civil works.
Loan 665 - Second NIBID Project: $20.0 million loan of April 15, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 791 - Third NIBID Project: $25.0 million loan of December 6, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The Second Loan has almost fullv been disbursed. The Third Loan
has been almost fullv committed. $11.8 million remain to be disbursed as of
September 30, 1973.
Loan 945 - Fourth NIBID Project: $15.0 million loan of November 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This loan has been declared effective on March 28, 1974.
