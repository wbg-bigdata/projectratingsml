            IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in
                                         independent evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
    To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to ad apt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the National Social
Action Project and the Food Price Crisis Response Development Policy Grant in the
Republic of Sierra Leone.

A Credit (IDA 37480) for the National Social Action Project was approved on April 24,
2003 for an amount of $35.0 million equivalent. The project closed on December 31,
2010, two years after the scheduled closure date, in order to implement a cash-for-work
program responding to Sierra Leone‘s food price crisis. The project was restructured on
August, 18, 2008, with an amendment of the project‘s objectives to accommodate the
cash-for-work program and was accompanied by a grant of $4.0 million from the Food
Crisis Response Trust Fund (TF92671). On November 12, 2009, a further $4 million was
provided comprising $3.0 million from the same Trust Fund and $1.0 million from the
Food Price Crisis Multi-Donor Trust Fund (TF95661) to scale-up the cash-for-work
program.

The Food Price Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (TF-92619) was a
development policy grant of $3.0 million. It was approved on August 6, 2008 and closed
as scheduled on June 30, 2009. The grant was disbursed as a one-time budget transfer on
August 27, 2008.

The report presents findings from the two operations based on review of the project and
program documents, the Implementation Completion and Results Reports, aides
memoire, supervision reports, and other relevant material. A mission to Sierra Leone was
undertaken by Keith Oblitas (consultant) from end January to early February, 2012,
during which interviews were conducted with government officials, Bank staff in
Washington and Sierra Leone, development agencies, beneficiaries and other involved
persons.

The report aims, first, to serve an accountability purpose by evaluating whether the
operations achieved their intended outcomes. Second, the report draws lessons to inform
future social funds and emergency budget transfers, in particular the lessons from the
food price crisis. Third, the assessment also contributed to the forthcoming IEG
evaluation of the World Bank Group‘s response to the global food crisis.

Following standard IEG procedures, the government of Sierra Leone was invited to
comment on the draft PPAR, however no comments were received.

Summary
This Project Performance Assessment Report reviews the experience and lessons from
two operations in Sierra Leone - the National Social Action Project (2003-1 0), and the
Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (2008-09). The Social Action Project
supported recovery from a civil war, and both operations supported mitigation of the
impacts of the 2007-2008 food price crisis on welfare.

In 2002-2003, when the Social Action Project was being prepared, Sierra Leone was the
poorest country in the world. It had just emerged from a devastating ten-year civil war;
seventy-six percent of the population had incomes below $2.00 per capita per day; much
of its social and economic infrastructure had been destroyed, especially in rural areas; and
basic services such as primary education and health care were dysfunctional or non-
existent. The human costs of the war were major. Some 20,000 of Sierra Leone's five
million people had been killed and many more had been maimed or sexually abused.
Among the most vulnerable were the poor, women, orphans, and unemployed youths.
Since the war, economic activity in Sierra Leone has significantly recovered, improving
welfare, but development has been uneven. As recently as 2009, the mortality rate for
children under five years old was 192 per 1,000 births.

This situation has presented many challenges. First, there is a chronic need to restore and
develop services providing for basic needs such as health and education. Second,
economic growth needs to continue apace and be socially inclusive, to enable families to
emerge from the pervasive poverty of the past. Third, tensions between the former rival
factions of the civil war need to give way to a socially cohesive society. More recently, as
if these challenges were not enough, a fourth challenge arose stemming from the steep
rise in the prices of internationally traded food commodities in 2007-2008. Due to this
"food price crisis", the price of rice - Sierra Leone's dominant food staple - increased,
especially in urban areas, by 50-100 percent. The hike in prices significantly increased
the cost of living of an already impoverished population.

National Social Action Project

The National Social Action Project, financed through an International Development
Association (IDA) Grant of$35 million equivalent, was a social fund assisting
communities to construct social infrastructure following a community-driven
development approach. The project's original objectives were to "assist war affected
communities to restore infrastructure and services and build local capacity for collective
action," with the priority to areas "not previously serviced by the government, newly
accessible areas (those which were under rebel control until January 2002), and the most
vulnerable population groups within those areas." In 2008, in response to the food price
crisis, the objectives were expanded to include assistance to "vulnerable households to
access temporary employment opportunities." To achieve this objective, an additional
component was added, a "cash-for-work" program, accompanied by two provisions of
additional financing of $4 million each. Thus, in essence, the restructured project had
three objectives: the two original objectives (restoration of infrastructure and services,
and building the capacities of local communities for collective action) and the additional
objective to assist vulnerable households to access temporary employment.
                                              xii


Under the community-driven development program, communities chose the social
infrastructure that best corresponded to their needs. They usually chose primary schools
or health clinics, which represented about one-third each ofthe sub-projects. Various
other investments, such as a village community hall or market, made up the balance.
Each community worked collectively to build and manage the facilities. Decision making
and implementation processes were formulated to promote participation of the
community as a whole, and these processes appear to have been influential. A survey
found that 96 percent of men and 87 percent of women had contributed to construction,
mostly in the form of labor. Of the 600 community sub-projects commenced under the
project, 589 were completed and over 90 percent of these were functional two years later.

Assessment of the benefits from the schools and clinics is complicated by possible
attribution problems due to the influence of similar facilities constructed under the
concurrent Bank-financed health and education projects. The number of children enrolled
in the project's primary schools increased by 27 percent overall (33 percent for girls, 23
percent for boys). About two-thirds of patients walked to a medical center before the
project, whereas after the clinic was operational. nearly all users walked. And at maternal
health clinics, 29 percent of pregnant women made two or more antenatal visits after the
clinic was established compared with 17 percent beforehand. Staffmg also improved;
nearly doubling for health workers and increasing by one-third for teachers.

The cash-for-work program primarily reached youths aged 15-35 (75 percent of
beneficiaries), many of whom were former combatants with little or no education and no
job or income, and women (30 percent).The design and implementation both had
shortcomings, such as deficient selection of target groups, limited involvement of
communities, and limited flexibility in choice of activities that could be suitable for
women. It only partly reached the poorest amongst targeted groups, as selection of
individual participants did not follow a standardized procedure and was sometimes
influenced by vested interests. Contractors were provided too much power relative to
communities, were often late in paying beneficiaries, and could produce poor quality
works.

The outcome ofthe project under its original objectives was satisfactory. Its objectives
and design were substantially relevant, it substantially achieved both its objectives and,
with relatively low overhead costs for a community-driven development project (about
10 percent), it was efficient in use of resources. Due to the modest achievement of the
additional objective to provide vulnerable households access to temporary work
opportunities and modest efficiency in achieving it, the outcome under the revised
objectives (the two original objectives and this additional objective) was moderately
satisfactory. However, as the majority of the project's resources were disbursed before
the restructuring, the overall project outcome is rated satisfactory. The main risk to
development outcome is the possibility that Government will fall short in financing the
supplies and staffmg to enable continued operation of the clinics and schools - a situation
that arose during the early part of the project period, which slowed implementation.
Counteracting this is, first, the political pressures to finance the operating costs of schools

 iron ore mine begins exploitation. This would ease government's fiscal situation and
 make public expenditures more affordable. Risk to development outcome is moderate.

  The Bank's performance was satisfactory. It provided technical assistance on the highly
  participatory processes brought in by the project. The cash-for-work program was
· prepared and implemented remarkably quickly as befitting an emergency project, and
  while it had a number of problems, these were identified during its two-year
  implementation period and adjustments made for a follow-on youth employment project.
  Government championed the project, and effectively backstopped the National
  Commission for Social Action and its coordination with other government agencies, but
  the shortfall in counterpart funding, albeit at a time when all sectors were affected by
  critical fiscal constraints, reduces Government performance to moderately satisfactory.
  The Commission was an effective implementer and coordinator of the community driven
  development approach. This was new to Sierra Leone, was national in scale, and required
  major training for staff in the relevant technical ministries and local councils. The
  Commission's performance was satisfactory, but taking account of the moderately
  satisfactory performance of the Government, overall Borrower performance was
  moderate! y satisfactory.

 Food Price Crisis Response Development Policy Grant

 The Food Price Crisis Response Development Policy Grant was a development policy
 operation of $3 million prepared on emergency basis to assist the Government in
 responding to the soaring international prices of food commodities during 2007-2008.
 The grant was provided shortly after international prices peaked in mid-2008. The
 operation's objective was to "support the Government's poverty reduction strategy in
 2008 by providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to partially compensate for the
 lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel imports. This
 support would help mitigate the impact of such price increases and contribute to
 continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups." For evaluation purposes the two
 intended outcomes were: (i) mitigating the impact of food price increases on consumer
 welfare; and (ii) contributing to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups.

 The objective of mitigating the impact ofthe food price increase on welfare was modestly
 achieved. Government reduced import tariffs on basic foodstuffs in an attempt to lower
 domestic prices. The most significant of these reductions was for rice, Sierra Leone's
 dominant food staple. The five percentage point reduction in rice import tariffs (from 15
 to 10 percent) is estimated to have reduced the import price for rice by about 6 percent.
 This is dwarfed by the 50 to 100 percent increases in domestic rice prices influenced by
 international markets. But the impact ofthe tariff reduction was much smaller. Based on
 a number of assumptions, without the tariff reduction, a doubling in the price of rice
 would have increased a "modest income" urban family's cost of living by about 7.5
 percent. With the tariff reduction, the increase would have been reduced by only one
 percent. This is not altogether surprising, as the initial tariff was not high and the
 reduction was even smaller. Yet, for these small reductions in the cost of living, the tariff
 reductions reduced revenues, straining the fiscal balance and the ability to finance social
 services.
                                             xiv


The objective of contributing to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups,
such as children and patients at health facilities, was reached in terms of the feeding
program's numerical targets. These ongoing institutional feeding programs· financed by
the government were at risk because ofthe sharp increase in the cost of food. Nearly
3,900 children in boarding schools and remand homes continued to be fed three times a
day as against a target of3,500 children; and 8,200 lactating mothers with children under
five and 12,700 patients at community hospitals or health centers received food three
times a day, as against targets of 5,300 and 12,800 respectively. The additional costs of
these programs as a result of the hike in food prices were approximately covered by the
fiscal space created by the Grant's $3 million budget support. There is no empirical
evidence on the quality of the feeding program or on its educational or health benefits.
For schools, donor agencies consider the main benefits to be greater ability of children to
concentrate; for health programs for young children, the benefits are in terms of improved
nutritional status. None of these were measured for the program, but the counterfactual
for this intervention would have been a cessation or sharp reduction in the institutional
feeding program. It is not known to what extent other sources of support might have
materialized had the program been cut. Efficacy of continuing the feeding program is
likely to have been substantial.

The Food Crisis Grant's outcome was moderately satisfactory. Its objectives met an
emergency need; the Grant was timely and supported the Government's budget at a time
of fiscal crisis; and feeding services were substantially maintained. However, it only
modestly achieved its objective to mitigate the impact of food price increases on
consumer welfare, in part due to deficiencies in the relevance of design. With the low
level of the rice tariff to begin with, its small reduction, and both of these in relation to
the very high increases in international prices, the likelihood of a significant impact on
welfare was small ex ante, but certain to lower revenue and available resources for
vulnerable groups. The risk to development outcome is significant, as Sierra Leone
remains highly vulnerable to future food price shocks. The Bank's performance was
moderately satisfactory. It responded rapidly to the food price crisis, and the
understanding with Government on maintaining social services enhanced the utility of the
grant. But the operation could have been designed in the broader context of the ·
effectiveness and costs of tariff reductions compared with the other actions government
was taking to reduce the impact of the food price increases. Government's performance
was satisfactory; notably, it was strongly committed to the operation, and its steering
committee ensured that the feeding program was fully funded.

Lessons

Two broader considerations have emerged from this review. First is the question of what
to do beyond a short-term emergency response to improve resilience to future shocks.
The Food Crisis Grant provided some measures for short-term relief to the food price
crisis and the components added to the National Social Action Project provided
temporary employment for the poor. A government campaign has been launched to
increase rice production and two strategy papers on food security have been prepared by
Government. These papers, however, have gaps and in most respects lack detail. In the
absence of a more comprehensive food security action plan and its implementation, there
                                             XV



would be little change in Sierra Leone's vulnerability to future surges in international
food prices.

Second, the government undertook other short-term mitigating actions in response to the
food crisis, ranging from export restrictions, agreements on price ceilings with rice
traders, monitoring of trader and retail prices, to a special deal with a shipper for a
consignment of rice imported at below market prices. The Food Crisis Grant and the
Social Action Project's cash-for-work program filled niches in the country's response,
but if the overall picture had been considered, this might have influenced the Food Crisis
Grant's design. Tariff reductions, with their resultant lower budgetary revenues, are an
expensive way to achieve reduced prices and, given the small impact on the cost of living
of the tariff reductions, Government's other actions are likely to have been just as
effective, or more effective, at lower cost.

The experiences of the two operations, particularly as concerns their role in the food price
crisis, yield the following main lessons:

   •   Attempts to lower food prices through reducing tariffs on imported
       foodstuffs have direct consequences on government revenues yet may have
       only marginal impact on consumer prices relative to the much larger impacts
       of international price changes. The impact of the tariff reductions on rice prices
       was small, and insignificant relative to the doubling of food prices influenced by
       international market forces. Sierra Leone took about 10 different actions to
       mitigate the impact of the price increases, which may have had greater impact on
       consumer prices than the tariff reductions.
   •   In a food emergency operation there may be a trade-off between a rapid,
       larger-scale response, at the cost of some reduction in quality, compared with
       a better prepared operation which is slower to mitigate the impacts of price
       increases. The cash-for-work program had an outcome less than its potential, but
       in responding to the emergency, speed was critical.
   •   A cash-for-work program needs clear criteria and processes that ensure
       objective selection of beneficiaries. Lack of such processes, and of community
       involvement in selection, reduced the program' s effectiveness at reaching the
       most vulnerable groups.
   •   High community participation helped the Social Action Project's
       communities to "own" their sub-projects and foster interest in maintaining
       their investment and operating the service. The project's community sub-
       projects were mostly effective in establishing community institutions,
       infrastructure and services; there are some indications that they might be
       sustained beyond the short term.

1. Background and Context
1.1      In 2002-2003, the time when the first of the two operations considered in this review
(the National Social Action Project) was being prepared, Sierra Leone was the poorest
country in the World. In 2003, 76 percent of the population had incomes below $2.00 per
capita per day, and 53 percent had per capita incomes of less than $1.25 per day. It was also
at the bottom of the Human Development Index. The country had just emerged from a
devastating ten year civil war affecting all of the nation‘s districts. Much of the country‘s
social and economic infrastructure (schools, health clinics, roads, markets and other
facilities) had been destroyed or seriously damaged, especially in rural areas, and the
corresponding services were dysfunctional or non-existent. The human costs of the war were
major. Some 20,000 of Sierra Leone‘s 5 million people had been killed and many more had
been maimed. Post-traumatic stress, women and children who had been sexually abused, and
children who had lost their parents, were ubiquitous. Other groups that were vulnerable were
the poor, women, and unemployed ―youths‖ (defined as those between 15 and 35 years old),
including the former combatants, a potential source of unrest.

1.2      By 2009, gross national income per capita was $340, relatively better than in 2003 but
among the 10 countries in the world with the lowest per capita incomes. Sierra Leone‘s social
statistics told the same story. In 2008, 28 percent of children under five years old were
malnourished, life expectancy at birth was 48 years and child mortality was 192 per 1000
children.1

1.3     Sierra Leone‘s economy has significantly revived since the civil war. The turnaround
in economic activity since the end of conflict reflects a catch-up effect, mainly driven by
reconstruction, a substantial surge of aid flows (including debt relief), and improved
macroeconomic policies undertaken by the authorities starting from 2002. GDP growth
averaged 10.2 percent per annum between 2002 and 2007. It then slowed to about 5 to 6
percent per annum from 2008 to 2012, influenced by the decline in growth rates in the global
economy and a sharp reduction in the prices of the country‘s mineral exports. The rural
sector has contributed to GDP growth but does not appear to have been a major driver, either
as a significant source of additional labor for the urban sector, or as a lead source of growth
through its own development. The percentage of Sierra Leone‘s population that is rural fell
from 67 percent in 1990 to 62 percent in 2010–not a major reduction for a period of two
decades. Agriculture‘s share of GDP fell from 58 percent in 2000 to 49 percent in 2010. Still,
with population increasing by about 3.5 percent per annum from 2000 to 2010, coupled with
some movement from rural to urban areas, the urban population doubled from 1 million in
1990 (33 percent of the country‘s total population) to 2 million in 2010 (38 percent).

1.4     Looking ahead, there are prospects for substantial revenues from new iron ore mines
that are beginning to be exploited. The country will have the opportunity to use its increasing
wealth to progressively improve incomes and social services, especially for the poor, and to
invest in agricultural services and related infrastructure. There is a long way to go, however.

The per capita income is only one-third of the average for Sub-Saharan Africa, social welfare
statistics illustrate widespread deprivation, and the 2007-2008 ―Global Food Price Crisis‖
found the country highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices of food
commodities.

1.5    Rice is Sierra Leone‘s primary food staple. Other staples such as cassava, sweet
potatoes, pulses, and palm oil are much smaller presences in diets and are mainly produced
domestically. By contrast, one third of rice consumption is imported making the country
vulnerable to changes in international prices.

1.6     In 2007/2008, international rice prices doubled, increasing by about 140 percent from
January to April 2008. This had already been preceded by a significant climb in rice prices in
earlier years (Figure 1). The prices of other basic commodities, such as other cereals,
petroleum, and fertilizer also rose, though not as much as rice (Annex B, Figure B1). The
hike in international prices affected domestic rice prices for urban consumers more than
consumers in rural areas.2 In urban and peri-urban areas rice prices typically increased by
between 50 to 100 percent, the larger increases tending to be where the local market was
particularly exposed to import prices, while those inland agricultural areas that were largely
self-sufficient in rice were only marginally affected.

1.7     The Food Price Crisis generated broad ranging short-term efforts by Government to
mitigate its impact. The government reduced tariffs on rice, wheat, wheat flour, sugar, and
petroleum. Other measures taken included: requests to rice importers and wholesalers to
moderate their price increases; monitoring against hoarding and monopolies; banning rice
exports and closing border posts with neighboring countries; distributing improved rice seed;
and efforts to expand social safety net programs. Assistance was also requested from
development agencies working in Sierra Leone which to the extent feasible in a short-term
context, stepped up their programs. Aid was primarily for social safety net programs in
health, education, feeding, youth employment, and intensified agricultural extension. Several
donors also provided budget support. Agencies supporting welfare activities included the
World Bank, African Development Bank, United Nations Development Program, European
Community, Department for International Development (UK), World Food Program,
GTZ/KFW (German aid), United Nations Children‘s Fund, Islamic Development Bank, Irish
Aid, JICA (Japanese development aid) and the nongovernmental organization (NGO)
community. Budget support was provided by the World Bank, African Development Bank,
Department for International Development, and the European Community.

  Trends in the consumer price indices suggest a segmentation of the rice market between urban and rural areas
in their susceptibility to fluctuation in international prices. The trend in the consumer price index for food in
Freetown, which was broadly similar to the general price index until 2006, increased faster than the general
index from 2007, while national data on the food and general price indices showed no significant
differentiation. Such apparent trends may, however, understate or misrepresent the situation at local levels.
First, the consumer price index for food only partly relates to the specific prices for rice. Second, there are
substantial differences between market prices depending on location, even between adjacent localities.

1.8      The World Bank‘s involvement in the food crisis response in Sierra Leone was
primarily through the two operations under review in this PPAR, which between them
contributed both to fiscal support and the social safety net. The National Social Action
Project, hereafter referred to as the ―Social Action Project‖ (FY03, $35 million plus $8
million additional financing) was a social fund to assist village communities to implement
and manage small investments for the common good. It was launched as one of several
projects following the civil war–among them the Health Sector Reconstruction and
Development Project ($20 million) and the Rehabilitation of Basic Education Project ($20
million), also approved in FY03 (Table 1). Most investments of the Social Action Project
were for social infrastructure, the most popular being primary schools and small health
clinics, but a component for cash-for-work targeted to youths was added in 2008 to mitigate
the impact of the food crisis. The Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (FY08,
$3 million), termed in this report ―Food Crisis Grant, was a budget transfer to Government
disbursed in one tranche. This was to provide emergency financial assistance to partially
compensate in the short-term for the reduced revenues resulting from lowering tariffs on food
imports, thereby: (i) helping to mitigate the impact of food price increases on consumer
welfare; and (ii) facilitating continued provision of food as part of education and health
services.

1.9    Thus, the experiences under the Social Action Project and the Food Crisis Response
Grant potentially provide between them a number of lessons for future community driven
development programs, for food security in a vulnerable state, for how to enhance the
development impact of an emergency budget support operation, and for reducing poverty.
The projects also provide contrasts between the relative advantages and disadvantages of two
commonly applied approaches and lending instruments for a food price crisis. On the one
hand, food import tariff reductions and the budget transfer instrument of a Development
Policy Grant as used under the Food Crisis Grant operation, which can be applied with little
                                              4


preparation. And on the other hand, the addition of an emergency component to an
investment operation, as done for the cash-for-work program added to the Social Action
Project. This provided more directly targeted relief measures, but with speed and quality of
implementation limited by the implementation capacity of the institutions involved. It also
posed a trade-off between the speed of implementation and possible loss in quality of the
program.

1.10 The Bank was the sole financial partner with Government for both the Social Action
Project and Food Crisis Grant, and there were no formally established links between the
Bank and other donors. However, the two projects were prepared and implemented within a
web of other projects and involved donor agencies in the same sectors, and sometimes with
closely similar activities. Specifically, the Health Sector Reconstruction and Development
Project and the Rehabilitation of Basic Education Project ran concurrently with the Social
Action Project and were in the same sectors as most of its community sub-projects. The
health and education projects were not directly linked with the Social Action Project,
although the general strengthening of these two sectors would likely have created a stronger
base for the Government‘s responsibilities under the project–provision of teachers, nurses,
drugs and materials.

1.11 There are five other projects with some relevance to the National Social Action
Project (Table 1). The Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (FY99, $38
million), preceded the project and was closed two months after the Social Action Project‘s
approval. It launched community level projects, but involved little community participation,
the essence of the Social Action Project. It also strengthened the implementing agency – the
National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, which was the
predecessor of the National Committee for Social Action (NaCSA), the implementing agency
for the Social Action Project. The Youth Employment Support Project (FY10, $20 million)
continues the Social Action Project‘s Cash-for-Work Program. The Decentralized Services
Delivery Project (FY10, $20 million) is strengthening the capacity of Local Councils–a
process to which the Social Action Project had contributed to through the councils‘
involvement in project implementation. And there are two projects supporting rural
development: the Rural and Private Sector Development Project (FY07, $30 million) focuses
on development of agricultural marketing chains and includes support to improve agricultural
technologies, and the Infrastructure Development Project (FY06, $55 million) includes
development of rural roads.

1.12 There have been no follow-on operations to the Food Crisis Grant, although
development of agricultural marketing and rural roads will support agricultural growth. If the
need for rice imports were to fall, Sierra Leone‘s vulnerability to future food price shocks
would be reduced. Government-financed development programs are also relevant. Most
notable is the extensive group of actions that Government took to mitigate the food price
crisis, which puts the role of the Food Crisis Grant in a contributory rather than primary
perspective. The Bank‘s lending program since the close of that operation in 2009 contains
little in the way of comprehensive measures to reduce Sierra Leone‘s vulnerability to future
food crises, although a number of projects contribute toward this.3

1.13 A caveat is in order regarding data sources. Statistical capacity, while improving, is
limited, and development related data are both scarce and of varying quality. Official
statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Bank and other sources also
vary in quality due to their substantial reliance on Sierra Leone source data. The analysis in
this report has, thus, supplemented available empirical information with use of proxy
information, interviews with stakeholders from government, civil society and beneficiaries,
and reference to the literature. These sources are typically qualitative rather than quantitative,
and often limited to only a few observations that might not be representative of the situation
as a whole. One technique has been to triangulate between such sources for common ground
with which to assess general directions and magnitudes. Situations where data are
particularly limiting are highlighted in the section concerned; the design and limitations of
the surveys used are discussed in Annex C.

2. National Social Action Project
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
OBJECTIVES

2.1     The original objectives of the Social Action Project, as articulated in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD), were to: ―Assist war affected communities to restore
infrastructure and services and build local capacity for collective action. Priority would be
3
    In marketing, rural roads, health, and youth employment (Table 1).
                                                            6


given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly accessible areas (those
which were under rebel control until January 2002), and the most vulnerable population
groups within those areas‖ (World Bank 2003).

2.2     The objectives expressed in the Credit Agreement are consistent with the PAD
version, but focused on the contribution of community-driven development on longer-term
poverty-reduction objectives: ―to assist the borrower in its efforts to generate sustained
poverty reduction by financing and supporting community driven development initiatives,
focusing on newly accessible areas and the vulnerable people within these areas.‖ In January
2008, the project underwent a second-level ―adaptive‘ restructuring to align the two
statements of objectives, modifying the Credit Agreement to align with the objectives in the
PAD. The objectives expressed in the PAD will be used in this evaluation as its original
objectives, but with some clarification regarding the target groups in the second sentence (see
below).

2.3     A third objective was added in August 2008 (the original closing year) so as to play a
role in mitigating the adverse effects of the 2007/08 food price crisis. The revised objectives,
accompanied by a two year extension of the project period, were: "To assist war affected or
otherwise vulnerable communities to restore infrastructure and services, build local capacity
for collective action and assist vulnerable households to access temporary employment
opportunities, with priority given to areas not previously serviced by the government, newly
accessible areas (those which were under rebel control until January 2002), food insecure
areas, and the most vulnerable population groups within those areas"4 (World Bank 2008).
There were no further modifications during approval of the second Additional Financing in
2010.

2.4     Thus, the two original project objectives and the third one added in response to the
food crisis can be broken down to its three primary intended outcomes:

          Restoration of infrastructure and services.
          Building the capacities of local communities for collective action.
          Assisting vulnerable households to access temporary employment.

2.5      A clarification is needed regarding the interpretation of the target population. First, as
concerns classification of affected areas: other than in the wording of the objectives, the PAD
makes no references at all to any specific geographic area. Rather, throughout the PAD,
targeting is oriented to types of communities and households, the common denominators
being the degree of poverty and deleterious impacts of the war. Second is the ubiquitous
nature of the ―war affected‖. Persons interviewed by the IEG mission emphasized that all
districts in Sierra Leone were war affected. Hence, war-devastated communities could be
found throughout the country.5 Further, specifically for the project‘s communities, qualitative
references suggest that the project did indeed primarily benefit the war-affected. The Social

Action Project‘s 2010 Beneficiary Assessment commented ―The overwhelming majority of
these projects were implemented in communities that had lost such facilities and services as a
result of the war.‖6 In fact, in the project‘s selection process, only communities that had
damaged or destroyed infrastructure were considered, thereby practically assuring that the
project, while geographically dispersed, went to the war-affected. Hence, vulnerability
characteristics such as poverty and war damage rather than geographic situations will be used
in this evaluation.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES

2.6     The project‘s original objectives were responsive to Sierra Leone‘s major challenge
of addressing the destitution and divisions left by the civil war. The Bank‘s ―Transitional
Support Strategy‖ of March, 2002, the policy current at the time of project preparation and
which was prepared just after the formal cessation of hostilities, emphasized improving
access of the poor to basic services such as health and education, and for improving the
welfare of the most vulnerable victims of the war–the very poor, landless, amputees, war
widows, displaced persons, orphans and sexually abused women. The policy document at
project completion - the March, 2010 Country Assistance Strategy – articulated Sierra
Leone‘s security issues in greater detail, also commenting that improved incomes and social
welfare would be a stabilizing influence for civil society. There was also the Second Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (June 2009), more commonly known as the ―Agenda for Change‖.
This is largely consistent with the earlier strategy documents, but emphasizes that
communities should be more involved in management of village infrastructure. Progressive
decentralization of responsibilities from central government to the District Local Councils
was a common theme in all documents. The project‘s objectives were consistent with these
policies - in the aftermath of the war, restoring destroyed and dilapidated social infrastructure
and services was a basic need; and social cohesion within formerly divided communities
could be facilitated if all factions worked together to a common purpose. The Relevance of
the original Objectives was Substantial.

2.7      The objective added to the project at the time of the food price crisis - to provide
temporary employment for the particularly vulnerable (the poor, women and unemployed
youths) - was a means of addressing poverty on an emergency footing to mitigate, on a short
term (within 10 months) basis, the additional hardships imposed by the steep rise in food
prices and the cost of living. Targeting unemployed youths (often former combatants) had a
strategic as well as poverty alleviation dimension - lack of income, idle time, no or minimal
education, and general disaffection with the status quo could pose difficulties for civil
stability. Employment for youths was a strategic need recognized in Bank and Government
policy documents– as expressed in the 2010 Joint Country Assistance Strategy — ―Youth
unemployment ….. remains a social, economic and security challenge.‖ And ―Youth
unemployment may increasingly become an issue of peace and stability that needs to be
managed.‖ An urgent response to the food crisis had become an additional priority, making

to show that CDD created assets have been consistent with the original NSAP (Social Action Project) design of
reestablishing basic social infrastructure and services in war affected communities …‖

the additional objective substantially relevant. The Relevance of the revised objectives
(comprising all three objectives) was Substantial.

DESIGN

2.8     The project as approved had three components (Box 1). An existing institution – the
National Commission for Social Action (NaCSA) - was chosen for coordination of the
project. With respect to the first component, local communities were to decide on the type of
sub-project, and be involved in oversight of contractors. The menu for the sub-projects
included social infrastructure such as schools and clinics, agriculture-related investments, and
investment in other productive assets. A community could apply for only one sub-project. No
maximum cost for a sub-project is specified in the PAD, although an average cost (all project
types) of $28,000 was assumed at appraisal.

 Box 1. The Social Action Project’s Components and Costs
 1. Community-Driven Program (Appraisal cost, $22.5.0 million; actual costs $27.6 million):
 restoring social and economic community infrastructure and services using community mobilization
 and collective action to select, implement and maintain small-scale sub-projects.
 2. Pilot and Special Programs in Newly Accessible Areas (Appraisal cost $4.0 million; actual
 costs $1.5 million): (i) rehabilitating basic chiefdom and district feeder roads, drainage, and other
 infrastructure through a public works program employing demobilized soldiers, unemployed youths
 and other vulnerable groups; and (ii) construction of shelters for poor and vulnerable families.
 3. Project Management and Innovative Activities (Appraisal costs $9.0 million; actual costs $10.7
 million) : capacity building for communities, chiefdoms and district authorities, information,
 education and communication, M&E, and technical assistance for social, beneficiary, poverty and
 vulnerability and environmental assessments, and technical and financial audits. (Primarily, this
 component was the technical assistance and training part of the community-based approach.)
 4. Cash for Work Program (Additional component at restructuring, estimated costs $8.0 million;
 actual costs $8.1 million.): Short-term employment, in response to the food price crisis, of
 vulnerable persons - primarily youths, women and the poor – for labor-intensive construction or
 rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure such as feeder roads, thereby providing income to
 improve the welfare of these vulnerable groups.


2.9     A community‘s proposal for a sub-project was to be reviewed by NaCSA and
required the endorsement of the line ministry concerned (e.g. Ministry of Health for clinics)
which required that design standards matched the norms established by each ministry.
Technical assistance during construction was to be provided by the Commission and the
concerned line ministry. A monitoring and technical assistance process was established,
involving NaCSA‘s specialist units (engineering, procurement, financing, project
management). The Local Councils were to be substantially involved in the project, eventually
as the conduits of funding for new sub-projects and the administrators of the program in their
respective districts. The Ministry of Health was responsible for providing and funding the
nurses, materials and medicines for the health clinics, and the Ministry of Education was
responsible for providing and funding the teachers and pedagogical materials for the schools.
The communities were responsible for maintaining the infrastructure, using their own funds,
                                                        9


materials and labor, and jointly responsible (with the nurses or teachers) for management,
with the main say in how the services would be provided. A Project Management Committee,
which after construction became the maintenance committee, was established by each
community for these purposes.

2.10 The pilot program to provide shelters for particularly war-affected persons was to be
implemented by NGOs. Communities were intended to identify beneficiaries, but
participatory processes were not clearly laid out. The sub-component was also quite large for
a ―pilot‖ – some 1,700 shelters at an estimated cost of $2 million. This was well beyond the
needs for a pilot. The PAD comments that shelter programs had mixed performances in other
countries, and in these circumstances a smaller program would have been better.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

2.11 The original design was well framed to achieve both of its objectives. The social fund
approach was suited to the multiple needs of communities for restoration of key social
services in Sierra Leone‘s post-conflict situation where both institutions and community
cohesion were weak. The design benefitted from the lessons learned under an earlier project
– the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project - specifically that community
participation had to be much more than a consultative role. Transparency and clearly defined
implementation processes were also important. Thus, the Social Action Project adopted a
new and highly participatory community-driven development approach, along with clear
processes designed to maximize community ―ownership‖ and transparent implementation.

2.12 The project‘s design was simple, comprising only two main activities: (i) the
rehabilitation of infrastructure; and (ii) doing so by a community driven development
approach. All sub-projects had the same operational processes for mobilizing communities,
procurement, and provision of technical assistance and funds. This straightforward design
directly responded to both of the original project objectives. However, the construction of
shelters for poor and vulnerable families (part of the second component), while valuable to
the potential beneficiaries, wasn't logically linked to the objectives of restoring infrastructure
and services or increasing the capacity of communities for local action. The Results
Framework in the PAD provided quantitative targets which would contribute to achieving the
project objectives. However, while the causal chain between inputs, outputs and outcomes
could be inferred from the performance indicators, this could have been clearer, and the
monitorable indicators more sharply framed to include more quantitative data for assessing
the project‘s outcome.7 Overall, the Relevance of the Social Action Project‘s Design to its
Original Objectives was Substantial.


7
  Thus, for the objective to increase the capacity of communities for collective action, the indicators provided
(PAD Annex 1) – communities to have conducted a participatory needs assessment and have management
structures in place, and 90 percent of communities to have assessed their projects as ―successful‖ (a qualitative
and subjective term) – cover some inputs and outputs but not outcomes, or proxies for outcomes. The
percentage of the community that contributed to the work and the average time or materials provided, the
regularity and attendance of committee meetings, the percentage of the community that contributed to a
maintenance fund, and the measured functionality of the facility (for example,. numbers of vaccinations given
and prenatal visits) are quantifiable indicators that would get nearer to assessing achievement of this outcome.
                                              10


2.13 The cash-for-work component was a response to the food price crisis, and the
component‘s design was directly linked to the temporary employment objective. This points
to a Substantial Relevance of Design for the project‘s Revised Objectives (the two original
objectives and the additional temporary employment objective).

DESIGN OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.14 The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system‘s design had the capacity to measure
the project‘s monitorable indicators. Several reporting systems were to be used - operational
reports from NaCSA‘s division leaders, quarterly and yearly reports of data relevant to
management decisions, and more evaluative reporting through social surveys. The weak area
was that the monitorable indicators and the data to be collected were mainly of an output
nature (for instance, the number of schools constructed), with less on outcomes such as
primary school enrollment rates. This was partly compensated by including social
assessments (later termed Beneficiary Impact Assessments or ―BIAs‖) in the M&E‘s design
which included some more outcome related data, albeit with significant gaps.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

2.15 The National Commission for Social Action was a natural choice for the
implementing agency, as it had gained a partial understanding of community-driven
approaches implementing the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project (under
NaCSA‘s predecessor, the National Commission for Reconstruction, Resettlement and
Rehabilitation). The roles of NaCSA and the line ministries, the latter providing technical
expertise and the Commission as a coordinator, and trainer and promoter for the community
driven development program, made best use of the existing institutions. The most
fundamental alternative to the project‘s design would have been to continue with the top-
down approach of the Community Reintegration and Rehabilitation Project. But this project‘s
experience had indicated that a more participatory program would have greater chance of
success.

Implementation
2.16 The project was prepared in 2002/2003, shortly after the end of the civil war. (The
concept paper review was in September 2002, and the project was approved on April 24,
2003, about 9 months later. It closed on December 31, 2010, two years after the original
closing date of December 31, 2008. This prolonged the project duration from 5 ½ to 7 ½
years. The original IDA Grant was SDR 25.4 million or $35 million equivalent. The
extension of the project period was made in 2008, the original final year of the project in
order to contribute to Sierra Leone‘s overall response to the food price crisis. Thus, in August
2008, shortly after the peak of rice prices in April-May, 2008, the project was restructured,
its objectives revised, and provided with additional financing of $4 million from the Food
Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, for addition of the cash-for-work program. In November
2009, in order to continue and scale-up the cash-for-work, a further additional financing
amounting to $4 million was provided through a further grant of $3 million from the Food
Price Crisis Response Trust Fund and a grant of $1 million from the Food Price Crisis Multi-
donor Trust Fund.

2.17 The mandate of the implementing agency (NaCSA) already included leading social
infrastructure projects. But it was still an inexperienced organization with limited practice in
the community oriented activities and support services that the Social Action Project was to
introduce. NaCSA progressively improved its capacity throughout the project period. A pilot
program in three districts for provision of shelter for vulnerable groups (part of the second
component) was terminated at the Mid-Term Review due to poor performance. The
intentions at appraisal were for the construction of 1,700 shelters8 at a total estimated cost of
$2.0 million. The two NGOs implementing the program were ineffective, construction costs
had escalated due to major increases in the costs of cement and other building materials, and
the majority of shelters were not reaching the most vulnerable people. Moreover, progress
was slow. By the Mid-Term-Review 908 shelters had been constructed (some were still
under construction but were subsequently completed). Savings from the closed shelter
program (the amount is not specified in project documents) helped finance the community-
driven program, which had also been affected by the increase in construction costs but was
considered a much higher priority for improving welfare and capacity for collective action.

2.18 For the Social Action Project‘s primary activity, the community driven development
program, the target number of sub-projects was significantly reduced at the Mid-Term
Review, from the appraisal target of 1000 sub-projects to a target of 600 sub-projects. The
primary reason was the major increase in the costs of materials; cement prices increased by
130 percent in the first two years of the project. As a result, contractors slowed down
construction and new contracts reflected the increase in construction costs. In these
circumstances, it made sense to reduce the target to stay within the financial limitations. This
may also have been sensible considering the pace appropriate to effectively respond to the
objectives.

2.19 The project was categorized as ―at risk‖ in 2004, its first full year, based on four risk
flags raised–two were country based (general country record and governance environment)
and two were project-based, related to weaknesses in NaCSA‘s financial management and
delays in provision of counterpart funds. In response to the first project flag, NaCSA
tightened monitoring and coordination of participating agencies and local governments.
Capacity building efforts were strengthened and project processes and fiduciary
arrangements were further developed and monitored. These actions substantially resolved the
problems, and thereafter, the Commission‘s institutional capacity progressively improved.
Concerning the second risk flag, delays in provision of counterpart funds caused delays in
implementation in the first years of the project and an overall shortfall of counterpart funds
during the life of the project of $1.5 million. The appraisal estimate of the Government‘s
counterpart funding was $3.5 million, whereas $2.0 million was provided. Exchange rate
changes provided an extra $2.9 million in IDA funding, thus covering the shortfall in
Government funds. Beneficiary contributions, mainly of labor and local materials, were
estimated at appraisal to value about $3.5 million, whereas at project completion, the value
was estimated at about $2.1 million, mainly reflecting a higher share of costs borne by
contractors.


8
    Prior to the Mid-Term-Review the target was reduced to 1,200 shelters.
                                              12


2.20 Disbursements: All of the original SDR 25.4 million (US$ 35.0 million) grant was
disbursed which, due to exchange rate depreciation, amounted in dollar terms to $37.9
million by project completion. Virtually all this amount was disbursed by the project‘s
original closing date. The extension of the project by two years was for the purpose of
implementing the cash for-work program, which used all of the $8 million in additional
grants.

2.21 M&E Implementation: M&E staffing (a lean 2 person cell in the Strategic Planning
and Information Division) provided a base for data coordination and collection although,
without full-time field enumerators, the cell relied on data collection through NaCSA‘s
District Coordinators and other operational staff. Data for output indicators were regularly
collected, but the lack of regularly reported outcome indicators in the M&E system‘s design
persisted. Exceptions were two beneficiary impact assessments - in 2006 (about mid-term of
the project) and at project completion in 2010 – which between them provide a broader
understanding of project impacts, although the range of information is limited and mostly
qualitative. Management Information System reporting was regular, and the data became a
useful management tool.

2.22 Fiduciary Issues: According to the ICR, NaCSA provided accounting and auditing
reports on schedule and to required standards. Initial weaknesses in financial reporting were
resolved with the Bank‘s technical advice, and guidelines for financial management and
procurement were issued. Procurement followed Bank guidelines with the exception of one
case of misprocurement which led to dismissal of the contractor. No other fiduciary issues
are reported.

2.23 Safeguards Compliance: The project was Environmental Category B. An
Environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework
were issued during project preparation with checklists to identify issues and mitigation
measures and to prepare an action plan for each type of sub-project. Actual implementation
of these systems was weak. An assessment of environmental safeguards practices was made
in February 2010, the last year of the extended project period. The main problems were
assessed to be: use of general rather than project-type checklists, inadequate numbers of
environmental officers and weak training, and inclusion of NaCSA officials in environmental
committees. Efforts were made by the Commission to address these issues. Although all sub-
projects and cash-for-work schemes had been completed, it introduced a Safeguards Manual
clarifying criteria and standards for screening sub-projects and developing mitigation plans,
increased staff training, and tightened monitoring. There is no information on whether these
measures improved environmental screening and mitigation, but the actions, though too late
for the project, are clearly in the right direction.

Achievement of the Objectives
2.24 Assessing the project‘s efficacy must contend with limited direct evidence on project
achievements and the fact that there were parallel health and education projects.
Nevertheless, from the BIAs, other commentaries or proxy data, and findings from IEG field
visits and discussions, an indicative picture emerges. There are a number of concerns and
limitations with respect to the BIA survey design and sampling, the occasional use of leading
                                                             13


questions, and the degree to which benefits can be ascribed to the project as opposed to other
influences, as discussed in Annex C.

RESTORING COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES

2.25 A total of 589 sub-projects were completed. The bulk of the investments chosen by
the communities were for primary schools (205 schools, 34 percent of the sub-projects),
general or maternal health clinics (185 clinics, 31 percent), and community infrastructure
such as a meeting hall or village market (111 projects, 19 percent, Table 2). The remaining
99 subprojects (16 percent) financed investments in irrigation, skills training, and other
choices. The sub-projects were a mix of new constructions and rehabilitations of destroyed
infrastructure. No break-down between the two has been noted in the beneficiary surveys and
ICR, although comments made in these documents infer that the great majority were for new
construction or rebuilding of virtually destroyed infrastructure.9 The quality of the sub-
project investments (infrastructure and adequacy of initial equipment) is not empirically
assessed in the BIAs, although the Borrower comments in the ICR indicate that, for 95
percent of the sub-projects, construction met the prescribed standards of the line ministries.10

  ―The overwhelming majority of these projects were implemented i n communities that had lost such facilities
and services as a result of the war.‖ ( 2010 BIA, page 33).

  The line ministries also had to approve construction standards before a facility could be authorized for
construction (Borrower‘s ICR, page 62 of the ICR.)

2.26 Restoring Education (Primary School) Services. The 2010 BIA found that of the
25 schools in the survey sample, 23 had been completed by the end of the project (92
percent) and two (8 percent)) had been abandoned during construction. This was about the
same rate of abandonment as the average for all (including all types of investment) of the
sub-projects sampled, for which 10 of the 90 sub-projects in the survey (11 percent of the
projects) were abandoned. A precise breakdown of the reasons why construction was stopped
is not available, but according to NaCSA, contractual disputes were the primary reason,
usually related to the steep rise in prices of cement and other materials, which had not been
foreseen at contract signature. Some contractors could not afford to continue the works under
these circumstances. Focus groups in the 2010 BIA made similar comments (page 53).

2.27 The more significant question is whether the investments made are being sustained in
good operational order. Available data is qualified by the short time periods observed in the
surveys, but there are some indications. In the 2010 BIA, 20 of the 23 (87 percent) completed
schools were found to be in ―good or acceptable‖ condition, and for all types of sub-project a
similar situation (90 percent) was found. The average age of the sub-projects would have
been over two years as about one-third of the sub-projects were completed in FY06, four
years before the survey.11 An alternative source of information is directly from NaCSA‘s
district offices. For six districts, 94 percent of completed sub-projects (all types) were still
operating two years after construction. Observations made to the IEG mission by NaCSA and
a District Chairman were consistent with these data – general views tended to be that all or
virtually all sub-projects were functioning well, and the Bank team assessed that 96 to 98
percent of sub-projects were operational at the time of the ICR.

2.28 From NaCSA data, the number of children enrolled in primary school in communities
near (not defined) project schools increased by 27 percent; for girls the increase was by 33
percent and for boys by 23 percent. The number of teachers increased by 37 percent.12 The
share of families with a school-aged girl who sent a girl to a NaCSA school rose from 19 to
37 percent. The BIA also comments from focus group discussions with beneficiary
communities (without quantitative data) that before the constructed/rehabilitated school, the
average time spent by children getting to school was two hours. IEG‘s field visit to a village
school supported by the project in the Western Area District confirmed the increased access
to schooling and continued participation by parents, while also pointing to continuing
shortages of teachers and materials (Box 2).

2.29 To some degree, the primary schools upgraded under the Rehabilitation of Basic
Education Project (implemented from 2003 to 2010, about the same project period as the
Social Action Project) can be used as a counterfactual – what was happening elsewhere? The
education project was a broad-based program providing improvements to schools in

11
  World Bank 2005, 2006 and 2007: Status of Projects in Execution, FYs 2005 and 2007. 212 projects were
―under completion in FY05, and the same number were reported as ―completed in FY07. (The construction
program began in 2004 and ended in 2008, two years prior to project closure at the end of 2010, and only a few
months after the 2010 BIA.
12
  These figures may be underestimates of the eventual increases, as data were reported as of March 2007. The
bulk of the schools would have been constructed less than two years earlier, and the full impact may not have
been fully achieved in such a short time period.

furnishings, equipment, teacher training, and materials through service providers funded by
―partial‖ government grants for 776 schools and ―full‖ grants for 192 schools that also had to
be constructed or rehabilitated. Between them the 968 schools represented 41 percent of the
total number of primary schools in the seven districts covered under the project. There are
few performance indicators enabling direct comparison of the two projects, as the parameters
measured differ.13 Nevertheless, both projects showed improvement – facilities and
pedagogical equipment were provided, the number of teachers increased,14 school
enrollment, especially of girls, went up, pass rates at the end of primary school increased and
communities appear to have greatly appreciated the schools.15

 Box 2: Observations at a Primary School Sub-Project
 IEG‘s visit to the Our Lady of Kwama Primary School, Western Area District, illustrates some of the
 issues encountered in the community driven development program.. Kwama school had been financed
 under the project, and its operations were being financed and supplied (teachers and teaching
 materials) by the district Local Council, with grants from the Ministry of Education. Maintenance of
 the school was done by parent volunteers. A group of parents explained that the community had hired
 and paid for additional teachers to reduce class sizes, with contributions from each parent of Le 5000
 (about $ 1.70) per child per annum. While not officially certified, the parents felt that these additional
 teachers were skilled enough for primary school teaching. The parent-teachers association reportedly
 met every term. The main subjects covered in the most recent meeting were the shortage of teaching
 materials, overly large class size and the problem of access by pupils from the more distant villages
 (some pupils had to walk up to five miles to reach the school). The main general problems mentioned
 by the parents were too few teachers, underpaid teachers, and insufficient training materials.
 Notwithstanding, enrollment of girls had increased from being a distinct minority to parity with the
 boys by 2011. IEG‘s site inspection found the school clean and children‘s notebooks neat and
 informative. There was an evident rapport between the teaching staff and parents. In a discussion with
 parents they advised that they were committed to maintain the school, and examples of actions to date
 were mentioned (weeding, cleaning). The parents felt that the school had helped the healing process
 after the war as families had to work together through the parent-teachers association, the maintenance
 committee, and other interactions.

  For instance, primary school completion rates increased in the education project‘s seven districts from 50
percent to 65 percent, but there is no comparable data for the social project other than views expressed in the
beneficiary survey‘s focus groups that the completion rates had improved.
14
  For both projects, teachers and pedagogical equipment and materials were provided through the Ministry of
Education. Financing of specialist equipment was by government in the case of the social project, and through
project funds under the education project.
15
  Based on data from the 2005 and 2010 BIA‘s for the Social Action Project and the ICR for the education
project. ―Satisfaction‖ (the term used in the ICRs of both projects and in the social project‘s beneficiary survey)
has limited utility as the term is subjective and may not be representative. Satisfaction was assessed for the
education project based on a questionnaire circulated to participants in the end-of-project workshop (ICR page
46) primarily comprising government staff, civil society, teachers and politicians (Workshop proceedings in
ICR page 65 and list of participants at page 103) with limited representation of beneficiaries. The very high
satisfaction rate for each project input (furniture, textbooks, teacher training, etc.) under the education project
does not necessarily reflect the views of beneficiaries given that they were largely excluded from the survey.
The social project‘s beneficiary survey (1656 respondents) rated whether their sub -project had been ―successful
or very successful‖ at 79 percent, but this was for all sub -projects, thus not education alone.

2.30 The fundamental difference in the orientations of the projects was the degree of
community participation. The Social Action Project put community participation at the fore,
with project management committees and engagement with the committees established
before consideration of any investment. Decisions, first-line construction supervision, and
maintenance were their responsibility, whereas the education project put emphasis on
equipping schools, in which function it was successful. However, in the education project,
only 291 school management committees received training, about one-third of the schools
that were refurbished. In a survey of one of the project districts (sample of 31 schools), four
years after construction, one-third of the schools financed by the education project were
found to need repairs (World Bank 2010).16 Direct comparison with the Social Action
Project is not possible as the measurement time-frame for the project is shorter.

2.31 Restoring Health Services (Clinics). The other main choice by communities was
small general or maternal health care clinics. Access to clinics improved due to the
substantial reduction in travel time and costs (before construction/rehabilitation the only
recourse to medical attention was to district hospitals). The clinics enabled nearly all users
(98 percent) to walk to the clinic whereas before construction only two thirds could access by
foot.17 The rest had to go by public transport as functioning clinics were few and far
between. Another indication of utility is the number of antenatal visits to a clinic – from
proxy information, 29 percent of pregnant women made two to three visits after a clinic was
established, compared with 17 percent before the clinic. 18 An encouraging sign, both of
appreciation and likely long-term commitment, is the growth in clinic staff (nurses or
assistants) by project closure.). Staff numbers increased by nearly 90 percent (based on
NaCSA data from 43 clinics). The focus group discussions in the BIA found that
communities highly appreciated the clinics (and schools).19 There are also cases, both among
the schools and the health facilities, where the school parents or the women visiting clinics
had paid, with their own funds, for additional assistant teachers and nurses (IEG mission field
visits and discussions).

2.32 There was a concurrent health sector Bank operation20 at the time of the social
project, but the health project‘s health outpost sub-component was relatively small: 50 clinics
in four districts were constructed and provided with nurses, specialist equipment and
medicines supplied, as with the Social Action Project, through the Ministry of Health. It is

16
  ―While two-thirds of school buildings are still in good condition after four years, one-third of schools need
repairs, including cracked walls, potholed/coarse floors, leaking ceilings and coarse blackboards that consume
too much chalk‖ (World Bank 2010).

  BIA, 2010. Sample of 47 mothers from 18 clinics, each with two infant children, one borne before the clinic
and one borne afterwards. Visits for the first child were before establishment of the clinic, and for the second
child, after the clinic was established.
19
  For instance, a comment from one women‘s focus group discussion in Laiya, Bombali: ―We are utilizing the
health center effectively, because, when people are sick, we take them to the health facility; likewise pregnant
women, we don‘t take them to Kamakwie.‖

not clear from the project documents whether the equipment and facilities were similar to the
Social Action Project clinics. There are also limited performance data for inter-project
comparisons, although evidence showing improved access to health care is consistent with
the Social Action Project clinics. As with the education project, the key difference between
the health and social action projects was in the degree of community participation. There is
virtually no mention of this in the health project‘s PAD, and this limitation is critiqued in the
ICR as a shortfall and a lesson for more community involvement in the future.21

2.33 Building Village Markets, Village Courts and Meeting Halls. The third most
popular choice for a sub-project was community infrastructure such as a meeting hall, a
village court or a small market. Sixteen of the 90 communities in the BIA had chosen such
community infrastructure and a (very small) sample of 75 individual respondents provided
feedback. Over 90 percent stated they were ―satisfied‖ with their sub-project.22 For those in
communities that had chosen courts, 85 percent considered that their court had become since
construction the main forum for settling disputes; over 90 percent of respondents visited their
markets ―often;‖ and about 90 percent of those using the market were women.

2.34 Piloting Shelters and Rural Public Works. The shelter program was a pilot activity
separate from the community driven development program and with a different, and far less
participatory design. It was closed down at the Mid-Term Review due to performance
problems. Of the originally targeted 1,700 shelters, 908 were constructed. The cost of the
program amounted to $1.5 million or three percent of total project costs at the Social Action
Project‘s closure. There were a variety of implementation difficulties, but the principal
weakness lay in weak processes for involving communities and selecting beneficiaries.
Communities were meant to select the poorest and most vulnerable people, but in practice,
for the majority of shelters this was not done, or only partially done (World Bank 2011). The
rural public works program was a demand-driven program to build community access roads,
drainage systems and other infrastructure implemented in the country‘s three poorest
districts. It was targeted primarily to demobilized soldiers and unemployed youths, and each
sub-project required a contribution by the community or local authorities of 10 percent of the
value of the works. Some 3,200 beneficiaries were involved in the works. The degree to
which the program reached the intended beneficiaries is not provided in project documents or
the 2010 BIA, although the task team considers that the program provided useful lessons in
community involvement for the cash for work program.

2.35 Central Services. The relevant line ministries and Local Councils were and remain a
central part of community services. For the schools, the Ministry of Education pays the
teachers‘ salaries, and provides a basic supply of teaching materials. Likewise, the Ministry
of Health provides for the nurses‘ salaries, medicines and vaccines. The Councils
progressively took on the administrative and financing role of the community development

21
  There was … ―very little involvement of the local communities that were beneficiaries of the facilities.‖
…… And, ―The lesson learned there was that local beneficiaries should be involved in every aspect of the
process. This will increase ownership, and introduce another useful control mechanism. (World Bank 2010,
page 44)
22
  As for the schools and clinics, ―satisfaction‖ is open to different interpretations; hence this can only be
broadly indicative.
                                                        18


program.23 The adequacy or otherwise of these human and material resources, frequently an
issue in Africa, is not assessed in the ICR, or in the BIA, but proxies suggest that this was not
perceived as a major issue. Thus, 79 percent of households stated they were satisfied with the
services provided by their sub-projects (sample of 1683 respondents across all of the 90
communities in the BIA survey).

2.36 Overview documents such as the 2010 BIA and the ICR are silent on the adequacy
and timeliness of medical and school supplies, even when specifically referring to the role of
the line ministries, sustainability, and borrower performance. None of these proxies can be
used to conclude that supplies and staffing were adequate, but together they suggest at least a
basic level of supplies, teachers, and nurses.24 The IEG mission site visits and field
discussion are consistent with this. 25 These various sources suggest that, while there were
situations in which materials and regularity of delivery were inadequate, this does not appear
to be a predominant issue.26 Coordination between the National Committee for Social Action
and the line ministries, and at district levels, the local councils, helped in meshing the
activities of the institutions concerned. At the central level there was a monthly meeting
between NaCSA and the line ministries, and similar coordination existed at district level
which also had monthly meetings between district level staff of NaCSA, the line ministries,
and the Local Councils.

2.37 The observations above provide indications that: the majority of completed
subprojects provided a useful service: they made a difference to welfare by providing
services that were needed; access to these services has improved; and the communities
appreciate the services. There are also some preliminary signs that the services will be
maintained. The Social Action Project‘s Efficacy at Restoring Infrastructure and Services
was Substantial.27




23
   This is in line with the Government‘s decentralization program, through block grants to each district and
transfer of responsibilities from the center to the Local Councils. For the Social Action Project, this includes
responsibilities for general monitoring of communities, coordination of the line agencies, and channeling of
funds.
24
   Consistent with these pointers, there is no discussion in the health project‘s ICR of supplies being an issue for
its clinics.
25
  For one of the schools and one of the clinics visited by the IEG mission, when parents or patients were
questioned by the mission as to whether the teaching materials and medicines supplied by these two ministries
were adequate, they commented that the materials were insufficient, and sometimes came late. But problems did
not appear serious. Medicines, vaccines and teaching materials did arrive, albeit sometimes irregularly, usually
responding to the clinic‘s or school‘s critical needs; and the quantity and timelines of supplies was not one of
the key issues raised by the staff or communities. However, insufficient staffing was evidently an issue for
parents and users of the clinics. In both facilities, the communities, with their own money, had hired extra
assistant teachers or nursing assistants.
26
  More specific data would have been desirable on the adequacy of materials, staff, and medicines, as
international experience has found that shortfalls in these areas are quite common.
27
  This evaluation excludes the pilot shelter program. This was only 3 percent of actual project costs and
followed a largely non-participatory approach, different from the rest of the Social Action Project.

BUILDING THE CAPACITIES OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES FOR COLLECTIVE ACTION

2.38 The preparation and implementation processes and institutional arrangements
required under the Social Action Project were a foundation for empowering communities to
take collective actions. The project brought in structured institutional arrangements and
processes that necessitated interactions within a community. The first step was the
establishment by a community of a Project Management Committee. At this stage NaCSA
was closely involved: it required that members should be chosen with as much participation
of the community as possible, and the Commission‘s staff were facilitators rather than
leaders in the meetings. Focus group discussions undertaken in the 2006 and 2010 BIAs
indicated that this was generally a democratic process, setting the stage for further
cooperation in later steps. There were some requirements for the committees: a membership
of 10 persons; women to be represented on the committee; illiterate as well as literate persons
to be eligible for membership; and no government officials or chiefs to be members. These
stipulations were generally complied with although there were exceptions (for instance,
situations with a low representation of women, whereas a minimum of four female members
was NaCSA‘s standard advice). Community meetings were held for major decisions such as
location of the facility, and the committee organized supervision (on site monitoring) of the
contractor.

2.39 Available information, most from the sample survey in the 2006 BIA (a sample of
630 community members from only 17 sub-projects across nine districts), indicates that the
communities were fairly active participants in most of these processes and in subsequent
implementation of their sub-projects, though this varied by stage of the process, and in some
aspects by gender (see Annex C for the limitations of the data).

2.40 Initiating the process was the weakest stage (Table 3). While the community meeting
was the primary avenue for informing the people (78 percent of male and 61 percent of
female respondents), nearly all survey respondents felt that there should have been a longer
consultation process and/or community outreach when NaCSA and other involved agencies
introduced the project. Nevertheless, about three-quarters of the respondents said that the
Project Management Committees were selected by vote at a community meeting and another
10 percent stated that it was by consensus during the meeting. There were very strong views
(90 percent of respondents) that voting was important in selecting the Project Management
Committee.

2.41 At the sub-project construction stage the great majority of respondents - 96 percent of
the men and 87 percent of the women - stated that they contributed to the work (the NaCSA
requirement is at least a 10 percent contribution from the community to sub-project costs),
although the actual participation may have been lower if some respondents in the survey
were embarrassed to say no. Nearly all respondents stated they made contributions in kind,
either in labor (62 percent of respondents) or land (31 percent). Participation in project
management was also found to be high. About 82 percent of respondents affirmed that there
were monthly project implementation meetings. Procurement and financial management
aspects of the committees‘ work had lower participation. Some 74 percent of respondents felt
that procurement processes were transparent, and about 45 percent considered financing and
financial management to also be so. Women respondents had somewhat lower assessments of
                                                                20


participation when it related to meetings. They were particularly marginalized at the
beginning of the process - only 36 percent stated that they had participated in identifying the
type of sub-project to be chosen, whereas the corresponding figure for the men was 68
percent.

2.42 As concerns construction, while there is no quantitative evidence, the 2010 BIA
comments (page 39) that, during the sub-project construction phase ―providing general
oversight to contractors in the course of implementation‖ was one of the two main activities
of a project management committee (the other was to ―work closely with local authorities in
mobilizing community-level resources, including unskilled labor and local materials‖). There
are also qualitative comments elsewhere in the report that infer that contractor oversight was
commonly carried out by committees and that good oversight was an important element to
achieve quality construction.28 Similar comments were made to IEG by NaCSA and by


28
  ―In most of the communities visited, they expressed this feeling that the quality of facilities constructed was
to large extent linked to the fact that they had community representative who acted as deterrent against theft and
                                                                21


communities during site visits. Thus, triangulation from these sources suggests that oversight
was a common practice and may have been a significant contributor to construction quality.

2.43 An important indicator of the capacity for acting collectively is whether the
community can play its role in operating and maintaining the infrastructure and the service
provided. A direct empirical assessment of the sustainability of the infrastructure and
services is limited by the still short period of operations and, especially, the period covered
by existing data. But the information that is available is consistent with a start in the right
direction. The 2010 BIA found that 95 percent of sub-projects (all types) were still
operational after 24 months (Table 4). At an aggregate level most communities were found in
the BIA to be satisfied with the services and showing strong ―ownership‖ of their sub-
projects. Overall, 79 percent of sampled households considered their sub-projects successful,
with higher percentages (though on relatively small samples) satisfied with their court barays
or community centers (92 percent) and 96 percent satisfied with their market sub-projects.
Some caution is necessary however. The terms ―satisfied‖ and ―successful‖ are subjective
terms, and there is little beyond these indicators and the functionality of the infrastructure
over a fairly short time period with which to predict sustainability. More empirical data such
as on the percentage of households that contributed to a community maintenance fund, or
contributed labor or materials for operations and maintenance would have provided greater
assurance on sustainability.

2.44 There are also indications that the project has contributed to building social cohesion,
evidently desirable, if not essential, for collective action, and also key to Sierra Leone‘s
peace building process. In the 2006 BIA, 70 percent of respondents considered that the level
of trust had improved over the previous two years (page 23). In a group discussion conducted
by IEG with parents of children at a primary school, the general view was that the
participatory processes, and in particular the way the parents were intimately involved in
school management and hiring new teachers, naturally ―brought people together.‖ Similar
views were expressed at two health centers. Regardless of former divisions, people visited

poor quality of work on the part of the contractor. At the same time, the committee acted as motivators for
influencing contractors towards building an asset that was rich in quality.‖ (2010 BIA, page 40)
                                                        22


the health centers when necessary. Conversations while waiting for treatment between people
from all social groups were helpful. The regular village visits of a nurse for open discussions
of preventative and basic health also helped. ―Bridges were built between us‖ was one
comment. And, reflecting on all of the project‘s activities in his District, a Deputy Councilor
commented that (community driven development) had ―really transformed our
communities.‖

2.45 The various sources of information above, while substantially qualitative in nature
and often based on small samples, suggest that, taken overall, the project, through its
participatory processes has Substantially helped Build the Capacities of Local Communities
for Collective Action. As to be expected, however, each community has its own unique
social character, and the individual experiences of the communities were notably diverse,
both in how the communities built and managed their facilities, and in the quality of
implementation and utilization.

ASSISTING VULNERABLE HOUSEHOLDS TO ACCESS TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT

2.46 This objective was added to the project in August 2008 to provide employment and
incomes to those particularly affected by the food price crisis. Rice prices had peaked only
three months earlier. A ―cash for work‖ program was established to benefit, on a temporary
basis, the most food-vulnerable (the poor, unemployed youths, and women). The program
covered all of the country‘s 14 districts (Table 5) and involved a total of 727 sub-projects in
both urban and rural areas.29 There are two main sources of information about the program:
the 2010 Beneficiary Impact Assessment and the ―Qualitative Assessment of Cash for Work
Program for Sierra Leone‖ (Dalan Consultants 2010).30

2.47 The great majority (80 percent) of the cash-for-work sub-projects were for
rehabilitation of small rural and urban unpaved roads. Restoration of small earthen irrigation
channels for valley swamp rice made up another 5 percent, land clearing and preparation for
other crops (predominantly cassava and vegetables), a further 11 percent, and the balance
(four percent) was for environmental projects such as urban drainage. Sub-projects were
required to have a minimum of 60 percent of costs in unskilled labor. Daily wage rates varied
by district but were typically about Leones 7,000 (US$ 1.60). Rates were set at levels about
70 percent of average wages for unskilled labor in the private sector.31 In an attempt to
provide a self-selection incentives structure, it was presumed that those who were employed
and getting remuneration above these rates would not seek to join the program.

2.48 The program provided temporary employment for about 39,400 persons, higher than
the 31,000 beneficiaries anticipated, due mainly to a reduction in days per beneficiary
practiced at some sites to accommodate excess demand for work (World Bank 2009d). This

29
     A breakdown between rural and urban sites is not available.
30
     The methodologies and limitations of these surveys are discussed in Annex C.
31
  The rate was generally within the range of 6,000 to 7,500 Leones per day. The difference between private
sector and cash-for-work wage rates could be significantly greater in urban areas – in the western urban areas
(primarily Freetown) cash-for-work rates were less than half of private sector rates (Dalan Consultants, 2010).
                                                               23


resulted in about two million person days of employment. The average number of workdays
per beneficiary was 50, and typical total earnings of a beneficiary were about Leone 350,000
($80). The 2010 BIA, states that 341 sub-projects had been completed and were in use out of
347 sub-projects that had commenced under the first phase of the program. (This may
overstate the completion rate as the Qualitative Assessment found that beneficiaries raised
the issue of contractors that didn‘t complete their job.) There are few, even qualitative,
statements about the quality of the work, but concerns about future maintenance of the
rehabilitated roads are raised. In principle, Local Councils and line agencies such as the
Sierra Leone Roads Authority are expected to take charge of maintaining the rehabilitated
roads. But experience in Sierra Leone is that development programs are seldom sustainable
without continual external financial support.

2.49 The program was effective in reaching its primary demographic target groups. About
75 percent of beneficiaries were youths, nearly 30 percent were women, and most of these
groups were also war affected. Unemployed youths were particularly targeted to help
mitigate the risks of conflict. Many were uneducated because they had been combatants
during the war, and were typically poor and needing employment to occupy their time and to
generate much needed income.32 The predominant views of Government officials, and as
also reported in the 2010 BIA, are that the program had reached youths as well as other
vulnerable groups, and had been a stabilizing influence. In a similar vein, the BIA reports
that focus groups felt that the program reduced the risk of conflict by occupying the youths‘

32
     As reported by Platt (2009), 70 percent of the Nation‘s youths were unemployed in 2009.
                                                      24


time and providing subsistence. Several government officials and a Local Council expressed
the same views to the IEG mission.

2.50 The targeting of potential beneficiaries was through a two-stage process, first with the
choice of areas for involvement and communities within these areas, and secondly, during
the choice of individual beneficiaries within the communities. The selection of the areas was
based on a national ―Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability‖ analysis carried out in
2008 by the World Food Program and Food and Agriculture Organization which was based
on prevalence of poverty and food insecurity, unemployment and nutrition rates. Selection of
communities within these areas was done by a Project Approval Committee comprising the
Local Council, NaCSA, and representatives of line ministries. The Qualitative Assessment
report commented that community selection was based on the official cash-for-work
guidelines, and considered that the program had largely reached the poorest communities. A
NaCSA official and a Local Council official met by IEG advised that the committee, by
having multiple entities involved and a Local Council that was answerable to its citizenry,
was protected from bias. This was not always the case, however. The Qualitative Assessment
also comments that some council representatives attempted to lure the choice of areas to their
own wards.

2.51 The primary shortcoming in the beneficiary selection process was the method of
choosing individuals. The Qualitative Survey, based on focus group discussions with
beneficiaries from the first phase of the cash-for-work program, found that selection of
individuals in three districts had involved the community, apparently without complaints. But
the majority of the sample communities in two other districts complained that participants
came from outside the community (page 75). In one site visited by the IEG mission
(Bombali), selection of participants was primarily by one individual (Box 3). To counter such
problems, NaCSA brought in a more institutionalized approach through a multi-party
committee ensuring more rigorous selection. From accounts to IEG, the presence of
representatives from the Local Council, town council, and village elders influenced a more
objective selection process.

 Box 3. The Cash for Work Program in Bombali District
 A cash-for-work road reconstruction site in Bombali district rehabilitated a 3 meter-wide dirt road in an urban
 community and had been completed about three years ago. The community had done light maintenance since
 then. The scheme provided work for ―Youths‖ (men or women 15 -35 years old) to work on a temporary basis
 over an 8-week period. This site had provided such temporary jobs for about 50 youths at any one time. On
 average about 30 percent of the youths were women. The Bombali District Youth Chairman recounted the
 method used to select the participants. The objective was to employ the most vulnerable ―street youths.‖ A
 combination of identification based on apparent poverty and of self-selection was used. First, he made house-
 by-house visits and identified the poorest youths who were not employed. This would inevitably contain some
 subjective judgment, but he considered the next step would tend to only attract the very poor. The daily wage
 rate of 6,000 Leone was well below rates for laborers hired by contractors who paid about 15,000 to 18,000
 per day for the same kind of work. Thus, from his experience, only those who genuinely needed the income
 tended to come forward. He also felt that food for work schemes would be better, earnings would be entirely
 for family nutrition, and in kind payment would provide greater buffering against food price increases.

2.52 The substantial degree to which cash-for-work reached youths and women was not
matched by the program‘s achievement reaching the most impoverished of the population. A
2012 World Bank study33 found that only 5.5 percent of the poorest of beneficiaries were in
the poorest quintile, and that even when the poorest and the second poorest quintiles are
taken together, only 20 percent of beneficiaries were in these categories.34

2.53 In implementing the cash-for-work program, the Qualitative Survey cites a number of
issues based on its focus groups discussions: selection of individuals could be by a contractor
without much regard for social concerns; might target relatives; could involve politicians;
and might even select individuals from outside the locality. Whether these are isolated cases
or occurred frequently is not known. Nevertheless, two issues are given particular
prominence–performance of contractors, and lack of community involvement–and appear to
be at the heart of the program‘s problems. Only 27 percent of communities were satisfied
with the performance of their contractor, the most commonly cited issues being that the
contractor might marginalize community involvement, might provide wages to communities
late or below the determined wage, sometimes did not complete a job, lacked transparency,
and might be dishonest. Lessons emerging from the project experience with cash-for-work
are summarized in Box 4.35

2.54 In summary, these various sources indicate that the cash-for-work program had some
success at reaching youths and women and in improving the welfare of its beneficiaries, and
was partially successful in reaching the target groups. The lax processes for selecting
beneficiaries enabled cases where vested interests might determine who participated,
contractors had too much power, which enabled malpractices such as late payments, selection
of participants from outside of a community, and poor monitoring of quality. And
communities were often marginalized in decision making and beneficiary selection. There is
no way to quantitatively determine the extent of these problems, but in both the 2010 BIA
and the Qualitative Assessment, such cases were often referred to during focus group
discussion, especially as concerns the contractors. In turn, these issues pulled down the
effectiveness of targeting the poor, and the ―ownership‖ of the investments by local
communities. Hence, for the project objective to Provide Temporary Employment to
Vulnerable Households, Efficacy was Modest.

     Backiny, Yetna and Wodon as reported in Andrews, Ovadiya, and Wodon (2012).

  By contrast, the cash-for-work program in Liberia reached 60 percent of beneficiaries in the two poorest
quintiles. According to the draft Social Protection Assessment (World Bank 2012) in 2007 some 57 percent of
Sierra Leone‘s population lived below the poverty line.
35
  The design of the follow-on Youth Employment Support Project (FY10) appears to have taken note of a
number of these lessons (Annex 9 of the PAD).
                                                               26



      Box 4. Lessons from the Cash-for-Work Program
      Beneficiary communities should be much more involved in the cash-for-work program: in
      selection of project location, type of project, and participants, and in monitoring of the works.
      Targeting of communities and participants should be significantly improved.
      Minimize the use of contractors or the range of their responsibilities, with communities taking
      over selection of sites and participants, and monitoring the contractors‘ activities (the
      contractor‘s role being mainly restricted to construction).
      Women‘s participation should be improved through inclusion of more projects other than roads
      (where strength is a primary need), or tasks should be differentiated within the sub-project by
      activities more suitable for women (fetching water, gravel, cooking, etc.), and arrangements for
      looking after children.
      Communities should be trained in management and maintaining the works. They should also be
      left with the tools to undertake maintenance.

Efficiency
2.55 Economic rates of return for the project were not calculated at appraisal or in the ICR,
on the grounds that benefits would be difficult to quantify, especially as concerns welfare
impacts - the essence of a social fund. There are, however, a number of observations that can
contribute to an overall assessment of efficiency. For the original objectives of the project
these are:

        Cost-effectiveness: NaCSA administrative and operating costs were about 12 percent
         of project costs, which is reasonable for a community development project where
         extensive capacity building is needed. While sub-project investment costs were
         higher than envisaged at appraisal, this was primarily due to the unanticipated hike in
         costs of materials, especially cement, which affected construction costs of
         infrastructure generally, across all projects. The ICR reports that investment costs per
         classroom and per clinic under the Social Action Project were lower than the costs of
         similar facilities constructed by government and under an Economic Union project
         (although these comparisons are qualified by lack of clarity on whether the facilities
         were the same and whether they were implemented under the same conditions).36
        Operational efficiency: The average time taken from application to approval of a
         sub-project decreased during implementation from about 21 months to 8 months - the
         latter is not excessive given the extensive meetings and sequential steps needed for
         effective community participation.

36
  Such as, whether the facilities are similar in size and furnishing, new construction or rehabilitation, inclusive
or not of community contributions, and other possible dissimilarities. Also, the costs compared are the direct
investment costs and exclude management and training. The community driven approach could be expected to
have higher overheads than programs with less participation.
                                              27


      Allocative Efficiency: Communities had free choices of the kind of subproject they
       wanted, and most made their choices through democratic processes. Most
       communities chose education or health because they felt that these would maximize
       their welfare. Thus, the high level of participation in community discussions would
       generally cause project funds to be allocated to investments where socioeconomic
       impact would be greatest.

2.56 Based on such observations, the Efficiency of the Social Action Project‘s Original
Objectives is assessed Substantial.

2.57 Under the added objective to provide temporary employment to vulnerable
households, all of the $8.0 million allocated to the cash-for-work program was disbursed.
This was within the 2 additional project years provided for the program, and the total number
of labor days reached 2.0 million compared with the target of 1.7 million. There was also
widespread interest in participating in the program, because it was seen as significantly
improving family incomes and welfare. Nevertheless, the weaknesses in selection of
beneficiaries resulted in only partly reaching the poorest and most vulnerable households,
hence under-achieving the program‘s potential benefits. The Efficiency of the temporary
employment objective is assessed Modest. This also reduces the efficiency of the project
under the Revised Project Objectives (combining all three objectives) to Modest.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.58 The civil war had resulted in widespread destruction of Sierra Leone‘s infrastructure,
and there was a crucial need for war-torn communities to recover from the divisions of the
past. The Social Action Project‘s design was well framed to achieve these objectives. The
project successfully contributed to restoring community infrastructure and services and in
building the capacity of local communities for collective action. It was cost-effective, and
allocation of funds followed community decisions on what they perceived as the most
beneficial for their needs. Under the Original Objectives, project Outcome was Satisfactory.

2.59 The additional objective to help the vulnerable access temporary employment,
implemented through the cash-for-work program, was a relevant emergency response to help
mitigate the hardships caused by the food price crisis. The program created jobs and
improved incomes. It benefitted participants and provided learning for future scaling up of
the program. However, it was less effective at reaching the most vulnerable, had limited
involvement of communities, and little flexibility in choice of activities suitable for women.
Both Efficacy and Efficiency were modest for this additional objective. Taking into account
the results for all three of the objectives, the Outcome under the project‘s Revised Objectives
(the original objectives plus the additional objective) is Moderately Satisfactory.

2.60 Under standard IEG/OPCS procedures for assessing a project with formally revised
objectives, the outcome of the project under the original objectives and under the revised
objectives is estimated separately, and the overall Outcome is a weighted average of the two
ratings, with the weights based on the share of final disbursements disbursed as of the time of
                                                         28


restructuring. On this basis, as disbursements under the original objectives are significantly
larger than under the revised objectives, the Social Action Project‘s Outcome was
Satisfactory.37

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.61 Political and institutional commitment to support the Social Action Project‘s
investments appears favorable. Government is strongly backing the community investment
program, which it considers central to poverty alleviation and development of grass-roots
society. The necessary support to the implementing agencies can be expected to continue,
although this needs to be reflected in sufficient budget allocations, a problem during the
project period (refer below). For the agencies themselves, the key needs will be that: NaCSA
continues to provide good coordination, and technical assistance; the Local Councils further
develop their capacity to manage the programs in their districts; and the line ministries
continue their support through technical assistance and provision of teachers, nurses, and
regular supplies of medicines and materials. As concerns the cash-for-work program, the
provision of temporary employment which was the program‘s objective, has already been
implemented, although, for maintenance of the roads that were constructed, continued
funding will be needed.

2.62 The most fundamental need is for continued commitment by the communities. Actual
or proxy findings related to the project‘s achievements indicate broad-based participation
within most communities, appreciation of the services provided by their sub-projects, and
motivation to maintain their investment. Consistent with this, most sub-projects, although
still recently constructed, were operating and in good condition at the time of the 2010 BIA.

2.63 Insufficient government financing of the recurrent costs of providing the services
associated with the infrastructure is the project‘s main risk. A shortfall in counterpart funds
was an implementation problem during the earlier years of the project. The gaps and delays
in Government funding might be expected to continue. As government finances teachers,
medical personnel and materials such as medicines and pedagogical supplies, this would
disrupt services. Two factors mitigate this risk. First is Government‘s high regard for the
community and cash-for-work programs, making chronic financing deficiencies less likely.
Second, the country‘s fiscal situation will likely improve from 2013, once the new iron ore
revenues come on-stream. Risk to Development Outcome is Moderate.

  Disbursements at the time of restructuring were $37.94 million. Disbursements for the additional objective
were $ 8.1 million, resulting in total disbursements at project closure of $ 45.94 million. The weights are, thus,
37.94/45.94 = 0.826 for the original objectives, and 8.0/45.94 = 0.174 for the revised objectives. Outcome
ratings are given scores of one to six, six being for highly satisfactory, five for satisfactory, four for moderately
satisfactory, and so forth, descending to one for a highly unsatisfactory project. Under the original objectives
the satisfactory outcome gets a score of five, and under the revised objectives the moderately satisfactory rating
gets a score of four. The share of the original objectives in the overall outcome is 5 X 0.826 = 4.130 and the
share for the revised objectives is 3 X 0.174 = 0.696. The overall outcome is 4.130 + 0.696 = 4.826. Rounding
to the nearest whole number, the outcome is five, which translates to a ―Satisfactory‖ rating for the project‘s
overall outcome.

QUALITY OF M&E

2.64 M&E Design had a systematic reporting system for operational monitoring, but few
monitorable indicators to evaluate the quality and outcomes of the project, as discussed
earlier.

2.65 M&E Implementation provided regular output type data for operational purposes,
but the gap in regular monitoring of outcome data persisted. The two Beneficiary Impact
Assessments in 2006, at about mid-point of the project, and in 2010, the last year of the
project, only partially made up for this.

2.66 M&E Utilization: The 2006 and 2010 BIAs have helped inform NaCSA
management and Bank staff on the aspects of the project that have been beneficial and what
needs revising. Both have recommendation sections to this effect. However, as noted above,
outcome-oriented data have been limited and, where they exist, tend to be based on focus
group discussions, which largely provide qualitative rather than quantitative assessments. In
addition, the BIA surveys and the Qualitative Assessment survey have some methodological
and sampling limitations (Annex C).

2.67 Use of monitoring systems for project outputs has been more successful. NaCSA‘s
Management Information System has become a well-integrated and important part of its
management. The M&E cell‘s quarterly reports (based mainly on data provided by the
various headquarter divisions and district coordinators) are the main documents used in
management meetings. An action plan is prepared after each meeting, which is then itself
monitored for actions taken, and as needed, followed up with instructions to lagging units.

2.68 Although operational monitoring was good, given the weaknesses in monitoring
outcomes and the limited evaluative evidence collected, the overall quality of the project‘s
M&E system was Modest.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

2.69 In the difficult circumstances of the immediate post-war period, the Bank designed a
project to address two critical needs: reestablishment of social infrastructure and services;
and, building the capacity of local communities for collective action. The Bank launched a
particularly participatory community-driven development approach, devising effective
institutional, implementation, and fiduciary arrangements. M&E was well designed for
management decision making, though wanting in assessing project outcomes. Nevertheless,
given that the project‘s design was in other respects good, Quality at Entry is rated
Satisfactory.

Quality of Supervision

2.70 The Bank provided experienced staff specialized in areas relevant to the project.
Supervision was regular and intensive, the team working closely with Government and
NaCSA, which helped resolve most project implementation problems. Fiduciary
                                              30


management was assiduous. The lack of outcome measurements in the M&E system was
partially made up for through the beneficiary impact assessments, but there were still gaps.
The Bank reacted to the food price crisis expeditiously. Under emergency procedures the first
Additional Financing grant was approved on July 29, 2008 – shortly after the peak in rice
prices in April-May. All NaCSA and government officials met by the IEG mission had
strongly favorable views of the Bank and its supervision (and preparation) team. While the
cash-for-work program had a number of difficulties, the task team made adjustments, and the
lessons learned were reflected in improved design features for future programs.

2.71 The follow-on activities for the community-driven development program could have
received greater attention. While the cash-for-work program was continued as a component
of the Youth Employment Support Project, there was no such provision for the more
complex community-driven program. Neither continued Bank support nor a planned exit
strategy was implemented. In the event, the task team informally persuaded the Islamic
Development Bank to finance continuation of the community-driven program, but a planned
and specifically designed exit strategy or a follow-on community development project would
have provided more assurance that continued funding would be provided, as well as the
necessary technical guidance. However, as concerns the project period, in the difficult task of
pioneering and steering a new community driven development approach responsive to Sierra
Leone‘s needs, supervision was strong and a key factor in the Social Action Project‘s
success. Overall, the Bank‘s Supervision Performance was Satisfactory. Taking account of
both Quality at Entry and Supervision performance, the Bank‘s Overall Performance was
also Satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

2.72 Government strongly owned the project and the community-driven development
approach. It provided an enabling policy and institutional environment, including dependable
back-up to NaCSA in the difficult area of decentralizing activities and creating institutional
cooperation between NaCSA, the line ministries and the Local Councils. Government was
also proactive in helping resolve implementation problems encountered as the project
proceeded. Cooperation with the Bank was excellent.

2.73 The main difficulty was in provision of counterpart funds. The country‘s critical
fiscal constraints contributed to financing shortfalls from Government in the early years of
the project, and slowed implementation. This reduces an otherwise strong Government
Performance to a Moderately Satisfactory performance overall.

Implementing Agency Performance

2.74 At project commencement, NaCSA had limited overall capacity, and minimal
experience with community-driven development approaches. NaCSA took on the new
approach and was a proactive learner and implementer throughout the project period,
progressively increasing its effectiveness. NaCSA vigorously embraced the challenge of
bringing together the line ministries involved, including monthly meetings between NaCSA
                                                      31


and the line ministries, both at central and district levels, the latter also including the Local
Councils. Particularly challenging was helping the councils to build capacity for their future
lead role in field coordination of the program. And most challenging of all for NaCSA was
the motivation, technical assistance, teaching and monitoring of the 600 community-driven
and over 700 cash-for-work sub-projects. The cash-for-work program had mixed
performance, but this was in part due to the need for scale-up on an emergency basis based
on only limited experience. With a less established and field-based institution than NaCSA
was becoming by the time the cash-for-work program commenced, the implementation
problems would likely have been worse. As concerns M&E, monitoring of project outcome
was weak, However, NaCSA had a good management information system which was
effectively used to track project progress and outputs, and the beneficiary assessments partly
made up for the limited attention to outcomes in regular monitoring. Implementing Agency
Performance was Satisfactory.

2.75 Taking into account the Satisfactory Implementing Agency Performance and
Government‘s Moderately Satisfactory performance, Borrower Performance overall is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

3. Food Price Crisis Response Development Policy Grant
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.1     The Food Crisis Grant was an emergency operation responding to the 2007-2008
Food Price Crisis that affected numerous countries world-wide, particularly in 2007 and
2008. The Grant provided budget support to Sierra Leone at the height of the surge in food
prices and was one of the two main actions – the other being the addition of the cash-for-
work program under the Social Action Project - taken by the World Bank to assist the
country‘s short-term efforts to mitigate the hardships brought on by the price hikes.

OBJECTIVES

3.2     According to the Program Document for this development policy operation, the
objectives of the Food Crisis Grant were to:

        "Support the Government's poverty reduction strategy in 2008 by providing the
        authorities with needed fiscal space to partially compensate for the lost revenues
        resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel imports. This support
        would help mitigate the impact of such price increases and contribute to continued
        basic service delivery for vulnerable groups" (World Bank 2008).‖

3.3     These objectives can be broken down into two anticipated outcomes in the short run,
against which the operation will be assessed:38



38
  The two objectives and results chain are presented in Annex 2 (―Program Matrix‖) of the Program Document.
Providing fiscal space (budget support) to partially compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the reduced
                                                        32


        Mitigating the impact of food price increases on consumer welfare; and
        Contributing to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups.

RELEVANCE OF THE OBJECTIVES

3.4     The two objectives were both critical needs in Sierra Leone as it faced the hardships
brought on by the food price crisis. Reducing poverty and improving social services were
well articulated priorities in the Country Assistance Strategy for FY 2006-09, the relevant
policy document at both appraisal and closure of the grant operation.39 Also, the Bank‘s
March 2010 Country Assistance Strategy and Government‘s 2009 Second Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, the ―Agenda for Change,‖ included human development and inclusive
agricultural growth as two of four development targets (the other two were development of
energy and transport infrastructure). The operation‘s objectives were, therefore, broadly
enveloped within the overall strategy, although, interestingly, food security, and specific
actions for reducing the country‘s vulnerability to future price shocks received only minor
attention in the Country Assistance Strategy. They were framed recognizing the limits of
what a modest grant of $3 million could achieve–―supporting‖ the poverty reduction strategy,
and ―partially compensating‖ and ―helping mitigate‖ the impacts of the food price increase,
and it was recognized as a short-term intervention (the 5 months until the end of 2008). The
objectives fit the strategic needs of Sierra Leone at a critical (emergency) juncture, and were
Substantially Relevant in this capacity.

DESIGN

3.5      The operation was funded by a Development Policy Grant of $3 million, disbursed in
a single tranche as emergency budget support to help compensate for the reduced revenues
that the Government was receiving as a result of its response to the food price crisis. A Letter
of Development Policy from the Minister of Finance and Economic Development described
the actions that would be assisted with the extra fiscal space provided by the grant. Prior
actions (implemented before grant approval) were reductions in import tariffs for several
basic food commodities and fuel. These reductions were also specified in the operation‘s
results framework in the Policy Matrix of the Bank‘s Program Document (as summarized in
Table 6). The two policy areas–food security and human development– were based on two
pillars of the Poverty Reduction Strategy:

        Food Security: This policy area supported measures to mitigate the impact of food
         price increases on consumer welfare. This was to be done by maintaining the lower
         import tariffs on main food commodities and oil.40

tariffs on food and fuel imports is a means to achieve the objectives – rather than an outcome. It will thus be
discussed as an action intended to contribute to the two objectives.
39
  There were a number of other policy documents at that time. The June 25, 2008 (first) Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper was issued six weeks before the Grant‘s approval, and a Progress Report for the 2006 -2009
Country Assistance Strategy was released on November 5, 2008, three months after approval.
40
   As discussed in the Framework Document for the Global Food Crisis Response Program (World Bank, June
2008), ―food security‘ has multiple dimensions; amongst them: policy development, short -term response
strategy, agricultural production, post-harvest losses, marketing and storage, commodity trading, social safety
                                                             33


        Human Development: The second policy area contributed to continued basic
         service delivery to vulnerable groups, despite the increased costs resulting from the
         food price hike. The services specified were: (i) feeding for patients in hospitals and
         community health centers; (ii) provision of food 3 times a day for lactating mothers
         and children under five in Ministry of Health and Sanitation Hospitals; and (iii)
         provision of food three times a day for school children, handicapped children, and
         children in remand homes and approved schools.

RELEVANCE OF DESIGN

3.6     The Results Chain. The causal chain between the Food Crisis Grant‘s objectives and
the impact of the operation on these objectives could be expected to be through the following
sequence: The steep rise in international commodity prices would likely be transmitted to
domestic prices. The reduction in import tariffs on cereals and oil could be expected to
reduce the increase in domestic prices of cereals. This in turn would reduce the increase in
the costs of foodstuffs for consumers, thereby somewhat mitigating the negative impact of

nets, advance warning systems, communications and coordination, institutional strengthening, fiscal support,
tariff reductions, investment in infrastructure for production and marketing (e.g., irrigation, feeder roads),
targeted programs for vulnerable groups, and other act ions. The primary focus of the PPAR‘s analysis for the
Food Crisis Grant‘s consumer welfare objective is narrowed down to the action‘s and impacts of the food
import tariff changes that the Grant enabled, although reference is made to other options where relevant.
                                                        34


the international price increases on welfare. The poor would benefit more, as a larger share of
their family incomes is spent on food. The tariff reduction would also reduce revenues for the
treasury, reduce fiscal space, and increase difficulty in funding of public sector activities,
including for social services. The Grant‘s fiscal injection would contribute to maintaining
basic service delivery for vulnerable groups, the operation‘s second objective. However,
achievement of the first objective assumes that tariff reductions would be transmitted to
consumer prices, which rely upon an efficient and fully responsive domestic rice market.
Inadequate data preclude quantitative assessment of the degree of carry-through, but
experience elsewhere, such as in Djibouti (IEG 2012),41 suggests that market distortions can
significantly reduce pass-through to the consumer.

3.7      The relation between the program‘s outputs and outcomes is logical, even if not
quantifiable. If a tariff reduction prevents prices rising as high as they otherwise would, the
cost of living and consumer welfare would be improved. However, given the low level of
tariffs to begin with (from 5 to 20 percent depending on commodity) and the relatively small
absolute reductions, it would be unlikely that this alone would have a major effect on
mitigating price increases42 and improving welfare, while the reduction in revenue could be
predicted. Thus, for the first objective, the design relevance was not strong. The second
objective had a more tangible outcome. Continued school feeding, or food programs for
hospitalized lactating mothers and children under five years old would be expected to
mitigate the impact of the food price crisis on vulnerable groups, who otherwise might lose
those benefits because of budget constraints imposed by higher food prices.

3.8     Choice of Instrument. There was an evident advantage in the Development Policy
Grant instrument, as it could be prepared and disbursed quickly. It also came in at a time
when the crisis was most evident – shortly after the peak in international rice prices. Neither
the Government nor the Bank could presume what would happen next, and a continuation of
the surge in prices would add further hardship for the country‘s already destitute people. A
fear of yet more price increases was developing in Sierra Leone. Protests in urban areas were
beginning to mount, and the prospects of resumed civil unrest carried considerable risk to the
country‘s still fragile social fabric.

3.9     An investment loan would have taken longer to appraise than the Grant and
disbursements would have been linked to specific activities over a much longer time period.
A short cut would have been to embed these funds in an ongoing project such as with the
Social Action Project‘s additional financing for the cash-for-work program which was
prepared quickly and approved in August, 2008, the same month as the Food Crisis Grant.
However, disbursements against actual expenditures, as in any investment loan, could not
create the fiscal space that budget support could provide. The $3 million budget transfer is
not large relative to annual government revenues and expenditures, but has greater

41
  The PPAR for the Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant in the Republic of Djibouti comments
that ―There is statistically strong evidence of some pass through from world prices to domestic prices, although
the correlation coefficient (71 percent) is sufficiently less than one to suggest that there are some other more
dominant factors at play. It is possible that removal of taxes increased traders‘ margins rather than being passed
through to consumers.‖
42
     This was a point made in the Global Food Crisis Response Program framework document.
                                              35


significance when compared to the projected budget deficit at that time of $48 million, the
estimated loss in revenues due to the tariff reductions ($5.4 million), and the expected
increase in the costs of delivering basic services of $3.5 million.

3.10 The relevance of the funding of social programs to vulnerable groups was substantial,
but in Sierra Leone‘s circumstances, the tariff reductions would have had little impact on
food prices and consumer welfare. The Relevance of the Grant‘s Design to its objectives was
Modest.

Implementation
3.11 The Food Crisis Grant was appraised in July 2008 and approved 12 days later, on
August 6th. The government‘s Letter of Development Policy had been sent to the Bank on
July 25, 2008, and the tariffs had been reduced in March 2008 (prior actions). The grant was
disbursed in a single tranche on August 27, 2008. The operation was formally closed on June
30, 2009. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development was the implementing
agency, and it was intended that two committees would be established for monitoring the
program‘s action plan: at the policy level, an Inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by
the Minister of Finance and Economic Development and, at more operational level, a
Technical Committee chaired by the Secretary of Finance and comprising relevant ministry
and agency heads. There is no record that the Technical Committee was established.

3.12 Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability. The Grant‘s results framework does not
include the measures that Government would take for fiscal stability, but anticipated that
food and fuel prices would rise faster than export prices, resulting in deterioration in the
terms of trade, which would start to be compensated from 2012 by very large earnings from
new iron ore mines. The medium-term objective would be to dampen the inflationary impacts
of the commodity price increases, and to maintain economic growth within a stable
macroeconomic framework, while continuing to finance poverty reduction programs. Prudent
fiscal policy and tightened monetary policy would limit price increases and debt build-up to
sustainable levels.

3.13 Sierra Leone‘s economic situation during and immediately after the food price crisis
showed mixed performance (Table 7). The fiscal balance (overall balance excluding grants)
deteriorated in 2008 to a budget deficit of 9.2 percent of (non-iron ore) GDP. The budget
deficit deteriorated further in 2009 to 11.1 percent of GDP. In contrast, the budget deficit was
lower in 2007 due to a major Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative by the World Bank and the
African Development Bank. The fiscal deficit started to decline from 2010 onwards, but it is
still too high to ensure macroeconomic stability. Inflation in 2008 and 2009 was kept at 10-
11 percent per annum. GDP growth slowed from its average of about 10.2 percent per annum
in the 2002-2007 period to about 5.5 and 3.2 percent per annum in 2008 and 2009
respectively, and then picked up starting from 2010. Macroeconomic management was less
disciplined in 2010 and 2011. Revenues rose, but expenditures increased by over 40 percent
between 2009 and 2010, and the deficit more than doubled. Inflation rose from 11 percent in
2009 to 18 percent in 2010. The IMF 2011 country report expressed concern with the
increased inflation rate but noted a number of actions by Government to tighten fiscal and
                                                                    36


monetary policy. The prognosis, providing macro-economic management is sound, was
considered good, led by the expected high revenues from the new iron mines in 2012-13.

3.14 As a proportion of the country‘s overall budget, education expenditures remained
remarkably uniform at about 18 percent from 2005 to 2009. Health expenditures fell
somewhat – from about 10 percent of budget before the price shock to about 8 percent during
and after the crisis (2008 and 2009) - but in 2010, health expenditures more than doubled as a
new national initiative was launched.43

Achievement of the Objectives
MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF THE FOOD PRICES INCREASES ON CONSUMER WELFARE

3.15 Reduction in tariffs. In March 2008, import tariffs on key foodstuffs and petroleum
were reduced as follows: the rice import tariff was reduced from15 percent to 10 percent; the
wheat tariff from 5 percent to 2.5 percent; wheat flour from 20 percent to 10 percent; sugar
from 20 percent to 10 percent; and petroleum 5 percent to $20/mt.

3.16 Changes in Domestic Food Prices. Reliable data on domestic prices of foodstuffs
are very limited, including for rice. Nevertheless, the trend in the domestic prices of rice is
discernible and appears to have followed the profile of international prices. From remarks
made to IEG by government and consumers, and documents from the time by the media,
NGOs, and other development agencies, domestic rice prices typically increased by between
50 to 100 percent. The change varied depending on: (i) location (urban or rural); (ii) for a
rural area, the degree of self-sufficiency in rice; and (iii) the time frame. As a generalization,
the more that a local market was exposed to international prices (for instance, the urban and
peri-urban areas, especially Freetown), the larger the increase in the consumer price of rice.
A 50 to 100 percent range would have been typical in urban, peri-urban, and more accessible
rural areas where rice consumption exceeds production.

3.17 Rice was the only main food staple in Sierra Leone significantly influenced by
international prices. The prices of cassava and sweet potatoes, largely domestic products, did
not follow the price profile of rice (Annex B, Table B.5). The domestic prices of higher value
commodities such as bonga (dried fish), milk, and eggs also bear no particular relation to the
spike in rice prices.

3.18 Impact of the tariff reductions on food prices. Due to the many variables
influencing prices, and some gaps in data, only an indicative assessment of the impact of the
tariff changes is possible. The tariff reduction for rice of 5 percent (together with the
adjustment in the reference price) would have caused consumer prices to be about six percent
lower than without the tariff reduction (Box 5). Even if import tariffs had been removed in
their entirety, with all the budget implications that this would have had, this would still have
had a relatively small impact on consumer prices compared with the influence of the
international rice market. Further, the reduction might have been less if the tariff changes
were not fully carried through to the consumer.44 Several other simplifications in the
simulation of impacts made above would also tend to reduce the effects on welfare of both
the price surge and the reductions in tariffs.45

3.19 The impact of the rice price increases on consumer welfare and the poor. In the
absence of survey data on consumption, a rough simulation of a household food consumption
budget provides an indicative assessment of the effect of a doubling of rice prices on the cost
44
     As in Djibouti where very little of a tariff reduction was reflected in lower consumer food prices (IEG 2012).
45
   This is not the full impact of the tariff reductions. While changes in the price of rice would have had greatest
impact on the cost of a family‘s food budget, the aggregate impact of the tariff reductions would be marginally
larger if wheat is included, as well as the effect on transport costs of the reduced petroleum tariff.

Box 5. Indicative Impact of the Rice Tariff Reduction on Consumer Prices
An indicative calculation of the impact on the domestic price of rice of the reduction in the rice import
tariff from 15 percent to 10 percent, coupled with a change in the reference price for rice is as below:
        The average international price of rice (current terms) before the food crisis was about
         $300/metric ton (MT) (average of prices of Thailand A1 special, and 5% and 25% broken).
        Before the food price crisis a tariff of 15 percent and a reference price of $260/MT was used.
         (The ―reference price‖ is the price set by Government for the purpose of levying the tariff.) .
        These values increase the import price of rice by $39/MT leading to a price of $339/MT as
         follows: $300 plus 0.15 X 260 = $339/MT.
        In 2008, international rice prices doubled, resulting in the international price of rice increasing
         from $300/MT to $600/MT.
        Assume first that there are no changes in the way that Government estimates the overall levy
         on rice imports. Hence, the tariff of 15% remains, and the ratio of the reference price to the
         import price (260/300 = 0.87) also remains the same. This ratio results in a new reference
         price of $522/MT (0.87 X 600). Hence the overall levy is 0.15 X $522 = $ 78/MT, and the
         price of rice imports after the levy becomes $600 + 78 = $678/MT.
        Taking now the actual changes, the tariff is reduced from 15% to 10% and the reference price
         is adjusted to only $375 (well short of the 0.87 ratio applied before the crisis). The import price
         of rice becomes $600 + 0.1 X 375 = $638/MT.
        Thus, the import price of rice after levies has decreased from $678/MT to $638/MT; a
         reduction of about $40/MT or 6%.
        By comparison, the import price will have gone from $339/MT in 2007 to $638/MT, an
         increase of 88%.
Source: IEG estimation


of food consumption.46 This is based on an IEG focus group discussion with a group of urban
women, the simulation being for a ―modest income‖ urban household (with sufficient income
to afford what was considered a reasonably balanced diet).47

3.20 A typical food basket for a family of 2 adults and 2 children would be about Leone
20,000 per day (about $4.6 for the family or a little under $1.00 per person) at early 2011
prices (Annex B, Table B.6). In this diet, family rice consumption would represent Leone
3,000 ($0.70) per day. This is about 15 percent of the family‘s total food expenditures. With
a doubling of the market price for rice, the daily consumption cost of rice would rise to
Leone 6,000, an increase in the family‘s food budget of 15 percent (by about 7.5 percent in
the case of a 50 percent rice price increase). The average share of food costs in overall
household expenditures in Sierra Leone is just over 50 percent. Hence, if rice prices doubled,
the overall cost of living for this household can be expected to have gone up by about 7.5
percent. The impact from the tariff reduction would have been much smaller – about a one
percentage point reduction in the increase in the cost of living. Thus, the reduction in the

and incomes was completed in 2011, but analyzed results are still to come.
47
  From a focus group comprising one woman (professional, mother) as main interlocutor in an interactive
discussion with other participating women. The group was asked to provide a possible food budget for a typical
modest to low income urban family.
                                                       39


tariff would have had little discernible impact for such a family. In actuality the impact is
likely to be smaller because the simulation assumes that the tariff reduction is fully passed
through to consumer prices48 and that consumers do not alter their diets by substituting other
food staples in place of rice.49

3.21 The effect of other government actions on food prices. In addition to the reduction
in tariffs, Government took a number of other measures to temper the rise in rice prices. An
understanding was reached between the Government and Sierra Leone‘s three major
importers of rice to limit the extent and pace of their rice price increases; a consortium of
local wholesalers was established for dialogue between Government and rice traders; traders
in Freetown and the districts were monitored to counter any hoarding and local monopolies;
selective food distributions at subsidized prices were made to vulnerable groups; rice exports
were banned and border posts with Guinea and Liberia were charged with enforcing these
restrictions.

3.22 Most of Government‘s actions were short-term in nature and would be unlikely to
stand-up to market forces in the longer term. Nevertheless, for the approximately 12 month
period of high international rice prices these actions are likely to have had some impact on
rising rice prices. Further, most did not require substantial Government expenditure. This
begs the question as to whether actions such as these might be more influential on prices, and
more cost effective to implement, than tariff reductions. This question is reinforced by the
generally lower increases in the domestic prices of rice compared with international prices.
International prices more than doubled, whereas, according to the sporadic data available, the
increases in domestic prices were typically below 100 percent for urban consumers, nearer to
half that in some estimations, and lower than 50 percent outside the urban and peri-urban
areas. If the gap between domestic and international prices is indeed substantial, it would be
hard to explain the lower domestic prices without ascribing some influence from the non-
tariff actions above.

3.23 To summarize, the budget transfer helped enable Government to maintain its tariff
reductions at a time when the fiscal balance was particularly tight. The direct impact of the
tariff reductions was to mitigate the increase in rice prices by about 6 percent (that is,
consumer prices would have been about 6 percent higher without the tariff reductions). This
was a small impact relative to the estimated 50 to 100 percent increases in consumer rice
prices in the urban and peri-urban areas. The grant‘s significance is even less when
considered within the context of Government‘s overall action program to address the food

48
  International experience suggests that full pass-through is not necessarily the case, such as in the PPAR for
the Djibouti Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (IEG 2012).
49
  The simulation contains a number of simplifications for estimation purposes, in particular: (i) Complete pass-
through to consumers of international price changes, whereas this could be more or less than the percentage
change in border prices depending on trader behavior, collusion, other Government actions and other factors;
and (ii) the price change is assumed not to alter the amount of rice that a household eats. For the ―modest
income‖ household simulated, this may be substantial ly correct given the cultural significance of rice in Sierra
Leone diets. But destitute households would likely reduce rice consumption and substitute cheaper food staples,
such as cassava; and (iii) the price impacts are calculated only for rice whereas tariffs were reduced for several
other food staples (though these commodities are minor cost elements in typical Sierra Leone diets.
                                                40


price crisis, and the decision to reduce already modest food tariffs increased the fiscal deficit,
making it necessary to intervene to protect ongoing feeding programs for the vulnerable. The
Grant‘s Efficacy mitigating the impact of the food price increases on consumer welfare is
therefore assessed as Modest.

CONTINUED DELIVERY OF BASIC SERVICES FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS

3.24 An Action Plan acceptable to the World Bank to protect the provision of basic
services to vulnerable groups was a prior action for the operation and was contained in the
Letter of Development Policy sent to the Bank on July 25, 2008.

3.25 The services to be supported were for continuing institutional feeding programs,
either as part of health services or for schools. Funds were needed to absorb the substantial
rise in the cost of meals due to the food price crisis. Thus, the need was to provide short-run
(defined as the five month period from August to December 2008) financial support to the
government for continuing these existing services. The Letter of Development Policy had
laid out the numbers of beneficiaries who would continue to benefit from its feeding
program, and according to government monitoring reports, these targets were achieved.
About 3,500 children in boarding schools or children who were handicapped continued to be
fed as against a target of 3,000 children; and 380 children in approved schools or remand
homes were fed compared with a targeted 500 (reduced as the number of children in homes
declined). On the health facilities side, 8,200 lactating mothers and children under five were
fed compared with the targeted 5,300; and 12,734 patients in district hospitals or community
health centers were fed, nearly at the targeted 12,800 patients. All of these beneficiaries were
from vulnerable groups

3.26 Monitoring of the program was overseen by the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development, with responsibility for data collection under the ministries of education and
health for their respective sectors. Data were provided directly to these ministries by the
institutions benefitting from the program. A draft implementation report was prepared by the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Development in June 2009, and a final report was issued
in December 2009. Data from the district hospitals and remand homes were provided late,
but the ICR comments that by the ministry‘s final report the information had been received
(with the exception of the information from one hospital).

3.27 While monitoring of the number of beneficiaries appears to have been thorough, no
information is available on the quality of the government feeding program or the number of
calories provided per beneficiary. There is some empirical information on feeding programs
financed by development agencies, but these are not necessarily equivalent. Donor funded
programs may provide the concerned institutions with more technical support, and the
nutritional quality of the meals may be different. Further, the Government program is all for
residential feeding whereas the programs financed by the development community tend to be
for non-residential beneficiaries. This makes some yardsticks of quality only marginally
relevant. Nevertheless, accepting these caveats, the benefits stemming from the donor funded
feeding programs may at least partially apply for the government program. Also indicative is
the sustained interest and involvement in feeding programs of a number of development
                                                       41


agencies and NGOs. Such commitment would not be there if the feeding programs were not
providing benefits.

3.28 The feeding program at health facilities was maintained, facilitated by the increased
budget enabled by the Food Crisis Grant. Breastfeeding mothers and children under 5 years
old are particularly in need of adequate nutrition, and in the absence of the program, patients
in district hospitals and community centers typically received minimal or no food, relying on
family or the good will of others; even from the doctors‘ and nurses‘ own salaries in the case
of one hospital.50

3.29 In summary, while empirical data are limited, there is evidence that the services were
continued, in most cases at 2007 levels or higher, though it is not known how much was
actually provided and whether it was sufficient for adequate nutrition. However, assuming
that the counterfactual would have been no food or reduced food provided by the institutions
(because of inadequate government budget), the continuation of the feeding programs likely
prevented a reduction in welfare among the beneficiaries. The Food Crisis Grant‘s Efficacy
contributing to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups during the last five
months of 2008 was Substantial.

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.30 The Food Crisis Grant‘s two objectives – mitigation of the impact of the increases in
food prices on consumer welfare and continued delivery of social services to the vulnerable –
were substantially relevant to Sierra Leone‘s efforts to mitigate a rapidly developing food
crisis. The extreme poverty of a large proportion of the population left them particularly
vulnerable to the domestic price increases‘ effects on their costs of living and family welfare.
Government tried to mitigate the price increases by lowering import tariffs. However, given
the low initial level of the food tariffs, their small reduction, and the very high increase in
food prices, lowering the tariffs was not likely to have an appreciable impact on the food
price increase or consumer welfare. The operation‘s design relevance was therefore modest.
Maintaining social services was relevant, but threatened by a critical shortage of government
funds due to reduced revenues. In helping to maintain a part of the social safety net, the grant
was valuable. The Grant‘s efficacy in mitigating the short-term impact of food price
increases on consumer welfare was modest, and its impact on consumer prices is likely to
have been significantly smaller than the impact of the other short-term actions taken by the
government to counter the spike in rice prices. Overall, the Food Crisis Grant‘s Outcome
was Moderately Satisfactory.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.31 The Food Crisis Grant‘s development outcome is, from a project perspective, already
over. The Grant was intended as a short-term response to the food crisis, not as an
investment. In the broader perspective, however, food security risks remain. The chances of

50
     As reported for the Sierra Leone Psychiatric Hospital by the Concord Times newspaper on April 23, 2008.
                                                        42


price shocks in the international rice market do not appear any different now than before the
food crisis and could become more so if large countries such as China need periodic
substantial importations of rice to compensate for a poor harvest. A major effort has been
made by Government to increase food production (cereals, cassava, and other staples),
especially of rice,51 and several Bank projects are also contributing to agricultural
development.52 This has had some success. The three year average of milled rice production
increased by 70 percent over the six years from 2005-2007 to 2010-2012. But consumption
and imports of rice also increased over the same period.53 As a result, while Sierra Leone‘s
reliance on imports has fallen slightly (from 23 percent of consumption in 2005-2007 to 17
percent of consumption in 2010-2012), the gap still leaves the country vulnerable to
international price fluctuations, especially as concerns the population in urban areas. Thus,
both in terms of the possibility of a surge in international rice prices, and the likely impact
from such an event, risks from food price shocks remain. Repeat operations of similar design
would not be a sustainable solution. The Grant‘s Risk to Development Outcome is, therefore,
rated Significant. Nevertheless, a more strategic approach to food security is developing,
which could lower the risk environment. A food security ―framework‖ was issued by
Government in 2009 with assistance from USAID, and a ―policy implementation plan‖ was
issued in 2012.54 These lay out a number of the elements for an overall strategy, and may
form the basis for more comprehensive food security actions over time.55

BANK PERFORMANCE

Quality at Entry

3.32 The Bank responded rapidly (13 days between Government‘s Letter of Development
Policy and Board Presentation) to the food price crisis. Bank staff worked well with
Government, supporting its short-term response to the crisis. The understanding reached with

51
  Among the measures taken have been campaigns to improve agronomic practices for main food staples such
as rice and cassava, introduction of a higher yielding, shorter duration rice variety (Nerica), promotion of larger
private sector farms, using higher technologies tha n smallholders, and investment in irrigation. The ―National
Sustainable Agriculture Development Plan, 2010-2030‖ (September 2009) provides a schematic overview of
some of these actions.
52
  Notably, the Rural Development and Private Sector Development Project (FY07), financing agricultural value
chains, and the Infrastructure Development Project (FY06) which includes rural roads.
53
  All data are from the US Department of Agriculture as of February 2013, expressed as milled rice. The three
year average for rice production 1n 2005-2007 was 410,000 metric tons, and in 2010 -2012 was 696,000 MT.
Imports averaged 122,000 MT in 2005-2007 and 141,000 MT in 2010-2012.
54
  ‗Sierra Leone Food Security Country Framework FY 2010 -2014‖, USAID, 2009; and ―Sierra Leone Food
and Nutrition Security Policy Implementation Plan, 2012-2016.
55
  The framework document provides a comprehensive overview of food security issues and possible actions,
but its purpose was not to detail an actual plan. The food and nutrition security policy implementation plan is in
considerably more detail. It is particularly detailed in reviewing social issues such as nutrition, maternal and
infant health, hygiene and common diseases, and it also overviews areas such as agriculture and disaster
preparedness. These areas, especially agriculture and short-term response, would have merited further detailing;
and other matters such as an ordering of priorities, capacity development, and a roll-out plan for the main
actions, might also have been included or given greater prominence.
                                               43


Government regarding maintenance of social services was practical, and fitted within
Government‘s crisis response actions. M&E design covered tracking of outputs such as
numbers of beneficiaries served but lacked plans to assess the quality of the feeding
programs. But the principal shortcoming of the operation‘s quality at entry was the lack of
assessment of the low probable impact of the tariff reductions on consumer welfare. The
speed of processing did not allow deliberate assessment of policy options provided in the
GFRP Framework Document. This qualifies an otherwise strong performance of the Bank,
leading to a Moderately Satisfactory Quality at Entry overall.

Quality of Supervision

3.33 Supervision was part of the broader policy dialogue with Government which was
sufficient for a short-term grant related to ongoing social services that had no particular need
for technical assistance. As concerns the feeding program‘s progress, this was monitored
closely and delays in M&E reporting appropriately noted and discussed with Government,
resulting in complete data on project outputs by the end of the project. There were two
Implementation Status Reports, with issues (primarily the M&E delays) proactively followed
up with Government. Supervision Performance was Satisfactory.

3.34 Taking account of both the quality at entry and of supervision, the Bank‘s Overall
Performance was Moderately Satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Government Performance

3.35 Government was strongly committed to the operation and was clear on what it wanted
and the actions that it would take as part of its overall policy. This was well conveyed in its
Letter of Development Policy. The High-level Inter-ministerial Task Force ensured that
social actions were implemented and that government funds went in timely manner to the
appropriate ministries. Despite the numerous development agencies involved with mitigating
the food crisis, including several other budget support operations, Government effectively
ensured that there was no duplication of activities between the agencies. Preparation for the
Grant was fast, and relations with the Bank were seamless. Government Performance was
Satisfactory.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY PERFORMANCE

3.36 The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development effectively headed the Inter-
ministerial Task Force, coordinated the ministries involved, and was the primary government
actor preparing the project and partnering the Bank during implementation. It assiduously
followed project progress and was instrumental in getting project monitoring up to date. The
intention at appraisal was to have an inter-ministerial technical committee headed by the
Secretary of Finance and Economic Development, to monitor the Food Crisis Grant, but
there is no indication that it was ever established. The two main agencies implementing the
feeding program were the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and the Ministry of Education,
Science and Technology. The feeding programs reached the numbers of beneficiaries
                                              44


intended. Both Ministries were slow in reporting on progress, though this was primarily due
to their need to rely on the promptness with which the various hospitals and schools provided
data. But taken as a whole, the performance of the Implementing Agencies was Satisfactory.
Taking account of both the performance of Government and the performance of the
implementing agencies, the Borrower‘s overall Performance was Satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.37 M&E Design: Monitoring was to be under a technical committee formed from the
ministries involved which would overview collection of data by each line agency. Data
would be provided to the committee by each agency on a monthly basis. The line agencies
were to collect the data. Data to be collected were primarily outputs such as the number of
persons benefitting from each project activity, rather than outcome related indicators such as
the quality of the feeding programs.

3.38 M&E Implementation: Monitoring was enough to measure output achievements
such as the number of schools assisted. More outcome oriented aspects – including
information on the amount of food and nutritional status - would have been desirable. The
frequency of data reporting varied between agencies, some being very slow. Reporting
during the project was sporadic.

3.39 M&E Utilization: Despite the weaknesses above, data for most social activities
appears to have been produced (though irregularly), and complete and up-to-date data were
available at project closure. However, reflecting the original design, data were restricted to
outputs, limiting the degree to which the quality and impact of the feeding program on health
and education could be empirically assessed.

3.40   The quality of M&E overall was Modest.

4. Lessons
4.1     Attempts to lower prices through reducing tariffs on imported foodstuffs have
direct consequences on government revenues yet may have only marginal impact on
consumer prices relative to the much larger impacts off international price changes.
The impact of the tariff reductions on rice prices (about six percent) was small, and
insignificant relative to the doubling of food prices influenced by international market forces.
The impact on households‘ cost of living was even smaller. Meanwhile, Government had
taken an array of separate actions to buffer the increase in rice prices, which are likely to
have had greater short-term impact and at lower cost than the tariff reductions. This raises the
question as to whether the operation was an efficient way of mitigating the price increases.

4.2     The effectiveness of a cash-for-work program can be compromised in its effort to
target benefits to particular social groups in the absence of: (i) clear criteria and
processes that ensure objective selection of communities and individual beneficiaries;
(ii) communities as the primary deciders on the type of works to be done and selection
of the participating individuals; and (iii) greater women’s participation and
differentiation of activities better suited for women. The Social Action Project‘s cash-for-
                                                45


work program primarily reached its target groups, especially for youths. But selection
processes for the individual participants were not uniformly applied, allowing situations
where vested interests influenced selection of the individuals. Communities felt that their
participation could have assured more objectively based selection of the beneficiaries, and
choice of investments responding better to the communities‘ priorities. Women‘s
participation would have been higher if work activities had been differentiated between more
strength-based activities for men and less physical tasks for women.

4.3     High community participation helped the Social Action Project’s communities to
“own? their sub-projects and foster interest in maintaining their investment and
operating the service. The project‘s community sub-projects were mostly effective in
establishing community institutions, infrastructure and services, and there are some
indications that they might be sustained beyond the short-term. An IEG review of the Bank‘s
experience with social funds found that a common experience with such funds was that
community infrastructure was not adequately maintained and that the facilities and services
were relatively short-lived. Whereas a common approach for social funds is to place the
infrastructure as first consideration, with participatory processes often in a less dominant
role, the Social Action Project placed communities and community processes at the fore.
Decisions, implementation and operations were the community‘s responsibility, and
necessarily required a high degree of interaction and cooperation which helped create
collective ―ownership‖ of the asset and service. The luxury of choosing a highly participatory
approach may not be there for social funds responding to urgent disaster recovery, but where
possible, participatory approaches may have better chances of sustainability.

4.4      Add-on emergency components to existing projects, which experience has shown
often encounter implementation difficulties, have greater chances of success with an
established institutional base. The addition of the cash-for-work program to the Social
Action Project benefitted from an experienced field-oriented agency (NaCSA) operating in
all the country‘s districts. It had also done a small pilot for cash-for-work giving it at least a
minimal base for scale-up.

4.5      In a food emergency operation there may be a trade-off between a rapid, larger-
scale response at the cost of some reduction in quality, compared with a better prepared
operation that is slower in mitigating the emergency. The cash-for-work program was
prepared quickly, when rice prices were still high, and was implemented quickly. However,
had the program been prepared in a more deliberated way, and implemented with less haste,
it is likely that there would been fewer design and implementation shortcomings.

The way forward

4.6      While these operations addressed the short-run impact of food price increases, and
Government‘s 2009 food security framework and 2012 policy implementation plan provide
many of the actions that would enhance food security further, there is no comprehensive
longer-term food security plan showing the inter-linkages between the various actions and
institutions involved. The design and value of the food crisis grant and the cash-for-work
program helped Sierra Leone respond to the immediate needs of the food emergency. The
Bank portfolio as a whole also potentially contributes to improved food security (such as the
                                              46


projects related to health, education, youth employment, roads and marketing chains). But
without a comprehensive plan to integrate such operations within an overall food security
strategy, to consider gaps in emergency response, to reduce future vulnerability, and to think
through institutional responsibilities and coordination, relevant needs and potential synergies
may be missed. Such a plan would also benefit from a more integrated agricultural
development program to draw the Government‘s ongoing actions to promote agricultural
development into a more interlinked strategy.

Annex C. Design and limitations of survey data used in the
assessment of the National Social Action Project
2010 Beneficiary Impact Assessment56

Design. The 2010 assessment was primarily of the community-driven sub-projects under the
Social Action Project‘s original design. All 13 of Sierra Leone‘s districts other than Freetown
were sampled (the sampling was not linked to the 2006 impact assessment). A sample was
taken of 90 sub-projects, out of the Social Action Project‘s total of 600 sub-projects, using a
two-stage cluster sampling method. First, the 600 sub-projects were stratified by district, and
a sample of sub-projects (about 7 per district) was then selected randomly using a probability
proportional to size method to provide a self-weighted mix of sub-project types. For the
selected sub-projects, a random sample of 10 households was taken from the population of
households and two adults ( husband and wife as first preference) were chosen from each
household. Through this method, 1683 respondents were selected, a 6% shortfall against the
theoretical number of respondents (90 X 10 X 2 or 1800 respondents) due to attrition and
other factors. The survey was supplemented by a focus group discussion in each community
with either an all-female group or a male group. A third source of information was through
in-depth interviews with other stakeholders such as NGOs, and a larger number of local
councils (25), sub-project management committees (27) and NaCSA field and national level
officials. Quantitative data analysis used Statistical Packages for Social Scientists. Secondary
sources of information (reports) were also used to inform the report. For each survey process
(individual interviews, focus groups, interviews of other stakeholders) observation checklists
were provided to provide background guidance of methodology and question areas, and the
household interviews were based on structured questionnaire forms.

The broad assessment areas that the survey attempted to cover (Appendix 2 of the survey)
included: effectiveness of maintenance of the sub-projects, degree of social inclusion in
community decisions and actions, social capital, capacity building and organizational
development, degree of community participation in sub-project selection, design and
implementation, measures of the degree to which community sub-projects achieved intended
impacts (e.g. school enrollment, utilization of health facilities, views on whether the sub-
project had been beneficial/successful), community ―ownership‖ of sub-projects, NaCSA
interrelations with the communities and the contributions of Local Councils and other
secondary stakeholders.

Limitations. The survey is a useful source of information, but had a number of limitations
and potential biases which need circumspect interpretation of varying degree, depending on
the specific question area, how questions were framed, and the sample sizes where data are
disaggregated. Attribution is the most difficult issue. There was no non-project sample;
analysis was longitudinal, with no comparison group outside the project. This then raises the

question as to how much of a change can be attributed to the project itself and how much due
to the influence of other factors such as general development or related programs. For
instance, enrollment and test scores increased for project primary schools, but were there also
other influences such as government programs to increase the quality of teachers and to
provide books? Schools outside the project may also have had improved results. The health
and education sector projects that ran concurrently with the project are thus discussed in this
PPAR for these reasons. There is also the difficulty that the survey sample had no precursor
survey (the 2006 Beneficiary Impact Assessment was a different sample). Thus, for some
questions, requiring retrospective responses from interviewees of situations ―before the
project‖ compared with current situations. Secondly, the survey had a number of leading
questions (for example, ―How have you benefitted‖) that might bias the responses. As
concerns sample size, this can vary by type of infrastructure and other matters, and may be
too small for some measures. Sample size has thus been reported in the PPAR‘s tables and
text, and has also influenced the selection of data to be considered. Finally, the survey relies
to a substantial extent on qualitative rather than quantitative information making comparisons
and evaluation of impact more difficult.

2006 Beneficiary Impact Assessment

Design. The 2006 BIA was commissioned by NaCSA with Social Action Project funding and
carried out by a team of consultants from the Nordic Consulting Group, Denmark, and
Business-Engineering Science and Technology consultants, Freetown. Information was
obtained through (i) a sample survey of individual beneficiaries; (ii) beneficiary focus
groups; and (iii) interviews with about 50 involved stakeholders (nurses, teachers, NGOs,
District Councils, NaCSA, and staff from the ministries of health, education and other
involved agencies). The main activity was the household sample survey. A sample of 17 sub-
projects from nine Districts was taken by the consultants from a list provided by NaCSA of
the first 100 sub-projects completed as of February 2006. The projects were stratified by
district and main types of subprojects (schools, clinics, community centers, etc.), and by
gender a category for youths, and thereafter was random from these strata. The overall
sample size was 630 individuals. The focus group exercise was based on five focus groups
for each sub-project community of which four would be ordinary community members and
one would be of the project management committee. The total number of focus groups was
96. Additionally, 3 communities without a Social Action Project were selected. Field
interviews were pre-tested in February 2006, the bulk of fieldwork undertaken in March
2006, and the report issued in May 2006.

Limitations. The 2006 Beneficiary Impact Assessment shares most of the survey limitations
of the 2010 survey, including the attribution difficulty and the need to partly rely on
qualitative information. Nevertheless, the sample selection process is more completely
described, adding some credibility in thus respect. As with the 2010 survey, where possible
the PPAR has triangulated from the different sources of data (household survey, focus groups
and interviews with stakeholders), plus IEG mission field observations and interviews, to
better assess findings. Due to its smaller sample size and use of substantial stratification, the
2006 BIA may be less reliable than the 2010 survey and findings, especially where there is
little possibility of triangulating from other sources, and the results risk misleading.

Qualitative Assessment of the Cash-for-Work Program57

Design. Primary data were from a stratified sampling process. In each district two cash-for-
work communities were selected; one from the District town and one from a locality outside
the town (16 rather than 14 communities were in the event selected as in one district four
sites were chosen; no reason is provided). Selection of the communities was done randomly.
From the 16 sample communities, two focus groups were formed, one of primary
beneficiaries (actual participants in the program) and one of secondary beneficiaries from the
locality but not directly involved. Thus, there were 32 focus groups in the sample,
representing nine percent of the total number of completed sites. Focus group discussions
followed a structured guide to enable comparison of findings. Field work was done in
February 2010. In addition, the consultants interviewed other stakeholders such as NaCSA,
the Local Council, chiefs, women‘s leaders and youth leaders. Written material as available
was also used.

Limitations. The main limitation is the qualitative nature of the survey. Assessment findings
are presented in a discussion form organized by topic (such as wages given, implementation
issues, performance of contractors, and other matters). The bulk of the discussion is a verbal,
qualitative discussion based on the consultants‘ interpretation of these various information
sources. The discussion is considered and appears balanced, providing valuable insight and
perspectives, but there is little in terms of quantitative data to back this up.

The Cash-for-Work part of the Beneficiary Impact Assessment

Design. The survey was also of the first phase of the cash-for-work program, covering the
seven districts involved. Sample size was 46 cash-for-work communities (out of an initial
target of 52). Sampling methodology is not entirely clear but appears to have been that the
sample was first stratified by District with communities then chosen randomly. The 46 sites
represent 13 percent of the total number of sites (341) completed at the time of the survey.
For each community a focus group was formed comprising ―mixed groups of direct and
secondary beneficiaries.‖ (BIA, page 73).

Limitations. Somewhat similar to the Qualitative Assessment in lacking empirical content.
Nevertheless, a broad discussion based on the consultants‘ findings is provided, and the
variability of experiences of the communities is illustrated with cited examples and candid
and more detailed commentary where particular issues, such as the performance of
contractors, were encountered
