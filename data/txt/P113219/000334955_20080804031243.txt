      PROPOSEDFOODCRISISRESPONSEDEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT
                           GRANTAND PROGRAMSUMMARY

Recipient:     Republic o f Sierra Leone
Implementing
Agency:        MinistryofFinanceandEconomic Development

Amount:        US$3.0 million
Terms:         TF Grant
Schedule of
Disbursement:  Single tranche to be disbursed upon effectiveness.

Description:   The proposedFoodCrisis ResponseDevelopment Policy Grant o f US$3 million i s intendedto
               support the Government's poverty reduction strategy by providing the authorities with needed
               fiscal space to partially compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced
               tariffs on food and fuel imports. The proposed grant will be financed through the Food Price
               Crisis Response Trust Fund, which was approved by the Board on May 29, 2008. In the
               medium-term, the government intends to stimulate food production through a combination o f
               agricultural investment projects, investments in the road network, especially rural roads, and
               an expansion inthe provision o f extension services.

Benefits:      The measures supported by the proposed grant are expected to have a significant positive
               impact on poverty reduction. By providingthe authorities with neededfiscal space to partially
               compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel
               imports, the operation would help mitigate the impact o f such price increases and contribute to
               continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups, notably school children and patients in
               district hospitals and community health centers.

Risks:         Sierra Leone remains vulnerable to commodity price changes. A further rise inthe prices of
               food or energy could underminethe impact o f the Government's program on the poor. This
               could also create pressures for a civil service wage increase. If food and fuel prices remain
               high for a prolongedperiodor rise further, there is also a riskthat the authorities may resort to
               heterodox policies such as government subsidized importing companies or de facto or de jure
               price fixing.   Such policies could drive private sector importers and producers out o f the
               market, resulting in significant distortions and shortages. These risks are being mitigated
               through intensive monitoring by the Government and dialogue with donors and, inthe case o f
               further significant increasesinfood and fuel prices, may require additional measuresto sustain
               the fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability.          Furthermore, the goal o f redirecting
               resources to offset rising food prices could be made more difficult in the event that revenues
               or grants fall significantly short o f targets or if substantial new and unavoidable spending
               requirements arise. These risks are mitigatedby the Government's manifested commitment to
               adhere to the already established principle o f protecting priority expenditures through
               reductions in less essential spending. Finally, there is a risk that implementation capacity in
               central ministries and local councils may not be sufficient to ensure that targeted beneficiaries
               are served in 2008 at least as well as they had been in 2007, because o f the natural
               replacement o f various key officials due to the political transition inlate 2007 and early 2008.
               MOFED officials indicated they have largely addressed this risk through intensive dialogue
               and monitoringwith the imdementingministries and local councils.

                                         1. INTRODUCTION

1.1     The FA0 has listed Sierra Leone as one o f 8 most vulnerable countries globally in the
current food prices crisis. Roughly 66 percent o f the population lives below the poverty line set
for the 2003/04 household survey. Twenty one percent o f the population in2003/04 was unable
to meet minimum daily caloric requirements.               An average o f 52 percent o f household
consumption i s devoted to food. Within that amount, just under one-third is spent on rice. Rice
i s the main staple food, accounting for roughly one third o f the caloric intake o f the poorest
quintile o f the population. Up to a quarter o f the population now lives in the Freetown area,
away from major production areas and dependent on imported food. Roughly one third o f
national consumptionmust be sourced though imports and food aid. Furthermore, Sierra Leone
has the world's highest rates o f infant andmaternalmortality -thus access to affordable food i s a
major concern.

1.2     Global price increases have reached crisis proportions in2008: the average export price
for rice, for example, increased from US$375/mt in January 2008 to US$775/mt by June 2008.
The impact o f high world food prices i s compounded by the pass-through effects o f higher fuel
prices, which adds to distribution costs, further fueling the rate o f food price inflation across the
world. Thus, it i s not surprisingthat consumer prices for food inSierra Leone have risen rapidly.
The cost o f imported rice in Freetown in December 2007 was 21 percent higher than in the
preceding December while the June 2008 the price was 49 percent higher than in the preceding
June. Similarly, the price o f wheat flour in December 2008 was 11percent higher than a year
earlier andthe June 2008 price was 28 percent higher thaninthe preceding June.

1.3     The combined effect o f these multiple food price increases, combined with recent fuel
price hikes, has not only created severe hardships for the population but also made it more
difficult for the government to maintain the planned level o f basic services to the population.
The government is especially concerned about the programs for education, health, social welfare,
local councils, andthe security services. There is a need for urgent action: the months between
June and December are traditionally known as the "hungry season" and government is deeply
concerned about both welfare and peace during this period. At least 150,000 people could be
pushed below the poverty line by the increased cost o f rice alone according to a preliminary
analysis, raising the poverty headcount for rice consumers by at least 3-4 percentage points to
around 69-70 percent.'

1.4     Thus far, the government has taken several actions to mitigate the impact o f the food and
fuel price increases, notably it has reduced tariff and excise rates on petroleum, rice, flour, wheat
and sugar, reduced the excise tax on petroleumproducts, used funds from a strategic petroleum

reserve to subsidize petroleum product prices for five weeks in June and July o f 2008, and
provided seed rice to farmers. The tariff reductions will result inrevenue losses o f about US$7
million over the course o f 2008. Inaddition, the cost o f delivering priority basic services in2008
has increased by approximately US$5 million, o f which US$3 million is accounted for by the
highercost offood.

1.5     The proposed grant o f US$3 million would support the Government's poverty reduction
strategy in2008 by providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to partially compensate for
the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel imports. This
support would help mitigate the impact of such price increases and contribute to continuedbasic
service delivery for vulnerable groups. Inthe medium-term, the government intends to stimulate
food production through a combination o f agricultural investment projects, investments in the
roadnetwork, especially rural roads, andan expansion inthe provision o f extension services.

1.6     The proposed grant is being undertaken under the Global Food Crisis Program (GFRP),
which was endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008, and will be financed out o f the Food Price
Crisis Response Trust Fund. The objectives o fthe proposed GFRP are to: (i)      reduce the negative
impact o f high and volatile food prices on the lives o f the poor in a timely way; (ii)      support
governments in the design o f sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse impacts o f high and
more volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the creation o f long-term market
distortions; and (iii)support broad-based growth in productivity and market participation in
agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply response.

                                    A. DEVELOPMENTAL      STATUS

2.1     Sierra Leone is a fragile state, emerging from a brutal conflict (1991-2001) which
displaced up to a third o f the population. Sierra Leone fares poorly inmost indicators related to
human development and the Millennium Development Goals. As noted in a recent document
from the World Food Program, the country was ranked last in the latest HumanDevelopment
Index (HDI) with data from 2005 computed by the UnitedNations Development Program. Life
expectancy at birth i s reported at 41.8 years. Infant mortality in 2005 was estimated at 170 per
1,000 live births, and under 5 mortality at 286 per 1,000.       According to the 2005 MICS-I11
household survey, 31 percent o f children under 5 are underweight, 40 percent stunted, and 9
percent wasted.    The adult literacy rate according to HDI data is 34.8 percent, whilst the
combined gross enrolment rate for primary, secondary and tertiary education is estimated at
around 44.6 percent. The overall HDIvalue for Sierra Leone in2005 is estimated at 0.336.

2.2     Growth. Sierra Leone's strong recovery, which began in 2000, continued for an eighth
unbroken year into 2007 when real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by an estimated 6.8
percent despite high and rising oil prices (see Table 2.1 below).        Much o f this growth was
concentrated in the informal agricultural, fishing, mining, and services sectors that make up the
bulk o f the economy. Formal economic activity is confined primarily to large scale mining,
construction, retail services, tourism, andgovernment employment.

2.3         External balance. Sierra Leone has broadened its export base from an almost exclusive
concentration on diamonds in recent years to include rutile, bauxite, and a growing number o f
cash crops. Estimated export growth was positive for all products in2007 but slowed relative to
both GDP and performance in previous years. The GDP share o f exports o f goods and non-
factor services fell to 21 percent in 2007 from 25 percent in 2006. Imports contracted by 4.3
percentage points o f GDP, as a consequence o f falling exports andrising oil prices. The external
current account deficit (including official transfers) increased to -3.8 percent of GDP from -3.5
percent o f GDP in 2006. Official reserves reached US$208 million or 4.5 months o f import
coverage.

2.4         The current account balance was financed mainly by concessional external assistance and
debt relief. InDecember 2006, Sierra Leone reached the Completion Point under the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and, in so doing, also gained additional relief
under the Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative (MDRI). Taken together, the total relief will amount
to roughly US$1.6 billion innominal terms spread over 30 years (see Section 2.D below on debt
sustainability).

2.5         Fiscal performance in 2007 continued its improving trend. The fiscal deficit (after

in2007.2 The primaryfiscal balanceimprovedto -1.9 percent ofGDP in2007 from -3.1 percent
o f GDP in 2006. Much o f this decline i s due to slower growth in expenditures, with additional
compression inresponse to shortfalls inexternal assistance andrevenues in2006 and 2007.

2.6       Sierra Leone's broadly positive performance in macroeconomic management masks
some emerging issues: revenues declined as a share of GDP in2007 and fell short of ambitious
program targets, while weak expenditure commitment controls allowed a substantial
accumulation of domestic arrears in2007; also, donor support was delayed in2007 on account o f
fiduciary concerns. Inaddition, monetarypolicy may need to become more proactive inthe face
o f ongoing international food and he1inflation and sporadic supply shocks. The government i s
acting to address these issues. Under the ongoing PRGF, an agreement was reached with the
IMF on a program for the remainder o f 2008 aimed at consolidating macroeconomic
stabilization.      Revenue collection efforts have been stepped up by the National Revenue
Authority through improved customs valuation and the collection o f tax arrears. Discretionary
duty waivers and other tax exemptions have been reduced sharply. Also, additional legislative
changes have brought off-budget revenues from some ministries into the consolidated revenue
fund. The enactment o f the Finance Bill and subsequent adoption o f revenue generating
measures contained therein will support the government's revenue mobilization targets.

2.7       Expenditure controls are being strengthened and the Government has agreed that the
balance o f domestic arrears accumulated in 2007 would be cleared in 2008, within the 2008
resource envelope, after they are audited. Poverty reducing expenditures have been expanded to
include the provision o f emergency power following the weak performance o f the National
Power Authority between 2006 and 2007. The government is also working to address donor
concerns about fiduciary arrangements, particularly the backlog o f published public accounts.
As o f July 2007, the Accountant General's Department had eliminated the backlog in public
accounts and i s now current through 2007. The Office o f the Auditor-General has completed the
audits o f the public accounts for the years 2004 to 2006. The audited accounts for 2002 to 2006
as well as the un-audited accounts for 2007 have beenlaidbefore Parliament. All these accounts
have been published. A recently completed Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) Performance Report and a Procurement Audit report, both commissioned on behalf o f
the multi-donor budget support group, established that the quality o f Sierra Leone's public
financial management i s on par with the average performance o f other IDA countries and
identifiedaspects o fpublic financialmanagement (PFM) inneed o fadditional strengthening.

2.8       Inflation trends. The increases in food prices, and the pass-through effects o f the
increases in oil prices, have already resulted in an acceleration o f inflation in 2007 through the
second quarter o f 2008. The 12 month inflation rate for June 2008 increased to 16.8 percent
from 13.8 percent inDecember 2007 and 8.3 percent inDecember 2006. According to data from
Statistics Sierra Leone, Freetown consumer prices for imported rice show an accelerating rate o f
inflation: the cost o f imported rice in December 2007 was 21 percent higher than in the
preceding December while the June 2008 price was 49 percent higher than the preceding June.
Similarly, the price o f wheat flour in December 2008 price was 11 percent higher than a year
earlier andthe June 2008 price was 28 percent higher than the precedingJune. The official price

o fpetrol increased by 27 percent between June-2007 andJune-2008 following larges increases in
preceding years. The Government mitigated some o f these price increases by reducing import
tariffs on rice, flour, and petroleum products.          These actions, however, are unlikely to be
sustainable inthe face o f increased internationalprices, low fiscal revenues and increasing social
tensions.

2.9     Monetary policy. Reductions inthe fiscal deficit as a share o f GDP have allowed for a
declining trend in the growth rate o f reserve money from 30 percent in 2002 (and higher in
earlier years) to 13 percent in 2004 and 11 percent in 2006. This pattern was broken only in
2005 and 2007. In 2005, aid inflows could not be fully absorbed, resulting in a build-up o f
foreign assets so that reserve money growth inthat year was 24 percent. In2007, reserve money
exceeded the program target (26 percent against 15.6 percent) due to unexpectedly high bank
reserves caused mainly by the establishment o f two new foreign banks. Since March 2008, the
IMF has reclassified the exchange rate system as a "conventional peg" system to reflect the
relative stability o f the nominal exchange rate managed through weekly auctions by the Bank o f
Sierra Leone. The nominal, end-of-period rate on treasury bills increased to 21.3 percent in2007
from 14.2 percent in 2006. The nominal exchange rate depreciated in 2007 enough to offset
inflation, thus allowing the real effective exchange rate to remain broadly stable

                            c. MACROECONOMIC          OUTLOOKFOR2008-10

2.10     The global economic prospects for traded goods suggest that Sierra Leone will continue
to be subjected to high fuel and food prices for the next few years. The terms o f trade are
expected to move against Sierra Leone in 2008, declining by 13.5 percent, as imported fuel and
food prices continue to accelerate faster than export commodity prices, before showing slight
gains in 2009 and 2010 (see Table 2.2). Crude oil prices are forecast to rise by 52 percent in
2008. Even though the price is then expected to fall by 2 percent in2009 and another 7 percent
in 2010, the price in 2010 will still be almost double the 2005 price. The outlook for rice is
equally stark: the international price i s expected to rise by 99 percent in 2008 and will be 1.7
times the 2005 price by 2010. Similar outcomes are forecast for sugar andwheat.

2.11     Key macroeconomic objectives underlying the government's medium-term strategy as
detailed inthe 2005-07 PRS and the IMF-supported PRGFprogram include the maintenance of
high real growth and a stable macroeconomic environment.                    In this regard, two sectors,
agriculture and mining, are central for Sierra Leone's economic growth and development.
Agricultural expansion is a key medium-term objective, given its importance for poverty
red~ction,~food security andjob creation. Sierra Leone's considerable mineral endowments will
continue to support the balance o f payments and output growth, and should be utilized to
enhance fiscal sustainability andpublic resources for basic services.

2.12     The original medium-term macroeconomic framework for 2008-10 assumes that real
output i s expected to grow by 6.0 percent annually through 2010, compared to the 2005-07
average o f 7 percent, reflecting a return to a sustainable growth rate following the immediate
post-conflict reconstruction boom. This forecast has been revised downward to 6 percent per


3 According to the PRSP, 66 percent of the population and 73 percent of the poor population were found in rural
  areas in2003104.

annum on account o f the frictions created by higher food and fuel prices. The main stimuli
behind the projected growth include an increasing rate o f private savings and higher public
investment - initially electricity in Freetown, followed by improved water supplies and road
access-all o fwhich are expected to help reduce costs to individuals and firms.

2.13     The fiscal impact o f the food crisis i s likely to be greatest in2008 as the Government has
recently reduced tariffs on fuel and rice imports without compensating measures in other
taxation. This policy, combined with the impact o f rising food and fuel prices, will make it
difficult to maintain public service delivery at planned levels. There i s an additional risk that
continued inflationary pressures could motivate a demand for higher civil service wages.

2.14     Fiscal policy in the medium term will be geared towards reducing the domestic primary
fiscal balance to -1.5 percent o f GDP by 2010 from -1.9 percent o f GDP in 2007. This i s
expected to be achieved through increased revenue mobilization efforts as the government aims
to achieve macroeconomic stability while also expanding investment spending to support the
implementation o fthe PRS. Several new tax measures are planned, including the introduction o f
a Value-Added Tax (referred by Government as the Goods and Services tax). The government
also aims to protect priority expenditure programs, particularly those which contribute to poverty
reduction, through better budget execution procedures. Prudent fiscal policy will assist monetary
policy in lowering inflation and ensuring that the domestic public debt would remain at a
sustainable level. Recourse to domestic credit from the central bank will be restricted to MDRI
savings. This will provide scope for expanding private sector credit and contribute to lower
domestic interest rates. This fiscal stance combined with prudent monetary policy would lead to
a reduction inthe end o fperiod inflation rate to 9.7 percent in2010 from 13.8 percent in2007.

2.15     The higher food and fuel prices are also likely to have an adverse impact on the country's
external balance. The current account deficit in 2008 i s expected to increase to -6.5 percent o f
GDP from -3.8 percent in 2007. The larger current account deficit will be financed by higher
official transfers. The gross official reserves are expected to stabilize at 4 months of import
cover by 2010.

2.16      Cumulative external financing requirements for Sierra Leone are reviewed on a regular
basis as part of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement with the IMF.
Financing requirements between 2008 and 2010 are projected to be about US$603 million (see
Table 2.3). The US$507 million required for fiscal operations is fully identifieda4 This would
come from US$334 million in grants and US$174 million in loans. Financingfor the Bank o f
Sierra Leone (BSL), via the second Three Year Arrangement under the PRGF, will provide
another US$27 million. Financing for all other activities wouldbe provided by a combination o f
direct foreign investment and loans.

2.17      Sierra Leone reached the HIPC Completion Point in December 2006. Debt relief to
Sierra Leone under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will amount to US$675.2 million in2000 net
present value (NPV) terms5, equivalent to a revised 81.4 percent6 NPV reduction o f Sierra

  These numbers are consistent with implementation of PRSP priorities under the macroeconomic framework
  agreed with the IMF on the basis o f identified external financing. Implementation o f the PRSP beyond core
  priorities will require additional financing.
  The net present value (NPV) of debt is the discounted sum of all future debt service obligations (interest and
  principal).

Leone's debt after traditional debt relief.               This assistance is estimated to correspond to
approximately US$994 million innominal terms.7 Inreaching the HIPC completion point, Sierra
Leone also became eligible for further debt relief from the IMF, IDA and the AfDB under the
MDRI. Debt reliefprovided under MDRIwill reduce the debt stock by US$556.2 million, in
addition to relief receivedfrom the three institutions under the HIPC Initiative. MDRIdebt relief
(net o f HIPC assistance) would lead to nominal debt service savings o f US$609.9 million on debt
owed to IDA, the IMF andthe AfDB.

2.18     Full delivery o f debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI has significantly
reduced Sierra Leone's external public debt. InNPV terms, the stock o f debt would be reduced
from US$1,197.6 million at end-2005 to US$483 million at end-2006 after HIPC relief and to
US$110 million after MDRI. This assistance i s estimated to correspond to approximately
US$1.6 billion innominal terms.

2.19     A debt sustainability analysis (DSA) completed in June 2008 concludes that Sierra
Leone's risk o f debt distress i s moderate. External debt indicators will remain below the DSA
thresholds throughout the projection period (see Table 2.4 above), barring unexpected shocks.
Following Enhanced HIPC assistance, as well as additional bilateral and MDRI relief at the
Completion Point, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio drops to 41 percent in2007 from 470 percent
in2005 and subsequently increases to 75 percent by the end o fthe projectionperiod. The NPV
o f debt-to-GDP ratio decreases to 9 percent in2007 from 92 percent in2005 and then rises to 29
by the end of the projection period. External debt service ratios are projected to remain at
comfortable levels in line with a significant reduction o f the NPV o f debt stock after the
Completion Point. Sierra Leone's debt sustainability outlook heavily depends upon sustained
export growth and prudent debt management. Stock indicators are expected to substantially
exceed the HIPC thresholds in the event o f large shocks to exports and shortfall in grant
financing.      Thus, the sensitivity analysis underscores the importance o f pursuing export
diversification and prudent borrowing policies in order to avoid potential risks for debt
sustainability.

                                    3. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                 A. THECHALLENGEOFPERVASIVEPOVERTY

3.1          According to the 2008 Sierra Leone Poverty Diagnostic, the poverty headcount may have
decreased to 57 percent in 2007 from 66 percent in 2003/04.* This is a welcome improvement
but there is considerable room for further reductions.                    Unfortunately, the same diagnostic
suggests that approximately 150,000 consumers could be pushedbelow the poverty line in2008
by the increased cost o f rice, raising the poverty headcount by 3-4 percentage points to 69-70
percent. Moreover, a significant portion o fthe population (21 percent in2003/04) are inextreme
poverty meaning they are unable to purchase more than 50 percent o f their daily caloric
requirements. The 2007/8 UN Human Development Index, based on social indicators from
2005, rovides another measure o f poverty. Sierra Leone was ranked 177th,at the bottom o f the
index.     r
                                    B. THEPOVERTY         REDUCTION      STRATEGY

3.2          The first PRSP o f February 2005 set out a number o f strategies and priorities for 2005-
2007 that address the main development challenges in Sierra Leone.                            Although the new
government i s preparing a new, second PRSP for the period 2009-2011, government policies for
2008 are expected to remain broadly consistent with the 2005-07 PRSP. The main elements are
summarized below.

3.3          The foundation o f the 2005-07 PRSP was a series o f extensive consultations conducted
throughout the country. These consultations were characterized by open and frank dialogue
between government and the people represented by key stakeholders - cabinet ministers,
parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members o f civil society, the private
sector, cooperative associations, local authorities, religious leaders, development partners and
beneficiary groups. The participatory methodologies included the Strategic Planningand Action
Process, Focus Group Discussions andParticipatory Poverty Assessments. Civic engagement on
the PRSP was ledbyNGOs. National anddistrict consultations on the draft poverty strategy and
validation workshops for the final draft PRSP were also organized.                        Radio and television
discussions were an important part o fthe communication and sensitization strategy.

3.4          The 2005-07 PRS targets an ambitious growth rate o f 8-9 percent per annum (6-7 percent
per capita). This would be promoted by actions to be undertaken under the three pillars o f the
PRS: (i)Good Governance, Security and Peace Building; (ii)                    Pro-poor Sustainable Growth for
Food Security and Job Creation; and (iii)              HumanDevelopment. The PRSP indicates that the
choice o f pillars derived from a number o f factors, including the recent emergence o f the country
from civil conflict, the status o f governance in the country, and the need to reinvest in the
productive sectors to promote growth in support o f the overarching commitment to reduce the
highlevel ofpoverty inthe country. Special attentionwas given to the topics of food security
andemployment.

3.5      The first pillar is influencedby the recent emergence o f the country from a brutal conflict
that reduced the capacity for good governance and security. Although significant progress has
been made in re-building various institutions for governing the state and safeguarding national
security, there continues to be a need for deeper reforms and strengthening capacity for effective
andefficient delivery o fbasic services andlong-term sustainable development. The participatory
poverty assessment undertaken for the PRSP emphasized various aspects o f weak governance as
one o f the main causes o f poverty. Consolidation o f peace and nation-wide reconciliation are
also expected to provide the enabling environment for the transition to medium and longer-term
development.

3.6      The key elements o f the government program for good governance under the first pillar
include: (i)strengthening the anti-corruption agenda; (ii)continued improvements in public
financial management; (iii)      improvements in public service delivery through capacity building;
(iv) decentralization o f service delivery; and (v) better statistics for monitoring outcomes.
Consolidation o f the peace achieved in January 2002 will be promoted through: (i)                     judicial
reform; (ii) tackling humanrights abuses; (iii)        deepening democratic institutions; (iv) improving
access to information; and (v) continued strengthening o fthe police and armed forces.

3.7      The second pillar emphasizes the continued implementation o f sound economic policies
to attain macroeconomic stability and a more favorable environment for private sector
development. A stable macro-economy will also underpin the sectoral and other more specific
interventions that have been designed through participatory processes involving consultations
with civil society and other community stakeholders inthe country.

3.8      The key elements in the government program for sustainable growth under the second
pillar include three broad objectives: the maintenance o f a conducive macroeconomic
environment, food security and job creation. These are to be achieved through: (i)                   appropriate
fiscal and monetary policies and effective debt management; (ii)support to the productive
sectors, and especially agriculture, through the provision o f inputs, machinery, extension services
and training;" (iii)   investments in infrastructure for power, roads and information technology;
(iv) improvements inthe investment climate including improvements inthe legal framework and
better access to credit and micro-finance programs; and (v) divestiture o fpublic enterprises.

3.9      The third pillar underscores the point that poverty reduction must be underpinned by
investment in human resources. Investments in the health and education o f the population and
the delivery ofbasic services will provide the basis for sustained poverty reductionby enhancing
the capacities o f the poor and reducing their vulnerability. This pillar includes several broad
objectives: expanded basic education and training, expanded health, immunization and nutrition
services, increased access to water and sanitation facilities, affordable housing for the poor,
HIV/AIDS prevention and control, gender equality and empowerment, and better environmental
management. The key elements o f the government program for human development under the
third pillar include: the decentralization o f several services, construction and rehabilitation o f
facilities, subsidies, school feeding programs, improved curricula, training for teachers and
health workers, and better administration, including improved statistics for monitoring
educational enrollment rates and health outcomes.


loInputs and machinery are to be provided on a cost recovery basis or through favorable credit terms.

3.10    A Poverty Reduction Strategy Technical Secretariat, led by the Ministry o f Finance and
Economic Development (MOFED), manages all PRS monitoring activities.              The Secretariat
oversees working groups that monitor resource allocations and expenditures, survey and census
results, community based strategic planning and monitoring and a fourth group in charge of
research and dissemination. Monitoring and evaluation i s coordinated by a National Technical
Committee. A new household survey i s expected to be conducted in2009.

               4. BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
                        c. LINKTO   THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCESTRATEGY

4.1     The June 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) sets out the Bank's support to the
government's PRS for the period FY06-09.'   ' It is explicitly rootedina results based framework,
which links the overall goals o f the government's PRS to specific strategic objectives and
outcomes which are monitored, where appropriate and possible, by quantitative intermediate
progress indicators that are directly affected by Bank interventions. The Country Assistance
Strategy includes a series o f programmatic development policy operations within the context o f
the Framework for Multi-Donor Budget Support to support critical PRS policies andreforms and
the progressive build-up o f PRS implementation capacity.          The CAS did not include the
proposed operation; however, it is fully consistent with the objective o f supporting the second
strategic priority o f the CAS, namely sustainable growth, food security, and job creation. In
particular, the operation would provide the authorities with needed fiscal space to partially
compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel
imports. This support would help mitigate the impact o f such price increases and contribute to
continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups.

                        D. RELATIONSHIP WITHOTHERBANKACTIVITIES

4.2     Several operations are direct complements to the proposed grant. Key among these i s a
proposed parallel Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund operation to provide additional
financing for the IDA-funded National Social Action Project (uS$41.9 million, Credit 3748-SL)
to implement a cash-for-work program under the auspices o f the National Commission for Social
Action (NaCSA).      The National Social Action Plan has performed well and NaCSA has the
necessary administrative and organizational structures to implement community level
interventions across the whole o f Sierra Leone. This short-term support will be followed by
medium- and longer-term support for relieving the pressure on food prices through increased
agricultural production.    This effort will be supported by the Rural and Private Sector
Development Project (US$30 million, Grant H290-SL) and the Infrastructure Development
Project (uS$55 million, Credit 4469-SL and Grants H191-SL and H405-SL) which will make it
easier to get produce to the markets by improving the road network. Finally, the Bank i s
providing support to the implementation of the government's reform program through a
programmatic series o f three development policy operations, with the first o f which (the
Governance Reform and Growth Grant, 37701-SL) approved in November 2006. The second
GRGG is expected to be presented for Board approval before the end o f CY08.                  The
programmatic series supports reform measures that are meant to: (i)      preserve the fiscal space

needed for poverty reduction; (ii)  promote efficiency, transparency and accountability inthe use

improve the investment climate andpromote exports.

            E. COLLABORATION WITHIMPAND OTHERDEVELOPMENT                   PARTNERS

4.3     IMF and IDA staff have coordinated closely on the identification o f the respective
institutions' areas o f focus. The IMFBoard concluded the first review o f Sierra Leone's second
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) inDecember 2006. The
second review was concluded in July 2008. IMF and IDA staff have collaborated closely to
assist the authorities inthe implementation o f the country's PRS, with the IMF taking the lead in
supporting the Government on tax reform, monetary policies and financial sector issues. IDA
has focused on supporting policy reforms in public financial management, civil service reform,
decentralization, private sector development, andinfrastructure (notably energy).

4.4      Budgetary support has been provided to Sierra Leone by the United Kingdom (UK)
Department for International Development (DflD) and the EC. DfID expects to disburse up to
15 million pounds in2008, subject to ministerial decision. While no formal agreement has been
concluded, a similar amount is likely for 2009 and2010. A key focus area o f DflD support i s the
improvement o f governance through strengthened financial management systems, human
resource management, delivery o f basic services, and decentralization. The E C plans to provide
41.5 million euros for the period 2008-10. Public finance management, incorporating the overall
budget process, regulatory framework, procurement, and financial management remain key areas
o f EC support. The AfDB intends to provide US$16 million over the period 2008-10. IDA has
collaborated closely with these donors. This coordination has been particularly strong on issues
o f governance, corruption, PFMandcapacity building.

4.5      The Food and Agriculture Organization i s promoting the medium-term effort to increase
food production through its support for Agricultural Business Units (ABUs). These units have
proved to be an effective mechanism inpromoting improved productivity andmarket orientation
among the communities. The BUSand Farmer Field Schools (FFS) have been effective at
buildingorganizational andtechnical skills o fmen andwomen farmers. FFS groups comprise an
average o f 25 to 30 farm families, some o f whom also benefit from Food for Work (FFW)
activities. The ABUs consist o f the members o f about 16 FFS or other community based
organization. A national coalition o f NGOs including CARE, World Vision International,
AfiCare and Catholic Relief Services have also established FFSs and market clusters at the sub-
district level. The United Nations Children's' Fund (UNICEF) i s supporting two therapeutic
feeding centers in the northern region, one at Mebesseneh Hospital and one at Magbenteh
Community Hospital inMakeni. These centers offer nutritional supplements such as plumpynut
and other micro-nutrient fortified foods. Incollaboration with the World Health Organization,
the World Food Program (WFP) and other partners, UNICEF Sierra Leone plans to provide the
same services found at Mabesseneh in each o f the 13 districts nationwide. This effort will
support the Ministry o f Health and Sanitation's 10-year national plan o f action for accelerating
child survival, andwill advance progress towards achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

4.6      The WFP supports basic primary education through primary-school feeding including an
incentive scheme for girls (take-home ration) and seeks to improve health and nutritional status



                                                 12

o f women and children through integrated Mother-Child Health and Nutrition programs.
Discussions are underway to see ifthese programs could be scaled up inresponse to the current
crisis. The WFP also support the Protracted ReliefandRecovery Operationwhich is designed to
provide food assistance to vulnerable populations in six districts (Kailahun, Kenema, Kono, Bo,
Bonthe and Pujehun) that suffered the highest levels o f destruction during the war.
Implementation will span the period July 2007 to June 2009 with a focus on food security
improvement, education and health.

                                       F. LESSONSLEARNED

4.7     Cross country experience suggests that governments facing temporary price shocks
should seek to maintain their expenditure plans, to the extent that they have access to non-
inflationary andconcessional financing, inorder to minimize program disruptions andhold down
costs.  In the case of permanent shocks, an adjustment in taxation and spending will be
necessary.     In the former case, budget support can help ease the process of transition.
Development policy grants can be an effective aid mechanism for such transition infragile states
such as Sierra Leone. Implementationo f World Bank development policy grants inSierra Leone
has been rated satisfactory since the first such operation was completed in 2002. Factors that
have contributed to this outcome include continuous improvements in fiduciary arrangements,
adaptation to local implementation capacity, frequent consultation with the authorities, intensive
supervision incollaboration with MOFED staff and close collaboration with other donors.

                                 G. ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

4.8     The conclusions and recommendations presented in a number o f analytical documents
provide the foundation for the design o f the proposed operation.          A June 2008 Poverty
Diagnostic based on the 2003/04 Integrated Household Survey, the pilot census results, and the
Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) results provide information on poverty and
public service delivery issues related to education, health, and electricity. It also includes an
analysis o f the impact o f internationalprice inflation for rice on consumer welfare. The Poverty
Diagnostic concludes that a reduction inthe rice tariff would be pro-poor if compensated by the
introduction o f additional, poverty-neutraltax revenues. The widespread anddeep poverty found
in Sierra Leone highlights the need for rapid income growth while the lower poverty in
Freetown, relative to the rest o f the country, highlights the need for Bank support for the
decentralization o f public service delivery.      It is noteworthy in this light that the largest
expenditures by the local councils are for education andhealth.

4.9     Key documents for issues related to public resource management include the 2007 PEFA
Report, the 2007 procurement audit, the 2004 HIPC AAP, the 2004 PER, the 2002 CFAA, the
corruption surveys from 2000 and 2002 and background papers for the IRCB. The documents
have highlighted areas for further strengthening in public financial management, several o f
which are beingsupported under the plannedGRGG.

                              5. THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

                               A. DESCRIPTIONOFTHE OPERATION

5.1      The proposed grant o f US$3 million equivalent would support the Government's poverty
reduction strategy by providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to partially compensate
for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel imports. This
support would help mitigate the impact o f such price increases and contribute to continued basic
service delivery for vulnerable groups. The proposed grant i s being undertaken under the Global
Food Crisis Program, which was endorsed by the Board on May 29,2008, and will be financed
out o f the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund. Inthe medium-term, the government intends
to stimulate food production through a combination o f agricultural investment projects,
investments in the road network, especially rural roads, and an expansion in the provision o f
extension services.

5.2      Consultations on the content o f the proposed grant were carried out with MOFED inearly
July 2008. A prior World Bank mission in March 2008 provided advice on short and medium
term interventions to counter the food crisis. The same mission included an inventory o f key
safety net programs with the aim to verify opportunities for scaling up o f existing programs, in
particular o f food emergency programs.

5.3      The proposed development policy grant meets all the requirements under the framework
o f the GFRP. Sierra Leone i s an IDA-eligible country which i s a net importer o f both food and
fuel. It is therefore highly vulnerable to price fluctuations for both commodities. The appraisal
mission provided policy analysis and advice to the Government on feasible pricing responses to
the food crisis.

                                         B. POLICY AREAS

5.4      The Government o f Sierra Leone has set up a ministerial task force, with the Ministers o f
Agriculture, Finance, and Trade and Commerce, to lead their response to the food and fuel price
increases. Thus far, the government has taken the following actions to mitigate the impact o f the
food andfuel price increases:

a. reduced tariff andexcise rates inMarch2008:
     0   the import duty on petroleum was reduced from 5 percent o f CIF ad valorem to US$20
         permetric ton;
     0   the import duty on rice was reduced from 15 to 10percent;
     0   the fixed reference price used to value rice was set at U S 3 7 5 per metric ton, well below
         world prices but higher thanthe 2007 reference price o fUS$260 per metric ton;
     0   the import duty on flour was reduced from 20 to 10percent;
     0   the import duty on wheat was reduced from 5 to 2.5 percent;
     0   the import duty on sugar was reduced from 20 to 10percent.

b. reduced the excise tax on petroleum products by Le 610 per imperial gallon in November
     2007 andpartially restoredthe excise tax to Le 300 per imperial gallon inMarch2008;




                                                 14

c. used funds from a strategic petroleum reserve to subsidize petroleum product prices for five
     weeks inJune andJuly o f 2008; and

d. provided 71,000 bushelso fseed rice to fanners.12

5.5      These measures have reduced the magnitude o f the shock felt by consumers and
government providers o f basic services. Even so, the remaining inflation has been substantial.
(Please see Table 5.1 below.) The impact has been severe particularly in 2008 when the June
price o f rice rose by 49 percent over the June 2007 price and fuel prices increased 27 percent
over the same period. Moreover, with the exception o f agricultural support, these policies have
only partially mitigated the full impact o fthe price shocks.

5.6      The tariff reductions resulted inrevenue losses relative to what could have been collected
had the tariffs been maintained at 2007 levels. MOFED estimates the loss in 2008 will be
approximately Le 20.7 billion (or US$7 million) when valued at actual prices seen in the first
half o f the year. By contrast, the cost o f basic service delivery increased by L e 13.6 billion, o f
which L e 8.9 billion (US$3 million) is accounted for bythe higher cost o f food.

5.7      The government intends to protect the provision o f selected basic services from the rising
costs o f fie1 and food. To this end, the government intends to use additional resources from
donors (including from the proposed operation) to fund the provision o f basic services to
vulnerable groups totaling almost 21,600 people.                     The beneficiaries would include school
children and patients in district hospitals and community health centers that receive government
provided meals. The latter include lactatingmothers and children under the age o f five.

5.8      To alleviate the short-run impact on consumer welfare o f rising food prices, the
authorities are currently discussing options to expand ongoing safety net programs for school
feeding, supplemental feeding for pregnant and lactating mothers, and food-for-work programs.
The Bank plans to assist in this effort by providing additional funding (US$4 million) for

  times and an inability to account for all the seedlings distributed.

NaCSA for cash for work programs under another grant under the Food Price Crisis Response
Trust Fund. As part o f this initiative, the government hosted its first workshop on the treatment
o f severe acute malnutrition in children on June 6, 2008. Inthe mediwn-term, the authorities
will stimulate food production through a combination o f agricultural investment projects,
investments in the road network and the provision o f extension services.         The Bank will
contribute to this effort through a recently approved US$30 million Rural and Private Sector
Development Project.

5.9    As indicated in Section 2.C above, the program is fully funded (See Table 2.3).         In
nominal terms, the tariff reductions are forecast to be fully compensated by rising international
commodity prices.     Preliminary data for the first half o f the year suggest that revenue
performance i s on track, relative to the original budgetary targets. The incremental costs o f
service delivery above budgeted levels, induced by rapidly rising international prices for food
and fuel, will be compensated by the proposed grant, leaving the deficit unchanged from the
budgeted amount.13 In real terms, the revenue shortfall created by the reduction in tariffs,
relative to what could have been collected had tariffs not been changed, will be compensated by
the proposed grant and a temporary real reduction in less essential spending until additional
donor financing can be secured.

                        c.  PRIORACTIONS FORTHE PROPOSEDGRANT

5.10    The proposed grant would support selected aspects o f the government's program
described in Section 5.B and inits Letter o f Development Policy that are deemed essential to its
successful implementation. (See Annex 1) The rationale for their selection has been discussed
in the previous section, namely their importance to the program and expressed government
commitment and feasibility. Compliance with the prior action below as defined in the Grant
Agreement forms the basis for IDAto proceedwith the proposed operation:

The Recipient has reduced tarvs in 2008 to mitigate the impact of rapidly rising international
prices of food and fuel and has prepared an action plan, acceptable to the World Bank, to
protect theprovision of basic services to vulnerable groups.

5.11 The expected outcomes o f the proposed operation relate to the number o f beneficiaries o f
selected basic service programs; notably, it is expected that (i)   approximately 12,800 patients
would continue to receive food annually in district hospitals and community health centers; (ii)
roughly 5,300 hospital patients, including lactating mothers and children under the age o f five,
would be fed three times a day; (iii) approximately 3,000 pupils in government boarding schools
and handicapped children would continue to be fed three times per day; and (iv) about 500
children in remand homes and approved schools would continue to receive food. Details on
monitoring and evaluation arrangements are provided inparagraph 6.4.

                           6. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                                A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

6.1     The measures supported by the proposed grant are expected to have a significant positive
impact on poverty reduction.       A rapid assessment resulting from the recent Bank mission
confirms that the set o f measures undertaken by the Government and detailed in paragraph 5.4
are the most feasible given the circumstances and will have fast and positive impact on Sierra
Leone's poor population. In addition, the 2008 Poverty Diagnostic concludes that the import
tariffreductions, andfor rice inparticular, arepro-poor-withthe poor accountingfor 55 percent
o f the food purchased in the country. By providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to
partially compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced tariffs on food and
fuel imports, the operation would help mitigate the impact o f such price increases and contribute
to continuedbasic service delivery for vulnerable groups, notably school children andpatients in
district hospitals and community health centers.

                                  B. ENVIRONMENTAL       ASPECTS

6.2      The proposed operation i s not likely to have significant negative environmental impacts.
The operation does not involve any significant physical processes that would impact the
environment o f Sierra Leone. An appropriate environmental framework is now inplace with the
adoption o f legislation in July 2008 establishing an Environmental Protection Agency but
capacity will need to be built andsustained over time.

                     c.  IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                            AND

6.3      The administration o f this operation will be the responsibility o f MOFED. To facilitate
program implementation and the coordination o f activities, the government has appointed an
Inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Economic
Development. This Committee i s composed o fkey Ministers andthe Governor o f the BSL. The
Steering Committee will be assisted by a Technical Committee comprising high level staff from
various line ministries and the BSL. The Technical Committee will be chaired by the Financial
Secretary and will be responsible for coordinating the activities o f all government agencies
involved inprogram implementation.

6.4      The Technical Committee will be responsible for monitoring the program and all
outcome indicators. The Technical Committee will provide monthly reports to the World Bank
and other multi-donor budget support partners on implementation progress measured against
established timetables and agreed performance indicators. The overall reform effort will be
reviewed by the government in close coordination with regular Bank missions to ensure
continued implementation o f the programwithin an adequatemacroeconomic policy framework.

6.5      Inaddition, as mentioned above, a PRS monitoring function has been established within
the Development Aid Coordinating Office (DACO). DACO is expected to coordinate with the
planning, monitoring and evaluationunitswithin eachministryto produce annual PRSP progress
reports.

                                       D. FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS

6.6     The Bank has reviewed the fiduciary arrangements in the context o f the previously
established programmatic series o f development policy grants referred to in Section 4.B above.
Overall, the Bank has judged the government's commitment to the PFM improvements and its
performance inimplementing the PFMreform program as showing adequate improvement. Key
documents for issues related to public resource management include the 2007 PEFA Report, the
2007 procurement audit, the 2004 HIPC AAP, the 2004 PER, the 2002 CFAA, the corruption
surveys from 2000 and 2002 and background papers for the IRCB. To address the issues raised
inthese reports, the government has embarked on awide rangingseries ofreforms includingthe
establishment o f an Anti-Corruption Commission, new legislation governing public budgeting
and accounting, strengthening the offices o f the Accountant-General and Auditor-General,
improved management information systems, a new organic finance law and supporting
regulations, and a new public procurement law.

6.7     The government i s committed to deepening these reforms. This effort will be guided by
the common National Action Plan on Public Financial Management currently supported by
DflD, EC, IMF and the World Bank.14 The plan includes actions designed to strengthen the
financial regulations in compliance with the GBAA; actions meant to improve the budget
process such as capacity building for strategic planning and budgeting in the sector ministries;
procurement reform; better budget execution (including a new IntegratedFinancial Management
Information System and chart o f accounts, reduced arrears, minimal discrepancy between
planned and actual spending); strengthened internal audit (including the establishment o f internal
audit units in the line ministries); and strengthened external audit and accountability (including
more trained staff inthe Office o fthe Auditor-General).

6.8     The IMFconducted a safeguards assessment o fthe Bank o f Sierra Leone. The assessment
shows that significant progress has been made on the priority recommendations o f the 2002
assessment.     Problems identified in 2002 regarding foreign exchange management and
improvement o f the internal control and audit environments have either been rectified or are in
process o f rectification. Further improvements in the internal controls over banking operations
and in the internal audit area were proposed and the BSL was encouraged to introduce
International Financial Reporting Standards as the financial reporting framework. The authorities
have committed to implementing the 2006 safeguards recommendations.

                                 E. DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                       AND

6.9     The proposed operation would consist o f a single tranche grant o f US$3 million
equivalent to be available upon effectiveness, anticipated by early August, 2008. The grant will
follow IDA'Sdisbursement procedures for development policy operations. Once the operation
becomes effective, and at the request o f the Recipient, the proceeds will be deposited by the
Bank into a government account at the Bank of Sierra Leone which forms part o f the country's
foreign exchange reserves. As a due diligence measure, within 30 days o f receipt the Recipient
will provide a written confirmation to IDA when the amount has been credited to an account
available to finance budgeted expenditures.         Disbursement would not be linked to specific

                                                  18

purchases. The proceeds o f the operation would not be used to finance expenditures excluded
under the Agreement. If, after being deposited in a government account, the proceeds o f the
grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Grant Agreement, the Bank will require
the Recipient to either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the
amount directly to the Bank. No dedicated account is required.

                                  F. RISKSANDRISKMITIGATION

6.10    Sierra Leone remains vulnerable to commodity price changes. A further rise inthe prices
o f food or energy could undermine the impact o f the Government's program on the poor. This
could also create pressures for a civil service wage increase. Iffood and fuel prices remain high
for a prolonged period or rise further, there is also a risk that the authorities may resort to
heterodox policies such as government subsidized importing companies or de facto or de jure
price fixing. Such policies could drive private sector importers andproducers out of the market,
resulting in significant distortions and shortages.    These risks are being mitigated through
intensive monitoring by the government and dialogue with donors and, in the case o f further
significant increases infood and fuel prices, may require additional measures to sustain the fiscal
balance andmacroeconomic stability.

6.11 The goal of redirecting resources to offset rising food prices could be made more difficult
inthe event that revenues or grants fall significantly short of targets or if substantial new and
unavoidable spending requirements arise.        These risks are mitigated by the Government's
manifested commitment to adhere to the already established principle o f protecting priority
expenditures through reductions inless essential spending.

6.12    Finally, there i s a risk that implementation capacity in the central ministries and local
councils may not be sufficient to ensure that targeted beneficiaries are served in 2008 at least as
well as they hadbeenin2007, becauseo fthe naturalreplacement o fvarious key officials aresult
o f the political transition inlate 2007 andearly 2008. This risk was evident inthe first quarter o f
2008. MOFED officials indicated they have largely resolved the problem through intensive
dialogue andmonitoring with the implementing ministries and local councils.

              FOODCRISISRESPONSEDEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT

                           LETTEROFDEVELOPMENT POLICY


IamwritingonbehalfoftheGovernmentofSierraLeonetorequestthatyouapprovetheFood
Crisis Response Development Policy Grant in the sum o f US$3 million to help compensate for
revenues lost due to recent reductions in food and fuel import tariffs, reductions meant to soften
the blow o f rapidly rising international commodity prices.     The additional resources made
possible by the grant would go some way to helping the Government protect the provision o f
basic services in2008. Inour view, this i s essential to the maintenance o f economic and social
stability as we leave our post-conflict status behindandpursue sustained economic development.

Sierra Leone has made significant progress in maintaining political and economic stability as
demonstrated by the peaceful Presidential and Parliamentary elections conducted in August and
September this year. With the continued support o f the international community, substantial
progress has also been made in implementing the Government's poverty reduction strategy. We
would particularly like to draw your attention to the good progress made ingovernance reforms,
particularly in the area of public financial management. However, poverty remains pervasive
andon current trends the achievement o f the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 remains a
key challenge.

Mr. President, the dramatic rise in food and fuel prices experienced in 2008 is undermining
Government's efforts inreducing poverty and preservingmacroeconomic stability. Sierra Leone



                                                20

is a net food importer and a non-oil producing country. Total annual rice consumption for the
country is estimated at 601,000 metric tons against a total production o f 414,700 mt leaving a
deficit o f 185,900mt. Food aid accounts for 10% (1,859 mt) o f the deficit whilst the rest i s
imported. All petroleum products are imported. Sierra Leone i s therefore highly vulnerable to
internationalprice fluctuations for bothfood andfuel.

As you are aware, poverty is already pervasive inSierra Leone. The revised estimates o fpoverty
based on the 2003/04 household survey suggest that 66.4 percent o f the population is poor (47
percent in urban areas versus 79 percent in rural areas). Rural areas account for the largest
proportion o f the poor (73 percent versus 61 percent o f the population). At the national level, 21
percent o f the population lives in extreme (food) poverty.            The average person's total
consumption falls short o f the minimum consumption level necessary in order not to be poor by
27.5 percent o f the poverty line. Sierra Leone i s also classified as one o f the countries with the
highest rates   malnutrition in Africa. Government o f Sierra Leone and the World Bank have
estimated that an increase o f 20 percent in the price o f rice alone could lead to an increase o f
three to four percentage points in the share o f people in poverty, i.e about 100,000-150,000
people. Yet, the present inflation rate for imported rice i s considerably higher and accompanied
by equally substantial inflation inother food commodities.

                         MacroeconomicPerformancein2007 and2008

The Sierra Leonean economy recovered strongly in the post conflict period with real GDP
growth averaging 7.4 percent during 2004-06. Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 6.8
percent in 2007, reflecting increased activities in the agricultural, mining, construction, and
services sectors. After declining to single digits in late 2006, inflationary pressures re-emerged
in2007. Year-on year inflation, as measuredby the CPI for Freetown, rose from 8.3 percent in
December 2006 to 13.8         percent in December 2007.        This was due partly to continued
international inflation in fuel prices and shortages in the supply o f basic commodities owing to
social unrest inneighboring Guinea, a major trading partner, inearly 2007.

Exports continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate in 2007 due to mainly to suspension o f
operations by Koidu Holdings, the Kimberlite miningcompany. However, exports o fbauxite and
rutile increased during the period. Imports grew by 4.6 percent in 2007, resulting in a slight
increase in the current account deficit, excluding grants, to 3.8 percent in 2007 from 3.5 percent
in 2006.    Gross foreign reserves increased during the period reaching 4.5 months o f import
cover.   The nominal and real effective exchange rates o f the Leone against the US dollar
remained relatively stable duringthe year.

Continuing the trend from previous years, the overall budget deficit, including grants was further
reduced to 1.2 percent in 2007. Inan effort to preserve macroeconomic stability in the face o f
shortfalls in revenue and delays in the disbursement o f external budget support, Government
adopted a cashbudget management system inApril 2007. Consistent with the cash-basedbudget
management system, efforts were made to match expenditures to revenues collected during the
period. The cash-budget management system enabled the Government to meet the quantitative
performance criteria under the PRGF-supported programme for end June and end December
2007.

Domestic inflation remained at double digits level in 2008 mainly due to the rise in the
international prices o f petroleum and food products.       The consequent pass through o f the
escalating prices o f these commodities to domestic prices has resulted in a rise in head line
inflation and this is having adverse macroeconomic and poverty impacts. The year-on-year
inflation rate rose from 8.3 percent in 2006 to 13.8 percent in December 2007 and has reached
16.8 percent in June 2008. Food inflation surged to 15.6 percent in December 2007 from 6.5
percent in December 2006 and subsequently jumped to 20.5 percent in May 2008. Prices of
several foodstuffs accelerated during the year given the positive correlation between the price o f
rice and fuel with that o f other basic food items. The price o f imported rice rose significantly by
49 percent between June 2007 and June 2008 while the price o f wheat flour andpalm oil rose by
28 percent and 22.8 percent, respectively, over the same period. The price o f dried fish (bonga)
rose by 47.6 percent between December 2007 and May 2008. The domestic price for kerosene,
petrol and diesel increasedby 27.4 percent inJune 2008 relative to the same period in2007.

Rapidly rising food and oil prices are posing serious challenges to economic growth.             The
projected growth rate o f 6.5 percent for 2008 has been revised downwards to 6 percent while
inflation is now forecasted to remain inthe double digits duringthe year.

              Medium-termMacroeconomicObjectivesandPoliciesfor 2008-10

The key medium-term macroeconomic objectives include the maintenance o f sustained highreal
growth, a stable macroeconomic environment and revitalizing the structural reform agenda. The
macroeconomic framework projects real GDP growth o f 6.0 percent during 2008-2010
underpinned by broad based sectoral growth. The planned investment in infrastructure and
improvements in the business climate are expected to contribute to the growth prospects of the
economy. Inflation will remain indouble digits until2010, assuming the lagged effects o f rising
food and energy prices. The external current account deficit, (excluding official transfers) is
projected to narrow inthe medium-term as imports growth slows down. Gross external reserves
are programmedto remain inthe range o f 3.5 to 4.0 months o f import cover.

                                           Fiscal Policy

Macroeconomic stability inthe medium term will be underpinned by prudent fiscal policy. The
medium-term fiscal objectives will aim at increasing revenue mobilisation, reducing the
domestic primary budget deficit to contain the domestic debt, and reorienting public spending
towards infrastructure andpoverty spending.

The Government intends to increase domestic revenue from 10.8 percent o f GDP in2007 to 13.4
percent o f GDP in 2010, subject to the risks created by the emerging crisis in international
commodity prices. The National Revenue Authority will be strengthened by operationalisingthe
NRAModernization Plan. The NRAwill put inplace measures to mobilize additional revenues
including undertaking field audits, strengthening o f tax enforcement, intensification o f arrears
collection and the stepping up of anti-smugglingactivities. The Government will introduce the
Value Added Tax locally known as Goods and Services Tax (GST), and significantly narrow the
scope o f import duty and sales tax exemptions.



                                                22

The Government will strengthen budget execution procedures, especially commitment controls,
contain the wage bill, and meet targets for poverty spending. Inthis regard all MDAs will be
required to seek prior approval from the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development before
entering into contracts and/or issuing Local Purchase Orders. In addition, expenditure
commitments by MDAs will be strictly controlled against the procurement plan approved by the
Ministryof Finance and Economic Development and within the cumulative allocations for the
year.

Taken together, these policies will allow the basic primary deficit to decline over the medium
term to 1.5 percent o f GDPby 2010 while limitingthe need for domestic borrowing.

                              Monetary and Financial Sector Policies

Monetary policy will continue to be conducted using market-based instruments o f monetary
policy mainly open market operations with the objective o f containing inflation. Government
will continue to strengthen the operational capacity o f the BSL by recapitalizing the Bank and
providing it with additional interest bearing securities to support monetarypolicy operations.

Sustaining the highGDP growth rates in the medium term critically depends on higher savings
and investment rates. Therefore, one o f the key objectives o f Government's medium term
financial sector strategy i s to enhance the mobilization o f domestic savings and increased access
to medium to long term credit. The Government will undertake structural reforms aimed at
enhancing confidence, efficiency, and the sector's capacity to offer financial services. To this
end, with technical assistance from the Bank and the Fund, the Government is developing a
comprehensive financial sector strategy based on the recommendations o f joint Bank-Fund
Financial Sector Assessment program (FSAP) conducted inJune 2006.

                                       Exchange Rate Policy

Exchange rate flexibility will continue to be a key thrust o f Government's external sector policies
as it will facilitate timely adjustments to external developments. The official exchange rate will
continue to be determined through weekly auctions at the Bank o f Sierra Leone. The exchange
system will remain free from restrictions on the making o f payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

                                       ExternalDebt Policy

Mr.President, as you are aware, Sierra Leonereached the Completion Point underthe enhanced
HIPC Initiative inDecember 2006 andbecame eligible for debt reliefunder the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI). Government will continue to implement a prudent external debt policy,
seeking grant financing whenever possible and contracting or guaranteeing only highly
concessional loans to ensure sustainability o f its external debt.

However, debt owed to commercial creditors is still outstanding and efforts to negotiate with
them have proved increasingly difficult. To address the situation, the Government requested the



                                                  23

World Bank to support a second debt buy-back operation for external commercial obligations.
Negotiations are on-going with the non-Paris Creditors to reach debt relief agreements consistent
with the enhancedHIPC Initiative.

                      The Firstand SecondPovertyReductionStrategies

The Financial Year 2007 markedthe final year o f the implementation o fthe 2005-2007 SL-PRS.
The foundation o f the 2005-07 SL-PRS i s a series o f extensive consultations conducted
throughout the country. These consultations were characterized by open and frank dialogue
between Government and the people represented by key stakeholders drawn from all levels o f
society. Three pillars emerged from these discussions: (i)  Good Governance, Security and Peace
Building; (ii) Pro-poor Sustainable Growth for Food Security and Job Creation; and (iii)       Human
Development.

Good Governance, Security and Peace Building: The key elements o f the government
program under the first pillar include: (i)strengthening the anti-corruption agenda; (ii)    continued
improvements in PFM; (iii)     improvements inpublic service delivery through capacity building;
iv) decentralization o f service delivery; and (v) better statistics for monitoring outcomes.
Consolidation o f the peace, achieved in January 2002, will be promoted through: (i)           judicial
reform; (ii)tackling humanrights abuses; (iii)   deepening democratic institutions; (iv) improving
access to information; and (v) continued strengthening o fthe police and armed forces.

Pro-poor SustainableGrowth for Food Security andJob Creation: The key elements inthe
government program for sustainable growth under the second pillar include three broad
objectives: the maintenance o f a conducive macroeconomic environment, food security and job
creation. These are to be achieved through: (i)      appropriate fiscal and monetary policies and
effective debt management; (ii)support to the productive sectors, and especially agriculture,
through the provision o f inputs, machinery, extension services and training; (iii)    investments in
infrastructure for power, roads and information technology; (iv) improvements inthe investment
climate including improvements in the legal framework and better access to credit and micro-
finance programs; and (v) divestiture o fpublic enterprises.

Human Development: The third pillar includes several broad objectives: expanded basic
education and training, expanded health, immunization and nutrition services, increased access to
water and sanitation facilities, affordable housing for the poor, HIV/AIDS prevention and
control, gender equality and empowerment, and better environmental management. The key
elements o f the government program for human development under the third pillar include: the
decentralization o f several services, construction and rehabilitationo f facilities, subsidies, school
feeding programs, improved curricula, training for teachers and health workers, and better
administration, including improved statistics for monitoring educational enrollment rates and
health outcomes. The provision o f these basic services will contribute to the maintenance of
social stability as well as progress towards the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

Preparations are now underway for a second poverty reduction strategy covering the years 2009-
11and a ten year national strategic development plan. The draft o f the second SL-PRS is well
advanced and a formal launch i s envisaged before the close o f 2008.



                                                 24

Mr.President, with the support from the World Bank andthe other multi-donor budget support
partners, the Government will continue to make good progress in implementing the elements o f
the first and second SL-PRS in order to promote sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction.

       THE GOVERNMENT'S FOODAND FUELCRISIS RESPONSEPROGRAM

Giventhe highlevel o f poverty in Sierra Leone, andinorder not to further increase the number
o f people already below the poverty line in 2008, the Government established a high level task
force comprised o f the ministersresponsible for finance, trade and commerce, and agriculture to
leadthe Government response to the food andfuel price increases.

As one o f its first actions inresponse to the emerging crisis, the Government decided not to fully
pass through the recent high international prices o f food and fuel to consumers. This was
achieved by reducing import tariffs on petrol, diesel, kerosene, rice, wheat, flour and sugar in
March 2008. Inaddition, the reference values (CIF) used for the calculation o f import duties for
these products were set at values below the prevailing international prices. For example, while
the internationalprice o f imported rice rose to US$775 per metric ton inJune 2008, the reference
value currently used i s US$ 375 per metric ton. The import duty on fuel was also removed in
November 2007 and later reinstated at a specific rate o f US$20 per metric ton instead o f 5
percent ad-valorem formerly levied on all fuel imports. The excise tax on petroleum products
was reduced by L e 610 per imperial gallon in November 2007 and partially restored at Le 310
perimperial gallon inMarch2008.

The reduction in tariffs on food and fuel has under-mined domestic revenue mobilization and
thereby deprived Government o f the fiscal space to deliver the planned level o f basic services.
Actual domestic revenue collected on imported food and fuel for the first half o f the year could
have been higher than the budgeted amount by L e 626 million and L e 9.5 billion, respectively, if
tariffs had not been adjusted downwards. Correspondingly, potential revenue on these products
for the second half o f the year is expected to exceed the budgeted amount by L e 1.5 billion and
L e 9.1 billion. The total loss for the year i s estimated at Le 20.7 billion or US$7 million.

Mr. President, the fiscal implications of combining the foregone revenue with the additional
costs o f basic service delivery deserves serious attention in order not to jeopardize
macroeconomic and social stability. The forgone revenue from reducing the tariffs in 2008 i s
significant when measured against total programmed budget support o f US$60 million. Due to
the rising costs o f food and fuel, the current budgetary allocations to MDAs are insufficient if
they are to provide the planned level o f basic services duringthe year. Additional resources are
needed if the delivery o f basic services i s to be maintained if not expanded. The government i s
especially concerned about the programs for education, health, social welfare, and local councils.

Inthis context, the government therefore seeks fast-disbursing external assistanceto mitigate the
negative impact o f the recent tariff reductions taken in response to escalating international food
andfuel prices.




                                                   25

The task force is discussing options with its development partners to further protect the most
vulnerable populations from food price inflation. The World Bankplans to fimd a cash-for-work
program through the National Commission for Social Action through a top-up to its National
Social Action Project. With proposed support from the other multi-donor budget partners, WFP
could expand its ongoing social safety net programs including the school feeding program, the
supplemental feeding program for pregnant and lactating mothers, and the food-for-work
program. The impact o f rising fuel prices on electricity generation will be softened by an
agreement with the United Nations Peace BuildingFundto provide additional financing for fuel
for emergency power.

The task force also intends to stimulate agricultural production in an effort to slow or reverse
rising food prices. As part o f the short-run effort, the Government has already distributed rice
seedlings throughout the nation's fanning communities. In the medium-term, the Government
will stimulate food production through a combination o f agricultural investment projects,
investments in the road network, especially rural roads, and the provision o f extension services.
This effort will be supported bythe World Bank's Rural andPrivate Sector Development Project
andthe World Bank's InfrastructureDevelopment Project that will make it easier to get produce
to the markets by improving the roadnetwork. Other contributions include AfDB's Agricultural
Sector Rehabilitation Project, F A D ' s Rehabilitation and Community Based Poverty Reduction
Project, the EC Transitional Support LRRD ( food security component), IDB's Diversified Food
ProductionProject, andthejoint IDA/EC/IDB Rehabilitationo fFeeder Roads Project.

                     The FoodCrisisResponseDevelopmentPolicyGrant

The proposed grant o f US$3 million equivalent would support selected elements o f the SL-PRS
in2008 by providing needed fiscal space to partially compensate for the lost revenues resulting
from the recently reduced tariffs on food and fuel imports. This support would help mitigate the
impact o f such price increases and contribute to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable
groups.    Special attention will be given to feeding programs in the schools and hospitals.
Specifically: (i)approximately 12,800 patients would continue to receive food annually in
district hospitals and community health centers; (ii)   roughly 5,300 hospital patients, including
lactating mothers and children under the age o f five, would be fed three times a day; (iii)
approximately 3,000 pupils in government boarding schools and handicapped children would
continue to be fed three times per day; and (iv) about 500 children in remand homes and
approved schools would continue to receive food.

The program supported by the grant would conclude in June 2009: the 2009 budget will be
informed by the second SL-PRS as well as the policy recommendations o f the high level task
force for food and fuel crisis.

Conclusion

Macroeconomic and budgetary management during 2008 has been, and will be, very
challenging. While Government i s trying to ameliorate the impact of rising food and fuel prices
on the poor andvulnerable, the actions taken have resultedinrevenue losses when they are most
needed for the protection of basic services. Inthis context, the continued and enhanced support
of our development partners remains critical in enabling the Government of Sierra Leone to
tackle the desperatepoverty situation andhence maintainpolitical and socio-economic stability.

IMFExecutiveBoard CompletesSecond ReviewUnder PRGFArrangement for Sierra Leone,
Approves Extension of Arrangement and US$7.2 Million Disbursement
Press Release No. 08/166
July 7,2008

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund(IMF) has completed the second review o f
Sierra Leone's performance under a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement.
The Executive Board also approved a one-year extension o f the PRGF arrangement to 2010.The
completion o f this review allows for the disbursement o f SDR 4.4 million (about US$7.2 million),
which would bring total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 13.5 million (about US$22.1
million).

The Executive Board also granted waivers for the non-observance o f three quantitative performance
criteria on the basis o f corrective measures taken and the temporary nature o f the deviations from the
quantitative targets.

The PRGF arrangement for Sierra Leone was approved on May 10,2006 in an amount equivalent to
SDR 31.1million (about US$50.9 million), to support the government's 2006-08 economic program.
The extension o f the program from three years to four years should provide sufficient time to achieve
the programobjectives (see Press Release No. 06/94).

Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, said:

"Economic growth in Sierra Leone remained robust in 2007 and early 2008, led by solid agriculture
and miningproduction and buoyant activity inthe construction and service sectors. Inflation, though
rising, was relatively contained in the face o f surging global food and energy prices. Performance
under the PRGF-supported program was mixed in the second half o f 2006 through much o f 2007.
Significant revenue shortfalls,      exacerbated by delayed external budgetary assistance, had
complicated budget execution. These developments contributed to a severe compression o f priority
spending and the accumulation o f domestic arrears. The strong commitment o f the authorities to
address the sources o f these setbacks and move forward with key structural reforms in the period
ahead i s welcome, and the recent improvement inprogram implementation i s encouraging."

"The proposed fiscal stance for 2008 seeks to recapture the momentum lost in mobilizing domestic
revenue, and strikes a good balance between expanding poverty-reducing and infrastructure spending
and preventing the accumulation o f public debt. The authorities are committed to stayingthe course,
with wide-ranging measures to make the National Revenue Authority more efficient and broaden the
tax base. Firm control over expenditure commitments by ministries, departments, and agencies will
provide critical support to the objective o f domestic arrears clearance while creating fiscal space to
address essential social needs."

"The Bank o f Sierra Leone will focus on strengthening its management o f liquidity and monitoring
closely developments inthe monetary aggregates, given the need to contain the second-round effects
o f rising import prices for food and fuel."




                                                  29

"First steps have been taken to advance structural reforms, in particular in public financial
management and the financial sector. The authorities will work to ensure transparency in all public
procurement contracts, strengthen the Anti-Cormption Commission, and improve the financial
viability o f public utilities in order to promote good governance, accountability, and sustained high
growth," Mr.Portugal said.

The PRGF i s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an annual
interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a %-year grace period on principal
payments.
