MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTI.E DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE GABONESE REPUBLIC
FOR A FORESTRY AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Gabonese Republic for US$22.5
million equivalent, on standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
15 years, including a five-year grace period, to help finance a Forestry
and Environment Project.
2.          Background.  Forestry exploitation has traditionally played a
very important role in the Gabonese economy, particularly before the oil
boom. In 1987, it represented 12% of export value, second only to oil.
Total dense forest cover is estimated at 22 million ha, of which 12.5
million are considered to be valuable commercial stands. Given its natural
resources, Gabon is one of the richer countries in Africa. The country's
flora and fauna benefit from a diversity that is unparalleled in tropical
Africa. The rich forest of Gabon is also an important sanctuary for 19
different primate species. The gorilla and chimpanzee population is
estimated at 35,000 and 64,000 respectively. There are also about 20
indigenous carnivorous species and more than 600 bird species. A number of
waterways and a long (750 km) coastline contain a diverse fish population
and other marine life systems. In addition, Gabon possesses significant
petroleum, natural gas, and hydro-electric resources.
3.          Environmental damage is localized mainly because of Gabon's low
rural population density (fewer than one inhabitant per km2) and the
minimal impact of agricultural practices (shifting cultivation/slash and
burn). Logging activities, still below maximum sustainable exploitation
levels in most of the country (forest exploitation rate is estimated at 0.6
percent of the country's surface area per annum), have however caused
environmental concerns in the depleted coastal zone. Extensive logging in
this zone, coupled with an increase in commercial game hunting, has led the
Government to initiate measures to protect the country's rich and diverse
natural resource base. Although a sound legal framework exists it has not
been fully translated into applicable decrees.
4.          The Ministry of Waters and Forestry (MEF) and the Ministry of
Environment, Tourism and National Parks (METPN) are the main institutions
responsible for implementing the Government's strategy for the forestry and
environment sector. As part of the envisaged strategy, the Government has
agreed to establish a restructuring program for MEF and assign part of its
plethoric headquarters staff to regional forestry services. This program's
objectives would be to: (a) reduce the overlapping of institutional
functions so as to avoid conflicts, duplication of efforts, and an
inefficient utilization of resources; and (b) increase the Ministry's
operational capacity in the field.
5.          Proiect Obiectives.  The project would: (a) contribute to a
better use of forestry resources by implementing, on a pilot basis, a
management plan in the depleted coastal zone; (b) to this end, reinforce
the strategic planning and operational capacity of government institutions
in the sector through the restructuring and strengthening of MEF and METPN;
(c) resume forestry and environment research activities; (d) make forestry
and environment training more practical and tailored to the needs of the
private sector and to conservation needs; (e) help prevent environmental
degradation through the implementation of recommendations from key
environmental studies; and (f) support the Government in the creation and
maintenance of wildlife reserves.



6.          The project is expected to have a major beneficial impact on
the environment. It would assist the Government so that the existing
comprehensive laws for the protection of the environment are enforced.
Along with the interventions of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the project
would assist the Government in clearly defining the protected areas through
their designation as reserves or, where applicable, as national parks, as
well as strengthening the Government's capacity to control and manage these
reserves and parks. The project would represent the first phase of a long
term effort to bri. sbout the rational utilization of the country's
natural resource base.
7.          Proiect Description.  To meet the above objectives, the project
would include the following components:
(a) Institutional Strenathenina. Assistance would be provided in
restructuring MEF to streamline and better define the functions
of its directorates; and in supplying other resources (field
housing, offices, vehicles, etc.) to increase MEF and METPN
operational, planning and monitoring capabilities, and, more
importantly, increase their presence in the field so as to
enable them to better superv4pe logging operations and prevent
poaching and other actions which co"id have a negative impact
on the environment.
(b) Forestrv and Environment Trainina. Activities under this
component would consist of: (i) promoting a forestry and
environment training program tailored to the needs of the
private sector, (ii) providing professional training and
retraining for forestry graduates; and (iii) implementing a
management and conservation plan for the Mondah Forest.
(c)   Forestry and Environment Research.  Activities envisaged under
this component would center on: (i) genetic improvement of
Okoume trees; (ii) sylvicultural operations on natural forest
and plantations with the view of bringing about durable and
rational management of forest resources; and (iii)
stabilization of agricultural production systems in forest
areas through agroforestry techniques--this need was
highlighted during the Environmental Impact Assessment (EA)
process. Some equipment and refrigeration facilities would be
provided to the National Arboretum to ensure the conservation
of its unique collection of plant species.
(d)   Forest Inventory and Rehabilitation.  Project support would
include the preparation and implementation of a management plan
subsequent to the rehabilitation and protection of 40,000 ha of
natural Okoume stands identified from an inventory of 275,000
ha in th%. coastal zone; and rehabilitation of 5,000 to 6,000 ha
of artificial Okoum6 stands.
(e)   Creation and Maintenance of Reserves.  This component concerns
the protection of the Moukalaba and Sett6-Cama reserves and
provision of infrastructure for the creation of additional
reserves. In concert with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the
reserves would be strengthened and, in time, opened for eco-
tourism purposes.
8.          Proiect Cost and Financina.  The total cost of the project is
estimated at US$38.2 million equivalent of which US$22.2 million equivalent
(r,FAF 6.1 billion) or 58.1 percent in foreign exchange. The European
Economic Community (EEC), the World Wildlife Fund, and the Banque Arabe
pour le D6veloppement Economique en Afrique (BADEA) are expected to
participate in the financing of the project. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement

and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are presented in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
Group operations are given in Schedule C and D respectively. A map is also
attached.
9.          Proiect Implementation.  The Gabonese Government through its
Ministry of Waters and Forestry would be responsible for the execution of
the project. It would be implemented through existing
institutions/departments, and the responsibility for executing each
component or sub-component would rest with the particular institution
concerned. The Directorate General of Forestry (DGF) would be responsible
for implementing the Forest Inventory and Rehabilitation component and for
carrying out the institutional strengthening of its sub-directorates and
regional services. The Forestry and Environment Training component would
be implemented by the National School of Waters and Forestry (ENEF), and
the Forestry and Environment Research component by the Directorate General
of Forestry. The creation and maintenance of reserves would be undertaken
by the Directorate of Wildlife (DFC) with the cooperation of World Wildlife
Fund (WWF) field personnel and in concert with the Directorate General of
Environment (DGE). Responsibility for the various studies would rest with
DGE which is also responsible for implementing the UNDP-funded National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) . Overall responsibility for project
monitoring and coordination would rest with MEF's Project Coordination Unit
(PCU).
10.        -To ensure inter-ministerial coordination and periodically
assess progress, a Project Coordination Committee (PCC) would be set up and
chaired by the Minister of Waters and Forestry. It would include the
Project Coordinator, heads of technical directorates involved in project
implementation, the Director of Investment Programs at the Ministry of
Planning, a representative of State Timber Marketing Office (SNBG), the
President of the Foresters syndicate and representatives of local
environmental NGOs (CENA, PEG, IADR). The committee would meet at least
twice a year to review project progress and address inter-ministerial and
other policy issues.
11.         Proiect Sustainability. The proposed project aims at bringing
about rational utilization of natural resources through the strengthening
of institutions in the sector. The reorienting of forestry and
environmental training towards the needs of the private sector, the
strengthening of biodiversity reserves which, in time, would be opened for
eco-tourism purposes, and the adoption of sound legal and fiscal frameworks
are all features that were emphasized in project design to ensure
sustainability.
12.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  Because the
proposed project would be the first to be financed by the Bank in the
Gabonese rural sector, preparation efforts capitalized on experiences
gained in other countries (C6te d'Ivoire, Central African Republic, Congo)
during the preparation and implementation of similar operations. In
particular, the need to fully involve in the project design, not only
Government institutions but also NGOs and local communities was stressed
during the preparation process. In this regard, an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EA) of the project was initiated before appraisal so as to: (a)
record experiences of past development efforts in the sector; (b) provide a
platform to get input from the population concerned by the project; and (c)
fully internalize the project at all levels of the society. Subsequently,
project design was fine-tuned to include a mitigation plan for actions that
could pose potential risks to the environment. Other lessons incorporated
in project design include significant measures in the area of fiscal
reform, institutional strengthening, and forestry and environmental
legislation. The underpinnings of the above measures are highlighted in
the Statement of Sector Development Policy (Lettre de Politique G6n&rale
pour le Secteur Forgts et Environnement) which was finalized during
negotiations.



- 4 -
13.         agreements reached.  Assurances were obtained that: (a) the
Government would complete a study of the forest fiscal system by March 31,
1993 and take agreed measures required to implement the study's
recommendations; (b) detailed programs of operations and budgets would be
submitted to the Bank for review and approval; and (c) a mid-term review
would be undertaken by June 30, 1995. The following conditions would be
fulfilled prior to Loan effectiveness: (a) adoption and promulgation of the
environmental law (Loi Relative a la Protection et A l'Amelioration de
1'Environnement); (b) signature of two decrees defin!.ng the forest areas
which may be exploited as well as the specific conditions for exploitation;
(c) submission to the Bank of an acceptable staffing plan resulting from
MEF restructuring including a reasonable timetable for the implementation
of field staff transfer; (d) signature of a Ministerial arrete setting
aside areas to be rehabilitated; (e) opening of a project account and
evidence of initial deposit of CFAF 150 million; and (f) estaDlishment of
the Project Coordination Unit and posting of the Project Coordinator.
14.         Environmental Aspects.  Although the project was initially
classified under the environmental category D, indicating a project with
positive impact on the environment, the Bank and the Gabonese Government
decided to undertake a full Environmental Impact Assessment of the project.
In FY92, the category D classification was abolished. The project was
subsequently reclassified as a category A project. The EA was initiated in
June 1991 to ensure the soundness of the project and confirm that
activities proposed under the project would not impact negatively on the
environment and on local communities in the project area. It was condtcted
by a working group comprised of staff from key ministries (MEF, METPN,
MPE), and two local consultants (one Environmentalist, and one Sociologist)
working closely with an internationally-recruited environmentalist.
Several local environmental NGOs (Club des Ecologistes et Naturalistes
Africains-CENA, Front des Ecologistes Gabonais-FEG, Inter Assistance pour
le D6veloppement Rural-IADR) and community groups were also involved from
the beginning. The local media (press, radio),. seminars and large public
meetings provided a platform through which all interested parties could
comment on the project viability/necessity and potential impacts as
designed prior to appraisal.
15.         The EA revealed that the project could have two significant
impacts: (a) a possible increase in wildlife poaching (already a serious
problem in Gabon) in the project are.-; and (b) localized pressure on land
in areas with relatively high population density, notably around plantation
sites envisaged in the project. A mitigation plan was developed for each
of these potential impacts and its proposed measures and costs were
incorporated into the project design. Moreover, the EA process confirmed
that: (a) the project components would not include support to any logging
operations7 (b) the project would not lead to any resettlement of people;
and (c) the project would be fully consistent with the Bank's Forest
Policy.
16.         Proaram obiectives Catecories.  The proposed project addresses
the Bank's environmental and natural resource conservation strategy through
the implementation of actions designed to: (a) improve forest management;
(b) prevent wildlife poaching; and (c) ensure environmental protection.
Moreover, the project aims at supporting the forestry sector, the largest
employer in rural areas, to properly fulfill its social and environmental
functions, thereby addressing the Bank's anti-poverty program.
17.         Proiect Benefits.  The proposed project would improve the
management and protection of Gabon's forest resources and its environment.
Measures envisaged under the project would help: (a) stop overexploitation
in the coastal zone; and (b) initiate a sound forest management plan for
the remaining areas of the country. The project would serve as an
important instrument for implementing government policies dealing with
forestry and the environment, and would further strengthen the scope of
these policies. The project would strengthen MEP and METPN's planning and



operational capacity through the implementation of training programs,
studies, and the provision of vehicles, equipment, and infrastructure. As
a result of the National Environmental Action Plan initiated during project
preparation, more appropriate conservation policies would be developed and
implemented. The project would also encourage private sector involvement
in the implementation of activities which would have a significant impact
on the conservation of the forestry sector, and provide significant
employment potential for the rural areas. Through the implementation of a
revamped training program at ENEF, the project would make forestry and
environment training more relevant to the needs of the private sector and
to conservation needs.
18.         _jjks.  The main risk of the project lies in the fragility of
institutions in the sector. The restructuring of MEF and the reassigning
of some of its staff to field offices, represent sensitive issues, but need
to be undertaken if the competitiveness of the wood sector and the
envisaged conservation objectives are to be attained. To reduce the risk,
MEF would be formally restructured and an acceptable field staff transfer
plan would be a condition of effectiveness. Also, the shortage of
adequately trained staff will be minimized through improved training
programs and some technical assistance.
19.         With regard to the environment, Government's capacity to
follow-up on environmental issues and the willingness of private foresters
to participate in forest conservation programs pose potential risks. The
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) initiated during project
preparation would clearly establish each party's role and help formulate
policies to better protect the environment.
20.         A final risk concerns the timely availability of counterpart
funding which, in the past has been consistently delayed and inadequate for
the forestry and environment sector. This risk is minimized, however, by
the fact t4at the Government has come to realize the importance of forestry
and the environment and, therefore, is committed to supporting the sector.
Also, counterpart funds are made available in a timely fashion in other
Bank-financed projects (Technical Assistance, Road Maintenance) in Gabon.
In addition, considerable efforts have been deployed to involve the
Planning and Finance ministr4es since the early stages of project
preparation to ensure that the Government's contribution is properly
provided for in the investment program.
21.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
