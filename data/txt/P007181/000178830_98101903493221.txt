i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of the
installation of a 33-Mw steam-electric generating set at the Guacalate
plant site near Escuintla and the provision of consulting services for the
proposed Atitlan hydroelectric development.
ii.       A Bank loan has been requested by the Ingtituto Nacional de Elec-
trificacion (INDE) to cover the foreign exchange cost of the Project the
total cost of which is estimated to be the equivalent of US$8.9 million.  The
loan would be for the equivalent of US$7.0 million including interest during
construction.  This will bring the Bank's participation in INDE's current
generation expansion program to US$22 million equivalent, or 68% of the total
cost of US$32.5 million equivalent.
iii.      The proposed borrower, the Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion,
is an autonomous agency of the Government of Guatemala. This would be the
second loan to INDE. The previous loan of US$15 million equivalent, 487-GU
signed March 10, 1967, was for the Jurun-Marinala hydroelectric project.
iv.       The Project is required to enable INDE to meet the forecast load
growth and to improve system reliability and efficiency.  It is technically
sound, the estimated cost is reasonable, and the construction schedule is
realistic.
v.        INDE would be capable of managing the construction of the Project
with the assistance of consultants.  Satisfactory operation of the Project
would be assured by the employment of supervisory personnel to be provided
by the contractors while training INDE's operating staff.
vi.       The Project costs would not adversely affect INDE's financial
position. Existing tariffs would provide sufficient revenues so that INDE
should continue to earn at least a 9% rate of return after 1969.
vii.      The potential benefits of the proposed Atitlan project are large.
The pre-investment studies should be accelerated and should consider the
possible advantages of interconnection with El Salvador.
viii.     The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$7.0 million
equivalent, for a period of 23 years including a grace period of about three
years.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a Project including installa-
tion of a 33-Mw steam-electric generating unit, and consultants' services
for studies and preliminary design of the Atitlan hydroelectric scheme. The
Project forms the second stage of the expansion program of the Instituto
Nacional de Electrificacion (INDE), a government-owned corporation responsible
for development of power resources in Guatemala.
1.02      INDE has requested from the Bank a loan to cover the foreign exchange
costs of the Project amounting to US$7.0 million equivalent including interest
during construction. The total cost of the Project is estimated to be the
equivalent of US$8.9 million.
1.03      The proposed loan would be the second Bank loan to INDE and would
increase the Bank's participation in INDE's current generation-expansion pro-
gram to US$22 million equivalent, or 68% of the total estimated cost of
US$32.5 million. The first loan of US$15.0 million equivalent is being used
as part of the financing for the Jurun-Marinala project and related facili-
ties, the first stage of INDE's development program. This first loan, Loan
487-GU, was signed March 10, 1967, but did not become effective until
November 14, 1967 due to extended consideration by the National Assembly.
No delays in ratification are foreseen for the proposed loan. Disbursements
under Loan 487-GU were more than US$2 million an of April 30, 1968, and the Pro-
ject is proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be completed as
scheduled.
1.04      This report is based on information supplied by the Instituto
Nacional de Electrificacion to a mission consisting of Messrs. J. Beach, J.
Fish, and A. A. M. Onslow of the Bank, which visited Guatemala in September-
October 1967, supplementing data collected by a mission consisting of Messrs.
J. Beach and D. I. Miller of the Bank which visited Guatemala in June, 1967.
Supplementary information was provided by INDE during negotiations.
2. THE BORROWER
History and Purpose
2.01      The Borrower would be the Instituto Nacional de Electrificacion
(INDE), an autonomous government agency created by Decree No. 1987 in May
1959 with full authority to develop Guatemala's electric power resources "for
the general benefit of the nation."  To this end it is permitted to generate,
transmit, distribute, buy and sell electric energy.  The decree also gave
INDE the responsibility to regulate the power industry; although as discussed
in para.5.O7 INDE is taking steps to divest itself of the regulatory func-
tion.



- 2 -
2.02      Electricity generated by INDE is wholesaled to distributors.  Oper-
ations are conducted in four reglons of the country (see map) but 80% of
INDE's sales are to the Empresa Electrica de Guatemala ("EEG" - a subsidiary
of the American and Foreign Power Company) which serves the principal load
center in and around Guatemala City in the Central Region. The proposed Pro-
ject will augment INDEts capacity in this region.
2.03      Although the authority was established in 1959, because of the
time required to form the organization and to turn over existing generating
facilities,INDE did not become active until 1961.  Before this date no single
organization in Guatemala was responsible for the control of the power
industry. Some of the functions of such an organization had been carried
out by the Department of National Electrification which formed part of the
Ministry of Public Works. The Department did not have any well-defined
jurisdiction and in general its activities were confined to investigation of
future hydroelectric projects and the provision of electric generati6n.facili-
ties in some of the smaller communities, including operation of the Santa
Maria system in the Western Region.
The Construction Program
2.04      Decree No. 275 of September 1964 detailed the construction program
which INDE was to undertake and gave authority to the Minister of the
Treasury and Public Credits to provide such finance as was necessary. The
projects specified were the Los Esclavos and El Porvenir hydro plants then
under construction in the Central and Western Regions respectively, a gas
turbine plant at Guacalate, the Jurun-Marinala hydroelectric scheme, and the
study of the future development of Lake Atitlan.
2.05      INDE has since accepted the responsibility for providing all new
generating capacity required to supply the public-service systems in the
country, and the current generation-expansion program includes, in addition
to the specified projects, a second gas-turbine unit, a 5000-kw diesel plant
intended for the Atlantic region, and the proposed 33-Mw thermal plant.
The future program now being studied would comprise additional generating
capacity as required including the construction of Atitlan, transmission grids
to interconnect the Central, Eastern and Western systems, a possible inter-
connection with El Salvador, and distribution extensions in the outlying regions.
Existing Facilities
2.06      The major facilities owned and operated by INDE comprise hydro
plants at Los Esclavos (13 Mw), the three Michatoya plants (12 Mw), Santa
Maria (5.8 Mw) and Rio Hondo (2.4 Mw); a diesel installation at San Felipe
(2.4 Nw) in the Western Region, a 500-kwq diesel set at Puerto Barrios, and
the gas turbine unit at Guacalate (12.5 Mw). The second ,2.5-Mw gas turbine
unit at Guacalate is to be placed in commercial operation in June, 1968. The
Michatoya plants (in the Central system) were transferred to INDE from EEG on
November 14, 1967, under the terms of a purchase agreement negotiated in
connection with the Jurun-Marinala project.



- 3 -
2.07      The Jurun-1Marina'La hydro project will have a capacity of 60 Mw when
it is completed in 1970. Transmission lines and substations being construct-
ed as part of that project will interconnect the Guatemala City load center
with INDE's plants in the Central Region, including Guacalate, site of the
proposed steam unit.
Organization and Management
2.08      INDE's Board consists of five directors and three alternates.   The
members of the Board are appointed for indefinite terms by the Chief of
Government through the Minister of Communications and Public Works. The five
directors must include three engineers, one lawyer and an economist. All
members participate in Board meetings but only the five directors are per-
mitted to vote. In the absence of a director his powers are delegated to
the alternate of the same profession.
2.09      Under the terms of the Jurun-Marinala loan, INDE was to employ
consultants for assistance in reorganizing and strengthening INDE's management
structure. Through no fault of INDE, delays have occurred in meeting this re-
quirement but a contract has now been signed with Middle West Service Company
and the Consultants have started work, so progress in this connection is sat-
isfactory. There are no substantial shortcomings in INDE's present organiza-
tion, but the Consultants' advice will enable INDE to meet the needs for
changes in its management structure resulting from the rapid growth of the
physical plant.
3. POWER MARKET
Central Region
3.01      Guatemala City is the load center of the Central Region.   BEG,
operating under a 50-year concession granted in 1922, distributes power in
Guatemala City and the adjoining provinces of Sacatepequez and Escuintla.
EEG now has 53 Mw of generating capacity and INDE 37.5 Mw of capacity in this
region. EEG does not intend to install further capacity since INDE has now
assumed the responsibility for meeting generation needs. Daily operation
of the system in the Central Region is controlled by an EEG dispatcher at
Laguna, guided by generation schedules established by a coordinating commit-
tee composed of EEG and INDE.
3.02      The load in the Central Region has experienced a recent growth of
12% to 14% per year. The peak demand in December 1966 was 86 Mw, an increase
of 17.5% from December 1965. Per capita consumption in 1966 was 323 kwh,
still among the lowest for principal population centers in Latin America.
Generally, supply and distribution facilities have been made available to
serve all potential customers within the service area and there was no signi-
ficant unsatisfied demand, but in the last half of 1967 some load shedding
through circuit interruption and deliberate lowering of voltage and frequency
on peak was necessary to compensate for maintenance shutdowns of EEG generat-
ing units. All generating units were returned to service by the end of the
year but this situation, plus an end-of-year lull in general economic activi-
ty, resulted in a 1967 peak demand of 89 Mw, only a 3% growth over 1966
although energy sales were up 8%. Normal growth is expected in 1968 as the
capacity shortage will be relieved temporarily when INDE's Guacalate No. 2
gas turbine is placed in service.



-h -
3.03      Several projections of load growth in the Central Region have been
made by INDE and INDE's consultants.  These show annual growth rates of 12%
to 14% and all are substantially in agreement. The forecasts reflect the
sustained industrial development and new residential construction in Guate-
mala City, and the general growth of the economy in the metropolitan area.
These trends are expected to continue.  Industrial sales accounted for 42%
of total sales in 1966 and 1967, up from 314% in 1964. Residential sales are
31% with the remainder divided about equally between commercial sales and
consumption for public uses (street lighting, government buildings, etc.).
INDE has adopted the demand figures shown in Annex 2 for planning purposes,
and these are considered reasonable.
3.04      Demand and energy requirements in the Central Region are expected
to double by 1972, from the present 89 Mw to 176 Mw, and from 420 Gwh to
829 Gwh.  The effect of the present peak-suppression should be temporary and
demand and sales should recover to predicted values shortly after restric-
tions are removed. In the decade after 1972, demand and energy are predicted
to increase threefold to 610 Mw and 2,710 Gwh in 1982.
3.05      Annex 1 is a graph showing the forecast growth in demand.  The
curve has a curious step characteristic indicating that most of the load
growth each year takes place in the last quarter. The increase in construc-
tion activity at the end of the rainy season probably accounts for this and
it must be taken into account for the proper scheduling of generating capa-
city additions.
3.06      The annual load factor has held steady at about 53% throughout the
past few years. INDE has assumed that the load mix will not change appre-
ciably and has used a load factor of 54% for the load forecasts. This
assumption is reasonable.
Outlying Regions
3.07      Electricity consumption in the outlying regions (Western, Eastern,
and Atlantic) accounts for only 20% of total usage in the country and was
only 33 kwh per capita in 1966. INDE supplies about 80% of this amount; the
remainder is generated by small municipal plants and independent suppliers.
Total installed capacity serving public systems is about 25 Mw. About 30%
of INDE's gross income is from sales in these regions. Although this per-
centage is not expected to increase, load development in these regions will
be a significant factor in INDE's future operations.
3.08      IDtE plans to develop an integrated grid supplying the Eastern,
Western, and Central Regions. The Eastern Region will be interconnected with
the Central system by sub-transmission lines now under construction around
Los Esclavos. By the time these lines are completed there will be a
deficiency of generating capacity in this region so about 20 million kwh
will be imported from the Central System in 1970. The Western Region will be
connected to the Central system as part of the Atitlan project, but additional
generating capacity may be required in this area before the interconnection is
established. No provision has been made in the financial plan for this ca-
pacity since the scope and timing would depend on the scheduling of Atitlan.



3.09      The Government has instructed INDE to accelerate the expansion of
electrical systems in the rural areas, and IiDE has prepared a construction
program for the Eastern and Western Regions that would result in an increase
in demand from the present 5,100 kw to 19,000 kw in 1972. However, as yet
the economic feasibility of the entire program has not been justified, so
for purposes of this report a reduced program has been assumed (seepara. 5.25).
It is forecast that this moderate program would result in load increases of
12% per year in these regions.
3.10      INDE has contracted with a Guatemalan firm of consulting engineers
to prepare a load growXth and expansion study for the Atlantic Region, in-
cluding the new port facility at Puerto Matias de Galvez near Puerto Barrios.
Estimates of demand and sales are not yet available for the expanded service
area in this region, and so,for purposes of this report, sales forecasts are
based on a continuation of the historical annual growth rate of 5%. This
assumption is conservative. The 5000-kw diesel generating plant planned
for Puerto Matias de Galvez, to be financed in part from proceeds of the
Jurun-Marinala loan, has not been purchased pending completion of the new
study, but the Bank has agreed to INDE's request to purchase the units for
temporary installation in the Central Region.
3.11      Electric power in the northern half of the country is confined to
a few small installations at administrative centers. The area is a
sparsely-populated jungle lowland without significant prospect for develop-
ment. Similarly, the remainder of the country outside the four regions
considered is mostly mountainous with little need for electricity. Although
substantial mineral resources are thought to exist, at present there are
no known plans for mining, agricultural, or industrial developments requiring
significant amounts of power located outside the four geographical regions
discussed above.
4. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      A detailed description of the Project is given in Annex 3.  The
map shows the location of the proposed steam plant and the general arrange-
ment of the system.
The Project would consist of:
(i)   A steam-electric generating station with one 33-Mw unit
to be constructed at INDE's Guacalate generating plant
site near Escuintla, about 50 km south of Guatemala
City, and
(ii)  Consultants' services for site investigations, studies
and design of the first stage of the Atitlan hydro-
electric project.



-6-
Justification for the Steam Plant
4.02      Annex 2 indicates the anticipated system operation thlrough 1982
including the 33-Mw unit and assuming that both the Jurun-Marinala hydro
plant and the steam unit come into service in 1970. The forecast shows that
the proposed steam unit is needed to provide. base-load capacity through-
out the period, including the year of initial operation, and also that, even
with this unit, the reserve position will not be fully satisfactory until
Atitlan is in service.
4.03      Under present schedules initial operation of the last units at
Jurun-Marinala and the proposed steam plant will be nearly concurrent. By
continuing the diesel units in base-load service, it would be possible to
defer the steam unit for several months. However, INDE's decision to proceed
on the present schedule is reasonable because if the steam unit were delayed,
fuel cost savings of $100,000 per month would be foregone and no capacity
would be available as reserve for emergencies and to allow for shutdowns for
essential maintenance.
4.04      In the pre-investment report prepared by INDE's consultants, the
33-Mw unit size was selected as being the nearest standard rating above the
1968 capacity-shortage estimate of 25 megawatts. The construction schedule
anticipated in that report has not been met so the unit will not be available
to fulfill this requirement. However, the forecast operating plan (Annex 2)
shows that the 33-Mw size is a reasonable choice, since if a smaller unit
were selected additional capacity would be required before initial operation
of the Atitlan project, while a larger standard-size unit (45 or 60 Mw) would
not be fully utilized after completion of Atitlan. The selected steam con-
ditions of 59.8 kg/cm2 at 482C (850 psi, 900F) are standard for this size
unit and appropriate for the anticipated fuel cost and operating conditions.
4.05      The consultant's report also included a comparison between the
steam unit and equivalent gas-turbine capacity. There are no other practi-
cal alternatives. The steam unit showed a substantial economic advantage,
as would be expected for the anticipated operating conditions. Installation
of another gas turbine prior to completion of the steam plant has been
proposed by EEG as necessary to avoid restricting growth in 1969. However,
from INDE's standpoint the investment in a third turbine would not be
justified. A program for system operation during this period has been
developed by INDE, with the assistance and concurrence of EEG. This pro-
gram contemplates temporary installation in the Central System of the
diesel units to be purchased for use in the Atlantic region. The program
is acceptable to the Bank.
4.06      The plant will use No. 6 heavy oil ("Bunker C" or residual) as
fuel. The probable fuel source will be a refinery located about 2 km south
of the plant site but INDE is also negotiating with a second firm which
intends to construct a refinery on the Pacific Coast about 50 km from
Guacalate. An adequate supply of fuel for the proposed plant will be
available from either of these refineries or other suppliers within the
country. Firm prices for fuel have not yet been established. Since the



- 7 -
principal advantage of the Guacalate site is the anticipated saving in fuel
transport cost, it is important to be certain that INDE will benefit from
these savings. INDE has agreed to obtain commitments for fuel supply at a
maximum price which will be sufficiently below the existing price to justify
locating the plant as planned, before placing orders for equipment for the
steam plant. This procedure is acceptable to the Bank.
Atitlan Studies
4.07      The 400-Mw Atitlan hydroelectric scheme has been selected by INDE
as the next stage in the development program. It is described briefly in
Annex 3. This project was considered in the 1962 U.N. Special Fund study
carried out by Acres International Limited, for which the Bank was executing
agent, and feasibility studies have just been completed by Verbund-Plan
(Austria) and SOFRELEC (France). Other reports include those by the con-
sulting engineering firms of Harza and Electro-Watt, and INDE's own extensive
preliminary studies. The overall project has been amply justified (Verbund-
Plan estimates a unit cost of 8 mills/kwh, substantially less than the cost
of equivalent thermal generation), but the details have not yet been
established. The project entails the diversion of at least four rivers,
several power-plant sites, and various unusual features so that the complete
information necessary to delineate the project has not yet been available.
The studies financed as part of this proposed project will provide the
remaining information and carry the work through preparation of bidding
documents for the first-stage facilities.
4.08      None of the previous investigations has considered the operational
economics of the system as a whole and it is probable that a first-stage
Atitlan development more intensive than that now proposed can be justified.
In addition to the work outlined above, this should be considered in the
studies forming part of the proposed 'Project. To assure this, INDE has
agreed that the consultants selected and their terms of reference would be
subject to the Bank's approval.
4.09      The Subcommittee on Electrification of the Committee of Economic
Cooperation of the Central American Isthmus has prepared certain studies on
the possibilities and advantages of interconnection between the national
electrical grids of the various Central American republics. This Subcom-
mittee recently completed a comprehensive report on interconnection between
Guatemala and El Salvador. According to the report, the principal advan-
tages of such an interconnection would be the savings resulting from
maximum utilization of low-cost thermal energy from El Salvador and a more-
intensive first-stage development at Atitlan. The two operating authorities
(INDE and CEL--Comision Ejecutiva Hydroelectrica del Rio Lempa, El Salvador)
are discussing a low-capacity interim interconnection to assist INFDE in
meeting its 1968 peak, but it is unlikely that this can be accomplished in
time to be of benefit since it has been determined that legislative action
by both countries would be required to provide a legal basis for the
interconnection. Interconnection would not be a substitute for the
proposed Guacalate No. 3 steam unit since El Salvador will not have large
amounts of surplus energy until about 1972. The cost of permanent inter-
connecting lines and terminals is estimated at about US$3.1 million equiva-
lent (Guatemala $2.0, El Salvador $1.1 million).  Since this represents



- 8 -
only a small percentage of the cost of the future power projects in each
country and in view of the probable benefits, the Bank should encourage
steps leading to interconnection. In particular, interconnection should be
evaluated in the detailed planning for Atitlan and the necessary facilities
included in the program at appropriate stages, if justified. INDE has
agreed to require such a study as part of the consultant's work for
Atitlan.
Estimated Cost of the Project
4.1o      The Broject is expected to cost the equivalent of US$8.9 million.
The foreign exchange component, including interest during construction, is
estimated to be US$7.0 million equivalent. A cost summary is given below.

4.11      The cost estimate for the steam plant is based on actual bid
prices which have been received for the main equipment andcivil works, plus
an allowance for supervisory services during the first year of commercial
operation. There should be no difficulty in constructing the plant within
the estimated cost. No allowance has been made for the cost of land since
the site is already owned by INDE. The local-cost component for this Project
appears low, but this is due in part to the extensive site work already
performed by INDE and charged to the Guacalate No. 2 gas-turbine project.
The unit cost would be the equivalent of US$165 per kilowatt, which is quite
reasonable.
1/ US$1 = Quetzal 1



- 9 -
4.12      The cost shown for consultanst services for the Atitlan studies
is based on a detailed estimate prepared by INDE. The work includes a study
of possible lake-sealing methods and a substantial amount of exploration
tunneling in addition to the usual geologic and seismic investigations,
studies and design. Originally, INDE had planned to purchase the necessary
equipment and perform much of the site investigation work with its own forces
but INDE has now decided to include this work in the basic studies contract.
This is acceptable to the Bank. The cost for the total Atitlan development
would be about US$80 million and an allowance of US$2.7 million for initial
engineering work is reasonable. The cost of the first stage project of
about 150 Mw would be about US$45 million.
Procurement and Construction
4.13      Contracts for all work other than consultants' services financed
by the proposed loan would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding. Consultants' services would be obtained in accordance with
conventional procedures as approved by the Bank. Disbursements would be
for the foreign currency costs of imported equipment and services only.
Expenditures prior to the date of the loan would not be eligible for re-
imbursement, and should the Project be completed for less than estimated
costs, any undisbursed amount of the proposed loan would be cancelled unless
there were good grounds for applying savings to additional works.
4.14      INDE has retained the Swiss firm, Electro-Watt, of Zurich, for
engineering services and supervision of construction of the steam plant.
Specifications and bidding documents for the plant have been prepared and
bids have been received and are being evaluated. The bidding documents are
acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations INDE agreed that during the
construction of the Project it will continue to employ consultants satis-
factory to the Bank.
4.15      The estimated construction schedule for the steam plant requires
22 to 24 months from time of firm order to initial operation. This is
considered to be a reasonable schedule since no unusual problems of site
conditions, labor or transport are foreseen. It is assumed that contracts
will be awarded in July 1968 so September 1, 1970, has been agreed as a
reasonable date for start of commercial operation.
4.16      INDE is presently negotiating insurance cover for the various
risks incurred by them. This insurance would be extended as required to
include the proposed Project.
4.17      INDE is preparing to invite proposals for the Atitlan studies,
and expects that the consultants would start work by the end of September
1968. The definitive site investigations and preparation of bid documents
for the first construction contract are expected to take one year, with
the remaining work to be completed in the following year. It is essential
that this schedule, or a similar one, be met if the first Atitlan unit is
to commence operation late in 1973 as required by the operating plan. INDE



- 10 -
has agreed to accelerate the selection of consultants so that this schedule
can be realized.
Operating Personnel
4.18      INDE's present operating staff is familiar only with gas turbine,
diesel and hydro machines. Additional personnel, skilled in steam plant
operating techniques, will be needed to operate the new plant. This
operating force must be developed through recruitment and training of new
local staff or by hiring expatriates. INDE has prepared a training program
which includes, in cooperation with C.EoL. in El Salvador, a period of
apprenticeship for INDE personnel at C.E.L.s Acajutla steam plant, as
well as instruction at the manufacturers' works and during the construction
phases of the new unit at Guacalate. Full-time supervisory operators during
the first year of commercial operation will be provided under a supplemen-
tary agreement being negotiated by INDE with the equipment supplier. This
program for providing operating personnel is acceptable to the Bank.

5. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Accounting and Audits
5.01      In the past INDE did not follow normal public utility accounting
practices. Its records and statements were maintained in a manner related
to "fund accounting" whereby all charges were applied against gross income
irrespective of whether the charge was an operating expense or a capital
expense. Depreciation was charged for office equipment, transportation and
other miscellaneous equipment, and also for a small part of the Santa Maria
regional system. Thus no depreciation had been charged for Guacalate, Los
Esolavos, Rio Hondo system and the majority of the Santa Maria system. The
result was that INDE's fixed assets were recorded at almost their original
cost plus major rehabilitation cost.
5.02      In accordance with one of the conditions of Loan No. 487-GU, a
firm of consultants has been advising INDE on changes which were necessary
to set up its accounts in accordance with accepted accounting practices.
Starting with fiscal year 1968, accounting procedures will be in accordance
with their recommendations, and fixed assets have been revalued to reflect
proper depreciation, and such values are used in the accounts as of January 1,
1968.
5.03      INDE's accounts were audited for the first time for the year 1966
and unfortunately owing to the late appointment of the auditor (April 1967)
the result was not as comprehensive as one could have wished. The same
auditor has been reappointed for audit of the 1967 accounts, who has presented
his report in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
5.04      Under the provisions of Loan 487-GU INDE's financial statements
are to be certified annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank and copies transmitted to the Bank within four months of the end of the
financial year. A similar clause has been included in the proposed Loan.
Tariffs - General
5.05      The principles of a tariff policy have never been fully developed
in Guatemala, and the tariffs charged by utilities have not been subjected
to an effective control by any regulatory agency. In the past tariff privi-
leges, including the supply of free energy to several towns, have been grant-
ed in two of INDE's outlying regions. In the Central Region, EEG's conces-
sion contract allows this private company to set its own rates although as
a matter of policy they consult with the Government on.any proposed changes.
5.o6      When INDE was organized, regulatory functions were included in its
charter, but lack of a defined program and qualified personnel prevented
INDE from performing these functions. It is realized both by the Government
and by INDE that the latter cannot combine indefinitely the Oiqpction of a
tariff regulatory body with that of generating and supplying bulk power,
although for the present it is necessary for INDE to fulfill this role in
view of the lack of any feasible alternative.



12 -
5.07      As a condition of signing toan h87-GU, INDE was required to make
arrangements acceptable to the Bank for the services of suitably qualified
experts to organize a regulatory agency and to train the necessary person-
nel.  As a result, a study has been started by the U.N. Economic Committee
for Latin America (CEPAL), which recent4y issued a prelliriary report cover-
ing part of the terms of reference, namely background studies and the basis
for laws covering the electricity supply industry. The progress in this
respect is satisfactory, and no new conditions are proposed.
Tariffs - Central Region
5.o8      Empresa Electrica de Guatemala (EEG) is INDE's principal customer
in the Central System and they have recently signed an interim sales contract
which fixes the price to be paid by EEG until December 31, 1968. A long-
term contract will have to be negotiated before this date, and will become
effective January 1, 1969. The principle upon which INDE has been negotiating
with EEG is that a minimum rate of return of 10% will be earned by INDE on
the average net value of its fixed plant used in the generation and trans-
mission of power to EEG. This rate of return is calculated after charging
rates for normal depreciation based on historic costs of the fixed assets
in operation, actual costs of operation, maintenance and fuel and a reason-
able proportion of INDE's central office overhead. The estimated deprecia-
tion rates are based on different rates for diesel, gas turbine, hydro and
transmission facilities and give a composite rate of approximately 3%,
which is reasonable.
5.09      The interim sales contract with EEG provides for a maximum demand
charge of Q2.50 per kw of demand per month, plus an energy charge of
QO.0125 per kwh for the first 7 million kwh per month or for 80 kwh per kw
of demand, if the latter figure should be higher. QO.008 per kwh is to be
charged for the following 200 kwh per kw of demand and Q0.005 per kwh for
any excess. An adjustment clause allowing for increased cost of fuel is
included.
5.10      This tariff yields an average return of about QO.017 per kwh,
which is reasonable from the viewpoint of both INDE and BEG. It is suffici-
ent to enable INDE to achieve its required rate of return. It still permits
EEG to earn a reasonable rate of return on its investment, since EEG has
introduced a surcharge on retail sales, which surcharge comes into operation
if the average cost of purchased power exceeds QO.0135 per kwh, a figure
related to EEG's average generating cost. At present the rate of surcharge
is 5%.
5.11      Over the last few years EEG has been able to finance a large
proportion of its capital expansion program from its own internal cash
generation and has paid cash dividends of increasing amounts. In the six
years 1961 through 1966 EEG has earned the following rates of return on its
average net fixed plant in operation (less plant financed by customers'
contributions in aid of construction):

1962        21,809                 2,759                    12.7
1963        22,9h8                 2,996                    13.1
1964        24,230                 3,347                    13.8
1965        25,000                 3,386                    13.5
1966        26,142                 3,480                    13.3
5.12      EEGts debt/equity ratio in 1961 was 15/85 which was reduced
to a ratio of 12/88 by the end of 1966 (debt Q3.1 million, equity Q23.7
million). Its long-term debt consists mainly of about Q2.9 million, 6%
mortgage bonds due and payable April 1, 1971. This represents approximately
95% of its long-term debt outstanding. Other recent borrowings have been
medium-term loans from suppliers.
5.13      This satisfactory financial position of EEG has been strengthened
by the sale to the Government of the Michatoya System and it follows that it
should be able to finance future capital expenditures for distribution
facilities estimated at Q1.5 million to Q2 million annually, without recourse
to substantial borrowing.
Tariffs - Outlying Regions
5.1h      Steps were previously taken to eliminate the concessional tariffs
in the supply of electricity by INDE in the two outlying regions. An Agree-
ment on the Santa Maria System (Western Region) was concluded in 1966,
but that on the Rio Hondo (Eastern Region) was only recently agreed.
5.15      The original draft proposal on the Rio Hondo system was that there
would be an agreement for 50 years from September 1, 1965, under which INDE
would sell to the Municipality of Zacapa as from January 1, 1966, 600 kw
of power with a plant factor of 50% at the generating cost of QO.0138 per
kwh, the balance of the consumption being paid for in accordance with INDE's
ordinary tariff for such consumers. The M5unicipality would credit to INDE
the sum of Q161,000 representing the estimated cost of electricity from
July 26, 1963, to December 31, 1965. This amount would be settled by handing
over to INDE the rights, etc. of Rio Hondo I. The Government in turn
undertook as from March 1967 to reimburse INDE the difference between the
tariff charged to the Municipality of Zacapa and the tariff which should be
charged.
5.16      This agreement was never ratified by the Municipal Council and a
new agreement was proposed which was substantially the same except in that
the agreement is not for a limited period, and the Municipality did not have
to pay for any electricity until March 1, 1968, but as from that date would
pay the ordinary tariffs charged by INDE. As compensation for this the
Government, at no cost to INDE, paid to the Municipality of Zacapa the sum
of Q150,000. This new agreement is in certain respects more advantageous
to INDE, provided the Municipality settles its accounts promptly, which,
we are assured, will be the case.



- 14 -
5.17      To insure that reasonable rates of return would be realized during
the construction period, INDE and the Government, under the terms of Loan
487-GU, agreed that until December 31, 1970, INDE would realize a minimum
rate of return of 10% on the net assets in its central region. Also, begin-
ning 1971, tariffs would be maintained at levels to enable it to earn a
minimum of 9% on its average net fixed assets for its total system after
allowing for normal operating charges and straight line depreciation at a
minimum rate of 0-2%. The ultimate aim of this tariff agreement is to earn an
overall rate of return of 9% on all net fixed assets. From Annex 6 it will
be seen that this should be achieved from fiscal year 1968 onwards. On the
other hand, the forecast shows that the outlying regions would only contri-
bute Q938,000 in the years 1968 and 1969 to the total net operating income.
It is not until 1970, that the annual net operating income from these regions
exceeds Q600,000. During negotiations INDE and the Government have agreed
not to reduce tariffs in the outlying regions during the period of construc-
tion and to maintain tariffs at a level to enable INDE to realize -
(a) a 10% minimum rate of return on the average net assets
in its Central Region until December 31, 1969, and
(b) a 9% minimum rate of return on all its average net assets
thereafter.
Present Financial Position
5.18      The financial statements of INDE have been substantially rearranged
for the purposes of this report. The revised balance sheets for 1961-1967
are shown in Annex 5. The main adjustments include the calculation of
depreciation and also the capitalization of exploration and planning costs,
which had been largely charged against operating income. LDE has recently
reviewed the valuations of its assets and also its depreciation policies.
These have been incorporated in the balance sheet as of December 31, 1967,
shown in Annex 5.
5.19      On this basis INDE's position as of December 31, 1967, would have
been as follows:

Debt/Equity Ratio                             15/85
5.20      INDE's capitalization consists mainly of equity contributions
received from the Government upon which no interest is payable by INDE.
These contributions have been made in the form of fixed assets or cash
contributions for capital construction. Provision for part of the necessary
funds was arranged with the Bank of Guatemala at an annual interest rate of
3% by the Government who issued Q15 million of bonds to INDE after approving
INDE's expansion program.  INDE was then free to convert their bonds into
cash at the Bank of Guatemala as and when money was needed for the approved
program. As of June 30, 1967, Q14.3 million had been obtained in this way.
This method of financing will not be followed in future. It is proposed,
now that the Q15 million have been utilized, that future Government contri-
butions will have to be voted annually in the Government's budget. During
negotiations an assurance was received from the Government that any funds
necessary to complete the Project will be provided by it.
5.21      In June 1964 INDE incurred its first long-term debt, obtaining a
20-year loan from the Inter-American Development Bank in the sum of US$3-15
million. The purpose of this loan was to finance the foreign cost of the



16 -
Los Esclavos project. The loan carries an interest rate of 5-3/4% with a
commitment charge of 3/4% on the undrawn balance. After a three-year
period of grace semiannual amortization payments of US$90,000 began in
June 1967. As of December 1967 the balance outstanding was US$2.7 million
and a further US$250,000 was receivable.
Past Operating Results
5.22      Annex 4 shows past income statements as revised for the purpose of
this report (paragraph 5.18). Although INDE was officially created in
June 1959, its operations did not start until September 30, 1961, when the
Government transferred two existing small systems and other assets to its
ownership. INDE's Santa Maria system (previously a state-owned entity) has
operated at a profit in spite of the fact that government establishments
received a 50% discount and the municipality of Quezaltenango, which accounted
for 42% of the total energy sales, paid only a fraction of cost for its power
consumption. INDE's Rio Hondo system operated at a deficit during 1962-64
because many of the towns served had been receiving free energy. In 1965
gross revenue for the system was substantially increased because an amount
of Q161,000 was included as compensation to be credited for free energy
delivered to the municipality of Zacapa during the period from June 1963
through December 31, 1965. The retroactive compensation distorts INDE's
actual performance for that year.
5.23      In the past, operating revenues were not sufficient to cover
INDE's central office overhead, which includes the cost of planning,
programming and execution of the country's power expansion program, and
therefore the Government made yearly appropriations from the Treasury to
cover these central office expenses. No such annual appropriations have
been necessary since that made in 1965.
Proposed Financing Plan
5.24      A forecast of Sources and Applications of Funds 1968 through
1971 is shown in Annex 7. The projections are based on the forecast
income statements presented in Annex 6 and on the estimated capital ex-
penditure program for the same period consisting of:
(a) Completion of the Jurun-Marinala Project;
(b) The proposed Project;
(c) Atitlan, which will probably be the next expansion of
the Central System, and
(d) Expansion in the outlying regions.
The financing for the period can be summarized as follows:

5.25      Under an agreement signed in making Loan 487-GU, INDE undertook,
except with prior agreement of the Bank, to restrict normal development
expenditure outside that Project to not more than Q500,000 in any twelve
months. INDE has developed a program for considerable expansion of the
outlying systems. This will be submitted to the Bank later together with the
overall financing plan. It has been agreed during negotiations that during
1968 the sum of $98h,000 may be expended for such development, and, except
as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the amount will remain at Q500,000
during 1969 through 1971, and this is reflected in Annex 7.
5.26      The financing proposed is as follows:
(a) IBRD Loan 487-GU for $15 million at an interest rate of 6%
per annum for a term of 25 years, including a grace period
of four years.
(b) The proposed loan of IZ$7 rmillion would be obtained in 1968.
For the purposes of financial forecasts an interest rate of
6k% and a term of 23 years, including a grace period of
about three years, has been assumed.

(c) A future foreign loan at an interest rate of 06% to cover
the foreign exchange costs of the Atitlan Project.
(d) Government contributions from the National Budget to make
up any deficit in the annual requirement.
5.27      Internal cash generation, after meeting debt service would finance
about 20% of total capital requirements. This is acceptable in view of the
short period during which INDE has been operating, thus precluding the
possibility of building up large cash surpluses, and in view of the large
development program. The remaining 80% would be financed,68% from borrowings
and 12% from Government contributions. During negotiations assurances were
obtained that no repayment of Government contributions will be required and
that no interest or dividend payments on these amounts will be made without
prior approval of the Bank.
Estimated Future Operating Results
5.28      Forecast income statements of INDE for the years 1968 through
1971 are shown in Annex 6. They reflect future earnings as follows:
(a) Central System: Based on the existing contract with EEG
through 1968. For the years thereafter a new contract should
be negotiated to allow a return of at least 10% in 1969 on
the average net assets employed in the Central System and a
minimum of 9% for 1970 onwards on the total average net assets
employed by INDE.
(b) Outlying systems: Based on the new tariffs introduced in 1967.
5.29      Based on these assumptions the net income from INDE's total opera-
tions would provide interest coverage of between 1.6 and 3.0 times during
1968 through 1971. Internal cash generation would cover total debt service
between 2.1 and 3.2 times during the same period.
Estimated Future Financial Position
5.30      Forecast balance sheets for the years 1967 through 1971 are shown
in Annex 8. It is estimated that INDE's total fixed assets would increase
from Q20.1 million in 1967 to Q71.3 million in 1971. Work in progress
(mainly Atitlan) would be Q28.7 million at the end of the forecast period.
5.31      INDE's debt/equity ratio would change from 15/85 in 1967 to 50/50
by the end of 1971, based on the assumptions in paragraph 5.26. During
negotiations it was agreed that INDE will continue with a debt covenant
similar to that under Loan 487-GU which stipulates a l.4 times coverage of
maximum future debt service.

6. COTICLTUSIONS AND RECOtENDATIONS
6.01      The proposed Project is required to help INDE meet its commitments
to serve a growing power demand in the Central Region and is justified.
6.02      The estimated cost of the Project is reasonable, the construction
schedule is realistic and the arrangements for engineering and supervision
of construction are satisfactory. The Project is considered to be tech-
nically and economically sound.
6.03      The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$7 million equivalent
for a term of 23 years including a grace period of about three years. During
negotiations INDE agreed that:
(i) Consultants and their terms of reference for services for
the Atitlan Project will be subject to Bank approval (para-
graphs h.08 and 4.09);
(ii) It will continue to employ consultants acceptable to the Bank
for engineering and supervision of construction of the steam
plant (paragraph 4.14);
(iii) It will continue to employ auditors acceptable to the Bank
(paragraph 5.04);
(iv) Until the end of 1969 tariffs will be so adjusted as to
achieve a minimum rate of return of 10% on its net fixed
assets in the Central System and there will be no reduction
of tariffs in the outlying regions. A return of at least
9% on its entire average net fixed assets in operation should
be achieved thereafter (paragraph 5.17);
(v) It will not borrow, without the previous permission of the
Bank, unless it can achieve a debt service coverage of at
least 1.4 times its future maximum debt service requirements
on existing and proposed debt (paragraph 5.31);
and during negotiations assurances were also received from the Government
that:
(i) It will provide all necessary funds to enable INDE to cow'plete
the Project (paragraph 5.20);
(ii) No repayment of its contributions to INDE will be required
and that no payments as dividends or interest on these contri-
butions will be made without prior approval of the Bank
(paragraph. 5.27).

2. General Description - Steam Plant
This generating unit, to be designated Guacalate No. 3, will be
located at INDE's Guacalate generating plant site near the town of Escuintla.
The boiler will be designed to burn No. 6 fuel oil (Bunker C, or residual)
which probably will be obtained from the nearby Texaco refinery. A fuel
pipe line to a railroad spur near the refinery is included as an optional
item in the bid documents for the steam unit. Provisions would be made for
receiving fuel by rail, tank truck, or direct from the refinery by pipeline.
The steam station would be of the semi-outdoor type whereby the boiler is
constructed in the open and the turbine-generator and auxiliaries are housed
in a steel-frame building. Predicted net plant heat rate is 3100 kg-cal/kwh
(12,300 Btu/kwh).

Site Conditions:
The plant location is in the midst of farmlands on the Guatemalan
Pacific coastal lowlands at an elevation of about 250m (840 ft). The climate
is generally warm and humid throughout the year, with about 2.6n (102 in) of
rainfall, mostly in the May-October wet season. The site is generally flat
with a 2%-3% slope to the south. INDE's 12.5-Nw gas-turbine unit Guacalate
No. 1 occupies the northern part of the site, along with a group of houses
for plant personnel. A new highway is projected through this area just north
of the houses and it is planned to move the No. 1 unit to a new location near
the proposed power plant. The relocation work is not a part of the Project.
The development plan for the area provides space for a future 220-kv switch-
yard in addition to the 138- and 69-kv structures now being constructed, and
room for a second 33-Mw steam unit. Additional space is available for fur-
ther expansion if required. INDE's secordx gas-turbine unit, Guacalate No. 2,
will be installed in the new area. At the end of September, 1967 the perman-
ent access road was under construction and the general area had been cleared
and graded. Water wells were being developed and additional borings made for
soils data. Foundation conditions included in the bid documents were based
on a set of borings taken about 500m from the site. These indicated that
adequate soil bearing for the main foundation block could be developed at a
depth of about 2.5m, such that piling should not be required. The soils in
the area are generally homogeneous so this assumption seems valid. The site
is located in the Guatemalan earthquake zone although the danger in this
region is less than in the highlands nearer Guatemala City. A seismic load-
ing factor of 100 cm/sec/sec (O.lg) has been specified in the bid documents.
This seems a reasonable value.
Connections to the System:
The project includes only the main step-up transformer and 138-kv
connections to the 138-kv switch structure. This switch structure, the
main 138-kv circuit breaker and the 138-kv transmission line to Jurun and
thence to Guatemala Sur are included with the transmission line and substation
work as part of the Jurun-Marinala project. The 69-kv switch structure is
being furnished with the Guacalate No. 2 gas-turbine unit, although the 69-kv
circuit-breaker for the auxiliary transformer is included with the 33-Dw
steam unit project.

3. The Atitlan Project
Lake Atitlan (not to be confused with Lake Amatitlan, nearer
Guatemala City) is located about 80 km from Guatemala City and has a sur-
face area of 128 km (304,000 acres). The lake is on the edge of the high-
land plateau so it is possible to develop a head of nearly 1,000 meters
within a horizontal distance of only 8 kilometers. About 1,100 Gwh per
year are available if the project is fully developed. Installed capacity
would be about 400 Nw.  More than half of the energy would be developed
by diverting water from nearby rivers into the lake. The rivers usually
considered for diversion are the Madre Vieja, Nahualate, Samala, and
Yatza. The lake has no visible outlet; natural inflows are lost mainly
through leakage which reappears as springs below the lake. A method of
sealing these filtrations has been proposed which, if successful, would
increase the available energy.
The project would include one or two main power plants and an
auxiliary plant on the Samala diversion. Although the scheme has been
the subject of numerous studies in the past, due to lack of complete infor-
mation none of these have been comprehensive. The studies financed as
part of the proposed project will fill the remaining gaps in the informa-
tion. Field work will include additional geologic investigations, hydraulic
model tests, and testing of the proposed leak-sealing procedures. Engin-
eering work would comprise network studies, evaluation of the field investi-
gations, a financial and economic study of the system including possible
interconnection with El Salvador, and delineation of the selected scheme
with preparation of designs and bid documents for the first-stage develop-
ment. It is probable that more than one consulting firm would be employed
in this work.
