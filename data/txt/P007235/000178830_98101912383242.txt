GUYANA
UPPER DEMERARA FORESTRY PROJECT
I.  THE FORESTRY SECTOR
A. Forestry in the Economy
1.01      Despite the fact that 83% of Gtuyana's territory is covered with
forests, the forest sector contributes less than 1% of GDP. Although export
earnings from forestry have increased, due entirely to timber price rises, at
about 11% per annum over the past decade in currert prices, the volume of sawn.
timber exported from Guyana declined at an average rate of 7% per annum from
1967 to 1976, due mainly to disappearing forest resources in the existing
concessions, while other developing countries increased their exports of
non-coniferous sawn wood at the same rate.
1.02      Guyana's trade balance in forest products remained negative through
1974 and 1975, averaging a net deficit of G$ 14.3 million (US$5.6 million) per
annum, mainly because of paper imports.  Employment in the forestry sector
stagnated at around 14,000 through the 1970s, representing 7% of the total
work force.
1.03      Wood is the principal building material for domestic residential
construction, but since mid-1976, production of sawn wood for that market has
dropped because of financial constraints in the private and public housing
sector and Government controlled prices. Also, Government's hope that the
forest industry would diversify production of wood products and utilize new
species has not been realized.
B. Forest Resources
1.04      The total forest area in Guyana is estimated at about 18.2 milLion ba
(45 million acres), roughly 50% of which comprises exploitable forests with an
average of 25 to 35 m3/ha of commercial timber0  At present, however, 0ut of
some 3 million ha of commercial forest, only about 850,000 ha have been surveye 
and assigned for utilization, and only 20% of these are being exploited. The
country has a considerable resource of fine timbers, one of which, greenheart
(Ocotea rodiaei), is in great demand as a marine construction wood.  Guyana nosw
exports 16 species (about 80% greenheart) and uses more than 30 additional species
locally (Annex 4, Table 1). The wood industry's prime supply area over the
past three years has been the Bartica Triangle, between the Essequibo and
Mazaruni rivers, but the main areas of expansion in the immediate future will
be in the central part of Guyana, in the Essequibo and Demerara River basi-ns0
Other potential areas are between the Mazaruni and Cuyuni rivers and in the
Kartabu Triangle (Map IBRD 13453).

C. Forestry Development Policy
Forest Tenure
1.05      Utilization of state-owned forest land :in G5uyana was formerly based.
on forest concessions which conferred exclusive r-ights for exploitatio!o of a
defined area. This arrangement was replaced in 1977 by one of Tirnber Sales
Agreements, which confer rights to individual firrs to cut a spe'zified group
of species within an area, according to a logging and utilization plan agreed
between each firm and the Forest Department. In case the recipient of a
Timber Sales Agreement does not log the total obligatory species and volume,
other companies can be given cutting rights in the same area. The primary
objective is to extract and utilize the highest possible proportion of secondary
species in each concession area by gradually increasing the share of such
species in the cutting list. At present, all firmis are operating under
one-year Special Permits (para 2.03) until all aspects of the newT Timber Sales
Agreements are cleared by the Government,
Domestic Price Controls
1.06      Price control was instituted in the domestic sawn1 wood market in
mid-1976 in an effort to halt the rapid price increases that were taking place.
At the same time, differentials were introduced for seasoned and treated wood
to stimulate production of such products. However, the fixed prices set were
unrealistically low and have probably resulted in reduced production for the
domestic market.
Public Investment
1.07      Between 1978 and 1981 the Government plans investments in the
forestry sector of approximately G$ 100 million (US$39 mil:Lion), of which
G$ 80 million (US$31 million) is for public enterprises and institutions.
Public sector projects, in addition to the Upper Demerara Forestry Project,
include the expansion of sawmilling and logging facilities at the State-owned
Guyana Timbers Ltd. (GTL), the production of prefabricated wooden houses and
assistance in administration, training and research. Private sector enter-
prises will receive finance through the Guyana Agricultural Cooperative
Development Bank (AGRIBANK) for the replacement of obsolete sawmilling and
logging equipment and for new small-scale cooperative sawmills in the interior
of the country.
Public Administration
1.08      During the current planning period (1978-81), the understaffed,
under-funded Guyana Forest Department (GFD) of the Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources (MENR) is to be replaced by a Forest Commmission which
would enjoy greater power and authority than the present agency. Plans are
to place the new public forest authority in a position to provide the infra-
structure necessary for forest development.



- 3 -
1.09      The broad Government goals on forest development are to:
(a) gradually replace private enterprise with state-owned corporations or
companies; (b) become involved in the prov:Lsion of infrastructure; and
(c) direct the demand and supply in the domestic market as it now does for
exports.
D. Forest Industries
1.10      Forest industries have historically produced logs which have been
sold in the round, hand hewn into poles (round) or piles (square or round),
sawn into lumber, or converted to shingles. Lumber has been further processed
by moulding and planing and, to a limited extent, prepared for use in the
construction of prefabricated housing units.
Sawmilling
1.11      Between 1970 and 1976, the number of sawmills increased from 65 to
75, with a total installed capacity estimated at 130,000 m3. However, the
lack of any significant additional output indicates that the increase in the
number of mills has been offset by diminishing efficiency and low utilization
of capacity. The situation should, however, improve since, by the end of 1978,
another private company will start production in a new sawmill that has an
output of 33,000 m3 and GTL iill be rehabilitated, with its capacity being
brought up to about 17,000 m .
1.12      Government estimates that the average annual output of lumber between
1966 and 1976 was 69,500 m3, reaching 78,100 m3 in 1969, but falling back to
57,800 in in 1976. During the last six years, the five largest sawmills 1/
produced3 75% of the annual cut, the majority of mills having an output of less
than 6 in per day.
1.13      The Guyanese sawmilling industry is low yielding by international
standards, due partly to considerable variation in raw material, partly to
worn and obsolete machinery, and partly to inadequate production methods.
Seasoning and Preservation
1.14      In 1956, Government established the Central Timber Manufacturing
Plant (CTMP), largely to promote the utilization of lesser known species, and
this organization has had some success in creating outlets for air-dried,
machined lumber. It has also engaged in timber preservation by diffusion and
pressure treatment. However, the availability of greenheart on the local
market has inhibited demand for species for which special treatment is required.
There is presently only one drying kiln in Guyana, owned by GTL.

fire); Toolsie Persaud, Willems, Mazaralli, and Sawh.

Prefabricated Housing
1.15      GTL was actively engaged in the production of prefabricated wooden
houses and had planned to produce 500 units, consuming over 5600 m3 in 1976,
the year that a fire interrupted the company's operations. Other mills, howesver,
have not attempted to meet this market.
Other Conversion
1.16      Other conversion of timber is limited to the small-scale production
of furniture for local use. A particle board mill operated between 1959 and
1963, but went out of business because it could not compete satisfactorily
with imported boards. Other forest products for which 1973 production figures
are available from the Forest Department include: balata, 225,000 kg; mangrove
bark, 225,000 kg; fuel wood, 10,054 m3; and wood for charcoal, 2,600 m3.
E. Development Assistance
1.17      Despite efforts of the Government to attract foreign aid for the
forestry sector, bilateral and multilateral assistance in the form of loans,
equipment, and know-how was obtained only from Canada and UNDP/FAO, apart from
some minor technical assistance from New Zealand (para 1.21).
Financial Assistance
1.18      In 1977, The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) approved
a loan of G$ 17.2 million to replace obsolete logging and sawmilling equipment
and to expand the capacity of private and publicly owned sawmills. The loan
which is being channeled through AGRIBANK is interest-free and repayable over
40 years, with 10 years grace. The AGRIBANK on-lends the loan proceeds to
mills at about 7% interest and will create a revolving fund with repayments
from the subloans. The subloans, however, are tied to purchase of Canadian
equipment for logging and sawmills and are intended to be disbursed by 1979.
1.19      In addition, CIDA has agreed to assist in the reconstruction and
expansion of the GTL mill, which was burned down in 1976, and it has arranged
a commercial loan of about G$ 3 million, guaranteed by the Canadian Government,
for equipment and technical assistance for management.
Technical Assistance
1.20      The major technical assistance project benefitting forestry under
way in Guyana is the FAO/UNDP project GUY/75/004, the first phase of which
will be completed by 1979, although a second phase is planned. Under this
project, FAO provides practical training to logging and sawmilling staff.
Total cost of the project is G$ 2.87 million, of which the Government would
contribute about G$ 1.55 million. The intention is to concentrate this



5 -
traininig on personnel required for the proposed sawmilling complex in order
to ease the existing manpower constraints. In addition, CIDA plans to finance
a project of G$ 3.3 million (US$1.3 million), which would provide about 30
man-years of training and 16 man-years of overseas management assistance, plus
some equipment for the GFD or its successor (para 1.08).
1.21      A third technical assistance project for wood preservation is being
financoad by the Government of New Zealand.  Guyanese woods are being tested
in New Zealand and an expert is expected to visit Guyana to help the GED
develop practical methods and schedules for various preservative treatments of
the sapwood of different species.
II. BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
2.01      The Government of Guyana would be the borrower of the proposed Bank
loan for the Upper Demerara Forestry Project.
A. Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR)
2.02      The MENR defines the Government's natural resource policies and
superv:lses its implementation. The Ministry comprises two technical depart-
ments --- the Department of Geological Surveys, headed by a Commissioner of
Surveys and Mines, with Divisions for Mines and for Hydropower, and the Forest
Department, headed by a Conservator of Forests, with Divisions for Forest
Utilization, Silviculture, Forest Resources Inventory and Management, Forest
Economics and Forest Engineering.
B. Guyana Forest Department (GFD
2.03      GFD controls timber extraction in state forests by issuing Timber
Sales Agreements and Special Permits.  It collects royalties and is respon-
sible :Eor research, forest extension, and forest management and regeneration.
It has also been increasingly involved in construction of forest roads, since,
under the current short-term exclusive rights granted for a concession area
through the new Timber Sales Agreement, private industry is reluctant to
undertake investment in road construction itself. The GED has only 10 approved
professional positions and of these only six have been occupied in recent years.
2.04      The GFD's budget for 1977 for current expenditures was G$ 700,000,
an amount which has remained relatively constant since the mid-1960s. However,
over the same period, capital investments have increased to G$ 507,000 per
annum from a considerably lower level.



- 6 -
2.05      In recent years, a small number of professionals from the GFD have
been :rained at the University of New Brunswick in Canada under fellowships
p.^ d     l I .D7A, but the majority of professionals trained overseas have
IC. -"e<. ':.  toI Guyana. Most of the few remaining forest technicians in the
cc unty Were trained in Puerto Rico under the USAID program which terminated
in 1970. The GFD provides a one-month elementary course in Guyana for forest
guards.
2.06      The lack of adequate personnel at all levels is being acutely felt,
since there is an increasing demand for trained staff in the expanding public
and private forest industry and in the Government's forest administration.
Efforts are underway to relieve this constraint under two technical assistance
programs (para 1.20), but it will take time to train sufficient staff to fill
the need.
C. Guyana Timber Export Board (GTEB)
2.07      The GTEB was created in 1971 to give Government control over all
timber exports and to assist the many small mills in exporting timber.  In
general, it is responsible for export marketing of all forest products and for
collecting export taxes. For these services, it charges a commission of 5%
and an additional 1% for bank processing. It also provides, for an additional
fee, services such as bundling and loading, and, for export to the Caribbean
area, also freight and insurance. The GTEB has permanent marketing arrange-
ments with 41 agents in 18 countries including such large mnarkets as the USA,
United Kingdom, Federal Republic Germany and Japan, and it also has a strong
position in the CARICOM countries. At present it is in the process of estab-
lishing a marketing contract with a well established European timber marketing
firm 1/, which, in addition to handling the marketing of Guyanese timbers, will
provide training for GTEB staff and an office for the agency at its Switzerland
headquarters.
2.08      The Board of Directors of the GTEB comprises 19 raembers, among whom
are representatives from the Ministries of Economic Development, Energy and
Natural Resources, including the Forest Department, and Trade and Cooperatives,
as well as of the workers' union and private timber industry. The agency has
only eight professionals on its managerial staff, and, whi:Le it is able to
handle the current volume of timber exports, it would requ:Lre technical
assistance and larger staff if much greater quantities of :Lumber are to be
handled. At present, GTEB's major constraint in establish:Lng permanent
markets abroad is its inability to obtain from the existing industry the
timely delivery of the required quantities and qualities of timber.

III. THE PROJECT, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Background
3.01      The Upper Demerara Forestry Project, formerly th£ Great Falls
Forestry Project, originated in mid-197i whien the Government of Guyana, follow-
ing a forest inventory carried out earlier that year by FAOiUNDP, asked the
Bank to examine the feasibility of a forestry project. An FAO/CP iden1-
tificat:ion mission visited the country in late 1971 and proposed a logging and
sawmilling operation with an intake of about 85,000 m3, which, at the request
of the Government, was to include a substantial proportion of species with
unknown marketability. By the end of 1972, the Bank had reviewed the FAO/CP
proposal, and a marketing study had been carried out with CIDA financing. At
the same time, Government initiated construction of the 130-km access road to
the conLcession area. In 1973, the Government of Guyana contacted a well
established Canadian forest products company I1 to ascertain its interest in a
joint venture to implement and operate a forestry compLex in the Great Falls
area, and an engineering and marketing stuady and feasibility report were
commissioned in consultation with Government,  The feasibility report,
finalized in November 1974, proposed a joint-venture operation in which the
Canadian company would contribute 49% to the equity capital and ensure the
managenent as well as the marketing of all species, including lesser known
species less easily marketed. This was an ambitious project in that the
proposed mill was to be the largest in Latin America, an operation with an
output of about 84,000 m3. The negotiations, however, remained inconclusive.
3.02      An alternative approach to the project was thereafter developed in
late 1976 on the basis that the output wouild be reduced to a volume of 41,100 m3
and that operations would be concentrated during the early years of the
project on production of well known species, with lesser known species to be
gradually introduced in response to market demand. The engineering, marketing
and feasibility studies carried out for the larger joint-venture proposal
served as a basis for the October/November 1977 appraisal mission. Preliminary
and firLal engineering design of the revised project proposal, funded by EDF,
was entrusted to a consulting firm in Decemnber 1977 and completed in May 1978
(para 3.16).
B. The Project Area
3.03      The concession area in which the project forests are located is
situated in the Upper Demerara-Essequibo Basin and comprises some 222,000 ha
(548,000 acres). It is bound on the north by an east-west line from Great
1/   McMillan Bloedel Ltd.



Falls on the Demerara River to the Essequibo River; on the east by the Demerara
and Mauri Rivers; on the south by the Kurupukar4 cattle trall: and on the  ,sE
by the Essequibo River.  The area is abDove the na7_aL  raplds in hLe Deeraz,
Essequibo Rivers (Map IBRD 13453).
3.04      The area lies within the humid tropics.  The average annual rainfall
at Great Falls, the north of the forest area, is 2,000 mm and at Kurupukari,
south of the area, 2,500 mm. At both stations, the highest rainfall occu-r
from May to August when the average monthly precipitation is 280 mm at
Great Falls and 300 mm at Kurukupari. The driest month is' October, with
80 mm at Great Falls and 90 mm at Kurukupari.
3.05      The topography is predominantly gently undulating and a great par=:
of the area lies between 50 and 100 m above sea level.  T'here are two
mountain ranges, one in the south central part of the project area and anotheir
along the west bank of the Demerara River, south of Great Falls, formed from
deeply weathered basic rocks (dolerite and amphibolite) and rising about 300 m
above sea level. The soils in the undulating area are mostly brown sands,
yellowish sandy loans, or sandy clay loansm  although white sands are scattered
over the entire area. In the more rugged areas, the soils are reddish brown
and lateritic, with dark brown gravelly or stony clay subsoils. There are at
present no road connections with population centers or with any port. Ini-
tiation of construction of an access road linking the project area with the
existing Wismar-Rockstone road was, therefore, a condition for negotiations.
3.06      The forests in the project area are the richest in Guyana, have
never been exploited and contain the largest stand of greenheart in the worldi.
In addition, they are well stocked with other valuable species that have
been exported by Guyana for the last 15 years or so (Annex 4, Table 1). These
forests were inventoried by an FAO/UNDP and Forestry Department team between
1969 and 1970, and four main forest types, covering 69% of the concession
area, were estimated to be economically exploitable.  The total extractable
gross volume of some 50 3identified species in these 3four areas is estimated
at about 22.4 million m , equivalent to about 147 m /ha. Twelve selected
species account for over 95% of the proposed project outpult, with Greenheart:
representing about 45% of the planned annual production. The extractable
volume (reduced for rot, heavy buttressing and fluting) of' these selected
species average 28.2 m3/ha and their standing extractable volume exceeds
4.3 million mJ.  There is enough wood available to s-dppr 'l the proposed mi1'
for over 46 years, without using any of the 30 remaining species, some of
which are likely to become marketable in the future as a result of efforts to
be made under the proposed project.

C. Brief Description
3.07      The project would aim at increasing exports of easily marketable
wood products and at gradually introducing lesser known species on the inter-
national markets. It would also improve the present supply of lumber for
domesti.c construction, particularly housing. For these purposes, the project
would utilize the timbers in an area of approximately 152,000 ha (para 3.06),
located between the Demerara and Essequibo Rivers, to produce sawn lumber,
piles and psles. It would comprise the following components: (a) logging
of 93,500 m of roundwood per year; (b) a sawmill, includin§ repair shops and
transport fleet, with an annual output capacity of 41,100 m of lumber;
(c) power facilities, with an installed capacity of 6,000 kw based on waste
wood ftel; (d) a township for about 1,500 people, including 500 employees
and their families, (e) port facilities and 13 km of access road; and
(f) a research program for developing an appropriate forest management
system for the type of forest occurring in the project area. Also, the project
would provide consultancy services for engineering, construction, supervision,
and mill management. About 80% of the mill output would be exported while
some 20% would be absorbed by the domestic market. The mill's output would
initially consist of 95% of primary or better known species and 5% of lesser
known species, but the proportion of the latter would increase in step with
the prcgress of efforts by the Government's timber export agency to market
them.
3.08      The project would be implemented and operated by an independent   *
Government-owned company, the Demerara Woods Company Ltd., established for
that purpose.  The development period would be four years.
D. Detailed Features
Logging and Transport
3.09      The project would provide for the commercial exploitation of a total
of 152,000 ha of hardwood timbers; the annual extraction program would ini-
tially cover about 3,300 ha and produce some 93,500 m of round logs per year.
Logging activities would include mapping and inventory of timber resources
(para 6.02), construction of logging roads (para 6.03), felling (para 6.04),
and log transport to the mill (para 6.05). The project would provide logging
equipment (chainsaws, bulldozers, skidders, hydraulic boom loader, and logging
trucks); road construction equipment (bulldozers, bucket loader, dump trucks,
road grades, chainsaws); and support equipment (fuel truck, crew buses, pick-up
trucks, mobile repair truck, low-bed traileir, and two-way radios); and trucks
for transport of wood products from the sawmill to the port.

Sawmili
3' -ject would provide for construction of bulldings (mill
buil--ngs, sawshop and office), log preparation equipment (front-end loaders,
debarker, crane and chainsaws), sawmill machinery (bandmills, gangsaws, edgers
and conveyors), and lumber storage facilities (sheds, forklift trucks and
straddle carrier).
Powerhouse
3.11      The project would construct a 6,000-kw power plant based on waste
fuel to supply the 2,900 kw required to operate the sawmill and provide
electricity for the sawmilling complex and associated township (para 6.12).
A power distribution system would also be provided. The power generation
requires about 24,000 tons per year of bone-dry waste wood which would be
produced in the sawmilling process.
Township
3.12      To provide housing for the sawmilling complex staff, including
national and expatriate management personnel, clerical staff and workers,
a township for some 1,500 people would be built close to the sawmill. This
township would include basic social services such as clinic, school, clubhouse,
shop, security office, sports ground, water reservoir and supply system,
helicopter pad and an internal network of streets and footpaths. Housing
facilities would include 20 management staff houses, 48 houses for clerical
and supervisory staff, 120 houses for workers and bachelors' quarters housing
260 individuals (Annex 4, Table 2). Local timber would be the main construc-
tion material used for building components.
Port Facilities
3.13      The project would provide port facilities for river transport of
sawmill products from a shipping site near Charters to the port of Georgetown
where they would be distributed for the local and export markets. These
facilities would include a 13-km access road to the port area on the western
bank of the Demerara River, a 110-m wharf with dolphins and loading equipment
(mobile cranes, sideloaders, and the like) and a hard macadam-surfaced yard
with open-sided sheds for 2,000 tons of sawn lumber and open storage area for
2,000 m3 of balks. In addition, the project would construct the necessary
buildings (gate house, office, pump generator rooms and shed for parking and
servicing mobile equipment) and housing for 26 employees.
Forest Management Research and Development Program
3.i4      The project would include a modest research and development program
which would tackle the major issues facing the GFD concerning appropriate
future long-term development strategy for management of forest resources, not
only in the project area but throughout the country. This program would



- 11 -
investigate forest development options sucn as continued management of selected
forest areas on a sustained yield basis, utilizing existing forest spec4es,
or deve:Lopment of more concentrated plantation resources of selected fast
growing indigenous hardwoods or exotic species. The development planning
aspects of the program would., on the basis of the ongoing prograas financed by
UNDP and1 CIDA, review the future forestry development potential for Guyana as
a whole and examine the institutional capability of the GFD to effectively
manage the forest and implement new projects.  fn addition, a study would be
carried out to determine the actual number and conditions of -he scarce
indigenous human population in the project area.
3.15      This research and development program component, to be carried out
through the GFD, would include 12 man-months of expert assistance, four man-
months of which would relate to the services of an overseas silviculturist,
preferably with experience in Surinam because of its similar ecological
conditions and the advanced studies already carried out in that country.
Four man-months would be allocated to a development planning economist with
experience in preparation of forestry projects and four man-months would
be reserved for specialized consultants to deal with special problems such
as environmental or pulp and paper development, as needed. The project would
also provide one pick-up truck, one four-wheel drive vehicle and equipment
for botanical and silvicultural research. The Government's contribution
to the program would be one professional silviculturist, one sociologist,
four technicians, 10 laborers, and office and field accommodations.
Consultants
3.16      The project would provide consultants' services for preliminary and
final engineering design, supervision of construction, and management of the
sawmill complex during the first three years of operation. The management
assistance would include the services of mtnaging director, chief account-
ant, forest manager, mill manager, mill superintendent, saw doctor, chief
engineer, and mechanical and electrical engineers (para 4.03).
E. Project Cost
3.17      Total project cost is estimated at US$30.5 million (G$ 77.8
million). The foreign exchange component Ls estimated at US$22.7 million,
or 74X of total cost.  The estimated costs shown in Annex 4, Table 3 are
summarized below:

Costs have been estimated at prices prevailing in March/April 1978, supported
by the preliminary design completed by consultants in May 1978. The project
would be exempt from customs duties and soime other taxes. A physical contin-
gency of 5% has been included for logging and power plant equipment, management
contract and forest management researchn, as well as 10% for se-wmill and port
facilities equipment, buildings and housing, workshop, furnishing, fittings
and working capital, and 25% for road transport equipment, which, in total,
amount to an aggregate physical contingency of 11% over baseline costs.
Due to the specific nature of a large part of the equipment and machinery
required, price contingencies are based on actual projections for such
items and on the assumption that price increases would be 8% in 1978, 7.5%
in 1979 and 7% thereafter for civil works and 7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and
6% thereafter for equipment and other investments. These combined price
contingencies result in an overall price escalation to 14% of baseline costs.
F. Financing
3a18      The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the European Development
Fund (EDF) and the Bank would join the Government of Guyana in financing the
project costs, which would be shared as follows:

The proposed Bank loan of US$10 million would be for a period of 20 years,
includi.ng a five-year grace period. The Government of Guyana would be the
borrower and the DWL would assume the foreign exchange risk. This loan would
finance 33% of total project costs, 44% of all foreign exchange costs (US$22.7
millioi), IDB's parallel financing participation in the project would amount
to 16% of project costs, and EDF's parallel financing to 23% of project costs,
the latter including US$1.0 million in the form of a grant to the Government
and USS600 million in the form of a soft-term loan. The IDB loan would be



- 14 -
of 40 years, inciuding 10 years of grace, with repayment in
60 semidannal instalments and with an interest of 1% for the first 10 years
E  ^7' ;. ter The EDF loan would carry an interest rate of 1% for a
]0L J    s    ears, repayments being made in 30 annual installments.
Co,,,nment'S  contribution would total US$8.5 million equivaLlent, or 28% of
total project cost, of which US$4 million would be from a loan from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance, in part, Government's equity
investment in DWL (para 4.05).
G. Procurement
3.19      Procurement of imported logging equipment, township materials,
ship loading equipment and all vehicles (US$5.2 million, excluding contin-
gencies) and civil works (US$8.1 million, excluding contingencies) in orders
or contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be by international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Orders or contracts of less
than US$100,000 and not exceeding an aggregate value of US$1.0 million would
be obtained under Government local procurement procedures which are satis-
factory. In view of the unlikelihood of interest among international
bidders to bid for some of the civil works contracts in this remote project
area, the Bank would consider that such works would be carried out through
force account or, whenever appropriate, through local competitive bidding.
Procurement of all consulting services was carried out in the process of
financing by EDF of the preliminary and final design in order to ensure
continuity through the supervision of construction and management stages,
and the selected consultants were acceptable to the Bank (para 4.03).
Assurances that procurement would be in accordance with the above procedures
were obtained during negotiations.
H. Disbursement
3.20      The Bank loan would be disbursed against 100% of itotal foreign
exchange expenditures for vehicles and equipment, including logging, support
and workshop equipment, and biological equipment for the forest management
research program (US$2.1 million); consultants' services for supervision
of construction, management, and forest management research (US$2.4 million);
and 35% of total expenditures for civil works, including bu:ildings, housing,
wharf and yard, road construction, and infrastructure (US$3.2 million).
Interest and other charges on the Bank loan up to US$1.5 million would be
disbursed as they became due. A sum of US$800,000 would remain unallocated.
All disbursements from the proposed Bank Loan Account would be supported by
standard documentation; except for expenditures incurred for civil works
carried out by force account, for which the Bank would be prepared to accept
statements of expenditures. It is understood that DWL woulcl be required
to preserve all supporting documents in respect of those civil works and
to hold them ready for review by the Bank, whenever requirect.



- 15 
3.21      The schedule of disbursements to be completed over four years is
estimated as follows:

I.  Accounts, Auditing and Reporting
3.22      The proposed new company (para 4.01) would set up and maintain
records and accounts adequate to fully and faithfully reflect operations,
investments, expenditures, and the source of financing. Project accounts
would be prepared by the Chief Accountant of the company (para 4.03) and
audited annually by independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank. These
audited accounts, together with the auditors' report, would be forwarded to
the Bank within four months of the end of each fiscal year. Project manage-
ment would also present to Government and the Bank a draft completion report
not later than six months after the proposed investments have been completed.
Assurances on the above were obtained at negotiations.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management
4.01      The project would be implemented and operated by an independent
Government-owned company, the Demerara Woods Ltd. (DWL), which was created for
that pu-pose.  The company was established under a Nemorand-a  of eiSsocia ion
as a comapany limited by shares under Chapter 89.01 of the Guyana Companies Act
and reguilated by Articles of Association under the same Act. The DWL would be
governed by a Board of Directors of no less than three and no More than seven
members, chaired by a representative of the MENR, with other members including
represenitatives from the Ministries of Finance (MF) and Economic Development
(MED.), the GTEB, and the Managing Director of the sawmilling complex. The
company would be empowered to carry out all necessary operations related
to the 'Logging, processing, transporting and marketing of forest resources
within the project area. Establishment of the DWL was a condition for nego-
tiation of the proposed loan.

lished within the MENR with the main function o' coordinating the activitie r
of the project involving MENR and other agencies of the Government.  This
Project Unit is headed  by the Permanent Secretary of the MENR and includes a
representative each of the Ministry oL Works and the Ministry of Economn-c
Development.  The Project Officer and the Secretary of DWL wouLd work in
coordi nation with the Project Unit.  After filiaticn o- rhe e anag ernena  rcc-

obtained during negotiations that DWL, in consultation w-ith the Bank, vou.ro
appoint, before December 31, 1978, a project director, a project officer, an.
accountant and a secretary and that the project          vout wou!l be maintained fc-.
period of one year after the completion of the sawmill corrp£lex.
Sawmill Management
4.03      During the first three years of operation, and possibly for a Icr
period, the logging and sawmilling complex would be maraged by the consultart
firm of Agrar-und-Hydrotechnik GMBH of the Federal Republic of Germany,
supported by Hinrich Feldmeyer company, a wood processing and marketing f_rrm
also from the Federal Republic of Germany. This itJould ensure that adequate
managerial capability would be available for the execution of the proposed
project in its crucial early stages. The consultant selected by Government
for engineering design, supervision of construction and sawmll management
to maintain continuity through the three stages oL the project, was found
acceptable by EDF and the Bank and they have prepared the preliminary aesig:
for the various project components. These consultants would be required to
provide nine key management personnel, including the Managing Director,
Chief Accountant, Forest Manager, Chief Engineer, Mill Manager, Mechanical
Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Saw Doctor and Mill Superintendent.  Local
managerial staff would include an Administrator, Ilamnnng Officer, HarIet-.'
Officer, Personnel Officer, Supplies Officer, Cost: Accountant, Financial
Accountant, Roads Superintendent, Logging Superintendent, Yard Superintende-7-
and Transport Superintendent.  An Organization  h^cart _s presented in A'a-£ ,
Chart 1, and terms of reference for the management: consultants, as well as
qualifications for senior staff, are presented in Annex 2. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that, before Februaryr 1, 1980, DWL would empls-
these consultants for a period of three years and that, after completion of
the management contract, the company would appoint a new Managing Director,
Chief Accountant, Chief Engineer and Mill Manager, i4n CoInsGltation with t<h
Bank.  A letter of intent has been signed between D-vLWL3 and the accepted
consultants covering the management services to be provided. Signing of
the supervision of construction and managemenrt          c':obetween Dl*gu sn,
the consultants would be a condition of effec-lvc-.-  for l-he proposed _sa

Training1
4.04      Training for DWL staff wotuld be provided on three levels:  first,
a steering committee, headed by the Conservator of Forests and including the
DWL Pro;ject Director and Project Officer as well as the Assistant Conservators
for Logging and Forest Management and a representative of the National Science
Research Council, would be created in the MENR to establ.s½  and i>½mt
a program to train as many logging and sawmilling personnel as possible before
the project becomes operational. For this purpose, training facilities of
the Government would be used as well as the technical and financial assistance
availab:Le from FAO and CIDA. Second,the Hinrich Feldmeyer company would
provide on-the-job-training of key personnel either before the project becomes
operational or during the start-up phase; and third, the consultant firm
that would manage the company initially would provide on-the-job training
for DWL personnel to facilitate the gradual transition from the management
firm to trained local management staff, expected to occur over a period of
three years. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that the steering
committee would be established before January 31, 1979.
B. Capital Structure of Demerara Woods Ltd.
4.05      The company's equity would amount to US$9.5 million (G$ 24.2 mil-
lion), which would be wholly contributed by Government, including a sum of
Us$1 mi:Llion (G$ 2,6 million) received from the EDF as a grant and the
proceeds of a US$4 million (G$ 10.2 million) loan from the EIB under the
Lome Convention statutes covering equity in national industrial projects.
This loan to Government would be for 20 years with five years of grace and
an inte:rest rate of 2%.
4.06      The rate of inflation in Guyana has been generally modest except
for the years immediately following the increase in fuel prices. After
registering an increase of 20% in 1974, the rate of inflation dropped to
about 5% in 1975 and 9% in 1976. It is expected that the inflation rate
in the next three years would average about 9%. There has been no invest-
ment by commercial banks in development projects stch as the one proposed
herein. There is, therefore, no point of reference for determining the
long-term lending rate operating in the economy. In the proposed project,
investment would be made in the undeveloped hinterland of Guyana and sub-
*         stantial outlays are required for developing the necessary infrastructure.
The proceeds from the IDB loan would be on-lent to the company at an
interest rate of 7.5% for a period of twenty years with four y-ears of grace.
The interest during the grace period would be capitalized. Ass-rances were
obtained during negotiations that Governmernt would on-lend the proceeds of
the Badnk loan (US$10 million) to the DWL at an interest rate of i10  for a
period of 20 years with five years of grace and that the company would
assume the foreign exchange risk.
4.07      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that,
by March 31, 1979, the Government would pay US$2 million equivalent to DWL



- 18 -
to start operations and thereafter make available such amounts as required.
In addition, assurances were obtained that the DWL would not, without the
aor--.",-~-     s f h-- Baik. incur any long-term debt other than that necessary
for com1pletion of the project if its most recent 12-month internal cash
generation is less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement in
any future year, nor increase its debt/equity ratio above a level of 70:30
during the life of the project. The execution of the financing agreements by
IDB and EDF and of a subsidiary loan agreement between Government and DWL
to transfer the proceeds of the Bank loan to the company would constitute
conditions of effectiveness for the proposed Bank loan.
C. Timber Sales Agreement
4.08      To justify the heavy, long-term investment required under the
Upper Demerara Project, Government has granted to DWL a modified Timber
Sales Agreement (para 1.05), giving it exclusive cutting rights in the
defined concession area for a period of 25 years, with the possibility of
renewal, and listing no obligatory species to be cut under the agreement,
which would allow the company the flexibility to produce according to
market requirements.
D. Construction Schedule
4.09      Tendering for equipment and construction contracts would be carried
out according to the schedule in Annex 1. The process would start about one
month after Bank approval of the project, with delivery of equipment and
completion of construction expected 30 months later. The design phase, started
in January 1978, would be completed by the end of November 1978. The sawmilling
complex would be operational by April 1981 after a trial run in March of the
same year.  Construction of the township and the road to the port would be
initiated in February 1979, the buildings of the sawmill and the power house
in June 1979, and the port facilities in November 1979. Ihe management contract
would come into effect 14 months before start-up of operations, with management
staff gradually being added (Annex 2).
E. Production Schedule
4.10      The sawmill would be expected to begin operations sometime in
early 1981 and reach a capacity of 20% by the end of the fifth month, using
one of its two headrigs in one shift. In the next month, another shift would
be added, bringing production up to 40% of capacity by the end of the eigth
month. From the ninth to the eleventh month of operation, the mill would
gradually reach a capacity of about 60% with one headrig working two shifts



- 19 -
and the other headrig working one shift. Full capacity would be reached by
the end of the fifteenth month with two heaclrigs working two shifts. A
production schedule for the sawmill, including log consumption and output of
lumber, is presented in Annex 4, Table 4.
F. Monitoring
4.11       Monitoring of an industrial operation in an area where no population
exists and where no other economic activity is underway would take place as an
integral part of the sawmilling complex management and is therefore included
in the terms of reference for the management: consultants (Annex 2).
V. DEMAND AND MARKET ASPECTS
A. Domestic Market
5.01       Current information on the domestiLc market is based on estimates
since neither the Government nor private industry keeps records on sizes,
grades or uses of lumber absorbed locally. These estimates suggest that
local lumber consumption declined by 21%, from about 55,900 m3 in 1974 to
44,400 m3 in 1976 (Annex 4, Table 5) because of low internal demand as a
result of the country's financial and economic difficulties, domestic price
controls (para 1.06) and a decline in lumber production of about 16% during
the same period.
5.02       The FAO/CP sector mission estimates that between 1972 and 1975
Guyana consumed wood annually as follows:
IQ3            % of total
Housing                           29!300                55
Transport                          9,000                17
Furniture                          7.000                13
Cases and Pallets                  3,000                 6
Miscellaneous                      5,000                  9
Total                    53.,300              100
5.03       The housing sector is the most important consumer of lumber, absorb-
ing more than half the production for the local market. From 1972 to 1975,
the Ministry of Works and Housing spent about G$ 20 million on land development
and housing, while the private sector's expenditure totalled about G$ 110 mil-
lion for the same period. Approximately 1,350 dwelling units were completed



- 20 -
over this period and house construction appears to have kept pace with the
increase in the number of households.  However, due to the reduced lumber
supply available in the local market during 1975 and 1977 and diminis ii25'3
purchasing power, housing construction has now fallen far behind demand.
5.04      Estimates for future demand are based on an annual population in'-
crease of 2.2%, resulting in a total of about 900,000 persons in 1982, with
a need for 22,000 new houses. In addition, it will be necessary to replace
housing at an annual rate of 1.6% 1/ of the existing stock, which would add,
14,500 units, bringing housing needs to 36,500 units by 1982, or 6,000 uites
per annum. However, in view of the present constraints (para 5.01), the
effective demand is estimated at only 4,000 new dwelling units a year,
requiring 48,000 m3 of sawn lumber a year. A modest increase for other
purposes is estimated to add approximately 30,000 m3 to the domestic deean.=
The projected total annual domestic demand 2/ for lumber through 1982 would
be as follows:
m3             % of total
Housing                          48,000                61
Transport                        11,000                14
Furniture                         9,300                12
Cases and Pallets                 4,500                 6
Miscellaneous                     5,200                 7
Total                    78,000              100
This means an average increase of local consumption of about 8% annually
between 1977 and 1982. The projected increase of about 26,000 m3 of lumber
assigned for the local market by 1982 would keep up with the increase in
local consumption, reaching about the same volume by 1982. DWL would
contribute about 8,000 m2 to the local market or 10% of total estimated
consumption. However, should the increasing demand reach this level, a higher
portion of secondary or lesser known species than has been included before
would need to be introduced to avoid increase of local usage of exportable
timber. The marketing officer in DWL would thus have to assist MENR in the
formulation of a suitable lumber grading system and a corresponding pricing
policy, as well as promote administrative stipulation for the use of secondeM
species in public construction projects.
B. Export Market
5.05      World consumption of tropical hardwood logs and primary processed
wood products increased from 47 million m3 of roumdwood equivalent in 1961
1/   Ministry of Works and Housing.
2/   Source:  MENR/FAO.



- 21 -
to approximately 121 million m3 in 1975, a rise of 17% per year. The main
importinig regions are Japan, Europe and the United States. Use of tropical
timber :Ln importing countries also rose in that period by about 11% per year
while use in countries producing tropical hardwood lumber IMcreaged by only
4% annuwlly. However, despite the smaller increase of consumption in the
producing countries, the trend there is apparently toward greater utilization
of hardwood species and more processed timber products.
5.06      The GTEB (para 2.07) is satisfactorily handling the relatively small
export qtuantities and has established trade relations with more than 40 sales
agents all over the world, particularly in the United Kingdom. However,
GTEB's capabilities must be strengthened if the total export volume is to be
tripled by 1981 as projected. Estimated increases in lumber production in
Guyana up to 1981 are as follows:
Beginning of     Estimated         Estimated           Export as
Company            Production        Output         Export Volume    % of total output
m3                m3                   %
Toolsie Persaud       1978          33,000             26,000                 80
GTL                   1980           17,000             6,000                 35
DWL                   1981          419000             33,000                 80
Total                     91,000             65,000                 71
5.07      Guyana's share in the world trade of tropical hardwood timber is
marginal (24,000 m3 out of 121 million m3 total trade volume), so that the
planned increase in export volumre should be easily absorbed by foreign markets.
Guyana is currently exporting about 20 species of high quality timber of which
12 wouldl be utilized by the proposed project (Annex 4, Table 6) at fob prices
ranging from US$160 to US$200 per m3. Exports in 1976, valued at US$3.8 million,
consisted of the following:
US$ million             %
Greenheart sawn lumber
and piles                        3.2                 84
Wallaba poles                      0.2                  5
Other species                      0.4                 11
Total                         3.8                100
5.08      Given the difficulties of handling a greatly increased export volume,
GTEB's rianagement is at present negotiating a contract with an internationally
recognized firm 1/ (para 4.06) experienced in tropical timber processing and
marketinig to strengthen its marketing capacities in return for exclusive
1/  Hiinrich Feldmeyer.



- 22 -
rights over some of Guyana's timber products in a selected number of markets.
It is proDosed that this firm market approximately 50% of the output of the
prO_,to 'e .-C C  in Europe, excluding the United Kingdom, while also providing
technical back-stopping for GTEB and promoting the marketing abroad of lesser
known Guyanese species. GTEB already has made marketing arrangements with 18
countries and these may be expected to work satisfactorily in the future, as
difficulties in the past were created mainly by an unreliable production
capability which did not allow long-term contracts and permanent relations
with the clients.
5.09      Under these circumstances and since the proportion of Guyana's
export volume to the world trade is marginal and the exported timbers are of
high quality and in demand, it can be assumed that marketing of the primary
species would not be a problem, even for larger quantities than those proposed
under the project. Secondary or lesser known species, while not presently in
demand in the export markets, have characteristics that can attract a favor-
able response to well-directed marketing promotion, supported by quality
wood products produced according to the timing and amounts required.
C. Marketing Arrangements
5.10      The proposed project would thus channel its exports through GTEB
under a marketing agreement (Annex 3) which would establish the expected
product mix, production schedule, loading terms and specifications and handling
fees and charges, prices and payments. The company's marketing officer would
relay order requirements to the mill so as to ensure that production meets
delivery dates and specifications.
5.11      Arrangements for marketing the output and training of marketing
staff will be greatly enhanced by the agreement now being negotiated between
the GTEB and the firm of Hinrich Feldmeyer (para 5.08). Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that, before December 31, 1980, a satisfactory
program of training in export marketing for the GTEB staff would be agreed
with the Bank and implemented thereafter.
5.12      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that DWL would, no
later than January 1, 1981, enter into a marketing agreement with GTEB for
the marketing of its entire exportable timber output. A letter of intent
has been signed between GTEB and DWL on the terms of such a marketing agreement.

VI. T]ECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS
A. Technical Specifications
Login.
6.01      The logging component of the proposed company would comprise four
major activities:  (a) mapping and inventory; (b) logging road construction and
maintenance; (c) felling; and (d) logging and transport.
6.02      Mapping and Inventory.  In order to facilitate the overall planning
of effective logging operations, and location of the main roads and the
usable timber stands, the engineering design and management consultants would
provide, on the basis of existing aerial photographs, orthophoto maps at scale
1:5,00C0, with contour intervals of about 10 m.  With these m-aps and the
results of a low density sampling inventory (0.04% of total area), three
inventory crews would carry out a detailed operational inventory covering 100%
oL the logging area in order to accurately locate and tabulate the commercial
trees, which generally are found in small numbers per hectare and sparsely
distributed. In addition, an estimate would be made of the outturn of the
forest on a yearly or quarterly basis to serve as a guide for establishing the
sawmilling schedule and for making marketing arrangements. With such informa-
tion, removal of desired species could be planned effectively according to
market demands. Each tree would be_given a number and its location marked
on a MnLp so that skid trails could be planned and the felling supervisor could
readily check the areas. Mapping and inventory should be completed at least
one year ahead of logging so that a  TT-fth  sawmilting compiex' could
make full use of the information.  This would also give the logging team time
to plan and design the road system and to construct the logging roads at
least three months ahead of hauling operations.
6.013     Logging Road Construction and Maintenance.  Logging roads would be
designed according to the location of the most dense commercial timber stands.
The ma:Ln access logging road leading south from the mill site would later be-
come the extension of the proposed public road from Linden to Lethem on the
Brazil-Lan border.  The annual logging area for the proposed production volume
would require an estimated 20 km of main and secondary logging roads and about
80 km of temporary spur roads, with log loading areas spaced frequently along
the latter.  The main and secondary roads would be maintained by the project.
The spur roads, however, would not require maintenance once the area is logged
over. With this road density, the skidding distance could be held to an average
of 160 to 180 m with a maximum distance of 350 m.
6.04      Felling.  Based on a recoverable volume of 28.3 m  per ha in an
annual logging area of 3,300 ha, the proposed logging operation, working at
full capacity, would produce 93,500 mg of round logs per year as input for
the sawmill. A daily on-shift log production of 354 m3 at full capacity would
require eight crews to fell and crosscut the selected trees according to the
producl:ion plan. Each crew would work independently and would consist of a
saw operator and a helper equipped with one operating saw and one spare saw.



- 24 -
6.05       Logging and Transport.  Following the felling crews, a logging unit
equipped with three 170-hp rubber tired skidders and three 140-hp bulldozers
would haul the logs to one hydralulic heel boom loader which would supply a
fleet of five log trucks, each with 30-ton log load capacity.  It is esti2i_;r^
that each truck would average three loads per day in the early stages of the
operation since the hauling distance would initially be short from forest to
Mill.
Sawmill
6.06       The sawmill is designed to consume 93,500 m3 of roundlogs per year
for an output of about 41,100 m3 of sawn timber. Assuming a double shift
workinag 275 days per year, an input per shift of 170 m3 would be required.
Conversion rates have been assessed at 50% for greenheart and 40% for other
species. Since a wide variety of sawn timber specifications would be
required if conversion targets are to be met, mill design would incorporate
adequate breakdown, edging and cross-cutting capacity to meet the demand for
boards, scantlings, flitches, railway ties, flooring, and the like. Two
vertical frame saws would also be provided to all]ow production of long marine
piles and mine guides.
6.07       Log Storage and Preparation.  Logs woul-d be transported from the
forest to the log storage area where they would be unloaded by a travelling
crane, sorted into species and stored by front-end loader. The logs would
be debarked by a mechanical debarker and washed to remove abrasive dust
and sand.
6.08       Sawmilling.  Logs would be placed on a log haul conveyor for move-
ment into the mill and pushed off to one of two 8-ft bandmills for breakdown.
The sawmilling process would be as follows:
(a) the bandmills would cut the logs into flitches or boards,
which would fall onto powered roller conveyors for delivery
to either a resaw, a gangsaw, or directly to an edger;
(b) the gangsaws would be so arranged that, in addition to the
acceptance of flitches from the bandmills, they would be able
to receive long logs for conversion into marine piles or mine
guides.  Boards from the bandmills which require no further
cutting would be carried directly to the edger. On leaving
the gangsaw or edger, sawn products would be carried by
roller conveyor to the green chain; and
(c) on the green chain, the trim-saw would end-trim or cut out
any defects which appeared during earlier processing.
Timber would be pulled off manually from the gresen chain,
stacked manually, and carried by straddle or lift truck
to the storage areas.



- 25 -
To maximize returns from local sales, about 4,200 m3 of planed and moulded
timber would be produced by a planer with six cutters operating on a single
shift. A saw maintenance shop would be located directly over the mill floor,
and snmall electric hoists would be placed above each bandmill and resaw
to redtuce time lost during saw changes. The bandmills would have a 14-inch
wide by 12-gauge thick saw, a specification successfully used in West Africa
for sawing Bongossi (ekki) and Iroko, both of which are marginally -,re
difficult to cut than greenheart.
6.09       Preservation.  Tests carried out show that most Guyanese timbers
will not absorb chemicals applied by the vacuum/pressure impregnation method.
Howeve-, experiments with dip-diffusion have shown positive results, and
this przocess would be chosen for the project. The method would involve
passing the unseasoned timber through a dip tank, situated approximately
two-thirds of the way down the green chain and containing insecticides and
fungicLdes in water solution. Timber would then be removed from the chain,
close-stacked while still wet, and left for a period of three weeks to allow
the chemicals to permeate the fibers of the wood to render it less vulnerable
to attack by insects or rotting fungi. The timber would later be re-stacked,
with sticks between each layer of boards, for air, or kiln drying.
6.10      Drying.  The bulk of the mill output would not require covered
storage or kiln drying. However, the part that did would be accommodated in
a stacking shed of 1,200 m3 capacity or dried in a kiln designed to process
3,000 m per year.
6.11      Log Handling at Mill Site.  Total handling capacity required during
daylight hours is 45 tons per hour, from vehicles to storage area and from
storage area to log haul. The most effective method of meeting this require-
ment would be with a combination of an overhead travelling crane and a front
end loader.
6.12       Power Supply.  The estimated average electric power demand of the
mill and associated township would be about 2,900 kw. Thus, installed power
requirement would be about 6,000 kw, allowing an additional 30% for peak
demand!, and provision for maintenance and overhaul. To meet this require-
ment, six 1,000-kw gas engines would be iastalled, two of which would be
provided with facilities to use diesel fuel in the event of an interruption
in the supply of wood waste.  Gas for power generation would be produced
from wood waste from the sawmill.
6.13      Waste Disposal.  The mill would produce about 30,000 tons of waste
wood per year.  This waste wood (offcuts, crosscuts, ends) would be broken
down into small particles in a chipper hog and poured onto a sawdust conveyor
which would transfer the mixture to the powerhouse where it would be converted
to gas for generation of electricity for the mill and the project township.



- 26 -
6.14      Iransport Facilities.  All finished products would be transported by
truck to a shipping terminal situated on the left bank of the Demerara River,
a   I - E24  13 km downstream from Wismar.  A fleet of six 20-ton timber
trucks would meet the transport requirements for the mill output of about
150 m3 of sawn timber per day. The export shipments of forest products would
be made by water, partly in liner vessels and partly in chartered vessels
because transport would be difficult over the busy and curving Wismar-
Georgetown road. Small parcels up to about 700 tons would be combined to be
carried as deck cargo on liner vessels, and chartered vessels could carry
larger parcels up to 4,000 tons. Pre-shipment storage would be adjacent to a
lumber wharf suitable for berthing vessels drawing up to 6 m and up to 140 m
in length as well as for loading pontoons. The storage yard would be equipped
with water and power supply and would have office and residential accom-
modations. Two mobile cranes and two side-loaders for handling timber in the
yard, open-sided 3sheds for 2,000 tons of sawn lumber, and an open storage
area for 2,000 m of balks would be provided. Timber would be loaded onto
pontoons by mobile cranes, but ships' gear would be used for loading seagoing
vessels. A 13-km road would be built to connect the shipping site with the
existing road to the sawmill. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that the Government would provide the necessary land for storage and ship-
ping facilities prior to July 1, 1979.
B. Product Mix
6.15      In order to maximize project revenues in the early stages of
operation and facilitate marketing efforts, a production program would be
followed which would initially concentrate on the use of primary or better
known species (about 95%). This program would later be modified to include
a higher percentage of lesser known species as market conditions improved
for them so as to ensure as wide a utilization of trees as possible. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained from DWL that during the first six
years of operation of the sawmill, the initial product mix (shown below) as
expressed in the marketing agreement would be maintained, except for minor
changes which are required for technical production or markleting reasons and
are not likely to adversely affect the long term profitability of the opera-
tions of the company. The expected species utilization to be maintained
until a wider market has been developed for secondary specLes is as follows:

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Financial Analysis
Financial Rate of Return and Benefits to Government
7.01      The proposed sawmill complex would be a financially viable enter-
prise, as shown in the project cash flow analysis (Annex 4, Table 7). The
financial analysis has been based on the following assumptions:
(a)  the sawmill output would be 41,100 m3, with 80% of production
destined for export and 20% for the domestic market;
(b) the sawmill would operate with 95% primary species and 5%
lesser known species during the first six years of operation;
(c) the sawmill would become operational by April 1981 and
would reach full capacity by June 1982;
(d) the corporation tax of 45% would begin to be levied after
five years of sawmill operation;
(e) an export selling commission of 6% of fob prices, including
1% of bank charges, would be levied by GTEB;
(f) an export tax of US$0.11 (G$ 0.28) per m3 would be charged
on greenheart only;
(g) the cash cost of production includes royalties (stumpage rates)
ranging between G$ 3.53 and G$ 13.42 per m3 according to
species;
(h)  a mill price of US$165.96 (G$ 423.20) per m3 of lumber in
1981 was applied in accordance with the price projection
made by the GTEB. To this price a 2% per annum compounded
increase in real value was added in accordance with the
Bank's Commodity Export Projections Department Tropical
Sawnwood and Logs Price Projections (Table 3, Commodity Price
Forecasts, May 1978); and
(i) the Government would contribute to the DWL US$8.5 million,
including price contingencies, for the equity.
Based on these assumptions, the operation of the sawmilling complex shows
a financial rate of return on capital employed of about 13.8% over the period
of 25 years (Annex 4, Table 8). The financial rate of return on equity before
tax would be 24%. After the sixth year, the Government would obtain from the
operation a yearly tax of about US$1.3 million and the DWL would have a cash
surplus of some US$1.6 million after taxes.



- 29 -
Sensitivity Tests
7.02      Sensitivity tests of the net cash flow before taxes were run to
consider (a) increase of initial investment cost by 15%; (b) increase in cost
of prcduction by 15%; (c) reduction in sale price of lumber by 10%; and (d) a
combination of (a), (b) and (c). Results show a reduction of the financial
rate of return to 11.4%, assuming an increase in cost of production by 15%;
to 11.2% assuming an increase in initial investment cost by 15%; and to 10.4%,
assuming a reduction of sale price by 10%. A combination of (a), (b) and (c),
which is highly unlikely, would bring down the rate of return below the
opportunity cost of capital (11%).
B. Economic Analysis
7.03      The proposed investments would result in economic benefits to the
country of over US$7 million (G$ 17.8 million) annually at full development
(the second year after the sawmill complex begins operations) from increased
export: and domestic sales of timber products. Expansion of exports of secondary
species as a result of marketing efforts by the GTEB have not been considered
in the analysis, but they would also significantly increase financial and
econoraic benefits. For the purpose of economic analysis, the following assump-
tions have been applied:
C:a) the total project cost is net of taxes and duties;
(b) the royalties, amounting to US$113,000 in 1981 and US$174,000
thereafter, have been deducted from the cash cost of pro-
duction;
(c) shadow pricing of labor is not applied, because only an
insignificant amount of unskilled labor would be required
and the project area would be remote; and
(d) a shadow exchange rate of G$ 3.00 to US$1.00 was adopted
against the official rate of G$ 2.55.
On the basis of these assumptions, the project shows an economic rate of
return of about 16.2% (Annex 4, Table 9).
7.04      Sensitivity tests show a reduction of the economic rate of return
(a) to 14.4%, assuming an increase in initial investment cost by 15%; (b) to
15.2%, assuming an increase in cost of production by 15%; and (c) to 14.1%
assuming a reduction of sale price by 10%. A combination of (a), (b) and (c),
which is highly unlikely, would bring down the rate of return to 11.5%. The
use of a current exchange rate of G$ 2.55 per US$1.00 would reduce the economic
rate of return to 14.9%. Sensitivity tests to production levels indicate that
the project is not economically viable if the capacity utilization falls below
75%.



- 30 -
C. Employment Effect and Other Benefits
7.05      The proposed first stage of the sawmilling complex would provide
direct employment for some 500 people, all of whom would come from other
parts of the country since the project area is at present uninhabited. In the
later stages, which would include expansion of the logging and sawmilling opera-
tions and introduction of increasingly sophisticated levels of wood processing,
considerable increases in employment would be possible. IrL addition, the
project would represent progress in the implementation of the national policy
of penetrating the hinterland, and the township associated with the sawmill,
with its expected population of 1,500, would constitute the nucleus for a
settlement which would no doubt create additional indirect employment.
7.06      Development of forest resources is Guyana's major untapped source of
improved foreign exchange earnings in the short term, particularly since the
country's vast forests include several internationally valued primary species,
most of which are represented in the project area. Expanding the market for
other lesser known timber species would also help broaden the future earning
possibilities of a large portion of this resource, which at present is only
partially used.
D. Project Risks
7.07      The existence of vast forest resources in the project area, the employ-
ment of a competent management team during the first crucia:L years of operation
and the reliance on an international market and price level which is expected to
be favorable in the foreseeable future are all factors which tend to minimize
risks for the proposed project. The lack of qualified local personnel and
skilled labor is a problem but it is being dealt with by including arrangements
for training in the proposed management contract and by providing training
of forestry staff (para 4.04).
E. Environmental Impact
7.08      The environmental impact of industrial logging in the project area
is not expected to adversely affect the overall ecological balance of the
surrounding region. Some minor modifications in forest microclimate are in-
evitable and the possible effects on natural regeneration will be examined in
the silvicultural management research program proposed under the project
(para 3.14).
7.09      The selective nature of logging operations should eliminate the
more serious fears of soil erosion. Peaks and steep slopes as well as river
bank areas would be excluded from logging in the Mabura Hill complex and
Akaiwana mountains in the northeast and in other parts of thie project area.
In addition, the maximum road gradients would be limited to 6% for main
routes and 14% for spur and extraction roads. Also, adequat,e drainage would
be provided for these roads.



- 31 -
7.10      The impact of logging operations on the botanical associations in
the residual forest would also be examined in the proposed research program.
Logging inevitably would tend to increase the number of wild animal and plant
species associated with secondary forests and decrease those associated with
climax vegetation.
7.11      Reforestation of the areas logged by the project has not been con-
sidered at the present time because only an average 19% of the total timber
volume in the project area would be extracted, an acceptable way to utilize
tropicaLl rain forests with extremely vulnerable soils, particularly white and
brown sands areas such as are found in the region.  Plans for clear cutting
and subsequent planting, at one time discussed for the area, were rejected
because, for one thing, they would lead to devastation of the regional ecology,
as has been clearly demonstrated elsewhere in Guyana. However, the proposed
forest management research program would investigate the advisability of
replant:ing as one of the alternative silvicultural treatments required to
keep the forests productive (para 3.14).
7.12      The scarce Amerindian population in the region is estimated at less
than 51) people, although no precise data exists. They are located in the
southern part of the project area, where logging operations would not commence
for 15 or more years and they have already been exposed to alien cultures.
The Timber Sales Agreement prohibits any activity other than those described
under the project within the project concession area; however, the proposed
forest management research program  (para 3.14) would include a component to
determine the actual number of the indigenous population and the expected
cultural and economic impact of the project, if any, on them and would
identify any remedial action necessary.
VIII.  SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government that:
(a)  procurement of all materials and services for the project
would be in accordance with the procedures outlined in
paragraph 3.19;
(b)  the project unit established in the MENR would be maintained
for a period of one year after completion of the sawmilling
complex (para, 4.02);
(c)  a steering committee for training in logging and sawmilling
would be established in the MENR before January 31, 1979
(para 4.04);
(d)  the proceeds of the Bank loan would be on-lent to DWL at
an interest rate of 10% for a period of 20 years with five
years of grace and that the company would assume the foreign
exchange risk (para 4.06);



- 32 -
(e) by March 31, 1979, the Government would pay US';2 million
equivalent to DWL to start operations and thereafter make
available such amounts as required (para 4.07);,
(f)  a satisfactory program for training of GTEB staff in export
marketing would be agreed with the Bank by December 31, 1980
and implemented thereafter (para 5.11);
(g) land necessary for establishing port facilities for the
project would be made available prior to July 1, 1979
(para 6.14); and
(h)  Government would cause the Export Board to enter, not later
than January 1, 1981, into a marketing agreement with DWL
for the marketing of the entire exportable timber output
of the sawmill (para 6.15).
8.02      Assurances were also obtained from DWL that:
(a) adequate records and accounts would be set up and maintained
to reflect DWL's operations, investments, sources of financing
and expenditures (para 3.22);
(b)  project accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and these accounts, together
with the auditors' reports, would be forwarded to the Bank
within four months after the proposed investments had been
completed (para 3.22);
(c) DWL would present the Government and the Bank a draft completion
report not later than six months after the proposed investments
had been completed (para 3.22);
(d) DWL, in consultation with the Bank, would appoirLt before
December 31, 1978, a project director, project officer,
accountant and secretary (para 4.02);
(e) DWL shall employ, before February 1, 1980, and for a period of
three years, management consultants satisfactory to the Bank, and.
after completion of the term of employment of the management
consultants, DWL would appoint, in consultation with the Bank,
a new managing director, chief accountant, chief engineer and
mill manager (para 4.03);
(f) DWL would not, without the agreement of the Bank, incur any
long-term debt, except for completion of the project, unless
its most recent 12-month internal cash generation is not less
than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requiremtent in any future
year, nor allow its debt/equity ratio to increase above 70:30
during the life of the project (para 4.07); and



- 33 -
(g)  DWL would, no later than January 1, 1981, enter into a marketing
agreement with GTEB for the marketing of its entire exportable
timber output (para 5.12) and tlaat the initial product mix
specified in this marketing agreement. would be maintained
during the six years following the commencement of the operation
of the sawmill, except for minor changes which are required by
technical production or marketing reasons and are not likely to
adversely affect the long-term profitability of the company
(para 6.15).
8.03      The signing of the supervision of construction and management
contracts between the DWL and the selected engineering and management
consultants (para 4.03), execution of the financing agreements by IDB and
EDF and the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government
and DWL (para 4.07) would be conditions of effectiveness for the proposed
loan.
8.04      With the above assurances and conditions, the project constitutes
a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$10 million to the Cooperative Republic
of Guyana for a term of 20 years, including five years of grace.

Supervision of Construction
Introduction
1.        In accordance with schedule requirements, the consultant would estab-
lish a resident engineering team at the millsite to undertake construction
supervision activities so as to control, in an orderly manner, the progress of
construction and supervision of erection. Normally, the first man on site
would be the Managing Director but this may be altered, depending on actual
deveSopments at the site as well as the volume of work. As the work fronts
expand, additional resident staff would be added to arrive at the full complement.
Resident Engineering
2.        The constultant's resident engineering staff would:
(a)  establish overall administrative procedures for Eield organiza-
tion and specific procedures for such aspects as receiving an
warehousing and work order control;
(b) establish quality control procedures to ensure that the work
is done in accordance with the drawings and spec;Lfications;
(c)  interpret drawings and specifications.  Check and coordinate
with design office as may be required. Carry out: minor modi-
fications to design as may be required;
(d) provide input for the monthly updating of trend lines on the
engineering and construction schedules; and
(e) assist mill management personnel in the physical start-up of
the mill equipment, including the normal minor design changes
which become evident only at start-up. This assistance would be
coordinated with management and operating assistance.
Invitations to Tender
3.        The Consultant would assist the Government in carrying out and
completing the purchasing procedures for machinery equipment and construction.
4.       - Extending from the above concepts, the purchasing program would
proceed in accordance with the established schedules for th(e work and would
continue through the project. The consultant would assist the Government to
execute the purchasing program in accordance with the design engineering and
drawing work, generally as follows:

ANNEX I
(a) prepare a list and schedule for purchase of auxiliary and
secondary items of equipment;
(b) discuss and agree upon the selection of each item with the
chosen supplier and provide the chosen supplier with the
necessary Piurchase Requisitions or Orders subsequent to their
issue by Government to meet the engineering and construction
schedule requirements;
(c) assist Government in the Comparison of Quotations, make
recommendations, and, advise the Government in negotiating the
terms and conditions of supply; and
(d) prepare for issue by Government invitations to tender for con-
struction and installation work, complete with detailed specifi-
cations and instructions to bidders, general conditions of
contracts, construction drawings, and required work schedules.
Procurement
5.        The consultant would follow World Bank procurement procedures.  During
design development, the consultant would carry the procurement procedures to
the Comiparison of Quotations stage for maior items or those for which extended
delivery periods are expected.
6.        A representative list of equipment for which procurement procedures
would be initiated by the consultant is as follows:

ANNEX 1
7.        It is recognized that the number and location of suppliers requested
to quote may have an effect on the consultant's ability to carry every one of-
the above items to the Comparison of Quotations stage prior to commencement of
construction and that some of the activities may extend iinto the initial period
of the construction stage.
Project Control Documentation
8.        The consultant would issue on a regular basis throughout the course
of the job Engineering Progress Reports, to be sent to Government within
the first two weeks of each month to report on engineering progress during the
preceding month. These reports would cover the following items:
(a) detailed design progress for the month and the program of work for
the following month;
(b) purchase commitment, item by item, showing the purchases made to
date and the variance of these purchases relative to the budget
allowance for each item;
(c) costs of purchasing activities showing both comniitted and uncommitted
items, a current estimate of their final costs, and the variance of
these final costs relative to the budget allowances;
(d)  time/money schedule for purchasing activities showing the projected
expenditures for each month over the course of the job, the actual
expenditures, and the variance; and
(e) for the initial phases of the work, engineering and construction
network schedules, showing, graphically, for each month whether
the key items are ahead of, behind, or on schedule. A written
commentary would be provided for each item that is behind schedule
giving the reasons and the remedial action to be taken.
Construction Schedule
9.        The following construction schedule (Chart 1) indicates expected
timing for each construction activity and serves as a guideline for procure-
ment of necessary equipment and machinery.

ANNEX 2
GUYANA
UPPER DEMERARA FORESTRY PROJECT
Terms of Reference for Management Consultants
A. Establishment of Organization and Management Structures
1.        The consultant would establish an organization structure setting
forth the lines of communication and delegation of responsibilities for the
consultant's personnel within the organization while at the same time
identifying the structure of the management system. The charts would be
updated from time to time to reflect variation in the assignment of line
responsibilities to counterparts. Ultimately, the charts would be further
revised to reflect the replacement of the Consultant's personnel by their
Guyanese counterparts. Job descriptions would be prepared for each of the
positions defined by the organization charts.
2.        A preliminary organization plan and manning tables would be developed
to serve as a basis for relevant planning activities. These would cover the
preparation of rates of pay, hiring and recruiting policies and schedules and
training plans. These tables will also serve as organization charts and would
be used to cross--reference other pertinent employee data.
Policies and Procedures
3.        The consultant would assure the preparation of regulations on general
points, as mentioned here below, taking into consideration the organization
chart and the need to allow mill management to carry out its function properly.
4.        Accounting procedure instructions are concerned with means of
collecting accounting information for presentation of cost statements.
Decisions must be made on what information to present, the format to be used,
frequency of presentation, and how it should be collected. These decisions
must be made jointly by operating and accounting personnel< Operating personnel
will provide basic information for the statements and make decisions based
upon them. The accounting department would assemble and present the informa-
tion in a form useful to operating personnel. The consultant would supervise
and assist in the preparation of an accounting system and examples of report
forms. The requirements will be appropriately documented iLn standard procedure
manuals.
5.        Mill stores must be fully stocked for successful startup of the mill.
To facilitate the administrative aspects of establishing the stores, a stock
coding system must be developed so that purchase requisitions and related
documents reflect the item code at the time of purchase. Coding procedures
which make for rapid identification of spare parts with the equipment for
which they are intended are vital to effective maintenance and to inventory



- 39 -
ANNEX 2
control and limitation. Minimum and maximum stock levels for effective
operation of the mill shall be established. The consultant's system of
coding mill machinery and construction accounts would be utilized in the
development of a stores coding procedure.
6.        For the control of maintenance, involving the scheduling of work
and limitation of expenditure with the object of maintaining the mill and
equipment in continuous production, well documented sound procedures would be
developed early. For this purpose, the Chief Engineer of the consultant
would be assigned well in advance of startup.
