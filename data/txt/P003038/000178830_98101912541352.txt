ZAIRE
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Zaire, in the heart of equatorial Africa, covers 2.3 million km  of
the huge basin of the Zaire River, which forms an area of 4 million km  on the
great African plateau (Map IBRD 15621). Nearly half of the country is covered
by equatorial rain forests, about 4% in the northern area is cultivated and
the rest is made up of savanna, mountains, lakes, rivers and marshes.
1.02      The population, estimated at 27.5 million in 1980, grows at a
rate of 2.7% p.a. and is very unevenly distributed. Unlike other African
countries, a relatively high proportion (28%) of the population lives in urban
areas. The urban population increased rapidly (10% growth p.a.) during the
decade after independence (which was attained in 1960), but stabilized there-
after at a rate of about 6% p.a.
1.03      GDP per capita was estimated at about US$260 in 1980 with large
differences within the country. Mining and mineral processing industries
which account for about 20% of GDP have so far been the largest source of
public revenue and provide more than two-thirds of the country's export
earnings. Zaire's economy is currently in a critical state, brought about by
deterioration in the terms of trade and particularly by the fall of the copper
price and by borrowing for projects with long gestation periods and question-
able returns.
1.04      Information on public health is fragmentary.  The Ministry of
Public Health, with a budget peaking only at 0.12% of the Government budget
during the last few years, has not been able even to monitor public health
adequately. The available information shows the health situation is very poor
and has deteriorated during the last few years. Waterborne and water-related
diseases are very frequent. The lack of safe water is a primary factor in the
unhygienic environment. In some areas, intestinal parasites affect as much as
70% of the population and infant mortality even reaches 25%. These are very
high figures 1/ The majority of the hospitalized children suffer from diseases
associated with poor socio-economic conditions.
Water Resources and Legislation
1.05      Rainfall is generally regular and abundant except in the south-
eastern regions. Yearly rainfall in the main urban centers varies from 910 mm
in Matadi to 1790 mm in Kisangani. Numerous rivers and streams provide
abundant surface water. Most urban centers are situated by the rivers but
river water needs to be treated before distribution. Springs are tapped in
some urban centers, but more often in rural areas. Deep aquifers are only
1/   Average infant mortality is 10.2% in Madagascar, 2% in Europe and 1.5%
in North America.



well known in mining areas. All water resources are state-owned. In principle
water rights are granted and charged for by the Government, but in practice
this does not apply to water used for drinking and sanitation purposes.
Legislation regarding protection of water resources from risks of pollution is
generally satisfactory, although not always well enforced.
Sector Organization
1.06      Water supply in urban areas is the responsibility of the state
corporation, Regie des Distributions d'Eau et d'Electricite (Regideso), the
proposed project executing agency. Regideso is government owned and is
responsible to the Ministry of Energy for technical supervision, and to
the Ministry of Investments (Departement du Portefeuille) for financial
supervision. The Ministries approve important decisions concerning new
investments, borrowings and Regideso's organization. Rural water supply is
the responsibility of a "hydrological brigade", which comes under the Secretary
of State for Rural Development, Ministry of Agriculture. The sewerage and
drainage sub-sector is not well organized. They are in principle the respon-
sibility of municipalities through their Roads and Sanitation Divisions,
which come under either the Ministry for Environment, Conservation of Nature
and Tourism, or under the Ministry of Public Works and Land Development.
Initiated by the Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, a national water
supply and sanitation committee was created in July 1980 and is headed by the
Planning Minister with the Minister for Environment as Vice President and
Regideso's Chairman as Executive Secretary. This new committee is expected to
coordinate the activities of the different government agencies involved in
the sector, to plan the development of the sector, to mobilize financial
resources and to propose arrangements for strengthening the institutions of
the sectors, especially for sanitation. Until now, its main achievement has
been to sensitize the top-level of the Government about the sector needs and
constraints.
Levels of Services
1.07      The level of water supply services in Zaire is one of the lowest in
the world. Regideso supplies water to about 1.7 million urban dwellers. This
represents only 21% of the total urban population, or 32% of the population in
the fifty-six urban centers served by Regideso. A high proportion (85%)
of those served is supplied through 150,000 private connections, which are used
not only by the family owning the connections but often also by friends and
neighbors who do not have connections of their own. The rest (15%) of the
population served is supplied through 550 public standpipes. Six years ago all
the standpipes were constructed and poorly managed by the municipalities and
since then there have been neither funds nor incentives to increase their
number, which was and still is unusually low. However, arrangements for the
management of standpipes are being changed (para 4.15) and their number is
now increasing. There is no distribution network in many of the suburbs
which grew up after independence. Ninety-eight urban centers of more than
5,000 people remain without piped water. Most of the urban dwellers not
supplied by Regideso rely on unprotected wells or springs, and polluted
streams. Only a small percentage of them are supplied through company-owned
systems.



- 3 -
1.08      Overall information on rural water supply is scarce.  The WHO
World Health Statistics Report (1973) maintains that, only 5% of the rural
population has reasonable access to permanent sources of safe water. Before
independence there were about 1,300 protected springs, 1,600 protected wells
and 1,200 handpumps in the villages, and about 1,500 public standpipes
supplied through motor-driven systems. Since then all four systems have
generally fallen into disrepair.
1.09      In urban areas, human excreta are usually disposed of through pit
latrines in low-income areas and septic tanks in high-income residential
areas. The only waterborne sewerage systems are found in the centers of the
main cities. About 100,000 people, or less than 1% of the urban population,
have house-connections to a sewerage system, and 500,000 or 7% use household
disposal systems. Most of the sewerage systems do not function. The most
serious effects of the lack of adequate sewerage have generally been kept in
check by low population density and permeable soil which enable the use of pit
latrines and septic tanks and by the usual proximity of large, fast-flowing
streams. However, there are potential health hazards where high density zones
have grown up some distance from rivers, or where streams are small or polluted,
as in parts of Kinshasa and the cities in the south-eastera region. Excreta
disposal in rural areas does not seem to be a serious health problem in the
sector.
Sector Objectives and Strategy
1.10      The Government's main sector objectives and its proposed strategy
for achieving them are to:
(i)  Increase the level and quality of service in urban areas and
particularly in major cities. The rationale for giving this
a high priority is that in these towns the risks to public
health are more serious and the cost per person served is
less, while in rural areas, villagers have generally better
access to less heavily polluted surface water with continuous
flow. The Water Decade target of clean water for all by
1990 is unrealistic in the case of Zaire, in view of the
present low level of service and the existing constraints on
financial and manpower resources. The Government has set up
more realistic targets, under which the percentages of urban
population served would be 60% in 1985, 70% in 1990 and 100%
in 2000; these targets are also very ambitious.
(ii)  Extend as much as possible water distribution through public
standpipes in order to lower the investment costs and meet the
consumers' ability to pay. Regideso's policy is to give
standpipe management to concessionaires living on adjoining
plots. The concessionaire sells the water to the consumers at
a marked-up price controlled by Regideso. Existing standpipes
still managed by municipalities (about 50% of all standpipes)
should be converted to the concessionaire system because under
municipalities' management, water for the consumers and the
municipalities is free and standpipes are unsupervised which
results in waste.

(iii) Pursue training of water supply staff in order to improve the
efficiency and quality of service and to support expansion of
the institutions involved in the sector.
(iv) Obtain more information on underground water resources.
(v) Obtain more information on the rural water supply subsector,
determine the most appropriate administrative organization and the
long-term development program, and start supplying centers of more
than 1,000 people. The proposed strategy is to rehabilitate facili-
ties built before independence, to start self-help schemes and to
train personnel who could thereafter assist in the expansion of such
schemes.
Sector Development
1.11      Between 1960 and 1967 there was no investment in the urban water
supply sub-sector. Since then, Regideso has made large investments (totalling
about $160 million equivalent) mainly with the help of the Government and of
European Development Fund/European Investment Bank (EDF-EIB) ($12 million),
IDA ($21.5 million), Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA)
($10 million) and African Development Bank (AfDB) (15 million). As a result,
from 1968 to 1978 Regideso increased the number of urban centers served by
14%, production capacity by 120%, distribution networks by 33% and quantity
of water sold by 84%. The main beneficiaries of these investments have been
the major towns: Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Kananga, Kisangani, Mbuji-Mayi,
Kamina and Mbandaka.
1.12      Regideso's development program for 1980-1985 includes extensions and
rehabilitation of production and distribution facilities, estimated to cost as
follows:
Foreign      Local        Total
…------- US$ millions --------
(1979 prices)
Rehabilitation                             31          27           58
Extensions                               232          218          450
Total                                    263          245          508
The program would mainly benefit the suburbs of major towns, medium-sized
towns and small towns not presently served. In addition to construction of
water production and distribution facilities the program includes the construc-
tion of plants for the production of some chemicals used by Regideso for water
treatment (lime and alum), the purchase of operation and maintenance equipment,
the implementation of an hydrogeological study, on the quantity and quality of
underground water resources, and a training program. This program appears
to be ambitious because it would require considerably more external aid than
is likely to be available. For the 1982-1986 period alone the appraisal
mission estimated that Regideso would only be able to invest $300 million
equivalent at current prices. Regideso's reduced development program for
1982-86 (para 5.03) is realistic, well balanced between new and rehabilitation
works and includes only priority items.



- 5 -
1.13      In rural areas, since independence, there has been practically no
development and no maintenance of existing facilities, except where missionaries
have helped to do so. In the last two years, however, some meagre resources
have been allocated to the Hydrological Brigade (para 1.06). UNICEF, assisted
by an engineering institution (AIDR-Belgium), is upgrading existing and
building new wells, and protecting springs in three regions (Bas Zaire, Kasai
and Kivu). UNDP is financing the training of local drillers and hydrogeologists.
The Government's development program for 1980-1985 includes construction of
rural water supply systems and equipment for new Hydrological Brigades at a
total estimated cost of US$26.4 million equivalent.
1.14      Virtually no development, repairs or maintenance are carried out
in the sanitation subsector, which is badly organized and needs a thorough
institutional reorganization (para 1.06). Specific recommendations on how to
remove the constraints to the development of the sector (para 1.17) were
proposed for three towns (Matadi, Bukavu and Likasi) in the feasibility
reports implemented under the UNDP Project ZAI 78/004 (para 1.18). Funds
should be identified to assist the Government in implementing the recommenda-
tions in at least two priority towns, Matadi and Bukavu, and preinvestment
studies need to be carried out for Kinshasa.
Sector Constraints
1.15      In the urban water supply sector, the major constraints are finan-
cial and are related to the economic difficulties of the country. There is
limited external financing and limited Government foreign exchange allocation
to Regideso to import spare parts, chemicals, meters, pipes etc., all of which
are necessary for operation and maintenance. Civil works are costly because
of a national shortage of building materials, gasoline, oil and spare parts.
Transportation is costly, security is poor and risks are high. Another
constraint is the lack of qualified manpower. Regideso's recent training
program has lessened this constraint but continued effort is needed. Should
external funds become available to allow full implementation of the 1980-1985
development program, external technical assistance would be needed to strengthen
Regideso's staff beyond the present use of engineering firms for preparation
and supervision of projects.
1.16      In rural areas the Ministry of Agriculture lacks both staff and
funds to maintain and rehabilitate the existing water systems and to develop
new ones.
1.17      Prerequisites to development in the sanitation sector are the need
to study appropriate low-cost technology, health education, cost recovery
arrangements and identification and strengthening of suitable institutions to
implement and maintain sanitation facilities.
Previous Bank Involvement
1.18      Since 1973 the Bank has played an important role in assisting
in the development of Regideso. Key activities have included: the implementa-
tion of a water supply sector study in 1973-74; co-financing a water supply
project in six cities (CR 625-ZR, referred to in this report as the first
project) in 1976, now practically completed; implementing a tariff structure
study, under the WHO/IBRD Cooperative program in 1979; and execution of the



UNDP Project ZAI/78004 in 1979-80, under which master plans and feasibility
studies for water supply and sanitation in three cities (Matadi, Bukavu and
Likasi) were completed. The Bank has also been involved in rural water supply
through the Smallholder Maize Project (CR 1040-ZR) presented recently to the
Board (June 1980) and including a US$1.2 million component for rehabilitation
of village water systems.
1.19      The first project, for which a US$21.5 million credit was made,
included extension and rehabilitation of water supply systems in six cities,
engineering services and contribution to a training program with Regideso as
beneficiary and implementing agency.  The project was completed in December
1981.  Certificates of completion for all construction contracts were issued
from March to November 1980, about 18 months behind appraisal estimates.  The
delays were due to difficulties in obtaining satisfactory detailed design and
bid documents from one consulting engineer, and to continuous external cons-
traints during construction of the works (poor transportation and communication,
fuel rationing, shortage of building materials etc.) The scope of the distri-
bution facilities in some of the cities had to be reduced at the awarding of
contracts, when tenders were 38% above appraisal estimates because of higher
price escalation for local costs and contractors anticipation of difficulties
in fuel supply, transportation and supply of local materials. Delays in
project implementation have been kept within reasonable limits because of
Regideso's relatively good administrative capabilities compared to other
agencies in the country. To reduce the risk of cost overrun in the second
project, a cost estimate based on detailed design was prepared prior to Board
presentation.
II. POPULATION, WATER SUPPLY SERVICE AND DEMAND
IN THE PROJECT AREA
Location - Special Features
2.01      The project area comprises the three cities of Likasi, Kisangani and
Mbuji-Mayi (including their suburbs) which cover 1760 ha, 2800 ha and 2000 ha
respectively (Map IBRD 15621).
2.02      Likasi is located on one of the Shaba mining fields.  Its economic
activity is dominated by the mining industry (copper and cobalt) and railway
maintenance workshops. Its population increased rapidly (7% p.a.) in the
period 1958-70, but population growth decreased to 2.5% p.a. from 1971 to 1980.
Its present population is 200,000 with 50,000 living in the mining company
township. Water sources consist of streams and groundwater from deep aquifers.
2.03      Kisangani, the capital of the Haut-Zaire Region, is located by the
Stanley Falls at the bend of the great Zaire River. It is located at a
communication center of river, road, rail and air transportation, and telecom-
munication, has a university and a few small industries. Its population
grew at about 6.6% p.a. from 1960 to 1975 but levelled thereafter at about
330,000 people. Its water sources consist of small springs and river water.



2.04      Mbuji-Mayi, the capital of the Eastern Kasai Region, has grown
around Miba (Socie'te Miniere de Bakwanga), a diamond mining company. Its
population swelled at a rate of 12% p.a. over 1960-1974 but the growth rate
has decreased to 2.9% p.a. since then. Its present population is about
260,000 people. The city is located on a limestone-dolomitic formation which
contains an extensive aquifer from which plentiful clean water flows from
artesian springs near the urban area. There will be no problem of water
resources and water treatment in Mbuji-Mayi for at least 20 years.
Existing Water Supply Systems
(Annex 1 and Maps IBRD 15621, 15622, 15623 and 15624)
2.05      Likasi's water production facilities  (raw water pumping station and
treatment plant) are entirely oined and operated by the mining colpany,
Gecamines.  Out of the 18,000 m  of water produced daily, 7,000 m  are for    3
Gecamines' own use, including the company township, and the remaining 11,000 m
are sold in bulk to Regideso for distribution. Regideso's distribution system
includes about 89 km of pipes which supply the city center, a few large
consumers, of which the railway company is the major one, and, very inadequately,
some of the fringe areas of the city. Since 1960, expansion of the water
supply system fell noticeably behind the growth of domestic needs, especially
in the areas of the city not linked to the mining and railway compound and
miltary camps. Water production facilities are operating to maximum capacity
and periodic water shortages occur in the few poor areas of the city served by
the distribution networks.
2.06      Kisangani's main production 3facility is the Tshopo II water
treatment and pumping pAant (20,000 m /day) constructed under the first
project.  About 2,500 m /day additional production facilities are provided by
a small plant at the new airport and by small springs in and nearby the urban
area.  Now that Tshopo II water works are commissioned  the old Tshopo I water
works could be rehabilitated, which would add 15,000 m / day to the existing
production capacity. The existing network does not supply all the peripheral
areas of the city. It includes about 226 km of pipes, of which 10.5 km of
primary pipes (diameter 200 to 450 mm) were laid under 3the first project.
The total capacity of distribution reservoirs, 2,270 m is presently
inadequate.
2.07      Mbuji-Mayi's water supply production facilities were expanded
from 3,600 to 17,400 m /day under the first project. No further expansion of
production facilities is needed in the immediate future.  The distri 3ution
system now includes a booster station, storage reservoirs of 1,880 m capacity
and a distribution system comprising 83 km of pipes. Distribution system
extensions under the first project are inadequate because the scope of
the project was reduced to accomodate cost overruns (para. 1.19).
Population Served and Standards of Water Supply Services
2.08      The table below summarizes for the three cities of the project the
data on population served through public water supply and present standards of
services (Annex 2). It shows that the percentage of population served is
low and that the supply through public standpipes is not yet well developed.

Some people get water from the connections of their neighbors.  Some neighbors
give the water, others sell it. People not served (including mainly the urban
poor) get unsafe water from streams, ponds or unprotected wells. The 560,000
urban poor, who have a per capita income of Z 660 or less a year, live mainly
in the fringe areas of the cities. It is estimated that 46% of them are
poorly served, while 54% are not served at all.
2.09      The table below summarizes the quantities of water presently used
by various types of consumers and by various standards of service. It shows
that the standards of service are low.

2.10      The estimated percentage of unaccounted for water appears to be
normal, varying from 17% to 20% of the quantities of water produced in each
of the three cities (Annex 1).
Population Projections and Water Supply Demand
2.11      The population living in the three cities of the project (and
outside the mining compounds which have their own water supply) are expected
to increase according to the following table:
1980         1985          1990          2000
Likasi
- population                   150,000       170,000      235,000       400,000
% increase p.a.                      2.5%          6.6%          5.4%

- population                   336,000      390,000       451,000       606,000
% increase p.a.                      3%            3%            3%
Mbuji-Mayi
- population                   261,000       296,000      335,000       430,000
% increase p.a.                      2.5%          2.5%          2.5%
Beyond 1985, the annual growth rate of the population in Likasi, outside the
mining compound, is relatively high but for Likasi as a whole, the population
growth rate is smaller. In the two other cities, the mining compound is
smaller (Mbuji-Mayi) or there is none (Kisangani). On average, for the three
cities (excluding the mining compounds), the population is expected to grow at
a moderate rate of 3.3% p.a. over the 1980-2000 period. The figures are based
on data included in pre-investment studies prepared for this project (para
3.01) and are reasonable.
2.12      While estimating the future water supply demands based on the
demographic changes in the three cities, reasonable assumptions have been made
in terms of standards of service and water use patterns (Annex 3). On
average in the three cities, key indicators relative to domestic demand are
expected to develop as follows:

- private connections                            22       22        34
- public standpipes                               7       38        40
- neighbors' connections                         30       40        26
Total served                                  59       100      100

- private connections                            78       88        97
- public standpipes                              10       15        21
- neighbors' connections                         22       18        24
Weighted average                              41        32        48
Until 1990 the percentage of people served through private connections would
remain constant while the percentage of people served through public standpipes
would sharply increase as new areas to be served are mostly inhabited by the
poor. This would reduce the weighted average per capita consumption until
1990, but there will be a slight increase over the 1990-2000 period.
2.13      Total water demand is expected to increase as follows:
/'day---------
1980       1990        2000
Domestic                                   18,200      33,100      68,600
Industry and Commerce                       4,200       5,400       8,700
Government institutions                     5,300       8,200      14,300
Total demand at distribution level         27,700      46,700      91,600
Total demand at production level           33,900      56,900    110,000
Peak day water demand                      36,200      64,400    116,000
On average for the three cities, the water demand is expected to increase over
the 1980-2000 period at an average rate of 6.1% per year. This is almost
twice the average population growth (3.3%) because the percentage of people
served would increase from 59% to 100%. It is still moderate because most new
people served would get water through public standpipes at a low per capita
consumption (10 to 21 liters per day).
2.14      Investment needed to satisfy this demand is realistic and attainable
provided water tariffs keep up with local inflation. The program would be
implemented in several stages. Works to be constructed under the proposed
project would meet the water demand up to 1990 in Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi and
up to 1985 in Likasi. The differences of time horizons between the towns
comes from differences in the existing facilities and type of water

resources. New production facilities need to be constructed in Likasi but not
in Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi where production facilities were extended under
the first project. Furthermore, the least cost solution for Likasi (para,
6.02) consists in tapping ground water for which investments have to be less
"lumpy" than for surface water used for Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi under the
first project.
III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      In 1978, the Bank agreed to be Executing Agency for the UNDP Project
ZAI/78004 under which master plans and feasibility studies for water supply in
Likasi, Bukavu and Matadi were to be implemented. A French engineering firm,
Omnium Technique de l'Urbanisme et de l'Infrastructure (OTUI), completed the
studies at the end of 1980. Further, water supply investments are still needed
in the three cities (Kisangani, Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka), which benefit from
the first project, as a result of a reduction in the scope of the distribution
facilities included in the project (para. 1.19). A few years ago, consulting
engineers 1/ issued reports for these further investments. Regideso updated
these reports in 1980.
3.02      The proposed second water supply project would meet the water supply
needs in the three cities where these needs rate first priority (Likasi,
Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi). It fits well in Regideso's reduced development
program for 1981-1985 (para 5.03). Detailed design studies for the three
cities started in May 1981 and were completed in March 1982. They were
carried out by IEU-SEURECA (France) for Kisangani, Latino-consult (Argentina)
for Mbuji-Mayi and OTUI (France) for Likasi. Improvement of the water supply
for the three remaining cities (Bukavu, Matadi and Mbandaka) would be deferred
to subsequent projects which would be implemented when more external funds for
the sector become available.
Project Objectives
3.03      The project would help to alleviate the major constraint for develop-
ment of the sector, which is the Government's lack of foreign exchange for
Regideso's development program. It would improve the level of service of
water supply in urban areas which is one of the lowest in the world. In
Kisangani, Mbuji-Mayi and Likasi, the percentage of total people served,
presently 54%, 60% and 70% respectively, would be increased to 100%. This
would be obtained mainly by supplying water to the fringe areas of the cities
through public standpipes which is low-cost technology appropriate to Zaire.
The percentage of people served this way would increase from 0% to 32% in
Likasi, from 15% to 60% in Mbuji-Mayi and from 4% to 69% in Kisangani, while
the percentage of people served through private connections would remain
approximately constant in each city until 1990. It is only after 1990 and
with new investments that the percentage of people served through private
connections would be increased. This second project, through its administration

by local staff, its financial covenants, its training component and its provision
of computing and accounting services is expected to maintain the institutional
effectiveness achieved under the first project.
Project Description
3.04      The project would strengthen and expand the water supply facilities
in Likasi, Kisangani and Mbuji-Mayi (Annex 4 and Maps IBRD 15622, 15623 and
15624). It would consist of:
-    Construction of about two production boreholes and drilling of
about eight test boreholes to investigate further water resources
in Likasi.
-    Supply and installation of three pumps with their electric
equipment (two in Likasi and one in Mbuji-Mayi).
-    Construction of two reservoirs  each of capacity 2000 m  in
Y3
Likasi; two reservoirs, capacity 1500 and 1009 m in
Kisangani; and one reservoir, capacity 1600 m   in Mbuji-Mayi.
-    Supply, transportation and laying of the following distribution
pipelines: 52 km in Likasi, 85 km in Kisangani and 57 km in
Mbuji-Mayi. Replacement of old pipelines, comprising 13 km in
Likasi and 49 km in Kinsangani, are included in the above figures.
The pipe diameters would range between 50 mm and 500 mm.
-    Construction of public standpipes with kiosks including piping and
meters: about 26 in Likasi, 115 in Kisangani and 10 in Mbuji-Mayi.
-    Construction of metered private connections:  about 2,000 in Likasi,
7,200 in Kisangani and 4,100 in Mbuji-Mayi.
-    Supply of pumping and water treatment equipment for the rehabili-
tation of the old water works in Kisangani.
-    Supply of 12 vehicles, two engine-driven electric generating
sets, and maintenance equipment for the three cities of the project.
-    Provision of engineering consultants  services to carry out detailed
design and to supervise construction of the project in the three
cities and for hydrogeological services in Likasi.
-    Provision of consulting services to improve Regideso's
computer operations and assist in the revaluation of assets.
-    Supply of training equipment for Regideso's training centers
and overseas training of personnel.
Cost Estimates
3.05      The total project cost is estimated at US$39.94 million equivalent
including taxes and import service charges (para 3.09), with foreign exchange
cost at US$25.50 million. The cost estimates (Annex 6) are summarized below:

3.06      The base cost estimates are expressed in June 1982 prices.  They
are based on estimates provided by consulting engineers after they had
completed detailed design studies (para. 3.02). Unit costs are based on
contracts awarded under recent projects.
3.07      The base costs for consulting services are estimated at US$2.8
million.  Consulting contracts for detailed design studies, preparation of bid
documents and assistance in awarding contracts for construction of this
project were signed in May 1981 for a total cost of about US$1.02 million
equivalent (para. 3.02). In order to speed up preparation of this project,
the first part of the services was paid under the first water supply project.
The second part of these services included under the proposed project is
estimated at US$0.57 million and would require about 56 man-months. The
contracts for construction supervision and hydrogeological studies would
require about 130 man-months of consultants' services. Consulting services to
improve Regideso's computer operations (para. 4.11) would require about 6
man-months. Services to assist Regideso in the revaluation of its assets
(para. 4.09) would require about 14 man-months. The average man-month cost
(including salary, costs, fees, international and local travel and subsistance)
is US$13,600.
3.08      Physical contingencies of 10% have been added to the base costs.
Price contingencies totalling 12.8% of the base costs plus physical contingen-
cies are based on inflation rates. The Government having adopted a policy of
flexible exchange rates, local costs expressed in US$ equivalent and foreign
exchange costs are estimated to follow the same annual inflation rates indi-
cated below:
1/   Zaire is likely to experience high rates of inflation and the Government
has adopted a policy of flexible exchange rates. Consequently both
local and foreign costs are calculated in US$ equivalent.

3.09      Materials and equipment imported directly for the project will be
exempt from customs duties and import taxes, but not from a small import
service charge (3% on CIF prices). Civil works contracts will be exempt from
turnover taxes. Local costs include taxes estimated at about only US$0.8
million, or 2% of the total project cost.
Project Financing
3.10      The project financing plan is indicated below.

Total (including taxes)                     39.95
3.11      External funds (US$27.3 million) would cover 100% of foreign costs
and 70% of the total project costs excluding taxes. The proposed IDA Credit
would finance 46% of total project costs excluding taxes. It would cover
100% (US$16.23 million) of the foreign cost component and about 19% (US$1.77
million) of the net of taxes local cost component of all project areas except
Likasi. The OPEC Fund contribution (US$8.0 million) would finance 100% of the
foreign costs (US$18.4 million) of the project in Likasi.
Project Implementation
3.12      Regideso would be responsible for overall administration of the
proposed project. Its administration of the first project was satisfactory.
For this project, Regideso would assign one full-time engineer to each
of the three cities to administer and supervise the construction of the
project with the assistance of consulting engineers. In addition it would
assign to Kinshasa, one full-time engineer to oversee the site engineers and
liaise with Regideso headquarters, consulting engineers' representatives in
Kinshasa and the financing institutions. These arrangements were confirmed
during negotiations.
3.13      Detailed engineering design studies are completed and bid docu-
ments would be ready by May 1982. The implementation schedule shown in Annex
5 is realistic. Evaluation reports of most of the bids would be ready by

December 1982 and major contracts could be awarded by February 1983. Construc-
tion of the project would be substantially completed by August 1985, except
for some minor items which may still be outstanding. The project completion
date is set at December 31, 1985. This extended construction period has been
taken into account in the cost estimates and the IDA Credit disbursement
schedule.
3.14      Engineering services for supervision of construction and hydrogeologi-
cal studies would be financed under this project (para. 3.07). Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that Regideso would retain for these
services, on the basis of the Bank's guidelines for the use of consultants,
engineering consultants whose qualifications, experience, and terms and
conditions of employment are acceptable to IDA.
3.15      Regideso will be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
project upon completion. Present standards of operation and maintenance by
Regideso are hampered by the shortage of foreign exchange for replacement of
equipment and materials. Vehicles and maintenance equipment to be purchased
for the three cities of the project would partly remove this constraint.
Procurement
3.16      Construction of the works would involve several contracts for each
city: supply of pumping equipment including transportation and installa-
tion; supply of pipes, valves, meters, and fittings including transportation;
construction of reservoirs; laying of distribution pipes; drilling of test and
production boreholes (in Likasi only); and construction of water kiosks and
private connections, supply of vehicles, maintenance equipment and rehabilita-
tion equipment for Kisangani which would involve several small contracts. For
all the major contracts, bid documents would be issued at the same time in
order to offer attractive packages to potential bidders. Construction of
water kiosks in each city would be under a separate contract in order to
promote bidding from small local contractors.
3.17      Retroactive financing of up to US$600,000 is proposed to cover the
foreign exchange costs of detailed engineering design services after May 1, 1981.
3.18      All contracts over $100,000 financed by the proposed credit would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank-s guidelines on procurement, allowing the following domestic
preferences. A preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is
lower, would be applied to the bids of local manufacturers of equipment. A
preference of 7.5% would be applied to bids from local civil works contractors.
3.19      It is expected that the equipment and pipes would come from abroad
and that most of the civil works contracts would be awarded to locally based
foreign contractors. Contracts under $100,000 would be awarded in accordance
with local procedures which are acceptable to IDA. Total expenditures under
such contracts would not exceed, without the prior approval of IDA, $500,000
for rehabilitation equipment in Kisangani and construction of water kiosks and
$500,000 for vehicles and maintenance and training equipment.

credit disbursements may occur several months later (Annex 7). The proposed
closing date would be December 31, 1986. Any unused balance of the credit
after completion of the project could be used, subject to IDA approval, for
further water supply works closely related to the project.

Health and Environmental Aspects
3.22      By providing sufficient piped water to people in the fringe areas
of three cities, the project is expected to reduce the incidence and risk of
diseases attributable to the lack of safe and adequate water. The increase of
water supply would lead to an increase of waste water. This would be no
particular problem in the project areas, where the population density is low
and. the soil generally permeable.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
4.01      The IDA Credit of SDR 16 million (US$18 million) to the Government
of the Republic of Zaire would be onlent to Regideso on terms detailed in
Chapter V.
Regideso's Organization and Management
4.02      Regideso was created by a 1966 law and is governed both by a 1978
law, that applies to all Zairian parastatal utilities, and by a 1978 ordinance
that gives its own statutes. Regideso is empowered to transmit, treat and
distribute water in urban centres, to study new water production and distribu-
tion facilities, and to supervise their construction. Formerly Regideso also
carried out power operations, but in 1979 they were transferred to the National
Electric Company (SNEL). It presently operates fifty-six branches throughout
the country and intends to expand its activities gradually to the one hundred
and fifty-four urban centers of more than 5,000 people (para 1.07).
4.03      Regideso's Board of Directors consists of nine members appointed by
the President of the Republic. Three are Regideso officials -- the Chairman
(President Delegate General), the Finance and Administration Manager and
the Operations and Equipment Manager -- the other members are Government and
business representatives. The Board retains the right to approve large
investments, new borrowings, other major important decisions, and to review
financial statements. It delegates daily operational authority to the Manage-
ment Committee, which consists of the three Regideso directors and one worker
representative. Four account controllers (Commissaires aux Comptes) acting
jointly, also appointed by the President of the Republic, verify the company
books and check the accounting systems and procedures annually.
4.04      Regideso is satisfactorily organized, as recorded since 1976 by
supervision missions under the first project. After a reorganization
authorized by the Board of Directors on January 16, 1982, the Central Adminis-
tration in Kinshasa is divided into four units: the Finance and Administration
Department, the Operations and Equipment Department, the General Secretariat,
the Budget Control and Objectives Division. In the first department are the
Accounting and Computer Sections and the Personnel and Training Divisions; in
the second department are the Equipment, Operations, Procurement and General
Services Divisions; in the General Secretariat are the Legal, Public Relations



- 18 -
and Organization Sections (Annex 8). Each of the Central Managers has func-
tional authority over his domain of responsibility throughout the country.
Nine Regional Managers and one Assistant Regional Manager are responsible for
operations in their regions. The heads of the Regional Branches are located
in Bandundu (Bandundu), Matadi (Bas-Zaire), Mbuji-Mayi (Eastern Kasai),
Mbandaka (Equateur), Kisangani (Haut-Zaire), Kinshasa (Kinshasa), Bukavu
(Kivu), Lubumbashi and Kamina (first and second Regional Branches of Shaba),
Kananga (Western Kasai). Regideso is fully capable of expanding its organiza-
tion to include water supply operations in other towns.
4.05      The President Delegate General was appointed as Regideso's Chief
Executive Officer in 1972 and has proved to be a competent and efficient
manager throughout a period in which the company has developed considerably.
Departmental, Divisional and Regional Managers are competent and some of them
have held their positions for several years.
Personnel and Training
4.06      Regideso employs a total staff of 3,600, which is the right order of
magnitude for a water entity of that size in Africa. The Central Administra-
tion employs 470 and the regions 3,130. There are 370 cadres and 3,230
skilled and unskilled workers. Manpower was stable at 3,700 staff members
from 1975 to 1978, decreased to 3,200 in 1979 when power activities were
transferred to SNEL (para. 4.02), and increased to the present level with
the staffing of new operations in the six cities of the first project and the
addition of staff to the Kinshasa Region. The number of expatriates working
for Regideso has been maintained at a low level for several years and has
worked satisfactorily at the present level of construction program (para
1.15). Out of the eleven expatriates presently with Regideso, eight are
technicians and three hold positions as advisers.
4.07      In 1978, through assistance provided by the first project, a Train-
ing Division was created within Regideso to define and implement Regideso's
overall training policy. With the assistance of an expatriate training
adviser a residential Training Center was established in Kinshasa. From 1977
through 1980 a systematic training program was developed and financed jointly
by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and IDA. The International
Labour Organization (ILO) was the Executing Agency for the project training
component. Within this program about 600 Regideso staff received training,
mostly off-the-job at the Training Center, amounting to a total of about
3,200 man-weeks. Over the same period an overseas training program was drawn
up and implemented for fifty key managerial and professional staff. A cadre
of twelve Zairian training staff and instructors was established and is now
fully operational. This first phase training program was successful and
Regideso's branches have reported that the quality of work, particularly in
operations and maintenance, has improved. In accordance with training policy
the Training Division now intends to shift the emphasis from technical to
management training.
4.08      The next phase of the planned training program has been devised by
Regideso and UNDP at a total cost of $6.6 million, of which $1.9 million will



- 19 -
be financed by UNDP and the balance by Government. In the interests of
continuity, ILO will again be retained as the Executing Agency. To avoid
over-centralization of training a second center was established at Lubumbashi.
Both training centers will provide regional services which will focus initially
on training operational supervisors in the skills of identifying training
needs and organizing on-the-job training at the place of work. Management
training will emphasize the development of systems for organizing, planning
and controlling work activities and will cover inventory staff through a range
of training services. A training cadre will be established by the Training
Division comprising twenty-four training staff inclusive of the twelve existing
Zairian staff. Ten additional Zairian instructors will be appointed and
trained within the program.
Accounting and Audit
4.09      Regideso's accounting department is under the supervision of the
Finance and Administration Manager. Accounts of all branches are centralized
in Kinshasa and since 1979 financial statements have been prepared according
to the National Accounting Code, but can also be available in Bank format,
annually or semi-annually. Regideso-s commercially-oriented accounting
system, although improved since the start of the first project, needs to focus
on the following areas:
(i)  Delays in issuing financial statements due to computerized
accounting (para. 4.11).
(ii)  Financial forecasts - prepared under a covenant of the first
project at the end of each year for the three succeeding years.
These are still unreliable, in particular the funds flow
statements, which reveals lack of coordination and slackness
in the Financial and Technical Divisions. In order to remedy
this, on January 16, 1982, Regideso set up a Budget and
Forecasts Section in the Finance and Administration Department,
whose main function will be, with the help of its Financial
Adviser, to collect relevant data and prepare five-year fore-
casts in a timely manner. Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that Regideso would maintain a financial organization
satisfactory to IDA, carry out a five-year forecast at the time
of budget preparation from 1982 to 1987, and exchange views
with IDA in the first quarter of each year on the investment
program of that year.
(iii)  In revaluing its fixed assets, as required by a covenant of
the first project to calculate the company's rate of return,
Regideso uses national and international inflation indices,
but because the base-year of these indices is seven years old,
the value obtained is imprecise. An engineering revaluation
is thus necessary for the rate of return covenant (para. 5.05),
and Regideso will carry it out on the basis of its existing
register of assets. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that Regideso would employ suitable consultants before



- 20 -
October 1, 1982 to carry out the technical revaluation of the
existing assets as of January 1, 1983, that such revaluation
would be ready before June 30, 1983 and that Regideso would
continue to revalue its assets annually, using appropriate
indices, such as an index of cost of living in Kinshasa for
civil works, and a Belgian industrial index for equipment.
(iv)  Now that Regideso has shown its ability to issue semi-annual
financial statements, it should be able to prepare monthly
accounts, as billing is now monthly (para. 4.13), consisting of
income and funds flow statements, and Regideso expressed its
intention of doing so, starting in 1982. These would be com-
puterized when the computer is operational (para 4.11).
4.10      External audit of Regideso's accounts has been carried out by Price
Waterhouse, an internatioaal accounting firm, under a covenant of the first
project. The auditors' report for the year 1980 was issued almost on time and
the accounts and systems and procedures were found to be satisfactory.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that Regideso-s accounts would
continue to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and that
audited accounts of a given year would be available to IDA not later than six
months after the end of such year.
Management Systems
4.11      Computer operations, placed under the supervision of the Finance
and Administration Manager, have caused delays in billing customers (para.
4.13), processing accounting and inventory control operations. The equipment
is old and does not have the capacity to sustain Regideso's current level
of activity, and there are not enough qualified personnel to operate it.
Under the proposed project, IDA would finance the services of a consultant
for about six man-months to identify a new organization entailing the hiring
of competent professionals, the setting up of more suitable systems and
procedures and the rent or purchase of adequate equipment. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that Regideso would employ suitable con-
sultants before March 1, 1983. In addition Regideso has contacted bilateral
agencies that could help fund computer equipment.
4.12      The Budget Control and Objectives Division was created in 1978
and issued Regideso's first budget for the year 1979.  The members of the
Division are still somewhat inexperienced, but in 1981 they completed cost
studies and job analyses of all branches and started a program of cost
reduction.  On the basis of a study, Regideso has instituted a satisfactory
inventory control system by mid 1981, but its smooth working will depend on
improvement in the computer operations.
4.13      Prior to December 31, 1981 the meters of the 1,450 largest customers
with special tariffs (para. 5.04) were the only ones to be read each month;
bills are prepared manually, and sent out on the 15th of every month. Prior
to that date, smaller consumers were billed every other month. Since the
beginning of 1982, the meters of the smaller consumers in non-computerized



- 21 -
stations of Regideso (amounting to 7% of its total revenues) are read each
month and the meters of the smaller consumers in computerized stations are
read three times a year. Bills are sent on the 15th of every month, based
either on the actual or on the estimated consumption. Due to poor computer
operations, bills are on average delayed by four months, which results
in receivables of over six months' revenues. In 1981 receivables were over
one year of consumption for Government and Municipalities, but the situation
has improved markedly in 1982 (para. 5.02).
4.14      The number of meters out of order has increased as part of general
shortage of foreign exchange and about 40% of all consumers are billed on
estimated consumption. To redress the situation, Regideso prepared a draft
metering improvement program and discussed it during negotiations. In 1982,
Regideso will receive 65,000 new meters financed by bilateral aid, which it
will install within twelve months of delivery. Regideso is still seeking,
financing for 70,000 more meters to complete its replacement program.
Public Standpipes
4.15      Under a covenant in the first project, Regideso undertook to maintain
arrangements for collecting charges for water supplied through standpipes.
Most of the existing standpipes were owned and operated by the municipalities
but the water consumed was paid by Government. However, the wastage of water
was excessive. In order to reduce the wastage and the excessive amounts paid
by Government Regideso has, since January 1980, begun to take over the
management of standpipes from the municipalities   (nearly half of the
estimated 550 standpipes in Zaire are still operated by municipalities).
Regideso uses concessionaires to whom they sell the water, for collecting
water charges from consumers. A ceiling price has been fixed which prevents
concessionaires from charging over a maximum of 2.5 times the Regideso rate
for small quantities (10 liters or less). In the case of standpipes operated
by concessionaires and where Regideso has sheltered the taps under kiosks,
waste is reduced and arrears are maintained at a reasonable level. As
standpipe operations need to be constantly supervised, Regideso has planned to
appoint a full-time manager to oversee the standpipe operations for all its
centers.
Private Connections
4.16      Private connections laid in public land are generally financed by
the consumers although they become Regideso's property. Because of recent
lack of foreign exchange, Regideso cannot buy pipes and meters to construct
private connections where no external financing is available. To ensure the
normal replacement and construction of private connections needed in the short
term in the cities of the project and to increase revenues as expected, the
foreign costs of about 13,300 metered private connections would be financed
under the project. To avoid subsidizing consumers with private connections,
it was agreed that Regideso will recover from the consumers the full cost of
constructing new private connections in the cities of the project.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Regideso's Past Operating Results and Financial Position
5.01      The yearly average increase in water sales from 1975 to 1980 was
only 2.2%. This relatively moderate rate is mainly due to: lack of new
distribution facilities to meet the domestic demand of newcomers in the fringe
area of the cities, decrease in the demand from trade and industries because
of the economic slump in the country and lack of fuel to operate some of the
pumping stations in the provinces. Regideso's income statements from the years
1976 to 1980 are shown in Annex 9. Because of the high rate of inflation--the
rate of exchange of the Zaire to the US dollar fell from 1.33 in 1976 to 0.33
in 1980--and the requirements of the rate of return covenant under the first
project, Regideso had to adjust its tariffs twice. In July 1976 tariffs were
increased by an average of 90% and in October 1979 by an average of 245%.
Regideso met the 7% covenant under the first project in 1977 and 1978 but the
rate of return was negative in 1979 and it was only 3% in 1980, as the 1979
increase was insufficient.
5.02      Regideso's financial position as of December 31, 1980 is shown in
Annex 10. The debt/equity ratio of 14:86 is satisfactory. The only debt
incurred by Regideso is relative to the first project where the lenders other
than IDA are RADEA and AfDB. It is the Government's policy to make direct
grants or to pass on foreign credits (except for IDA projects) in the form of
grants to Regideso, which has not had time yet to build retained earnings in
spite of the rate of return agreement (para. 5.01). Regideso's current ratio
of 3 is high because receivables represent on average more than 7 months'
consumption. Prior to negotiations of the proposed project, in a letter to
Regideso dated March 3, 1982, the Government confirmed that it had settled
Government's and Municipalities' 1981 receivables for water consumption and
gave assurances that it would regularly pay Regideso's invoices during 1982
and in future years. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government
would settle administrative accounts on time, that Regideso would invoice the
Government and the Municipalities without delay and would regularly inform IDA
on the level of their receivables.
Financing Plan
5.03      Because of the high rate of inflation in Zaire, all Regideso's
financial projections and assumptions (Annexes 11 to 15) have been prepared in
US dollars with escalation at the estimated international rates of inflation
(para 3.08). The financing plan for the construction of the proposed project
covering the five calendar years 1982 through 1986 is summarized as follows:

The US$18 million IDA credit for the proposed project would be onlent under a
subsidiary loan agreement by the Government to Regideso at a 11.6% 1/ rate of
interest and with a repayment period of 30 years, including a five-year grace
period. Regideso will assume the foreign exchange risk. The execution of the
subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and Regideso, and the
signing of the agreement between the Government and the OPEC Fund for the
1/   IBRD lending rate at the time of circulation of Credit documents to the
Board. Long-term lending rates charged by the Bank of Zaire are currently
9% for agricultural or agroindustry equipment and 15% for other loans.
In view of Regideso's extension needs for funds for its capital expendi-
tures, an interest rate of 11.6% is considered appropriate for the project.
Inflation rates in Zaire from 1977 through 1979 were 63%, 58% and 98%,
and are expected to remain at about 50% over the next three years.



- 24 -
financing of the project (US$9.3 million equivalent, assumed to be under a loan
at a 11.6% rate of interest, with a repayment period of 30 years, including a
five-year grace period), would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
Credit. The balance of the project would be financed by a Government grant of
US$12.6 million equivalent. During the five-year period 1982-1986, Regideso
is expected to be able to invest about US$260 million in other constructions,
that are either new works (US$165 million) or rehabilitation (US$95 million).
Total construction during the period would therefore be US$300 million and,
with the effect of the tariff covenant applicable to the proposed project
(para. 5.05), Regideso would provide about 52% of the required financing out
of its own funds ($154 million), which is satisfactory. For other construc-
tions, Regideso has already negotiated credits of $38 million with foreign
lenders and would require additional funds of about $22 million from unidenti-
fied foreign lenders to provide the necessary foreign exchange, and $42
million equivalent from Government.
Tariffs
5.04      On October 20, 1979, Regideso was authorized by the Government to
increase its average water tariff by 245% (para 5.01) to comply with the rate
of return covenant under the first project. The tariff structure it adopted
was the result of a tariff study executed in November 1978 by WHO under the
first project. The two main features of the new structure were to increase
the tariff of smail consumers with metered connections (average consumption
no more than 10 m /month) to the same level as the standpipes' tariff, and to
make the consumers with the larger metered connections pay a flat tariff
for their whole consumption, discontinuing the benefits from a three block
system. As it appeared in mid 1980 that the tariffs would not be sufficient
to attain the covenanted cash-generated rate of 7%, Regideso applied for a
tariff increase averaging 70% that became effective on January 1, 1981, but
was too small, as the rate of return for 1981 is estimated to be 2%. On
January 1, 1982, prior to negotiations of the proposed project, Regideso was
authorized to raise its tariffs by 156%, enabling it to comply with same
covenant and attain an estimated 8% rate of return for 1982. The former
tariff structure and the present one are compared in the following table:

5.05      Because of the present scarcity of Government funds, PRegideso has
to finance its water development program internally as far as poss3ihble.
Moreover, watei tariffs in Zaire calculated at the shadow rate of exchange
(about $0.35/m ) are average in comparison with other African countries 1/,
and therefore Regideso should maintain its tariffs at a level that would
enable it to finance about 52% of its capital expenditures. In 1976 a
cash rate of return was required under the first project 625-ZR as a measure
of Regideso's performance because its accounting procedures were poor and it
was not able to determine depreciation levels based on revalued assets.
However, this rate is dependent on the level of receivables, excludes depre-
ciation, and includes debt service and, for the proposed project, it was
agreed at negotiations that as from 1982 Regideso would apply tariffs to earn
a rate of return, calculated as the ratio of net operating income to net
revalued fixed assets in operation. 2/ It was thus agreed at negotiations
that a minimum rate of return of 7%, as defined above, would allow Regideso to
achieve its objectives and Regideso would consult with IDA by January 1 and
July 1 of each year on the tariff adjustments required to attain this return.
Calculation of the estimated 1982 rates of return gives 8% under the previous
formula (para. 5.04) and 10% under the new one. Regideso would therefore be
able to comply with the covenant in the future as before. Consistent with the
tariff covenant of the first Credit, these requirements would maintain Regideso
as a utility with cost-reflective operations.
5.06      The tariff increases in the period 1983 to 1988 are calculated to
maintain a minimum rate of return of 7%. Because the 1982 tariff increases
would produce an estimated 10% rate of return, no tariff increases, expressed
in dollar terms, would be necessary in 1983 and 1984. Increases for the
subsequent years are shown in the following schedule:
Dates of increase: January 1            1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988
Average tariff, in $tm3                  .70   .70   .76   .84   .89   .94
Annual increase in current
terms (x)                                0      0     9    10      6      6
Annual increase in real terms (%)    -7.5  -7.5   1.4   2.3  -1.4  -1.4
As actual inflation in Zaire is likely to be more severe than the international
rates indicate (Annex 15), annual increases of tariffs are likely to be more
pronounced than shown in the above table over the six year period.
1/   In 1991, average water tariffs in other African countries expressed in
USU/m at the shadow rates of exchange are 42 in Botswana, 43 in Kenya
41 in Lesotho, 21 in Madagascar, 52 in Malawi, 25 in Somalia and 36
in Swaziland.
2/   Net revalued fixed assets are the result of the difference between the
gross book value of fixed assets, excluding works in progress, and the
amount of accumulated depreciation, to be revalued annually in accordance
with methods of revaluation acceptable to IDA and Regideso (para. 4.09).

Future Operations and Financial Position
5.07      A summary of forecast income and funds flow statements for Regideso
from 1981 through 1988 are given in Annexes 11 3and 12.  Regideso's water siles
are estimated to increase from 110.1 million m in 1981 to 176.3 million m
in 1988, an average annual growth rate of 7.0%. Based on the tariff increases
indicated in para 5.06, operating revenues are forecast to increase from $43.4
million in 1981 to $168.5 million in 1988, an average growth rate of 21.4% per
year. Operating expenses are expected to grow from $44.0 million in 1981 to
$123.1 million in 1988, an average growth rate of 15.8% per year, so that the
operating ratio resulting from the application of the covenanted rate of
return would decrease from 101% in 1981 to 73% in 1988. The debt service
coverage ratio is estimated to be 3 in 1981 and would remain high, between 7
and 11, during the period 1982-1988, as Regideso would receive the bulk of its
financing as grants from-the Government either directly or passed on.
5.08      Regideso's estimated balance sheets from 1981 to 1988 are given in
Annex 13. Regideso-s capital structure would improve steadily during the
forecast period. Its retained earnings would increase from 0 at the end of
1981 to $180 million at the end of 1988 and its debt/equity ratio would
improve from 14:86 to 6:94 during the same period. In case Regideso should
resort to borrowing for its capital expenditures, assurances were obtained at
negotiations that Regideso would ask for IDA's agreement before incurring debt
of US$4 million equivalent or more, any year from 1982 to 1986. The current
ratio would remain at a high level during the period, between 2.4 and 4.0.
Receivables which are equivalent to 6-month consumption in 1981 are assumed to
be reduced to a 5-month consumption level in 1982 and maintained at the
4-month consumption level from 1982 on, as a result of the application of the
covenant on Government's receivables (para 5.02). Year-end cash balances are
expected to be adequate throughout the period of the forecast.
VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
6.01      The project would satisfy the water supply demands in the project
areas (paras. 2.09 - 2.14). It would provide safe water to about 513,000
additional people at an3average of 20 lcd which would increase domestic
consumption by 10,410 m  /day.  This would significantly reduce the high
incidence of mortality and disease caused by the prevalence of pathogenic
and other harmful waterborne agents. The project would also meet the needs of
industry, commer e and government whose water consumption would be increased
by about 3,090 m /day.
Least Cost Solution
6.02      The consultants and Regideso  have selected the most economic
alternatives to meet the water demand in the project areas. Rehabilitation
of the water supply system has been proposed wherever necessary, and justified
old waterworks in Kisangani, parts of the distribution pipelines in Kisangani
and Likasi). Ground water is being relied upon wherever available and
economical. This is the case in Likasi where six alternatives based on
surface water and three based on ground water have been studied. Alternatives



- 27 -
for all the proposed systems were compared by analysing the discounted cash
flow of capital, operation and maintenance costs. Sensitivity of the results
to discount factors varying from 6% to 12%, to variations of cost estimates,
and to the shadow price of foreign exchange and unskilled labor has been
examined and found not to affect the least cost solutions.
Internal Rate of Return
6.03      The internal rate of return is taken to be the discount rate at
which the present value of all capital and associated operating and
renewal costs equals the present value of water revenues attributable to
the investment over its economic life. These capital costs comprise invest-
ments related to increasing the production and distribution capacity in the
three cities of the project and maintenance costs related to the new works,
and exclude all maintenance costs related to the existing water systems. The
financial rates of return are 6.9% for Likasi, 4.2% for Kisangani and 8.7%
for Mbuji-Mayi. The rates of return calculated with shadow pricing of foreign
exchange at 150% and of unskilled labor at 50% (excludirg all duties and
taxes) are 5.7% for Likasi, 3.8% for Kisangani and 7.6% for Mbuji-Mayi. The
average loig term marginal costs sf supply in these cities ase Likasi
US$0.760/m , Kisangani US$1.417/m and Mbuji-Mayi US$0.816/m , all in constant
1982 prices (Annex 16). These costs are above the overall Regideso 1982
tariff level which is estimated to be US$0.70/m , mainly due to (i) the small
size of the cities, which precludes the economies of scale available in such
cities as Kinshasa; (ii) the current high costs of new construction in Zaire
reflected in the new capital construction in the three cities; and (iii) the
high proportion of existing assets in the rest of Regideso's system which are
in the category of sunk cost, thereby depressing the overall tariff level.
Although they are low, the rates of return for the three cities are acceptable
because the above long term marginal costs have been computed with a 10%
opportunity cost of capital. The rates of return would be higher if tariffs
reflected costs in individual areas unrestrained by a national tariff policy.
The rates of return would also be higher if the additional benefits relating
to health and other environmental factors could have been quantified, as the
water revenues alone understate the economic benefits of the project. Sensiti-
vity analysis indicate that a 10% increase in capital costs or a 10% reduction
in water revenues would reduce the above economic rates of return by about
0.8% (Annex 17).
Impact on Poverty Group
6.04      The poverty group in the three cities of the project currently
consists of about 560,000 people of whom 256,000 are supplied with safe
water, while 304,000 have no access to safe water. Out of the 513,000
additional people served by the project 448,000 (i.s3. 87%) have incomes below
the poverty level (para 2.08). Out o0 the 10,410 m /day of water consumed by
the additional people served, 6,490 m /day (i.e. 62%) would be for the poor.
It is expected that in 1990 about all of the low income group would be served.
The following table gives the urban poverty component of the project and of
the Credit for two different criteria used to define this component:



- 28 -
Criterion:                Criterion:
number of people        quantity of water
Urban poverty component:        US$ millions             US$ millions
- of total project                   34.7                    24.7
- of IDA Credit                      15.7                    11.2
6.05      The absolute urban poverty threshold in Zaire is estimated at
Z 360/month/household in 1980, with an average of 6.5 persons per household.
From the income distribution in the three cities of the project, 75% of the
population have incomes below the urban poverty level. The median income
was estimated at Z 175/month/household. Assuming basic later needs to
be 20 lcd/household, at the estimated tariff of Z 1.22/m in 1980 prices (2.5
times the standpipe rate, para. 4.15), in 1987 a household using standpipe
water would spend 2.4% of its monthly income, which is considered acceptable.
A low-consumption household with a metered connection would be in a better
position, as it would consume water at a cheaper rate.
Project Risks and Merits
6.06      The project risks relate to costs overruns which may occur when the
bids for project construction are opened, delays during the construction of
the project and poor operation and maintenance of the facilities because of
lack of foreign exchange to buy spare parts, chemicals and material and
equipment for renewals.
6.07      The risks of cost overruns and delays during construction are,
however, moderate because project cost estimates and schedules of imple-
mentation have been based on detailed design studies (para. 3.06). (Cost
estimates of the first project were based on feasibility studies).
6.08      The risks of poor operation of the facilities, because of lack of
foreign exchange, are moderate since Regideso s management has succeeded in
the past in securing enough foreign exchange allocation to operate its facili-
ties. To reduce these risks, the supply of vehicles, generating sets and
maintenance equipment for the three cities has been included in the project
(para. 3.04).
6.09     The project risks appear moderate compared  to the substantial
benefits which are expected from its execution (para. 6.01 and 6.04).
Although substantial in absolute terms, the benefits are limited compared
to the enormous water supply needs of the country.
Monitoring
6.10      Regideso will, through bimonthly and semi-annual reports during the
implementation of the project, monitor critical indicators (Annex 18). Within
three months after the project has been completed, Regideso will prepare a
project completion report on the basis of an outline agreed with IDA.



- 29 -
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, it was agreed that:
(a)  To administer the project, Regideso would assign one full-time
engineer in Kinshasa and one full-time engineer in each of the
three cities (para. 3.12);
(b)  Regideso would employ engineering consultants satisfactory to
IDA for supervision of the project construction (para. 3.14);
(c)  Regideso would prepare five-year forecasts and maintain a
financial organization satisfactory to IDA (para. 4.09);
(d)  For the purpose of calculating the annual rate of return Regideso
would employ suitable consultants before October 1, 1982 to
complete the technical revaluation of its existing assets, as of
January 1, 1983, before June 30, 1983, and would continue to revalue
them annually, using appropriate indices (para. 4.09);
(e)  Regideso would continue to submit its accounts audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, together with the
auditors' reports, not later than six months after the
end of each financial year (para. 4.10);
(f)  Regideso would employ a computer consultant before March 1,
1983 to advise it on steps to be taken toward setting up a new
computer organization (para. 4.11);
(g)  Regideso would recover from the consumers the full cost of con-
structing new private connections in the cities of the project (4.16);
(h)  The Government would settle Government's and Municipalities'
receivables for water consumption in a timely manner and Regideso
would invoice public consumers without delay and regularly inform
IDA of the level of their receivables (para. 5.02);
(i)  Regideso's water tariffs would be adjusted so as to enable it
to earn a yearly rate of return on annually revalued net fixed
assets in operation of at least 7% (para. 5.05);
(j)  Regideso would seek IDA's agreement before incurring debt of
US$4 million equivalent or more, any year from 1982 to 1986
(para. 5.08);
(k)  Regideso would provide periodic progress reports during project
implementation and a project completion report (para 6.10).
7.02      Execution of the subsidiary loan agreement covering Government on-
lending to Regideso and signing of the agreement between the Government
and the OPEC Fund for the financing of this project, would be conditions of
effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit (para 5.03).
Recommendation
7.03      Subject to the foregoing conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit of SDR 16 million (US$18 million).

ZAI RE
SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Existing Facilities
Likasi
1.        Likasi's water supply system was designed more than 50 years ago for
a population far less numerous than now. Production facilities are entirely
owned and operated by the mining company, Gecamines. Raw water is taken from
the river Panda and pumped to a storage basin 2.6 km away. Part of the raw
water is then pumped again to a treatment plant located 140 m above the riv sr.
The sedimentation, rapid filtration and ozonization plant produces 18,000 m
day of Which 11,000 m /day are sold to Regideso for distribution in the town,
7,000 m /day are used by Gecamines in the mining compound and its residential
area. The water treatment plant operates beyond its design capacity and cannot
be extended at its present location because of lack of space. Furthermore,
Gecamines does not intend to build a new plant. Treated water is distributed
by gravity to most of the town, except in parts of the Kikula area which are
supplied by a small booster station. The existing distribution network
includes 89 km of steel and asbestos-cement pipes of 25 to 250 mm diameter.
There are 7,000 private connections and only one public standpipe. According
to Regideso records, unaccounted for water totals only 18% of average produc-
tion. This is a surprisingly low figure which probably arises from Regideso's
difficulties in measuring production outflows accurately.
2.        Consumption of forty percent of the production by a few large
consumers (the national railroad company being the biggest one) raises the
average daily per capita consumption to a relatively high level of 104 lcd.
The remaining consumers, consisting of small consumers with private
connections have had an intermittent supply since 1975. In the Kikula area
which has a population of about 90,000, water is supplied on a rotational
basis; however, this arrangement is unsatisfactory since the supply is
inequitable, failing to reach some areas where people have to rely on
unprotected wells.
3.        In order to increase the water production facilities, Regideso
drilled a 360 mm diameter, 180 m deep borehole in Kampenba and purchased an
electric driven pump and a rising main with the assistance of the French
bilateral aid. Installation of the pump and the main, supply of electric
power line and civil works for the pumping facility would be included in the
proposed project.
Kisangani
4.        Most of the city's drinking water comes from a new treatment plant
of 20,000 m3/day capacity, constructed under the first project near the



- 31 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 2
confluence of the Zaire river with one of its tributaries, the Tshopo river,
on the outskirts of the city of Kisangani. The treatment consists of floccula-
tion, sedimentation, rapid filtration and disinfection by chlorine. Supple-
mentary sources comprising a small plant at the new airport, three small
springs, located 4 km and 10 km to the east of the city in the university           3
area, and one spring on the left bank of the Zaire river, supply about 2,500 m
/day.
5.        The distribution network consists of 226 km of mains of various
sizes up to 400 mm in diameter. The pipes are generally made of steel and
occasionally asbestos-cement. Most of the existing network does not serve
all the peripheral areas of the city. There are some 9,300 connections and 4
public standpipes.  Thirty new design public standpipes (kiosks) are under3
constrVction. The combined capacity of distribution reservoirs is 2,270 mi.
Unaccounted for water is said to be 17% only of water production. As in
Likasi (para. 1), the real figure is probably higher.
6.        The old waterworks, Tshopo I, arS presently out of order.  After
rehabilitation they could produce 15,000 m /day additional water. Part
of the existing distribution network is in poor condition and 49 km of pipes
need to be replaced. The total capacity of distribution reservoirs is
presently inadequate.
Mbuji-Mayi
7.        The water supply system of Mbuji-Mayi draws its water from a plentiful
karstic aquifer through a spring called Muya. Production facilities have been
expanded from 3,600 m /day under the first project and are presently adequate.
No further extension of production facilities is needed uitil about 1987. The
pumping station at the Muya source delivers abo t 9,000 m , through two trunk
mains, 300 mm and 500 mm in diameter to a 920 m reservoir located in the
town. From this reservoir the lowest part of the city is supplied by gravity
while the highest parts Ire supplied through a booster st5tion and two
reservoirs, one of 460 m capacity and the other of 500 m capacity. The
distribution network consists of 83 km of mains up to 500 mm in diameter,
mainly of steel. It serves 2,004 hectares or approximately only 70% of the
urban area. There are 4,113 private connections and 13 public standpipes.
8.        Although the distribution facilities (booster station, reservoir and
pipes) need to be expanded, in order to meet present and future water demands,
its condition is good and few pipes need to be replaced.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
Likasi
1.        Works to be financed under the project would consist of:
(a) complementary hydrogeological investigations in the sites
of Kampemba, Kamantanda, Kabunene and Ngoya. In Kampemba,
pumping tests would be implemented as soon as the existing
borehole is equipped with its pumps and its electric motor
and power supply. The potential capacity of the aquifer
would be determined and a second production borehole would
be constructed if the capacity of the aquifer exceeds the
capacity of the existing borehole. In Kamatanda, test
boreholes would be drilled and pumping tests implemented to
determine the potential capacity of the underground aquifer.
The test boreholes would be 150 to 250 mm in diameter and
120 m deep, and the number required is estimated at about
eight. One or two of the most promising test boreholes
would be converted into production boreholes by increasing
their diameter to 300 mm or 400 mm. Full scale pumping
test would be carried out on these boreholes. In Kabunene,
test boreholes would be drilled to get more infonnation on
thie uridervrourd water.  If results are unsuccessful,
investigation would be pursued on the Ngoya site;
(b) installation of the pumping equipment with its associated
electrical equipment, and of the 350 mm diameter, 5.5 km
long pipeline, already ordered for connecting the existing
borehole in Kampemba to the existing distribution system;
(c)  supply of stand-by pumping equipment (3,000 m /day) and
supply and installation of water hammer protection and
disinfection equipment in Kampemba;
(d)  construction of the civil works associated with the pumping
electrical, and chemical equipment of the Kampeinba site;
(e)  supply and installation of pumping equipment (about 3,000
m /day) with related electrical equipment at one of the two
additional production boreholes mentioned in (a);
(f) construction of two distribution reservoirs at ground level.
They would be reinforced concrte and would each have a capacity
of 2,000 m3;

(g) supply and laying of distribution pipes: 38.6 km of new pipes,
60 to 500 mm diameter and replacement of 13.4 km pipes, 60 to 150
mm diameter in existing densely populated areas;
(h) construction of about 26 public standpipes with kiosks including
piping and meters and construction of about 2,000 metered private
connections; and
(i) consulting services for detailed design and hydrogeological studies
and for supervision of construction of the works mentioned above.
Kisangani
2.        The works financed under the project would consist of:
(a)  construction of two distribution rese voirs:  one of 1,500 m
capacity in Matete and one of 1,000 m capacity in Kabondo;
(b) supply and laying of
- a primary distribution network with 7.8 km of mains with
diameters ranging from 200 to 300 mm;
- a secondary distribution network with 19.3 km of mains
with diameters from 80 to 150 mm; and
- a tertiary distribution network with 57.4 km of mains with
diameters from 50 to 60 mm.
These works include replacement of 49 km of pipes.
(c) construction of about 115 public standpipes with kiosks including
piping and meters; and construction of about 7,200 metered private
connections;
(d) supply of miscellaneous equipment for rehabilitation of the
Tshopo I waterworks including pumps, electrical equipment,
sedimentation and filtration equipment; and
(e) consulting services for detailed design and for supervision of the
construction of the above mentioned works.
Mbuji-Mayi
3.        The works financed under the project would consist of:
(a) supply and installation of a third pump (146 m /h and 130 m
head) with its electric motor and control equipment in a
booster station to supply the reservoir of the high-level
pressure zone;

ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 4
(b)  construction of 1,600 m  reservoir at ground level at the
booster-station site;
(c) supply and laying of the following pipelines:
- 4.65 km, 300 mm diameter trunk main between the booster
station and Avenue Mgr Nkorgolo;
- 2.51 km of 100 mm and 150 mm secondary mains;
- 50.0 km of 50 mm and 80 mm service mains.
(d) construction of about 10 public standpipes with kiosks including
piping and meters and construction of about 4,100 metered
private connections; and
(e) consulting services for detailed design and for supervision of the
construction of the above mentioned works.
Vehicles and Maintenance Equipment
4.        The vehicles and maintenance equipment financed under the project
for the three cities would consist of:
- Four 7-ton trucks
- One mini-bus

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections of Regideso
Because of the high rate of inflation in Zaire, financial projections
have been prepared in dollars, using international inflation rates (para B).
A.   Income Statements
Sales Forecasts
The growth rate in water demand has been derived from the consultants'
projections for the three cities of the project and from Regideso's estimates
for the other towns in the country after discussions with the appraisal
mission. For the areas served by Regideso, estimated annual growth rates
until 1987 are:

Meter and connection revenues are assumed to increase with tariffs
and with new consumers, accruing at the average yearly rate of 3%.
Operating Expenses
Salaries and services increase with inflation (see B below). No
significant increase in personnel is planned. Materials increase with infla-
tion and half the increase in water sales, because part of their cost is
variable.

Depreciation
The rate of 3.6% adopted, calculated on the average of gross fixed
assets between the beginning and the end of the year, is the rate Regideso
uses. Regideso's detailed rates are:
- 2% for buildings
- 2.5% to 4% for water treatment plants and tanks
- 3% for water distribution networks
- 10% for equipment, meters and furniture
- 20% for vehicles
Interest
Regideso pays interest ranging from 4% to 8.5% on loans for the first
project and would pay the rate of interest at the time of Board presentation
on the loan onlent from IDA credit for the proposed project. This rate is
consistent with lending within the country to similar entities (para. 5.03).
Income Tax
Regideso does not pay income tax.
B.   Funds Flow Statements and Balance Sheets
Construction Program
The amounts for the proposed project are the estimates of the
appraisal mission. The other amounts including inflation as given below are
also given in the table at the end of this annex.
Assets
Assets have been revalued each year at the international inflation
rates used in the forecasts of 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983 through 1988.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are assumed to be equivalent to five months of
water revenues in 1982 and four months of water revenues thereafter.
Inventories and Accounts Payable
Inventories and accounts payable are assumed to grow at the same
rate as expenses for material.
Long-Term Debt
Details are given in the debt statement schedule. The onlending
rate of the IDA Credit is _%, 1/ the amortization period is 30 years includ-
ing a five-year grace period.
