1. SECTORAL CONTEXT
A. General
1.01     The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina (BiH) is located in
the western part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) and
has common boundaries with the Socialist Republics of Serbia, Montenegro and
Croatia. The population and the area of BiH is about 4.1 million (1981) and
51,129 km2 or 18% of Yugoslavia's total population and 20% of Yugoslavia's
total area. The capital of BiH is Sarajevo, and Tuzla is located some 100 km
northeast of Sarajevo.
B. Sector Data
1.02     The Federal Commission for Water Management is responsible for
establishing the basic framework for the maintenance of water quality within
the country. Commissions for Water Management in each Republic coordinate
water resource development and establish stream classification criteria.
Water quality standards for drinking water are established by the Commission
of Health. The Republic of BiH issued regulations in 1967, 1968 and 1969
concerning the "Protection of Waters, Classification of Waters, and
Categorization of Streams." The regulations, which were updated in 1978,
define measures to limit the release of harmful materials into the waterways
and provide for construction of facilities to process wastewater and reduce
pollution. Four classes of waterways were established in accordance with the
purpose for which the water is intended. Class I and IV, at each end of the
spectrum, represent clean, unpolluted water and highly polluted water
respectively.
1.03     Increasing attention is being paid in Yugoslavia to the problem of
water pollution and to the question of integrated development of water
resources. The authorities preserve and enhance the quality of their inland
and coastal waters by the construction of flow regulating and pollution
control structures and wastewater treatment facilities.
1.04     Individual communes 1  are responsible for the provision of water
supply and sewerage services and for this purpose in the large urban centers
local self-management enterprises have been established usually designated as
"Vodovods." These financially autonomous enterprises operate under
Yugoslavia's self-management principles and their investment programs and
tariffs are subject to control by the communes.
1/ The Commune or municipality in Yugoslavia is an administrative area
normally covering a town and its surrounding rural communities. It has an
Assembly and an Executive Council.



-2 -
1.05     The financing of specific community water supply and sewerage
projects is mainly at the communal and Vodovod levels with considerable
dependence upon voluntary contributions from the workers and the enterprises,
and from water and sewerage tariffs. Republic funds are also made available
in varying amounts, as well as Federal funds at concessional terms to finance
projects in the less developed areas of Yugoslavia.
1.06     Growing urbanization and industrialization have, in some areas,
caused severe air pollution problems and air pollution control has been given
increased priority. Responsibility for preventive and corrective actions
rests with the Republics and the communes.
C.  Bank Role in the Sector
1.07     Bank involvement in the water supply and sewerage and air pollution
sectors in Yugoslavia was initiated in 1971, and has continued through the
following projects:
Loan                                                      Amount           Date of
Number                Title                             (US$ Million)       Signing

2055    Kosovo Water Supply Project                       41.0            12/14/81
1.08     The Ibar, Metohija and Macedonia Projects include community water
supply, irrigation and power generating elements. The Morava Project covers
municipal water supply and sewerage systems, and also includes comprehensive
studies on water quality, flood hazards and regional development. The
Dubrovnik and Sarajevo Projects concentrate on the provision of community
water supply and wastewater disposal facilities and on reduction of Sarajevo
air pollution through construction of a gas-fired central heating system. The
Kosovo Water Supply Project provides water to two communes through a newly
developed regional water authority. The Bank is also assisting in the
preparation of a pollution control project in the Titova Mitrovica area of
Kosovo; the project includes water supply, sewerage, solid waste collection,



central heating and air pollution control. In addition to substantial
financial participation in these projects, the Bank has actively assisted the
Borrowers in project development and implementation as well as in the
establishment of new institutions and in the preparation of appropriate
financial strategies. Previous experience from project execution has
generally been favorable.
D. Bank Strategy
1.09     Lending in the sector is in accordance with Bank country policy for
Yugoslavia and has primarily focussed on the less-developed republics. In
doing so, the Bank is able to assist SFRY in its policy of meeting basic needs
through improving health and environmental conditions.

II. POPULATION, SECTOR SERVICES AND DEMAND IN PROJECT AREA
A. Project Area
2.01     The project area covers the Tuzla region.  The town of Tuzla is
located in the northeastern part of BiH where the southeastern slopes of the
Majevica mountain descend into the fertile valley of the Spreca River. Tuzla
and its surroundings are among the most densely populated and heavily
industrialized areas in Yugoslavia due, in part, to the availability of raw
materials such as salt, lignite and limestone and also to the development of
thermal power. The Tuzla master plan area regarding water supply covers the
town of Tuzla and the following six surrounding municipalities!/ Lukavac,
Banovici, Zivinice, Lopare, Srebrenik and Kalesija (Map IBRD 16531).
2.02     Because of excessive salt solution mining, the center of Tuzla is
subsiding (Map IBRD 16532), which in some areas has reached up to 10 m and
most buildings and infrastructural works have been damaged or destroyed.  Ten
thousand people have already been relocated, and an additional 15,000 will be
relocated over the next five years. The Tuzla area is also facing increasing
environmental problems of water shortages and river pollution, aggravated by
significant industrial effluents, and of air pollution mainly caused by the
large number of lignite-burning facilities used for heating purposes.
2.03     In order to address the subsiding phenomenon, a master plan for the
rehabilitation and development of the Tuzla municipality has been prepared. A
first stage program to be executed during 1981-1986 includes the following
components. (i) development of an. area of about 50 ha for the relocation of
about 15,000 inhabitants on the western side of Tuzla, including the provision
of infrastructure and public utilities; (ii) re-development of the central
part of Tuzla (the subsided area) into a civic and cultural center; and (iii)
construction of a central heating system to serve new and subsequent housing
developments. The salt solution mining will gradually be phased out, and
geological stability will be restored.
2.04     The Jala river, which flows through Tuzla and is a tributary of the
Spreca river, is heavily polluted by domestic and industrial wastes. The flow
is characterized by significant fluctuations and a low flow rate (Q 95%) of
only about 90 l/sec.2/  A UNDP/WHO study (Phase I) entitled "Investigation
1/ These are subsequently referred to as "the six municipalities."
2/ This indicates that such a flow or lower prevails 5% of the time.



into the Reduction of the Jala River Pollution" was completed in 1980, and was
followed by a Phase II study "Reduction of the Water Pollution in the Spreca
River Basin" completed in 1982.
2.05     The Phase I Study defined the problems resulting from the discharge
of municipal and industrial wastewaters into the Jala river and established
alternative methods for pollution reduction. The Phase II study provided
specific advice on pre-treatment requirements for industrial effluents and on
treatment for domestic and industrial wastes for Tuzla. A review was also
made of minimum flow requirements (para. 2.11) in the Spreca river for
maintaining an acceptable water quality standard with regard to downstream
uses of water.
B. Population Projections
2.06     Population projections as prepared by the Tuzla Institute of
Economics through the year 2020 are as follows:

2.09     The Tuzla water supply is based on:  (i) three wells with a combined
production capacity of 21,600 m3/day located in the area of StuSari; and
(ii) four wells with a combined production capacity of 17,280 m /day located
in the area of Toplica (Map IBRD 16531). The water from the Toplica source is
allocated to Tuzla, Lukovac and Zivinice in the quantities 9,072 m3/day
(53%), 4,320 m3/day (25%), and 3,888 m3/day (22%) respectively. In the
area of Spreca Polje, four wells have recently been constructed with a
combined yield of about 11,300 m3/day but these have so far not been
developed since the water contains excessive iron and manganese. There is no
potential for any further ground water development in the area. Water supply
available for the Tuzla municipality totals 30,672 m3/day which is
distributed as follows: domestic consumption (39%), industrial/commercial
consumption (30%), and unaccounted-for (31%)1/.
2.10     The existing water supplies in the six municipalities are all based
on spring or ground water. The maximum per capita water availability for
Tuzla (about 126 l/d) and the six municipalities (average about 90 l/d) is
generally very low and, particularly during the summer season, below the
actual demand which has resulted in intermittent supply.
2.11     The water supply for major industries depends on the Modrac
reservoir, located some 18 km from Tuzla. The available flow rate from the
Modrac reservoir is 7 m3/sec, of which 4.7 m3/sec is allocated for
downstream users and for maintaining acceptable water quality in the Spreca
river; and the remaining 2.3 m3/sec (198,720 m3/day) is allocated to
industrial water supply. This flow rate is sufficient for the time being, but
would have to be increased to meet the demand from ongoing industrial
development including a proposed second thermal power plant to be located in
the neighborhood of Zivinice about 20 km from Tuzla.
2.12     The sewage system mainly covers high density areas with holding and
septic tanks more prevalent in fringe areas. The system is combined for
sanitary sewage and storm water, and only recently have separate sanitary
sewers started to be laid. The domestic and industrial effluents are
discharged into the Jala river at a number of outfall points, which
particularly during low flows (para. 2.04) create a severe pollution
situation. The objectives for the Jala and the Spreca rivers are to reduce
the pollution levels to at least initially satisfy the characteristics of a
Category III river (para. 1.02).
2.13     The air pollution in the Tuzla area is basically caused by
lignite-burning heating boilers, and the lack of flue cleaning devices.
During the winter season air inversion also often occurs. The air pollution
frequently exceeds acceptable levels, causing a high incidence of respiratory
diseases (para. 6.03).
1/ Unaccounted-for water is the difference between water produced and water
sold. It includes inaccuracies in water metering, non-metered water used
at public hydrants and leakages.



- 8 -
2.14     In Tuzla town (excluding suburban areas), there are at present about
110 boiler houses and a large number of individual coal burning facilities
serving 79% of the total population; the remaining 21% are served through
electric heating (Annex 1, Table 2). The lignite presently used as fuel is
being depleted in the area and would gradually have to be replaced by a
lignite with an even higher sulphur content, which would, if no actions were
taken, further deteriorate the air quality.
D. Demand for Services
2.15     The water supply demand (average day), in the Tuzia Region through
the year 2020, with major industries accounted-for separately (para. 2.11),
has been projected as follows (Annex 1, Table 1, shows more comprehensive

The domestic consumption has been based on an assumed average per capita
demand by 2020 of 150 l/d in Tuzla and 110 l/d in the six municipalities.  The
projected (2005) respective shares of domestic, industrial/commercial and
unaccounted-for water requirements in the total water used are 42%, 33%, and
25% for Tuzla municipality and 47%, 33% and 20% for the six municipalities.
2.16       For Tuzla and the six municipalities the projected average day
water demand by 1985 (excluding major industries) exceeds the present
production capacity by 34%; the corresponding percentage for major industries
is 7%. Any delay in the extension of water production and distribution
facilities would impede the development of the Tuzla region.
2.17       The population served by sewer connections in Tuzla and the six
municipalities are projected to increase as follows:

2.18     If no action is taken on sewage disposal, water pollution will
gradually get worse because of increased population and industrial
development, which would make it increasingly difficult to maintain reasonable
and generally accepted environmental standards.
2.19     In order to reduce the health hazard in connection with high air
pollution levels, the Tuzla municipality has decided to gradually replace the
existing heating boilers with a central heating system based on the
circulation of hot water generated at the thermal power station located about
4 km from Tuzla and using lignite as fuel. The central heating system would
initially cover (i) areas presently under development mainly for absorbing
relocated people from subsided areas (Sjenjak 1); (ii) areas served by local
boiler stations (Sjenjak 2, Stupine and Usce); and (iii) scattered areas
served by boiler stations or individual facilities (Novi Grad and Skolski
Center) (Map IBRD 16532). The corresponding energy demand for these areas is
estimated at 140 MW, and another 160 MW would be required for subsequent
extensions.

III. ThE PROJECT
A. Genesis
3.01     The master plan for the rehabilitation and the development of the
Tuzla municipality (para. 2.03) identified future infrastructure
requirements. The UNDP/WHO studies (Phase I) provided the groundwork for the
establishment of pollution control standards within the Spreca River Catchment
Area. On the above basis, World Bank missions explored possible alternatives
for Bank assistance and agreed with BiH and Tuzla officials that the Bank
would concentrate its support on regional water supply development and
environmental rehabilitation.
3.02     During the preparation of the project the following studies were
undertaken:
(a) feasibility study for the development of a regional water supply
system for Tuzla and its six surrounding municipalities (prepared
by Energoinvest, local consultant);
(b) UNDP/WHO Phase II study, including a complete feasibility report
for Tuzla wastewater disposal, with preparation of tender
documents for the sewage treatment works (prepared by DHV, Dutch
consultant);
(c) engineering study on central heating system with preparation of
tender documents for major facilities (prepared by Janko Lisjak,
local consultant); and
(d) studies on air pollution and related health impact (prepared by
KOMPRED, the project entity).
During the preparation of the regional water supply system, it was, however,
decided, because of financial constraints, to phase its implementation with
only a minor portion to be constructed in a first phase. The second phase
(Phase II) would then be executed during 1986-1989 (Map IBRD 16531)
B. Project Objectives
3.03     The project would cover about 73% of the projected water supply,
sewerage and sewage disposal and central heating combined investments during
the project implementation period 1982-1987; the remaining 27% representing
investments for the second phase of the regional water supply system. Its
objectives would be:



- 11 -
(a) to reduce present and expected water shortages by the extension
of a first phase of the regional water supply system, thus
enabling the community and industrial development to proceed as
envisaged;
(b) to improve the environmental conditions in the Spreca river basin
through provision of primary and secondary treatment for domestic
and industrial effluents for the Tuzla municipality;
(c) to reduce the health hazards through the reduction of air
pollution;
(d) to improve the institutional capacity in project preparation and
implementation, works operation and maintenance, and financial
management by the development of existing organizations; and
(e) to assure financial self-sufficiency through adequate water
supply, sewerage and central heating charges.
3.04     The project would constitute a first phase in the development of the
regional water supply system in the Tuzla area, in the pollution reduction and
control in the Spreca river basin and in the creation of a healthier living
environment.
C. Technological Aspects
3.05     For the regional water supply development two potential water sources
have been investigated, the Modrac reservoir (para. 2.11) and the Krivaja
river (Map IBRD 16531). The capacity of the Modrac reservoir could be
extended by an additional 216,000 m3/day (2.5 m3/sec) by raising the
overflow weir, which would bring the total quantity available for water supply
purposes to 414,720 m3/day (4.8 m3/sec). This would approximately
correspond to the projected industrial water demand by the year 2000 (para.
2.15). The catchment area for the Modrac impoundment which cannot readily be
protected, is subject to domestic, industrial and agricultural pollution.
This would, however, be of less concern for industrial water supply, requiring
lower water standards than for domestic use. An economic/technical evaluation
has concluded that the Modrac reservoir, and its possible future extension
should continue to be used for major industrial water supply while the Krivaja
river should be developed mainly for municipal water supply.
3.06     The development of the Krivaja river, (Phase II), would require
regulation through an impoundment in order to maintain minimum flow
requirements for downstream users. Alternatives have been evaluated for all
project components such as location of dam, treatment works and storage tanks
and alignments for tunnel and transmission mains. The water would initially
flow by gravity to Tuzla, and pumping would only be required at a later stage
with increasing water demand.



- 12 -
3.07     The implementation of the proposed regional water supply system will
be deferred (para. 3.02), but in order to relieve the immediate water
shortages, the Spreca Polje ground water source (para. 2.09) will be developed
on a temporary basis with a treatment plant to be installed for iron and
manganese removal. The water from this source will be conveyed to the
existing Spreca pumping station for further pumping to Tuzia and possibly also
to Lukavac and Zivinice, by using existing, or under the regional water supply
system, proposed transmission mains and storage tanks. The bulk of the works
to be executed will then form an integrated part of the future regional water
supply system.
3.08     Studies for the sewage interceptors have considered alternative
arrangeme ts such as separate mains or a combined main for industriall/ and
domestic2/ flows and operation of the mains under gravity (pumping at
treatment works) or pressure (no pumping at treatment works) conditions.
Separate mains and mains under pressure have been found to be most
economical. Effluent standards for industrial wastes have been established,
and industries, where required, will provide their own pretreatment facilities.
3.09     Comparative studies, taking into account economic as well as
operational reliability and flexibility aspects, have been carried out on (i)
separate or combined secondary treatment for industrial and domestic sewage;
(ii) extended aeration or activated sludge processes; and (iii) aerobic or
anaerobic sludge mineralization. The most feasible solution has been found to
be combined treatment with the activated sludge process for secondary
treatment, and with the surplus sludge being oxidized through extended
aeration.
3.10     Possible alternatives for heating systems would be (i) to maintain
the existing system of lignite-burning boilers; (ii) to convert these to
oil or to extend electric heating; and (iii) to utilize the hot water
available at the thermal power plant. The use of oil, which is imported, is
for this purpose prohibited by law, and the overall available electricity
would not be sufficient on a long-term basis. Neither would it be acceptable
to maintain and expand the present system wihich does not meet the objectives
of improved health and living conditions. Polluted air also has a corrosive
and deteriorating effect on building materials and metal surfaces. The
upgrading of existing systems, with the installation of high stacks and flue
cleaning devices, would be neither practical nor economical.
1/ Chemical industries only.
2/ Includes industrial effluents except those from the chemical industries.



- 13 -
3.11     The thermal power plant, which at present has a capacity of 830 MW,
will be extended by one 100 MW unit to be commissioned by about 1990. Two of
the existing units (100 MW and 200 MW) will be adapted to produce steam and
hot water for industrial and heating purposes as will the future unit. The
ultimate hot water requirement would correspond to an energy output of about
300 MW. The hot water from the power station will be circulated through a
primary pipeline system, and the heat will be transferred at substations
through heat exchangers to water circulated in secondary pipeline systems
which will serve groups of apartments and houses. Different solutions have
been evaluated with regard to temperature levels, kinds of pipe material and
the number and location of substations. In particular the water temperature
in the primary distribution system would be 150°C with 900C in the return
main; corresponding temperatures in the secondary system would be 900C and
700C respectively.
3.12     The phasing and design data for the various project components may be
summarized as follows:
(a) the master plan for the regional water suppli system would
initially call for a capacity of about 1.6 m /sec, which
together with existing production capacity, would be sufficient
for the projected water demand by the year 2010. The proposed
immediate extension of the water supply system would, regarding
the water source and treatment works, have a capacity of 0.13
m3/sec. which would enable coverage of projected average water
demand of Tuzla, Lukavac and Zivinice to about the year 1987.
(b) the sewage interceptor is designed for four times the average dry
weather flow (ADWF) or 1.2 m3/sec, which would be sufficient
for the flow projected by 2005; this would imply only limited
overflows to the Jala river during periods of rain;
(c) the sewage treatment works will ultimately have a capacity of 1.3
m3/sec (primary treatment) and 0.8 m3/sec (secondary
treatment), which would take care of the flow projected by 2005.
Construction of certain components will be phased to mid-1990; and
(d) the primary pipeline system for central heating is designed for a
demand equivalent of 300 MW, which would be sufficient through
2005, while the secondary pipeline system and substations would
be extended under the sub-project to cover only a heating demand
equivalent of 140 MW.
3.13     Alternatives selected and various project components recommended for
implementation represent the most feasible least cost solutions at discount
rates of 10 and 12%. The proposed phasing of the various project components
and the design criteria used are appropriate.



- 14 -
D.  Project Composition and Description of Project Components
3.14     Tne project would include the following major components:
(a) development of the first stage of a regional water supply system
which ultimately would cover Tuzla, and its six surrounding
municipalities (paras. 2.01 and 3.12(a));
(b) development of an existing ground water source with provision of
a treatment plant;
(c) extension of sewage collection and sewage disposal works for the
Tuzla municipality;
(d) development of a central heating system for the Tuzla
municipality;
(e) operation and maintenance equipment for the water supply,
sewerage and central heating systems, and for a sanitary landfill;
(f) consultant assistance for project management and construction
supervision, and for the next stage water supply system
development; and
(g) tariff study and training.
The extension of water distribution and sewage networks systems of Tuzla forms
a part of the development program but is only partly included in the project;
the remaining part will be financed by developers, consumers and through
internal cash generation (para. 5.15).
3.15     The water supply component would consist of:  (a) ground water
pumping plant; (b) treatment plant for iron and manganese removal; (c) treated
water pumping plant to be located in the existing Spreca pumping station; (d)
transmission mains to Tuzla (total length 15 km) and extension of the
distribution systems; (e) tunnel (length 0.5 km); and (f) balancing reservoir
at Si Selo (capacity 4,000 m3).
3.16     The sewerage and sewage disposal component would be composed of:  (a)
interceptors 5.0 km and extension of the sewerage systems; (b) sewage
treatment works for secondary treatment; and (c) outfall main 0.2 km.
3.17     The domestic (max. 4,255 m3/hr by 2005) and industrial (chemical
industries only) (max. 350 m3/hr by 2005) effluents would be treated
separately at the primary treatment stage, which would include aerated grit
chambers and settling tanks. The industrial effluent would also be partly
decarbonated because of its excessive lime content. The domestic effluent
would be subject to primary treatment for four times average dry weather flow
(ADWF) and for secondary treatment for 1.5 times ADWF while the total



- 15 -
industrial effluent would be subject to secondary treatment. The combined
flow, domestic (max. 2,688 m3/hr) and industrial (max. 350 m3/hr), would
then be biologically treated in activated sludge tanks followed by secondary
settling tanks. The sludge, after extended aeration, would be disposed of
together with the ash slurry from the thermal power station to a landfill site
for industrial waste. The treated effluent, which has to comply with a
standard of BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand).!  of less than 20 mg/l and SS
(Suspended Solids) of less than 30 mg/l, would then be discharged into the
Jala river.
3.18     The central heating system would be composed of:  (a) primary mains
(length 10 km); (b) equipment for about 90 substations for which the civil
works are not included in the sub-project because they are executed by
building developers or where structures already exist, these are being used;
(c) secondary mains (length 23 km); and (d) a hot water pumping plant to be
located within the thermal-power station compound. The Tuzla municipality has
recently provided for a new landfill site, and as a supplement to existing
equipment a new compactor will be procured.
E. Cost Estimates

- 16 -
3.20     The cost estimates are mainly based on (i) for the water supply
component, preliminary engineering; (ii) for the sewerage component, detailed
engineering; (iii) for the sewage treatment works component, preliminary
engineering; and (iv) for the central heating component contract prices for
the primary main and for the remainder, preliminary engineering. The base
costs are at December 1982 price levels. Physical contingencies have been
assumed to vary between 8 and 15% for various components with an average of
about 11%. From preliminary to final engineering no major modifications are
expected in the design and related cost estimates of the project components.
3.21     The price contingencies for both civil works and material and
equipment when calculated in US Dollars have been estimated assuming annual
price increases of 7.5% for 1983-85 and 6% thereafter, and correspondingly
when calculated in Dinars, 20% for 1983, 15% for 1984 and 13% thereafter.
3.22     The costs for project management and construction supervision and for
subsequent stage of engineering for water supply development (para. 3.28) are
estimated at about US$6.1 million equivalent and would cover about 800 and 130
man-months for local and foreign consultants respectively. These estimates
are based on average total cost per man-month of US$2,000 equivalent for
local, and US$10,000 equivalent for foreign consultants (1982 price level)
including subsistence allowances.
3.23     The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$25.45 million
equivalent. This reflects assumptions made regarding goods to be imported,
civil works contracts to be awarded to foreign and local contractors and the
average foreign cost component of locally manufactured material and
equipment.    The Bank loan would cover the foreign exchange requirements,
amounting to US$30.00 million, including interest during construction and the
front-end fee.
F. Project Implementation
3.24     KOMPRED (para. 4.03) would be responsible for project implementation
and for operation and maintenance of the water supply, sewerage, sewage
disposal and central heating systems. The water distribution and the sewage
network systems in the six municipalities would be the responsibility of the
respective municipalities.
3.25     The present status of project preparation can be summarized as
follows: (a) final engineering design is being prepared for the water supply
component which together with remaining geophysical and soil surveys would be
completed by early 1983; (b) final engineering design and tender documents
have been prepared for the interceptors; (c) engineering design and tender
documents for equipment supply and civil works have been prepared for the
sewage treatment works; and (d) final engineering design and tender documents
have been prepared for the main part of the central heating system.



- 17 -
3.26     For the sewage treatment works separate contracts would be awarded
for civil works and equipment supplies, and the design for the civil works
would be finalized after a decision has been made on the equipment supply
contracts.
3.27     During project implementation, KOMPRED would be assisted by
engineering consultants for (i) tender evaluation and preparation of contract
documents; (ii) review of contractors drawings; (iii) finalization of detail
design for water supply and sewage treatment works; and (iv) supervision of
construction works and material and equipment supply and installation.  The
consulting services would be provided by (i) ZAVOD (para. 4.02) for the
central heating component with subcontracting to the Institute for Steel
Construction and Material for equipment quality control; and (ii) local
consultant with foreign consultant assistance for the water supply and sewage
disposal components. KOMPRED's own staff would supervise the construction
works for the interceptors. For the central heating component the consultant
has already been appointed, while for the water supply and sewage disposal
components, a contract would be entered into under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank (Chart 1). Assurances to this effect were obtained
from KOMPRED at loan negotiations.
3.28     KOMPRED would appoint a local consultant with foreign consultant
assistance (Chart 1) for subsequent stage water supply development under terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank. This consultant and the one proposed
under para. 3.27 will be employed in accordance with the Bank "Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants" (August 1981). The consultant work which will be
reviewed by the Bank, would include (i) elaboration of a master plan for
industrial water supply in the Tuzla area; (ii) updating of the master plan
for the Krivaja river water source development; and (iii) final engineering
with preparation of tender documents with related field investigations for
proposed regional water supply system. Assurances to this effect were
obtained from KO4PRED at loan negotiations.
3.29     A master bar chart for project implementation has been completed and
detailed CPM networks for individual contracts will be prepared by respective
contractors. An outline project implementation schedule is shown on Chart 2.
A project monitoring and reporting system including selected financial
performance indicators (Annex 1, Table 5) as well as the timing for its
implementation was discussed and agreed upon during project appraisal.
3.30     Land acquisition and right-of-ways have been completed for the
sewerage and central heating components and are expected to be finalized by
early 1983 for the water supply component, for which no difficulties are
foreseen.
3.31     During negotiations assurances were obtained from KOMPRED that within
six months following the closing date of the loan it will prepare and submit
to the Bank a project completion report covering the planned objectives and
achievements of the project including the costs and benefits and performance
of all entities associated with project execution and the operation of the
systems.



- 18 -
G. Procurement
3.32     Proposed contracts and their respective cost estimates are shown in
Annex 1, Table 6. Equipment supply contracts estimated to cost more than
US$350,000 and civil works contracts estimated to cost more than US$1,000,000
will be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with
Bank Group guidelines. Other equipment supply and civil works contracts with
an aggregate cost not exceeding US$2,500,000 and US$6,000,000 respectively
would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures, which
are satisfactory.  Contracts to be subject to ICB would represent about 85% of
total project costs. For material and equipment procured under ICB a domestic
preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower would be used for
purposes of bid evaluation. The Bank would review all documents for those
contracts to be subject to ICB.
3.33     It is anticipated that foreign suppliers will be awarded the
contracts for the water supply and sewage treatment plants. For other project
components experience has shown that Yugoslav suppliers and contractors are
extremely competitive and may win most of the contracts.
H. Disbursements
3.34     Statistical evidence in the Bank shows that disbursements for the
water supply sector in the EMENA region extend over an eight year period while
countrywide disbursements extend over seven and a half years. Overall
completion of the proposed project is scheduled for December 31, 1987 and
taking into account the status of project preparation and the relative
efficiency of the implementing agency it is reasonable to assume that the loan
will be fully disbursed one year after completion of the project, i.e., by
December 31, 1988. A forecast of disbursements is shown in Annex 1, Table 7.
3.35     The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million would be disbursed as
follows;
Amount            % of
US$ Million    Expenditures
Category     Description                          Equivalent    to be Financed

equipment, supplies and                           expenditures and
installation                                       70% of local
expenditures
2         Civil Works                               5.75      100% of foreign
expenditures and
30% of local

(civil works and equipment) and substations (equipment only). Tender
documents and evaluation reports have been reviewed by the Bank.
Advertisement was made in the Development Forum and bids were invited
according to ICB and the Bank procurement procedures. Retroactive financing
would be provided for an amount of up to US$3.0 million equivalent which could
also include consultant services for an amount less than US$50,000
equivalent. Disbursements would be fully documented.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AND OPERATING AGENCY
A. Background Data
4.01     The "Work Organization of Water Management of Bosnia and Hercegovina"
is responsible for the coordination of water sources development and water
pollution control in BiH, with its "Basic Organization of Associated Labor
(BOAL) of Water Management, 'Spreca' Tuzla" in charge of the Spreca river
catchment area to be extended to also include the Krivaja river. The latter
organization has constructed and presently operates the Modrac reservoir
(para. 3.05).
4.02     In the Tuzla municipal structure, the Town Assembly is the central
authority with delegates elected from various activities in the society. The
Executive Council is the executive arm of the Town Assembly, while the
Municipal Institute for Construction-Tuzla (ZAVOD) is responsible for the
coordination of all development activities in the municipality.
4.03     "KOMPRED," the proposed borrower for the Tuzla project, is an
umbrella organization functioning as an autonomous entity and is composed of
one administrative entity and seven financially and functionally independent
operating entities called Basic Organizations of Associated Labour (BOALS)
(Para. 4.06). In September 1981 KOMPRED's BOALS for water supply/sewerage and
central heating requested KOMPRED to borrow funds from the Bank and other
lenders in order to carry out the proposed project and stated that they (the
BOALS) would provide debt service coverage. KOMPRED accepted the BOALS'
request and copies of these documents have been received by the Bank. KOMPRED
reports to the Executive Council and its budget and tariffs are approved by
the Town Assembly. Also located in Tuzla is the "Work Organization, Research
and Education in Chemical and Process Industry," which through its "Institute
of Chemical Engineering" is involved in pollution control and in specifying
quality standards for industrial effluents and related pre-treatment
requirements.
4.04     Tuzla and the six municipalities have for the development of a
regional water supply system entered into a social agreement signed April 14,
1977 by the Presidents of the respective Town Assemblies. This agreement
refers mostly to the second stage of construction, but the detailed
engineering for its execution will be provided under this project.
B. Organization and Management
4.05     The highest decision-making body for KOMPRED is the Workers' Council,
which is elected by the Assembly of Workers. This Council elects the
Executive Board and appoints the General Manager who is responsible for the
day-to-day operation of the enterprise. The General Manager serves for a
period of four years and may be reappointed for one additional four-year term.



- 21 -
4.06     The KOMPRED organizational structure, as established on January 1,
1978 is shown on Chart 2. The administrative entity and the BOALS are dealing
with: (i) water supply and sewerage; (ii) central heating; (iii)
construction; (iv) community services; (v) insect and rodent control; (vi)
street cleaning and solid waste; and (vii) parks and public places. BOALS (i)
and (ii) have units for project planning and design, works operation and
maintenance and revenue collection. BOAL (iii) handles minor construction
works for KOMPRED and also for third parties. BOAL (iv) operates the water
distribution system in Zivinice, which may be extended to other
municipalities. The function of sewage disposal would be integrated under
BOAL (i). The administrative entity handles such matters as personnel,
payroll, billing and legal matters for all of the BOALS.
4.07     For project implementation a special Working Community Development
and Investments-Tuzla for project management has been established within
KOMPRED containing separate units for water supply, sewage disposal and
central heating. The major functions of this Working Community would be, with
consultant assistance, to review tender documents, enter into contracts, and
to coordinate and manage the construction supervision and equipment supply and
installation.
4.08     The "Water Management (BOAL) Spreca Tuzla" will closely coordinate
the development of the Krivaja water source. KOPRED will be assisted by the
"Institute of Chemical Engineering (BOAL)" in matters regarding water
pollution control and the execution of the sewage treatment works.
C. Staffing and Training
4.09     KOMPRED's present staff consists of 824 employees of which 190 are in
the BOAL for Water Supply and Sewerage (about 8.5 employees/1,000 water
connections) and 98 in the BOAL for central heating. All positions are filled
and for the time being no additional staff would be required. Upon completion
of the project KOMPRED envisages assigning about 35 staff members for the
operation and maintenance of the water and sewage treatment works and
transmission mains. The existing staff is well qualified; staff morale is
high, and turnover is negligible.
4.10     Training under the project would concentrate on strengthening the
operational capacity particularly for water and sewage treatment works and
central heating systems. Training would be provided by the equipment
suppliers who would conduct pertinent training courses for selected staff
members. Staff would also participate in equipment installation and obtain
on-the-job training during the commissioning periods.
D. Accounting, Billing and Collection
4.11     KOMPRED uses the standard Yugoslav chart of accounts and financial
statement formats. While differences do exist between certain accounting
treatment under the Yugoslav system and that commonly accepted in



- 22 -
international circles, transformation of the financial data to the format used
by the Bank for public utility analysis is relatively straightforward.
KOMPRED has computerized all accounting activities and maintains separate
internal accounts to segregate revenues and expenditures between its seven
operating BOALS, and a basis for distributing the common administrative costs,
which is satisfactory to the Bank. KOMPRED has already established separate
accounts to segregate the project expenditures from those incurred by
KOMPRED's other BOALS. Agreement was obtained at negotiations that KOMPRED
will maintain its accounts in sufficient detail and will keep separate its
accounts for project activities.
4.12     Domestic water and sewerage customers are billed monthly by KOMPRED
based upon an estimate of their annual water consumption; settlement between
estimated billing and actual consumption is based upon an annual meter
reading. KOMPRED's industrial, commercial and institutional water and sewerage
consumers have their meters read monthly. Central heating billings are made
only during the heating season, October through March, and are based on a
monthly charge/m2 of area heated. Outstanding receivables for water supply
and sewerage represent less than one month's equivalent sales which is
considered very satisfactory. Receivables for central heating during December
1981, the middle of the heating season, represented less than 3% of the
previous season's billing, which is also considered satisfactory.
E. Audit
4.13     KOMPRED's financial statements are subject to the standard audit by
the Social Accounting Service (SDK). KOMPRED requested the special auditing
group of the SDK during February 1982 to be included in its special audit
program from 1982 onward. The audit under this program is performed in
accordance with internationally accepted standards. Assurances were obtained
at negotiations that (i) KOMPRED will, beginning in FY82, prepare annual
statements in the accepted public utilities format for its consolidated
operations and for the water supply/sewerage and central heating BOALS, and
will have these statements audited by SDK; and (ii) the audited statements
will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal
year.
G. Insurance
4.14     KOMPRED insures buildings, equipment and warehouse stocks against the
normal risks of fire and theft and carries third party liability coverage on
all vehicles. Employee accident insurance is provided under the national
plan. In addition, KOMPRED will insure against damage caused by accidental
rupture of the heating pipeline system. KOMPRED's insurance program is
adequate.

V. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
5.01     KOMPRED's seven operating departments (BOALS) (para. 4.06) are
self-contained units. The accounting system adequately segregates the assets
and liabilities and costs and revenues of each to measure individual
performance.
5.02     Five of the seven operating BOALS are not affected by the project:
(i) construction which generates 60-80% of its revenues from contracts with
third parties and 20-40% of its revenues from services to other BOALS;
(ii)street cleaning and solid waste collection and disposal which generates
50-70% of its revenues from tariffs, and 30-50% from town budget sources;
(iii) insect and rodent control which generates all its revenues from services
to third parties; (iv) cemeteries/parks/gardens which generate 70-90% of its
revenues from services to third parties and 10-30% from town budget sources;
and (v) the BOAL responsible for the operation of the water supply system in
Zivinice derives its revenues from tariffs.
5.03     The BOALS described above, have relatively minor long-term debt,
their projected capital expenditures' budgets are under US$1.0 million
equivalent per year, and all have been profitable during the three-year period
1979-1981. KOMPRED's consolidated financial statements for the years
1979-1981 are shown in Annex 1, Tables 8 and 9.
5.04     KOMPRED's two BOALS for Water Supply/Sewerage and Central Heating
derive their revenues primarilyl/ from tariffs which are authorized by the
Town Assembly. Water supply and sewerage revenues are based on metered water
usage. The meters are owned by KOMPRED and connection costs are charged to
the consumers. Heating service is not metered and revenues are based on both
the square meters of surface to be heated and the height of the ceiling (above
and below three meters), with connection costs to be paid separately. The
local law requires connection to the public system if one exists.
1/ The BOAL for Water Supply and Sewerage has historically generated from
30-40% of its total revenues from installation, repair, and cleaning
services provided to system customers; the BOAL for Central Heating
generates from 10-20% of its revenues in a similar fashion.



- 24 -
5.05     KOMPRED's past tariff and charge increases in project related
operating BOALS have been related to the unit cost of providing the service or
to the financial needs of the service. KOMPRED has had little difficulty in
raising loans in the past for its expansion programs, the largest of which was
a loan of Din. 120.0 million (US$1.8 million equivalent) for the Toplice water
supply development. Water Supply/Sewerage internal cash generation was 3.7
times debt service in 1980 and 3.9 times debt service in 1981, while Central
Heating was ten times in 1980 and also in 1981.
B. Tariffs
5.06     KOMPRED's requests for tariff adjustments for water supply, sewerage
and central heating form a part of its annual budget process, which when
approved by the Worker's Council are forwarded to the Town Assembly for review
and approval. Tariff increases for all services are routinely approved in
October of each year; such increases have averaged 25% per year since 1976
which has exceeded internal inflation. Exceptionally, water tariffs were
increased by 80% in 1980 when the debt service associated with the Toplica
water source (para. 5.05) began. Additional tariff increases, and/or other
charges were implemented in October 1981 which will meet the conditions of the
revenue covenant (para. 5.15) for 1983.
5.07     KOMPRED's existing tariff schedule is as follows:
Dinars
Water Supply
Domestic                                            6.01 /m3
Commercial/Industrial/Public Institutions          18.15 /m3
Bulk Water Supply (Zivinice)                       5.53 /m3
Bulk Water Supply (Lukavac)                        5.53 /m3
Sewerage
Domestic                                            1.85 /m3 of water

space
5.08     Tariffs for the three services projected in current prices are
presented in the following tablet

Water Supply Din/m3 (Average)         11.63 29.48  47.72  58.27   401.0         71.3
Sewerage Din/m3 (Average)             4.29 14.14  27.46  31.31   629.8         128.9

1/ Based on inflation rates of 30% (1982), 20% (1983), 15% (1984) and 13%
thereafter.
5.09     The above table demonstrates that there will be growth to all tariffs
in nominal terms; such growth is required to meet the expanded operating costs
and debt service which result from both expanded volume of operations and to
financing required for the construction program being undertaken. When
considered in real terms, the required growth in tariffs reflects primarily
the need for internal financing. The projected tariff rates are within the
paying capacity of a low income family.
5.10     Tuzla's present tariff structure (para. 5.07) indicates a certain
amount of cross-subsidization. However, because all tariffs are fixed
irrespective of the quantities used, a block tariff structure should be
considered to induce water conservation. For this purpose a tariff study to
be carried out in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank
will commence by March 1, 1984 with recommendations to be implemented by
January 1, 1985. Assurances to this effect were obtained from KOMPRED at loan
negotiations.
C. Financing Plan
5.11     A forecast of the sources and applications of funds for the project
related BOALS (para. 5.04) for the period 1979 through 1989 is in Annex 1,

Phase II - Regional Water Supply
Proposed Project Cost                            2,693.3      100.0
5.12     For the project, the proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million (Dinar
2,325.2 million), including front-end fee, and interest and charges during the
grace period would provide about 33% of the total financing required, and
100%  of the estimated foreign exchange cost.  The period of the loan would be
15 years final maturity including three years of grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
5.13     The balance of the proposed project financing plan consists of: (a)
internal cash generation (29% of total requirements) which the municipal
assembly has approved and which also provides substantial funding for the
Phase II water supply program; (b) grants and contributions (30.4% of total
requirements) which have been confirmed, and are contained in the 1981-1985
Five-Year Plan which has been approved by the BiH Republic Assembly and in
separate agreements which have been provided to the Bank; and (c) local bank
loans and advances (8% of total requirements) whose terms have been projected
to provide 12 years final maturity, three years of grace during which interest
is capitalized, carry an interest rate of 12% per annum, and are repaid under
the annuity (constant total payment) system. Privredna Banka has agreed to:
(a) provide KOMPRED with the local borrowings foreseen in the project
financing plan; (b) provide for cost overruns; and (c) provide for any
additional borrowings that might be required in the event that approved tariff
increases might be delayed due to Government price containment programs.
Regarding Phase II Regional Water Supply Project, final design forms part of
the proposed project (para. 3.14(f)), but construction execution (1986/1989)
is not. Financing for Phase II has not yet been identified and has been
projected on the basis of KOMPRED's assumption that 60% of financing
requirements would be generated through water surcharges and contributions,
and the remaining 40% through bank loans. Implementation of Phase II would be
subject to confirmation of appropriate resources (para. 5.16).

D. Future Performance
5.14     The financial statements for 1979 through 1989 for the water
supply/sewerage BOAL, and the central heating BOAL are in Annex 1, Tables 10
through 16 and the assumptions on which they were based are in Annex 2.
5.15     The projected changes in water supply/sewerage and central heating,
in current prices are illustrated in the following table:

I/ Value data is per cubic meter of water supplied.
Value data is per square meter of heated surface.
E/ £xciudes depreciation.
The projected increase in water supply volume by 1989 reflects only the
increase due to the proposed project; Phase II comes on stream in 1990.
Sewage volume reflects the addition to the system of the chemical industry
effluent when the treatment plant is completed in 1987. Central heating
volume in 1981 refers to the three existing plants while by 1989 it would
represent 50% of the capacity of the new system plus one of the three original
plants which will be taken out of service in 1990. The other two original
plants would be abandoned in 1985 and 1988. The increase in operating cost
per unit sold - in water supply and central heating - is less than the
projected cumulative internal inflation during the same period (230%). This
is achieved in water supply through a program to reduce unaccounted-for water,
while it is achieved in central heating by the new facilities which operate at
a lower unit cost than the existing ones. The substantial increase to
sewerage operating costs results from the introduction of a secondary sewage
treatment plant. Debt service fluctuates with the debt/equity financing of
the project elements: (i) 62% loans/38% equity for water supply; (ii) 50%
loans/50% of equity for sewerage; and (iii) 42% loans/58% equity for central
heating. The projected tariffs and other charges would provide adequate funds
for the two project related BOALS to meet all their obligations. During
negotiations, agreement was obtained that beginning FY83, KOMPRED will
implement tariffs and other charges to provide the water supply/sewerage and
central heating BOALS with adequate funds to cover: (i) all expenses of
operations, including employee compensation, administration and overhead
costs, maintenance, and taxes and other contributions required by law, but



- 28 -
excluding depreciation; (ii) all interest and other charges on debt and principal
repayments or depreciation, whichever is higher; (iii) all increases required
for adequate levels of working capital; and (iv) adequate financing for
subsequent year's investments in the Project. This financial discipline would
be monitored through annual reviews. During negotiations, agreement was
obtained from KOMPRED that the two project related BOALS will, three months
before the beginning of each fiscal year, provide the Bank with copies of
their proposed budget for such fiscal year and financial projections for the
following two years as well as their proposed tariff actions. In addition, in
order to ensure that KOMPRED's non-project related BOALS financial performance
will be satisfactory, agreement was obtained from KOMPRED during negotiations
that the financial operations of the non-project related BOALS will not be
allowed to affect the financial viability of the two project related BOALS.
5.16     The debt equity ratios of the project related BOALS peak in 1984 for
both Central Heating and Water Supply/Sewerage. The early peaking in Central
Heating results from 51.5% of the project cost being completed in 1983, thus
requiring debt financing early on in the project cycle. The early peaking in
Water Supply/Sewerage is of similar orgin. Debt service however, peaks in
1988, and coverage is forecast to be 1.9 for the water supply/sewerage BOAL
and 1.3 for the central heating BOAL. Agreement was obtained from KOMPRED at
negotiations that the project related BOALs will not, during the project
implementation period, incur any medium or long-term debt (other than for
carrying out the project) without the Bank's prior agreement.

VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Socio-Economic Analysis
6.01      The benefits accruing from the proposed sewage collection and
disposal system in the Tuzla region would be substantial but cannot be
meaningfully quantified. In assessing these benefits, the reduction of the
incidence of waterborne infectious diseases and of the pollution of waters
used for various purposes, improvements in the general aesthetic conditions
and in the quality of life, and the enhancement of opportunities for economic
development are all important factors.
6.02      The decision to develop a central heating system in Tuzla to replace
local lignite-burning facilities was primarily based on air pollution and
related health hazard considerations. Alternative energy sources were
evaluated but were not found to be feasible (para. 3.10). The degree of air
pollution with regard to sulphur dioxide, soot, dust and sediment was
measured in Tuzla during the period February 10-June 10, 1981. The resulting
report (para. 3.02(d)) indicates that on average the maximum allowable
concentration 1/ of sulphur dioxide was exceeded about 4% of the time
period; and in the case of soot about 56%. Furthermore as the survey period
covered less than half of the heating season, the results would be far more
unfavorable if the measuring had been done during the heating season only.
6.03      An analysis was also undertaken on the occurrence of respiratory
diseases directly related to prevailing air pollution during the period
1961-1980. The results may be summarized as follows: (i) respiratory
diseases have a typical seasonal characteristic with most cases occurring
during the winter; (ii) the number of respiratory diseases per 1,000
inhabitants in Tuzla has increased by 50% (1961-1980); and (iii) the incidence
of mortality from respiratory diseases is about 10% higher in Tuzla than the
average in BiH. The health benefits to be achieved from a reduction of the
air pollution level cannot be quantified but would be significant.
B. Average Long-Term Incremental Costs
6.04      The average long-term incremental costs in 1982 prices have been
calculated separately for water supply and sewerage and for central heating by
using a discount rate of 10%, which is appropriate for Yugoslavia.
1/ Based on WHO standards.

6.05      The calculation for the water supply and sewerage collection and
disposal systems which take into account production, distribution, collection
and disposal facilities through 2010 shows that beginning in 1987, average
revenues would be about 71% of the average long term incremental costs, and
commercial/industrial average revenues about 124% of the average long term
incremental cost. This, however, does not take into account the substantial
voluntary contributions which both the citizens and the enterprises will be
making towards project financing. The tariff study to be carried out under
the project (para. 5.10) will inter alia result in the adoption of progressive
tariffs. The higher block of the new tariff schedule would be at least equal
to the average long term incremental cost.
6.06      Upon completion of the project, the approved tariffs for central
heating would be about 46% higher than the average long-term incremental cost
while the commercial/industrial tariff would exceed it by about 133% (Annex 1,
Table 18). The high tariffs for central heating are meant to generate funds
for future investments.
C. Internal Rate of Return
6.07      The internal rate of return for the water supply and central heating
components have been calculated in constant prices using revenues and
contributions as a minimum measure of the economic benefits, a process which
excludes the additional obvious social, health and economic benefits to be
derived from the project.
6.08      For the water supply component, the minimum measure of the rate of
return is expected to be 10.9%. An increase in construction costs of 10% and
a reduction in demand of 10% would reduce the rate to about 8.8%. The minimum
measure of the central heating component rate of return is expected to be
13.1%. Since this component has major elements under contract, the
sensitivity analysis used was a 5% increase in construction costs with a 10%
decrease in demand, resulting in a rate of return of 9.2%. The sensitivity
analysis indicates that the project components are moderately sensitive to
price changes.

D. Project Merits and Justification
6.09     The merits and justification of the project may be summarized as
follows: (i) the project will, in the Tuzla Municipality alleviate the
present shortage of water supply and enable industrial development to proceed
as planned; (ii) the project constitutes a first step in the reduction of the
river pollution which is commensurate with overall objectives in environmental
improvements; (iii) the project will improve the health standard through
reduced air pollution and consequently contribute to better living conditions;
(iv) the project and its components are feasible first phase extensions of
respective master plans and are technically and economically least cost
solutions; (v) the investment costs per capita in current terms calculated for
the 1987 population are US$88 equivalent for water supply, US$129 for sewerage
and sewage disposal, and US$171 for central heating; these costs are
reasonable; (vi) the project will contribute to strengthening the
implementing agency and its cost recovery procedures; and (vii) the project
will during the construction period, provide about 2,500 man-years of local
employment.
E. Project Risks
6.10     A major project risk would relate to the possibilities of delays in
project implementation and for cost overruns which are normally associated
with any large civil works undertaking.
6.11     All necessary actions have been or will be taken for the timely
completion of the project such as thorough project preparation with soil
investigations, the establishment of project monitoring and coordinating
functions and the appointment of qualified staff or consultants for project
management and construction supervision. Therefore the risk of not achieving
the organizational, technical and financial objectives of the project would be
minor.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Agreement having been reached on the issues referred to in Chapters
III through VI of this report, the proposed project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$30.0 million to KOMPRED for a term of 15 years including a
three-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.

TUZLA REGION WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A.  Rates of Inflation
1.       All the financial projections are in current dinars.  The same rates
of inflation as used for capital investment costs (para. 3.21) have also been
used in estimating the operational and maintenance costs.
B. Income Statement
2.       Tariffs are consistent with the revenue covenant and were devised to
cover operating costs, the greater of debt service or depreciation, and
appropriate increases to working capital.
3.       Revenues generated from other service related functions such as
maintenance of the internal plumbing systems (water supply and central
heating), and the cleaning of internal sewerage systems have been forecast to
grow at one-half the rate of the increase in the volume supplied, collected or
heated.
4.       Projections of the costs of operation of each project component were
developed as follows:
(a) Water Supply: Additional staffing requirements, chemical, energy
and maintenance costs for the project component were developed by
KOMPRED staff. Existing unit production costs were held constant
(in real terms) while distribution costs varied with increased
volume. All costs have been adjusted for forecast internal
inflation.
(b) Sewerage: Costs were projected separately for the collection
system, and for the project treatment plant. The costs for
salaries, chemicals and maintenance have been forecast to
increase in accordance with volume, adjusted for internal
inflation.  For the treatment plant, salaries, chemical                         )
costs, and electric energy were developed from data in the
feasibility reports, and adjusted for internal inflation. Other
costs were forecast by Kompred personnel based upon engineering
and financial data.



Annex 2
Page 2 of 2
(c) Central Heating: Again, costs were developed for the new project
system and separately for the existing systems. New personnel
were added for maintenance of the new system, as well as
materials for that purpose. The cost of heated water to be
supplied by the thermoelectric power plant was taken from the
April 1982 contract for that service. Since the existing systems
were operating at full capacity in 1981, the costs for fuel,
transport of ashes, personnel and maintenance were simply
adjusted for internal inflation until 1985, when the cost of
operating the existing 5MW system was eliminated because the
boiler house was substituted by the new system; the remaining two
existing units were operated until 1989 (15MW system) and 1990
(32MW system) at which dates both cease operations. Other costs
were developed by Kompred personnel.
(d) Depreciation: Depreciation costs were developed on the basis of
global rates for existing systems and separately for the new
project systems as follows:
Water Supply       Sewerage       Central Heating
Existing Systems           3.5%/Year        2.0%/Year         4.5%/Year
New System                3.0%/Year         4.2%/Year         4.5%/Year
Secondary Network         3.0%/Year         2.0%/Year
C. Balance Sheet
5.       Fixed assets in Yugoslavia are revalued from time to time as directed
by the Federal Government. Interest has been capitalized during the
construction period.
6.       Inventories were related to chemical and maintenance material costs,
and represent approximately two months supply.
7.       Receivables.  Customers accounts were allowed to increase to two
months billing (water supply/sewerage) and one and one-half months billing
(central heating) and were then held at that level.
8.       Accounts Payable.  These were segregated into: (a) normal operating
payables (1 1/2 months of annual operating costs excluding depreciation); (b)
project related payables - one months construction costs - and retention
monies; and (c) payables specifically related to finance which were based upon
the terms of financing involved.
9.       Long-term debt.  In addition to the basic terms of the financing, the
foreign debt (IBRD and supplier credits) funds used were revalued in
accordance with the relationship between foreign and local inflation.
