MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TILE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A SECOND SHAANXI PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China for $210 million to help finance a Second Shaanxi Provincial
Highway Project. The loan would be a US dollar loan at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based single
currency loans, with a maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The proceeds of the Bank loan
would be made available to Shaanxi Province on the same terms. Shaanxi Province would bear the foreign
exchange risk.
2.           Country/Sector Background. China's economic development since the opening of its
economy in the late 1970s has resulted in a 9.5 percent average annual rate of economic growth. Key
facets of this growth are rapidly increasing domestic and foreign trade as well as increasing personal
mobility and consumption of energy (derived mainly from coal burning). These, in turn, have caused the
demand for transport and higher quality transport services to surge. Supply capacity, however, is
constrained and recognized as one of the most serious bottlenecks to future economic growth and
efficiency. In particular, motorization (including use of heavier trucks) is growing rapidly but road
transport, for historical reasons, has not been widely developed in much of China outside its cities. The
road network ranks among the sparsest in the world relative to geographic area or population and is quite
unsafe. Few expressways exist, and about 22 percent of rural communities have no all-weather vehicular
access of any kind. Governments at all levels have therefore embarked on a major highway investment
and improvement program.
3.           At the central level, the basic strategy is to develop a National Trunk Highway System
(NTHS) for the exclusive use of motorized vehicles, giving priority to two north-south and two east-west
corridors and to corridors serving border areas and cross-border trade. The Ministry of Communications
(MOC) has been developing the NTHS, consisting of 12 interprovincial trunk expressways spanning China
and totaling some 25,000 km. The Bank is already heavily involved in the construction of substantial
sections of the four priority corridors of the NTHS. At the provincial/regional level, the strategy is to
concentrate on network maintenance and the expansion and improvement of provincial and rural road
networks currently totaling more than I million km, to provide greater mobility and to stimulate
socioeconomic development, particularly in less-developed regions.
4.           On the road transport policy agenda, growing attention is being paid to removing
administrative and physical barriers to interprovincial trade and to redefining the Government's role in
transport in light of rapid administrative decentralization and growing non-state sector involvement.
MOC needs to be strengthened to carry out its reform mandate in matters such as finance, standards for
planning, design and operation of the NTHS. Provincial and municipal governments are expected to
continue to mobilize most investment resources required (including access to private investment and
capital markets) and to seek greater expenditure and system efficiency through improved highway planning
and investment strategies, as well as to modernize maintenance capacity and improve cost recovery. Local
governments are also expected to further the development of the road user services and road construction
industry through deregulation and promotion of competition, access to modern technology and better
management. The Bank has prepared a report (No. 11819-CHA dated February 1994), "CHINA: Highway
Development and Management Issues, Options and Strategies", which provides recommendations for
action in the foregoing areas and is the basis for the Bank Group assistance strategy in the sector.



- 2 -
5.           Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi, located in China's middle west, has an area of 205,000 sq km
and a population of 34 million. The province has three distinct zones: the Northern Shaanxi Plateau
which is rich in coal, natural gas and petroleum, making it an important base of energy resources for the
whole of China; the Guanzhong Plain which is the "locomotive" of the developing Shaanxi economy with
its dense population and solid industrial base; and the Southern Shaanxi Mountain Area which is less
populated but rich in mineral deposits and hydroelectric resources that need to be developed further.
Although the gross output value of agriculture and industry (GOVAI) increased at an annual rate of 11.7
percent between 1985 and 1993, Shaanxi's GNP per capita is about 32 percent below China's average, and
the Province has large areas of poverty. Shaanxi has the second largest number of officially designated
poor counties in China (50 out of 107) and the fifth largest poor population (5.0 million or 6.25 percent
of China's poor), 80 percent of whom live in two northern and three southern prefectures. Lack of
transport infrastructure is one of the factors behind the depressed economic conditions in these areas.
6.           Traffic growth in Shaanxi is high, particularly around the capital, Xian, with a population
of over 2.0 million. In 1994, highways accounted for 87 percent of the passengers, 32 percent of the
passenger-kilometers, 87 percent of the freight tons, and 18 percent of the ton-kilometers carried in
Shaanxi. The road network comprises about 39,000 km of which 31,000 are classified (classes I to IV).
The vehicle fleet included 237,400 trucks and 80,700 passenger cars and buses. Under the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (9FYP: 1996-2000) Shaanxi will continue to give priority to expanding, maintaining, and
strengthening the highway network; strengthening the sector institutions and training their labor force; and
improving the efficiency of road user services (trucking and passenger transport). However, limited
financial resources sharpen the need for better planning and prioritization of investments and for ensuring
that new and improved roads are not built at the expense of maintaining the existing network.
7.           The Province's Master Plan for Poor Areas (8-7 Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation 1994-
2000) has set as its goal to provide year round access to every poor township and 80 percent of the
villages in Shaanxi. The World Bank-assisted Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project (1989-1995)
contributed to the implementation of both the investment and poverty alleviation plans by supporting
construction of the Sanyuan-Tongchuan Class I Highway and the improvement of selected lower class
roads, many of them located in the southern poor prefectures. Nine percent of the highway sector
investment component of the Province's Ninth Five Year Plan (totaling $1.66 billion equivalent) has been
reserved for county and village roads, primarily in poverty counties.
8.           Project Objectives. The proposed project would build on achievements of the Shaanxi
Provincial Highway Project and would: (a) provide continued support for the development of road
infrastructure to relieve congestion, improve access to important archeological and touristic sites, facilitate
mobility and increase the efficiency of road transport in the interest of stimulating socio-economic
development by supporting a slice of the Shaanxi highway investment program (including national,
provincial, county and village roads) during the 9FYP; (b) support poverty alleviation programs in poor
areas of the province; (c) promote development of institutional capacities, through training and other
means, in planning, design, operation and maintenance of Shaanxi's highway network; and (d) increase the
safety of road transport.
9.           Project Description. The project would comprise:
(a)   construction of the following high-grade highways on new right-of-way (about 75.9 percent
of base cost): (i) a 78.1 km four-lane expressway between Weinan and Tongguan (Henan
Border); (ii) a 73.6 km four-lane Class I highway between Tongchuan and Huangling and
doubling of the existing two-lane Class 2 auto-only highway between Yaoxian and
Tongchuan (18.4 km); (iii) a 48.3 km two-lane Class 2 auto-only highway between Lantian
and Xiaoshangyuan; and (iv) two 2-lane Class 2 auto-only highway connections, between
Lintong and the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum (5.9 km) and Famen Buddhist Temple to
Tangyu through Jiangzhang (34.8 km);



(b)    upgrading of the 32 km Xian-Sanyuan Class 1 Highway (constructed under the China First
Highway Project, Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA) by providing full control of access,
traffic safety devices and installation of a telecommunications system (3.3 percent);
(c)   improvement of 3 linking roads (totaling 8.2 km) to the above-mentioned high-grade
highways (0.5 percent);
(d)   improvement and construction of about 4,100 km of rural roads (15.8 percent) included in
a road improvement for poverty alleviation (RIPA) program in poor counties in Shaanxi;
(e)    a highway safety component to help reduce accidents on highways in Shaanxi Province
(0.3 percent);
(f)   institutional strengthening/training (IST) of staff of the Shaanxi Provincial Transport
Department (SPTD) and its related agencies and institutes (0.3 percent) by enhancing
capabilities in high-grade highway construction supervision and operations; highway
investment planning; maintenance of high-grade highways and other roads; and
implementation of RIPA and highway traffic safety components of the project; and
(g)    an equipment component mainly for operation and maintenance of high-grade highways,
maintenance of other roads, environmental monitoring, institutional strengthening and
highway safety (3.9 percent).
10.          The RIPA component was developed within the context of the National and Province
8-7 poverty program and involved consultations with all concerned agencies as well as a screening
process aimed at targeting the poorest segment of the population based on various poverty indicators.
Thirty-one road systems in 25 counties were selected for improvement in the project on the basis of
continuity of the road system, maximization of the population served, connectivity to as many
settlements as possible, and the cost of proposed improvements per person served in the area of
influence of each system. The first year's program (five road systems totaling 320 km) has been
confirmed along with preparation requirements for subsequent road packages, i.e., feasibility studies,
engineering studies and bidding documents, environmental and resettlement documentation,
construction supervision arrangements, implementation plans, and maintenance arrangements.
11.          The Highway Safety component was designed to address the high accident rate in the
province relative to the number of vehicles. In 1994, about 1,600 fatalities and 4,000 injuries
occurred on Shaanxi roads despite the relatively low number of vehicles in Shaanxi. A highway safety
program to reduce traffic accidents was developed by SPTD and the Traffic Police. This program
consists of: (a) establishing a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination; (b) improving traffic
accident reporting and analysis; (c) establishing and training a Road Safety Unit in SPTD to undertake
accident black spot identification and improvement and establish safety audit procedures and
checklists, with expert support also provided; and (d) a study to evaluate the driver training system.
SPTD agreed to allocate Y 10 million ($1.2 million) to the Unit during 1997-2000 to undertake safety
studies/research and to implement on a pilot basis physical improvements to accident black spots.
12.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for China presented to the Board in June 1995 supports China's strategy to reduce poverty and to
relieve infrastructure bottlenecks by, inter alia, rapidly modernizing and expanding its highway system.
The proposed project furthers both of these goals by reducing poverty in Shaanxi through a program
of rural highway improvements targeted at the poor counties and implementing the Weinan-Tongguan
Expressway segment of the NTHS. Furthermore, Bank assistance to NTHS construction should
facilitate interprovincial trade and promote long-distance and transit road traffic, which in turn would
help arrest a growing regionalism while furthering the liberalization, facilitation and cost reduction of
transport, key requirements for market-oriented reforms to succeed. Bank support is also justified by
project assistance to institutional development, which among other things would include a highway



- 4 -
maintenance study to facilitate the introduction of market mechanisms in highway maintenance and
improve methods of highway maintenance through introduction of a higher degree of mechanization.
Bank involvement is also expected to benefit the design and quality of construction of the roads to be
undertaken (this has been problematic in some other projects) as well as traffic safety on the roads.
The project would also foster improved practices in the areas of environment and land acquisition and
resettlement of affected people.
13.          Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Sector. The Bank has
accumulated substantial experience through the preparation and implementation of a dozen highway
projects in China, two of which have been completed. While the overall performance of highway
projects is by and large satisfactory, some problems have occurred, including inadequate quality of
construction, cost overruns and a late start of the design of traffic engineering facilities, which have
delayed completion of the projects. Preparation of the proposed project has specifically addressed the
above issues. The engineering design and bid documents for the project's high-grade highways were
reviewed by international experts and construction of the highways will be supervised by an
international/local team with the local team receiving both formal (in China and abroad) and on-the-
job training in supervision of construction activities and environmental aspects of road development.
The conceptual design of the traffic engineering facilities has already been completed.
14.          The Bank's recent, albeit limited, experience with the operation and management of
tolled expressways in China indicates the need for improvement in this area. The proposed project
therefore provides training for staff and equipment for efficient and safe operation and maintenance
of the project's high-grade highways. Moreover, SPTD would benefit from the general results of a
study of the operation, management and maintenance of high-grade highways included in the Second
Henan Provincial Highway Project (scheduled to be presented to the Board in June 1996).
15.          Several of the most important lessons learned in implementation of highway projects
worldwide concern road maintenance. Bank policy papers in 1979 and 1988 underscored the fact that
neglect of road maintenance can ultimately result in very high costs to restore infrastructure, and that
new road construction must be balanced with the need for road maintenance. Previously, this was not
an issue in China -- adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose and maintenance was
adequately carried out. However, with the expansion of the NTHS (with its high costs), the rapid
increase in traffic volumes, and the trend towards using larger trucks with heavier axle loads, concern is
growing about the accelerating maintenance requirements in the future. A thorough analysis of the
sources and uses of highway funds during the 9FYP in Shaanxi Province revealed that the Province will
be able to meet its highway investment and maintenance plans. To help ensure that adequate funds
will be allocated to highway maintenance, Shaanxi is to submit an annual report to the Bank stating
the physical targets for the condition of the various classes of highways and the related estimates of
monies to achieve these targets and comparing the actual achievements with the plans.
16.          Experience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia and with the Bank's Shaanxi
Highway Project in China has shown that provision of basic access through all-weather roads and
provision of nonmotorized transport are effective means of reducing poverty in rural areas, especially
when combined with programs for socioeconomic development. The RIPA program in the proposed
project was developed on the basis of comprehensive national and provincial poverty programs and
the transport component was integrated with the remaining aspects of the poverty program.
17.          Limited experience with highway safety programs in China has pointed to the
difficulty of their implementation due to poor coordination between the Traffic Police and the
Highway Departments. The proposed project addresses this problem by requiring the establishment
and continued operation of a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination (para 11).
18.          Experience in the area of land acquisition and resettlement has generally been
satisfactory. However, the lesson has been that the Bank should make its requirements well known to
the Chinese agencies at an early stage in the preparation of the project. Also, the Legal Department



should be brought on board early in the project preparation. Experience in the environmental area in
China has generally been favorable. However, the lesson has been that more attention should be paid
to environmental supervision and monitoring during construction and to training of personnel. The
resettlement and environmental aspects of the project were properly addressed throughout
preparation, resulting in specific environmental plans for the design, construction and operation
phases of the project as well as in resettlement action plans. Both plans would be monitored
throughout implementation. Moreover, the proposed project would provide equipment for
environmental supervision and monitoring as well as training of staff.
1 9          Environmental Aspects. This project is classified as category A from an
environmental point of view. Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of the project's high-grade
highways were carried out and, together with the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), were reviewed
by the Bank and found satisfactory. For the RIPA roads, a sectoral environmental assessment
approach was applied. EIAs and EAPs for the first package of roads were therefore prepared and
found satisfactory by the Bank. In addition, the Bank has found satisfactory the basic policies,
planning proposals and institutional arrangements to be applied in the preparation of EIAs and EAPs
for subprojects of the RIPA component for subsequent years. The environmental assessments indicate
that the proposed highways will not affect ecologically sensitive areas, and, if appropriate actions are
taken, their construction and operation should have no adverse impact on the environment through
implementation of EAPs. Major environmental impacts include noise and air pollution during
construction and operation; alteration of hydrological regimes, soil erosion and impacts on local
ecology during construction; impacts on cultural relics; and transportation of construction materials
during construction. The EAPs specified the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental
monitoring plans, institutional arrangements to implement the EAPs, training and equipment
requirements, and budget needed for environmental protection. Major mitigation measures include
adequate selection of alignment, appropriate design of overpasses/underpasses to minimize social
disruption, reconstruction of irrigation channels where appropriate, water sprinkling to reduce dust,
and construction of noise barriers and forest belts to reduce noise. Engineering design and technical
specifications for the highways will incorporate these measures.
20.           Land Acquisition and Resettlement Aspects. The project will require land
acquisition and resettlement. Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for all project components were
submitted and reviewed by the Bank and found to be acceptable.
21.           Efforts were made during project preparation to minimize land acquisition and
resettlement through modifications in highway alignment and designs. A detailed census survey of the
affected persons and properties was completed in December 1994, and excluding the RIPA
component, the project will require acquisition of about 948 ha of land (affecting 13,097 persons) and
resettlement of 2,154 persons living in 467 households. Persons whose livelihood is affected due to
acquisition of farmland will be rehabilitated primarily through land redistribution. If this is not a
feasible option, they will receive non-agricultural jobs in enterprises. One thousand forty-two of the
13,097 affected persons will be provided non-agricultural jobs in enterprises and their residence will be
changed from "rural" to "urban". The remaining affected persons will be able to continue in
agriculture with the help of land redistribution. About 249 ha of land will also need to be leased
temporarily during construction. Twenty-three enterprises with 2,156 workers will need to be
relocated due to the project. The first year package of RIPA would affect 1,291 persons due to land
acquisition and 356 persons due to house relocation. About 83 ha of farmland and 63 houses (5,007
square meters) will be affected. A detailed socio-economic survey of the affected persons will be
carried out before the RAPs are implemented; thereafter the land acquisition and resettlement program
will be monitored by an independent agency. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for
the entire project is about $53 million.
22.           Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated to be about $557
million equivalent, excluding loan commitment charges and interest during construction. Project
financing would be provided as follows: $145 million from MOC; $202 million from SPTD; and $210



- 6 -
million from the Bank, or about 38 percent of the total project cost. Advance contracting and
retroactive financing in a total amount of about $2.5 million is recommended for early provision of
full access control on the Xian-Sanyuan Highway to reduce the high number of accidents, for early
resolution of the issue of the Xian Bypass and for the start-up of the highway maintenance study.
Expenditures incurred after July 1, 1995 would be eligible for retroactive financing. The project's cost
and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
23.          The Government of China and Shaanxi Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar
single currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange
risk of their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net
trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They selected the LIBOR-based
product in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed rate option which
would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk.
China is eligible for single currency loans under the expanded program. This loan represents 8.5
percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD lending program to China, well within the 50 percent volume
guideline approved by the Board.
24.          Project Implementation. The SPTD would have overall responsibility for project
implementation. The high-grade highways and their linking roads would be constructed under 17
contract sections to be awarded following international competitive bidding procedures. All
contractors for these sections would be prequalified. National competitive bidding procedures would be
used for service areas, toll plazas, and administration and maintenance buildings as well as for the
Xian - Sanyuan Highway and RIPA contract sections. Construction supervision would be provided by a
joint international/local supervision team. Force account would be used for some of the works of the
Xian - Sanyuan Highway, some of the RIPA subprojects, and the pilot program for accident black
spots improvements. The proposed arrangements for project implementation and construction
supervision are satisfactory. The project would be implemented during 1996-2001. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are
provided in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 15160-CHA dated
February 5, 1996 is being distributed separately.
25.          Project Sustainability. China has a good record in the sustainability of its highway
investments and Shaanxi Province is no exception to this. The sustainability of the project's physical
investments is dependent on the quality of the initial construction and adequate funding for routine and
periodic maintenance. The use of a relatively independent construction supervision team comprising
international and domestic experts, combined with up-front construction supervision training and
regular Bank supervision missions, will help ensure quality control. To maintain the high-grade
highways, some of the funds collected from road users in the form of tolls will be earmarked for
routine and periodic maintenance. Maintenance of other project roads would be funded by revenues
from user charges (primarily road maintenance fees collected by provincial highway authorities).
Institutional sustainability is also likely. SPTD is one of the strongest provincial highway
organizations in China and is committed to further improving the capabilities of its staff through the
project's technical assistance and training program. SPTD took the lead in designing the program,
which should ensure the transfer of skills envisioned. The road safety component should benefit from
the establishment, under the proposed project, of a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination. This
Group would ensure better coordination between the Traffic Police and SPTD -- the main two agencies
concerned with traffic safety in Shaanxi Province. This Group has already been established.
26.          Economic Analysis. The economic evaluation of the high-grade highways was based
on the economic cost of road investments, operating costs of the new roads, and benefits to the local
economies. Economic costs comprise investment costs (project development, design, land acquisition
and resettlement, construction, construction supervision, and electrical and mechanical works) and
operating costs (routine and periodic maintenance and expressway operations, including toll collection
and administration costs). Quantifiable benefits would accrue to goods and people's mobility in the



- 7 -
form of lower transport costs and reduced travel times and accident rates. These would in turn increase
accessibility to Shaanxi's substantial archeological and tourist resources. Many road users are own-
account truck operators for productive enterprises or, in the rural areas, individual farmers, and thus
should capture the benefits of the project directly. Public freight and passenger services are also likely
to respond to increased competition so that transport cost savings would be passed on to users; at
minimum, reduced operating costs would permit future price increases to be held down. Passengers
would in any case enjoy the time savings offered by the project. The estimated economic internal rate
of return (EIRR) is 16.0 percent for the high-grade highways included in the proposed project, based
on the medium level of traffic projection which indicates a 6.7% average annual growth rate between
1993 and 2018.
27.           For the RIPA systems, economic costs and benefits and the EIRR were treated in the
same way as the high-grade highways. Social benefits were considered only for those systems
considered essential but where their economic benefits are below the agreed upon thresholds (8-10
percent in the lowest population density, remote areas). Social benefits for providing all-weather
access to a given county were estimated on the basis of comparison with similar counties that have
such access. Social benefits will accrue in the form of improved access to health and educational
facilities (resulting in lower death rates, fewer work days lost due to sickness, lower educational drop-
out rates and increased adult literacy levels), increased employment opportunities, increased market
access for agricultural products, and increased year-round access for social communication. The
reduction in expenditures for the Food for Work Program was also considered as a benefit.
Employment creation will be a factor in the evaluation of bids by contractors when the two lowest
evaluated bids are within S percent of each other. The total number of people who are expected to
benefit from the RIPA component is about 2.72 million, or about 54 percent of the poor in Shaanxi
Province. The direct beneficiary population in the influence area of the five systems in the first RIPA
package is about 520,000. The estimated EIRR for this package is about 15.0 percent. This EIRR
must be considered as minimum since the measured benefits represent a small part of the total benefits
of RIPA.
28.           Besides the nonquantified social benefits of the RIPA component, the project has
other nonquantifiable benefits which include (a) reduction in disruptions to traffic service caused by
snow and flooding due to higher standards of the new roads; (b) less cargo damage resulting from the
high standard of the new and improved existing roads; and (c) added comfort and convenience for
passenger transport. In addition, the safety and IST components, and provision of modern
maintenance equipment included under the project, are expected to result in substantial but
unquantified institutional benefits. The safety component should help reduce traffic accidents with a
consequent reduction in deaths, injuries and property damage. Training of highway sector staff and
their involvement in procurement processes would also provide longer-term benefits for the sector:
staff in the implementing agencies are likely to manage the roads in their project over the long run
and to be involved in the development of other major highway projects. The RIPA component has
introduced new and systematic methods of analysis and evaluation which would be applied to other
rural roads in Shaanxi Province and elsewhere in China. The equipment included in the project would
strengthen the capacity of highway agencies for road maintenance, operation of high-grade highways,
research, and construction. Moreover, the adoption of some of the recommendations of the highway
maintenance study included in the project, should result in better allocation and utilization of highway
maintenance funds, and quicker and more efficient maintenance due to the likely expansion in the use
of equipment in highway maintenance operations and the introduction of maintenance by contract.
29.           Risks and Actions. The project faces few risks. Risks related to quality of
construction, cost overruns, delays in implementation, inefficient operation of high-grade highways,
insufficient or untimely maintenance of highways, and ineffective highway safety programs were
identified under the "Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Sector" (paras 13-18). Project
preparation has focused on the mitigation of risks specific to this project or risks identified in other
Bank-financed highway projects. Preparation has incorporated specific lessons from Bank projects in
China and has involved the Ministry of Communications for assistance in technical matters and

project formulation. International experts have also been involved in the design of the high-grade
highways and road safety project components and in the preparation of bidding documents and
technical specifications. Even the risk of reduced benefits for the Weinan - Tongguan Highway
through failure to construct the connecting road to National Highway 310 in Henan Province, has
been substantially reduced by including that link in the proposed Second Henan Provincial Highway
project and through firm committments from MOC to ensure its construction.
30.          Bank-wide experience also shows that there are risks of overly optimistic estimates of
traffic growth and diversion to the project roads, key assumptions in estimating project benefits. The
economic evaluation for this project has considered scenarios with low traffic growth, low diversion of
traffic, and cost overruns. The project remains economically viable over a wide variety of scenarios
and with a wide range of variations in specific costs and benefits. For example, the cost of the project
must increase by 35 percent, or its quantified and costed benefits must decrease by 30 percent, or the
costs must increase by 20 percent and the benefits must decrease by 20 percent at the same time,
before the EIRR of the high-grade highways would become lower than the least acceptable value of 12
percent for China. The likelihood of the occurrence of such circumstances is considered to be low.
3 1.         Actions Agreed. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Borrower
regarding: (a) the onlending arrangements for the proceeds of the loan to Shaanxi Province; and (b)
the completion of the construction of the Yangjia-Baijizhai Connection in Henan Province by
December 31, 1999. Assurance was obtained from Shaanxi Province concerning: (a) the submittal of
an annual report on highway maintenance to ensure that adequate funds are allocated to this activity;
(b) the undertaking of the study of the Xian Bypass and studies of highway maintenance and the
adequacy of the driver training system in Shaanxi; (c) the implementation of a staff training program;
(d) the execution of Environmental Action Plans satisfactory to the Bank; (e) resettlement under the
project in accordance with plans satisfactory to the Bank; (f) monitoring of the effectiveness and
socio-economic impact of resettlement; (g) the submittal of an annual monitoring report to ascertain
conformity with the implementation and developmental impact objectives in the course of project
execution and operation; (h) the auditing of project accounts and special accounts, including
statements of expenditures, by independent auditors; and (i) submission of recommendations regarding
the rationale for setting appropriate toll levels for the high-grade highways.
32.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
