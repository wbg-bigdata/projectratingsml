1 GaNERAL
1.1  Origin and Aims of the EtA
The proposed Xiaoshangyuan-Lantian highway project, located
between Shangzhou city and Lantian county in the Qinling
mountainous area of southeast Shaanxi, is an important
segment of the National Road No. 312. It is also a component
part of )tt-shaped highway network in Shaanxi.
The proposed project has been entered in the list of the
major construction projects of 9th Five-year Plan in the
province. It has been approved by Shaanxi Provincial Planning
Committee on Mar. 27, 1993. Shaanxi Provincial Transportation
Department  (SPTD)  entrusted  the  Environmental  Impact
Assessment (EIA) of this project to Shaanxi Provincial
Institute of Environmental Protection Sciences (SPIEPS) in
May of 1993. The Outline of EIA for the project has been
prepared by SPIEPS in July and that was reviewed and approved
by China National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA) in
November.
Considering the road construction impact on environment, the
EIA  aims  at  investigating  the  social  and  natural
environmental   status;   determining   the   environmental
background values of noise, air, water, soil and vegetation;
predicting construction phase and operation phase impact on
the environment of concerned area. To put forward mitigative
measures and  strategy  to minimize the adverse  effects
associated with the project.

1.3 Scope and Criterion
2.3.1 Nfoise
Along the curbs of proposed highway, the noise effect within
100 meters was assessed against the 4th class standard; and
the noise impact on hospitals and schools was evaluated
against the 2nd class standard under "Standard of Environment
Noise of Urban Area" (GB 3096-93). refer to Table 1-3-1.

1.3.2 Air
The BIA scope for air is the belt area with a width of 200
meters along the curbs of proposed highway.
NO., CO, 502 and TSP were evaluated against the secondary
standard under the "Ambient Air Quality Standard" (GB
3095-82); The EIA standards for Lead Dust comes from the
"Hygienic Standard for Industrial Enterprise Designing" (TJ-
79). Total Hydrocarbon standard was quoted from the USA. All
the standards are listed in Table 1-3-2.

1.3.3 Natural Ecological Environment
(1) Surface Water
The secondary class standard under the "Environmental Quality
Standard for Surface Water" (GB 3838-88) was adopted for
evaluating the rivers along the proposed highway.
Table 1-3-3   Surface Water Standard (mg/l)
pollutants   pH       Pb      BOD5    DO    Oil & Grease

3



(2) Soil and Crops
The EIA scope for natural ecological environment is as same
as that for air. The standard for heavy metals in soil is not
available. So the criterion of 300 mg/kg which recommended
by the previous research was used. The background value in
the concerned area is 18.6 mg/Kg. The reference standard of
lead in crops and vegetables are:
Crop: 0.5-1.0 mg/Kg;   Fresh Vegetable: 0.5 mg/Kg;
Dried Vegetable: 2.0 mg/Kg.
1.3.4 Social Investigation and Public Participation
The public participated in the project in three levels.
First, the opinions and suggestions from the local congress
and the local political consultative conference were
solicited. Second, public investigations were carried out to
collect the public opinions. Finally the opinions from social
organizations and relevant specialists were solicited by
means of some consultations.
1.3.5 Covered Time Period of the EIA
According to the requirement of the EIA Guideline to this
project, the covered time period is up to 2017.
1.4 Environment Protection Objective
According to the project's scale and features, and associated
zonal circumstances, it is decided that the environmental
protection objective is to maintain the original ecological
environment and make sure the environment quality of the
concerned  area  to  meet  the  national   environmental
requirements.
1.5 Assessment Methods
The EIA can be basically divided into two part: present
situation assessment and impact predication. Following
methods are applied to the major special subjects:
- The situation assessment will demonstrate and
synthetically analyze the physical, social and
4



ecological environment in the project construction
area by means of site surveying, monitoring, data
collecting and computing.
- The impact predication will mainly forecast and
evaluate the adverse effects of the project upon
environments by using collected data and computer
modelling.
- The EZIA will conduct respectively at different
sections along the proposed highway, in consideration
of different physical and social conditions.
1.6 Assignment
The EIA of this project was undertaken by Shaanxi Provincial
Institute of Environmental Protection Sciences with Grade A
EIA License. The Institute has 20 senior engineers and 50
engineers. They have finished a number of EIA reports of
highway construction projects. The EIA work team for this
project has rich experiences and information in this field.
Shaanxi Environmental Monitoring Central Station was
responsible for the environmental monitoring for the EIA. The
Central Station has passed the certification test which
conducted by the National Environmental Protection Bureau.

2. ANALYSIS OF TEE ALTERNATIVES
2.1 Alignment Alternatives
ALTERNATIVE 1 (existing road reconstruction)
Because of the influence of the topography conditions,
longitudinal grade and villages along the road, the existing
road can not be used. The new road will be constructed. The
beginning point of the new road locates at Xiaoshangyuan
connecting the beginning point of the Class II auto-only road
from Xiaoshangyuan to Shangzhou city and the ending point
locates  at  Luolicun,  east  of  Lantian  county.  The
reconstruction length will be 51.345 km.
ALTERNATIVE 2 (Muhuguan-Lanqiao, the proposed alternative)
The alignment begins from Xiaoshangyuan. The starting point
(kO+OOO) will connect with the beginning point of the newly
built class II auto-only road from Xiaoshangyuan to Shangzhou
city. It will cross over Danjiang river and get into Qipanhe
valley area. And then goes against the water stream passing
the places of Lijiayuan, Qinlingpu, Xiadianzi and Shataizi.
Then, it goes through the long tunnel of Lu;shugou-Jiucaigou
(1670m). After that, the alignment extends in the stream
direction  passing  the  places  of  Dongmuhu, Xindianzi,
Lanqiaoxiang & Donglongtan up to Wangtan. Then the alignment
would enter the plain area passing Zhoujinatan and
zhangduzhuang cross over Bahe river to the ending point--
Luolicun. The length of the alignment would be 48.282
kilometers.
ALTERNATIVE 3 (Niyuhe river-Mitanghe river).
The begin;ning point of the alternative would locate at
Lijiagelao, south part of Xiaoshangyuan. The alignment will
cross over Danjiang river entering Niyuhe valley by passing
the places of Miaoyuan, Sanchahe, Nijiataizi, Kangjiahenao,
Yanjiayuan, Jinjiaping to Chenjiataizi connecting with
Alternative 4 at K32+560. Then, the alignment will follow the
Alternative 4. The new road length would be 73.28 kilometers.
6



ALTERNATIVE 4 (Yangxie-Gepai-Wangchuan).
The' beginning point would locate at Lijayuan south of'
Shangzhou city and the ending point will be the cross road,
northwest part of Lantian downtown. The main passing places
are Shangzhou city, Machi town, Yangxie town, Linchahekou,
Gepai, Chenjiataizi, Caopingjie, Wangchuan and Lantian. The
total length of the new alignment would be 96.96 kilometers.

2.2 An Environmental ReVieW on the Alternatives
Comparing the four alignments, the alternative 2 (Muhuguan-
Lanqiao) is superior with a short alignment and short length
7



for new construction. The horizontal and longitudinal data of
the most sections is favorable. The work quantity is small
with only one tunnel to be constructed. It also makes fully
use of the newly constructed Class II Auto-only Highway.
Because most of the recommended alternative goes through
river banks or mountain foot, therefore, less arable land
will be occupied. Consequently, less vegetation/ecosystem
will be destroyed. It minimizes the soil erosion.
2.3 Recomendation on Alignment
Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, the alternative
2 is recommended. Thus, the EIS will focus on alternative 2.
The alignment of the 4 alternatives are illustrated in Figure
1.

3. SURVEY OF THE PROJECT
3.1 Project Significance
The highway traffic has been growing rapidly in Shangluo
Prefecture with the economic development in the past decade.
According to the OD investigation, the average annual mixed
traffic in 1990 reached 3,620 vpd and 4,790 vpd respectively.
And the saturation level was 1.80 and 2.40. The existing
traffic exceeds the designed capacity greatly. The existing
highway is far behind the increasingly growing needs.
Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to built the
Xiaoshangyuan-Laltian Highway.
The proposed highway is a component part of National Road No.
312 from Shanghai to Yining and a shortcut connecting
developed Southeast China and Northwest China. It will play
a very important part in the economic interconnection between
above areas and promoting the market economy in Northwest
China after its completion.
3.2  Alignment and Main Control Points
The recommended route alignment starts from Xiaoshangyuan,-
west of Shangzhou city, via Heilongkou, Muhugan, Lanqiao and
passing by the site of Xiangang Company, then ends at
loulicun of Lantian. The alignment and its location
illustrated in attached map 2.
3.3 Construction Scale and Technical Standard
The forecast traffic volume of the proposed highway are
described in Table 3-3-1, and the vehicle types presented
TabLe 3-3-2.

mountains and rolling ground, the topographical characters
were manly as follow.
A. Xiaoshangyuan--Qinling pass (KO+OOO--K15+100)
The area consists of medium and low mountains of Qinling
Mountain range and skirt shape hill slope. The cross slope is
very large.
B. Qinling pass-Heigoukou (K15+100--K35+000)
It is the valley band features. The alignment would pass by
the places of old river course, terrace, small alluvial skirt
deposit. The topography of both sides are steep. Part of the
alignment would go through the old river course. The land
feature is low-laying with high moisture content.
C. Heigoukou--Xiangyang Company (K35+000--K44+200)
It belongs to the land feature of Qinling valley with steep
mountains at the both sides and a narrow valley bottom.
D. Xiangyang Company--Ending Point (K44+000--K48+2821
It belongs to the piedmont alluvial plain. The upper part of
the stratum is grey yellow sandy soil, sand and gravel layer,
and the lower part is loessal sandy soil with buried soil and
gravel layer.
4.1.3  Geological Structure and Earth Quake
The alignment would pass the area of Tieluzi active faulted
zone and Shangzhou--Shuangguan active faulted zone around
stake No. K31. But the broken rock layer has small influence
to the subgrade.
Earth quake: The expected maximum scale of seismic intensity
is 7 in Lantian and 6 in Shangzhou.
4.2 Ecological Environment
The major trees in Qinling Mountain area are: Cypress,
lacebark pine, Chinese pine, and some other arbores such as
Huashan pine, white birch, aspen, varnish.

4.5.5  Air Quality Assessment
In a word, because there was little industrial
pollution sources in the assessment area, the
above monitoring results shown that the air
quality along the proposed highway was fair.
4.6 Monitoring and Assessment of Ecolog'ica.l Environment
Lead emitted from vehicles partially got into atmosphere, and
some of them got into food chine via vegetation and soil. So,
lead pollution in soil and crops will be presented in this
section.
4.6.1 Monitoring and Assessment of Agri-ecological
23



Environment
4.6.1.1  Environmental Background Value of Soil
To evaluate the soil quality, chose Pb, Ph and organism as
the assessment factors.
(1) Soil Type
Being dominated by warm and semi-wet-dry climate, the major
type of soil in concerned area is drab soil. And there are
some brown earth spread in the region depending on soil
formation.
(2) Land Usage
Most of the region are mountain area, therefore, the portion
of forest land and grass land was greater than that of
cultivated land. The land usage in Heilongkou and Muhuguan
are described in Table 4-6-1.
(3) Sampling Locations
Eased on soil type, properties and land usage, as well as the
vegetation type, chose 4 places to take soil samples.
Sampling locations are shown in Figure 3.
(4) Sampling Method and Sample Preparation
Soil was collected at road side where is about 20 m apart
from the proposed highway. At each station, 5 subsamples were
taken at a cross shaped and then mixed. The sampling depth
was 0--20 cm.

The soil samples were air-dried and ground until the whole
subsample passes through a 60 mesh sieve.
(5) Analyzing Method
All the three parameters were determined referring to the
mENVRONmNTL MONITORING AND ANALYZING STNnDAu  METODS" (issued by
China EPA). The specific methods are described in Table 4-6-
2.

(6) Monitoring Results
The soil background vaJ.ues are presented in Table 4-6-3.

(7) Soil Quality Assessment
Lead concentration ranges from 10.8--19.9 mg/kg. The range
lies in the normal distribution of Lead Background in
Shaanxi. Because of the geological difference, the Pb
background level of kuhuguan was higher than the other three.
Organism level was increased from place to place, the
increasing may be associated with the elation increasing.
However, all the 4 values were acceptable. -
pH value of soil was between 7.00 and 8.00. It indicated that
the soil was weak alkaline. In short, the soil in this region
did not polluted by lead, its quality was good.
25



A:
4.6.1.2. Monitoring and Assessment of Lead in Crops
(1) Sample Collection
Potato samples were taken respectively at Muhuguan and
Lanqiao where soil samples were taken.
(2) Monitoring Results
Lead content in potatoes are shown in Table 4-6-4:
Table 4-6-4 Lead Concentration in Fresh Potatoes (mg/Kg)
Parameter           Muhuguan                 Lanqiao
Pb             0.039                    0.042
The results tell us that Pb content in potato was quite low.
The crops were free of lead pollution.
4.6.2 Vegetation and wildlife
There were a forest land of 138,000 ha. in Shangzhou, 57800
ha. in Lantian. The forest covering rate were 49.1% and 40.2%
respectively.
An investigation on rare plant and wildlife was carried out
from July to Sep. 1993. The survey crew worked at Muhuguan
and Lanqiao for more than 60 days and visited the local
residents. A 78-year old farmer recalled when himself was 10
year old the common wildlife such as wolf almost disappeared.
The survey crew had not found any rare plants, animals and
natural conservation area in the assessment area.
There were no any rare plant, animals, and natural
conservation area in the assessment area.
4.6.3 Soil Erosion
In the medium maintain region (Lanqiao and Muhuguan), because
there were a larger area of forest and a stony geological
structure, the soil erosion was not too heavy. Its erosion
modules is 725--740.6 T/Km2.a. However, in the lower mountai-n
area (Heilongkou), the modules of erosion reached 1042.6
T/Kmd.a due to the less area of forest land as well as the
frequent human activities.
26



The cause of soil erosion are mainly as following:
--- rainfall, especially the torrential rain and plum
rains;
--- porous soil and steep mountain slopes; and
--- poor geological structure, such as heavy weathering and
gravity erosion.
Of course, reclaiming wasteland, over logging and mining are
the other reasons of soil erosion.
4.7 Monitoring and Assessment of Surface Water Quality
The proposed alignment mainly lies on the banks of Qipanhe
stream and Qinghe stream. The two streams are seasonal
stream. Their flows very from season to season.
(1) Monitoring Station
The monitoring stations for surface water are list in Table
4-7-1. Their locations are shown in Figure 3.

S. PREDICTION AND EVALUATION OF THE ENVIROMENT QUALITY
5.1 Prediction and Assessment of Air Quality
5.1.1  Prediction model
The proposed highway was divided into 4 types segments
depending on its topographical features:
Type A:   two sides open;
Type B:   one side open, one side cliff;
Type C:   two sides cliff;

5.1.4.4  Type D Terrain (Tunnel) -
There will be a 1590 m tunnel between K131010 and K14+600.
46



Based on the predicted traffic volume of 714 V/h, at a speed
of 60 km/h, to maintain concentration of CO in the tunnel is
not greater than 150 ppm.i.e 187.5mg/LM3. The ventilation is
required. The total ventilation will be 426 3/s with a
circulation speed of 34.8m/s. The jet area should be 0.5m2
with a blow rate of 17.5m3/s. To satisfy the above
requirement, 22 set vertical jet-flow blows, No.8(#-8Ocm),
are recommended. Each pair blows will be installed at the
ceiling of tunnel with a distance of 140 m. The first and
last pair blows should be settled at 135 n away from the
entrance and exit respectively.
CO was the only factor assessed in tunnel air quality.The
other pollutants' prediction results were only for reference.

tunnel are listed in Table 5-1-16.

5.1.5 Assessment
(1) The Rank of Pollution Strength
Comparison of the predicted results in the 4 types of road
segments, the order of pollution level is as following:
Type D > Type C > Type B > Type A.
47



(2) Ground Concentration
Type A and B Road Segments:
All the pollutants' ground concentration will be below the
secondary national air quality standard.
Type C Road Segments:
NOx and THC may be respectively above the criteria at 20
meters in 2005, and in 2017. Type C road segments are the two
sides cliff section (X12+050-K13+010) and K34+000-K42+900).
It's a no resident area. So there is no impact on people's
living.
Type D Road Segments:
Because the air quality standard of tunnel is not available,
the CO standard was quoted frow the D_.signing Standard of
Highway and Tunnel (JTJ 026-90). Comparing the predicted CO
results (2.724mg/Nm3) with the standard, C !ere will be not
any excedances even in 2017. The result is a o bellow the
secondary standard of air quality.
(3) Daily Average
The predicted concentration of NOx, CO, Pb and SO2 at all the
four types segment are all under the Secondary Standard of
Air Quality. CO level at type D road segments, 1.303 mg/Nm3,
is also far bellow the design standard.
In conclusion when Xiaoshangyuan-Lantian highway will be put
into operation, the project will not impact the air quality
greatly. The air pollutants may not influence the residential
area too much.
5.2 Prediction and Assessment of Traffic Noise
5.2.1  Predicting Model
(1) The Propagation Model of Traffic Noise
The propagation characteristics of the roadbed noise is
illustrated in Figure 5-2-1 and 5-2-2.
48



Sownm  S/
Figure 5-2-1    Diagram of sound propagation at embankment
The Figure 5-2-1 was divided into 4 areas:
---Area I
Sound waves at prediction point R including directly reached
sound, from soutce S, and the sound that reflected on the
road surface. If we regarded it as a mirror reflection, Lft
of the prediction point is:
(LAq) = LAO .ItLr                    ( 5-2-1l
where
Lm  : directly reachec sound of vehicles, dB;
AL_: correction amount of the surface reflection,
dB.
--- Area E 
In this area , only directly reached sound (LAO) exists
(LAqh =                              (A.  5-2-2)
---Area I
Besides directly reached sound (S), sound reflected by the
ground exists as well. The equation is:
(LACq)= Lo + ALg                     (5-2-3)
where
ALg: correction amount of the ground reflection, dB.
49



---Area Y
This area is a diffraction fie.'.d of the sound images. The
equation is:
(LAq)t = tLA - AS                  (5-2-p)
smc of ke fmqe
Figure 5-2-2 Sound spread at culvert
From the figure we know that sound field at different
altitudes of culverts can be divided into three areas
- Area I: directly reached sound and reflection sound of the
image source S';
- Area I: directly reached sound only;
- Area N: diffraction sound area of the source S.

5.2.2.6  Wind and Air Influence to Noise Propagation
---When it is very windy, the noise propagation may be
influenced in the downwind area. In the concerned area, the
dominated wind was in WN direction and the annual average of
wind speed was 2.4 m/s.
-- LA.,correction caused by air absorption is calculated
by using the following equation:

where
a : the coefficient of air absorption.
Because the vehicle noise frequency, 125--OOO Hz, is lower,
so the air absorption was negligible.

(2) Assessment
Based on the above predicted results,, we can draw a
conclusion that the noise level of the village which is
closest to the highway will pass the 4th class noise
standard. Therefore the traffic noise will not impact the
villages too much.

(2) Assessment
The prediction results indicated that the Qinlingpu Primary
School and Heilongkou Hospital will be effected by noise
during the highway operation phase. Especially, the long-term
impacts will reach a wider area. Consequently, the highest
noise level during the daytime will occur at Heilongkou
Hospital.
However, the noise prediction results also shown the noise
level during night and daytime will be lower than the 2nd
standard, except a exceedance of 0.2 dB at Qinlingpu Primary
School exceedance of 0.2 dB at Qinlingpu Primary School in
2017. Therefore, the noise impact is slightly.
5.3  The Prediction and Assessment of Surface Water Quality
5.3.1 Operation Phase
The major effect factors of water pollution during the
highway operation phase will be lead dust discharged from the
vehicles and oil scrubbed from the road surface. Because the
oil scrubbing only occurs during rainy reason, then the lead
pollution exists all time, therefore, the lead pollution on
surface water will be predicted.

(5) Assessment
The predicted results shown that impact of lead dust on
surface water will be negligible. Even when sedimentation
contents a lot of lead during rainy season, there will not
any excedances in the rivers. The maximum value will be 0.050
mg/l which occurs in 2017.
5.3.2 Construction Phase
Part of the highway construction activities will be carried
out at the watercourse. That may result in soil erosion and
consequently degrading surface water quality. Therefore, good
construction practice and mitigative measures must be taken.

5.4.1.1 Prediction And Assessment of Lead Pollutiorn In Soil
(1) Prediction Method

Based on survey , following equation (Leonzio Model) is
applied to calculate lead content in soil.
C(D) - BKg + A e0°0 (0-4-1)
where
C(D): lead concentration in soil where is (D) m to the
highway, mg/kg ;
BKg  : lead background value, mg/kg;
A   : increased lead content at 5m, mg/kg ;
D   : distance to the highway, m
The following procedures are applied to predict and evaluate
lead pollution in soil:
---calculating emission strength on a section to
section and period tc period bases.
----calculating lead concentration distribution
through atmospherical diffusion model.
----calculating the annual deposition mass of lead at
distances.
----predicting the remained lead in soil at distances
and periods.
----analyzing pollution trend of crops according to the
linear relationship between lead content in crops
and soil lead pollution.

The above results indicated that!.
--- For type A terrain, the remained lead level in soil
will be under the lead background range (18.6 X 1.06 mg/kg)
during the near future of operation phase; However, the
remained level will be above the lead background within 200m
away from the highway during the far future of operation
phase. The maximum value will be 25.68 mg/kg which is 1.'38
times of Background.
--- For type B terrain, the remained lead level in soil
will be above the background level with the distance of 4am
during the near future of operation phase, as well as lOOm
during the far future of operation; The maximum value will be
30.62 mg/kg which is 1.65 times of background. However, the
remainder will be below the background in the area beyond
lOOm.
--- For type C terrain, the remained lead level in soil
will be above the background level during operation phase.
The maximum value will be 45.42 mg/kg which is 2.44 times of
background.
In conclusion, the remained lead level in soil will be close
to the background level. It is far lower then the reference
criteria of 300 mg/kg.
5.4.1.2 The Impact of Lead Pollution on Food Products
5.4.1.2.1 Grains
(1) Influence of Lead in Soil on Grains
Absorption of lead by plants is mainly through roots. The
order of lead remainder levels in plant organs is roots,
stems, leaves, and seeds. The remainder levels in grain
depend on lead content in soil.
Based on the previous studies, the relation between lead
content in soil and lead content in wheat is:
Y = 0.188 + 0.012X             (r=0.98)
Substitute x with 45.42, the maximum remainder, the predicted
63



lead level in wheat will be 0.73 mg/kg. This value is below
the national standard of 1 mg/kg.
(2) Impact of Lead Content in Soil on Grain Yield
The research results conducted by the Environmental Institute
under the National Agriculture Ministry shown that: The yield
of the wheat and maize will not be affected when the lead
content in soil is below 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the maximum
lead remainder (45.42 mg/kg) in the assessment area is far
below the influence level.
5.4.1.2.2  Vegetables
Cabbage, Chinese cabbage and potato are the staple vegetables
along the alignment. The prediction model of lead pollution
in cabbage and Chinese cabbage is:
Y = a + b-W                  (5-4-3)
where
a : a constant;
b : absorption coefficient of vegetable;
Y : lead concentration in vegetable, mg/kg;
w : lead concentration in soil, mg/kg.
Prediction results see table 5-4-3 and 5-4-4.

2017    3.98   3.54   3.28   2.89   2.72
The predicted results  indicated that  lead remainder in
Chinese cabbages will be below the food hygienic standard in
20 years operation phase; However, lead remainder in green
vegetable will exceed the standard during operation phase.
The maximum value will be 3.98 mg/kg, which is 6.98 times of
the standard. Therefore, when the highway is in operation,
planting of green vegetable along the highway will be not
permitted.
5.4.2 Soil Erosion
5.4.2.1 Soil Erosion Prediction Model.
The intensity of soil erosion is described as the formula:
A = R - K - LS - P - C             (5-4-4)
where
A : the intensity of soil erosion, T/ha.Y or
T/ha.m;
R : the factor of rainfall, MJ.mm/ha.h.Y or
MJ.im/ha.h.m;

K : the factor of soil erodibility;
LS: the factor of topography, L(m), SU-);
C : the factor of vegetation or management;
P : the factor of soil conservation.
5.4.2.2 Parameter Determination
(1) Pactor R
R depends on shower distribution, intensity, and the rainfall
amount. R can be estimated by the follow formula:
p2
1Z         (I. Slg  t _0.a8280)
R -    1.735 * e    p                 (5-4-5)

Heilongkou: 89.73, Average: 100.29.
(2) Factor K
.K depends on soil composition, particle size and organic
content. The formula is:    I
lOOK- 2.1 X 10-4 X (12-OH  X MI-14 + 3.25(SS-2) + 2.5(PP-3)
(5-4-6)
where
GM : the percentage of organic in soil;
N : soil particle parameter, N equal to:
M=(0.002-0.lOmm)size grade%-(0.02-2.0mm)size grade%
(5-4-7)
SS : soil composition classification;
PP : permeability class of soil profile.
(3) Factor LS
LS is calculated by using the formula:
66



LS- (  A  ) x (65.4sin2O + 4.56sine + 0.065)       (5-4-8)

where
A : the length of slope;
o : slope;
m : index, m will be chosen according to Table 5-4-5:

(2) Operation Phase
In order to minimize soil erosion, control measures will be
applied in the highway project, including asphalt pavement,
retaining walls of 20,643 m and a slope protection of 3,130
m. Furthermore, the vegetation will be restored during
operation phase. Therefore, the soil erosion intensity should
decrease year by year. The predicted trend is:
1st year:            43.4 T/ha;
2nd year:            13.1 T/ha;
3rd year:             2.2 T/ha;
4th year:             0.7 T/ha.

EUVRONMENTAL MEASURES:
--vegetative cover should be preserved for as long as possible;
--all accumulated debris and soil resulting from clearing and grubbing
should be located away from watercourses and temporarily stored or
disposed of in manner acceptable to relevant government agencies;
--all the debris sites should be restored and planted as soon as
possible.
--the soil for restoration will come from the nearby borrowin; sites.
The total debris of the project will be about 695.434
thousand O3. One of the planing disposal site will be located
at Putaugou, right side of K12+930, with a storage capacity
71



of 80 thousand m3. After completion of the project, the
disposal sit will be restored for cultivation.
Investigation shown there is no residents and rare wildlife
and plant around the waste stone disposed sites.
5.4.4 Impact Analysis on Natural Vegetation
There is no forest and grassland along the proposed route. A
total of 844 trees will be cut, due to the highway
construction. Most of the cutting trees are timber. The
cutting of wood will not be a serious problem.
However damage of vegetation associated with the-construction
activities will happen very often, especially in the earth
and stone sites. The impact will be limited to the lowest
Level if adequate measures are taken in the design and
construction phases.
5.4.5  Impact on Historic Site
The  proposed  highway  passes  two  historic. sites,  i.e.
Guojiacun village and Chenjiayan sites of Lantian County
which shown in attached map 4. Tiles and Brick Tomb of the
Han Dynasty were found at the sites. Although the project
will not impact on the historical sites, carefully survey
should be taken at the two sites to protect the historical
legacy. Once any historical articles be found, adequately
protect the site and report to the relative agency
immediately.
72



6. RISK ANALYSIS
Risk of this project is mainly from traffic accidents, bad
weather and leak of hazardous chemicals. In most cases, the
risk can be minimized by good management practices.
6.1 Factors of Risk
leaking of being transported hazardous chemicals;
vehicle exhaust and traffic noise during traffic
jam;
bad weather, e. g. rain, snow, fog, strong wind,
the surface freezing, etc;
driver violence, e. g. drunk, exceed the speed
limit, slam the brakes on, etc;
questionable traffic signs;
poor management and capability of accident
treatment.
6.2 Measures of Traffic Accident Control
-properly training personnel who look after traffic
accidents, deal with pollution events and fire
fighting;
installing necessary communication equipment and
supervision facilities such as emergency telephone,
as well as proper and clear traffic signs;
all the vehicles loaded hazardous chemicals must be
signalled clearly; Once a leaking happened the
accident should be dealt with as soon as possible;
during bad weather, such as windy, snowing,
raining, fog and freezing, speeding up, braking,
turning suddenly and other dangerous operations
should be avoided. Reasonable distance between cars
and tire chain are recommended.

7. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONNENT AND 3COMO !
Integrated methods of quantity and quality are applied to
analyze economical, environmental and social benefits. The
major impacted area is shown in Figure 7-1-1.
7.1 Regional Economic Character and Development Tendency
7.1.1 Regional Economic Character
(1) Shangluo Area
Shangluo area is located in South-east part of Shaanxi, south
side of east Qinling, connecting three provinces, i.e.
Shaanxi, Benan and Budei and also is the south-east gate of
Shaanxi. It has a very important geographic position. The
area consists of one city and six counties, 19,292 square
kilometers, with a population of 2,312,000 in 1990. The
reform and open door policy has brought an economical great
change in the area. In 1990, social gross output value was
1,520 million yuan (RMB). The national income was 739 million
yuan (RMB), agriculture and industry output value was 1,199
million yuan (RMB).
Agriculture is still the leading sector. The other
industries, especially the third industry has been rapidly
developed in resent year. Regional industrial structure is
becoming more reasonable year by rear.

Industries are the leading economy of Xian, especially
machinery industry, textile industry and electronic industry.
Xian is one of the foundation places of education and
scientific research. Xian is also one of the four famous
ancient cities, with a very rich tourism resources, i.e.
Emperor Qinshihuang's Tomb, Terra-cotta worriors & Horses,
Lishan Scenic Spot, the City wall, the Forest of Stone
Tablets, the Dayan Pagoda and Xiaoyan pagoda and Lantian
shuilu convent, as well as Lantian Ape-man Fossils etc.
7.1.2 The Regional Economic Development Tendency
Shangluo area and Xian city are the two major regional which
will directly gain benefits from the project. According to
the Eight "Five-year' plan and the plan for 2000, the
e-onomic development tendency of the two regional are as
listed in Table 7-1-1.

7.1.3  Traffic Volume and Economic Development
The relationship between the increase of traffic volume and
economic development is very close. Traffic restricts
economic development, vice-versa. The relationship between
GOVAI and traffic volume can be respectively expressed as
y=ax+b in Xian regional and y=axb in Shangluo regional. The
predicted results are described in Table 7-1-2.

7.2 Economnical Cost-benefit Analysis
Comparing the project's economic benefit with its investment,
to  weigh  up  the  project's  gains  and  its  capability  of
repaying the loan.
7.2.1 The Project's Economical Benefits
Economic benefit of the project means the benefit obtained by
all users. It include: direct economic benefit, benefit of
shortening distance, benefit of saving travel time, benefit
of increased traffic volume, reduced cost of traffic
accidents and so on. Direct economic benefit see Table 7-1-3:
Table 7-1-3    Economic Benefit of the Proposed Highway

7.2.2 Investment of the Project
The total length of proposed highway would be 48.95 Km. A
total investment of 254.56 million yuan is planing to be used
to the project.
7.2.3 Economy Evaluation
The national economy evaluation of the proposed project was
conducted by using the four index, i.e. economic internal
rate of return(EIRR), net present value(NPV), economic
benefit-cost rate(EBCR), and the investment pay out year(T).
The followings are the results:
EIRR           12.91%
EBCR           1.089
NPV            8.35 million yuan(RMB)
T              21 years, including construction period.
The above results indicted that even in the worst case, i.e.
the cost increasing 10%, the benefit reducing 10%, the ENPV
is still great than 0, and the EIRR is great than social
discount rate of 12%. That means the proposed project has
very obvious economic benefit and a pretty strong resistent
to economic risk.
7.3 Analysis of Environment Benefit
The environment will mainly be impacted by noise and air
pollution.
(1) Traffic Noise
The sound environment of existing highway should be improved
greatly because the load sharing of proposed highway. As
described in previous chapters, the sensitive facilities like
schools and hospitals will affected by the new highway's
traffic noise. However, if the noise control measures
presented in this report would be adopted, the noise impacts
will be minimized to the acceptable level.
(2) Air Quality
If the proposed highway will not be constructed, the traffic
volume of the existing highway will be above 20,000 v/d in
2017. Consequently, NOx would exceed the national standard
78



too much. The air quality may degrade further. However, a
total of 76314.22 tons fuel will be saved during the highway
operation phase resulting from improvement of the road
condition. That means the pollutants emission will be
reduced. The cut-down of pollutants are shown in Table 7-3-1:
Table 7-3-1    The Cut-down of Pollutants (Ton)
Fuel           NOx        CO       THC          Pb        SOz
Gas            921       8193      391          27        182
Diesel        1128        686      846           9        272
(3) Land Saving
The proposed highway will occupied land 121.4ha. But 18.3ha
land will be returned from reclaiming and refilling. If the
recommendation of setting up another tow waste disposal sites
is adopted, another 1.3ha. land will be reclaimed.

8.3 Summary of Public Opinions
8.3.1  Summary of Public Hearing Meetings
- The highway construction project benefits both the
State and the local people. And the local people
have been looking forward to constructing the
highway for a long time.
- The proposed highway will promote the local
development. Therefore, the local governments and
people encourage the project very much.
- The proposed project affects the local farmers' life
resulting from the land occupation. So, the
cultivated land occupation should be limited at the
lowest level and make the necessary compensation for
farmers' land loss.
- The people who have to remove should be resettled
well.

9.5 MITEGAfl VE MEASURES AND RECODEENDATIOR
9.5.1 Preventive Measures during Construction Period
(1) Construction Noise
Refer to the relative information, the noise level of some
construction equipment presented in Table 9-5-1:
Table 9-5-1   Noise of Construction Equipment, (de)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Distance (m)      Shoveller    Roller    Blending machine
------------------------------------------------------------_
7.5            79.1          83.8         92.6
-50            65.8          69.3         70.0
100             55.4         52.8          64.8
The results indicated that noise level of the villages 50
meters away from the construction site will exceed the 4th
class noise standard of 55 dB during night. Therefore, the
construction activities should stLp during 22:00 pm--06:00
am, in where distance to village is less than 50 meters.
(2) Dust Depressing
In order to minimize the TSP impact on concerned
environments, Two sprinklers will be used to depress dust.
The expectant effects will be as followings:
The building material, such as earth, stone and lime, should
be stored with cover cloth or watering on them. Reasonably
arrange the work schedule to shorten the storing time.
In addition, to minimize the impact from asphalt mixing
sites, all the asphalt mixing sites should be equipped with
dust collector and located at downwind side 500m away from

(3) Sewage and Solid Waste Disposal
The sewage and garbage discharged from the construction site
should be collected and treated. The solid waste should be
sorted and recycled the useable part.
(4) Rain Water and Waste Water
Rain water and waste water s-hould be discharged separaLely.
Waste water must be treated by means of sedimentation before
discharging to rivers
(5) Village Separation
To avoid d.n-turbing the local people's life, passages and
overpasses   are needed at where the villages have to be
separated.
9.5.2  Ecosystem Conservation Measures
a) Mitigation of long-term soil erosion is best
addressed through a combination of careful project
design and site restoration.
b) The combination of good construction practices such
as aaaa reasonable arrangement of working program
and various site specific "control" methods can
avoid the short-term soil erosion. The less arable
land be used, the better.
c) Locating stockpile of cleared material away from
watercourses especially during the raing season
like july. August and september, to prevent the
flood and degradation of water quality by sediment
and organic debris.
d) One more stockpile of construction waste should be
established near the section K8--K15, to shorten the
transportation distance. The proposed stockpile has
been designed in the project Engineering Design.
e) The construction of all temporary and permanent
drainage ditches, culverts and sewers should be
completed as rapidly as possible. The activities
should incorporate erosion and sediment control
measures sufficient to ensure that off site impact
are minimized.
90



f) The topsoil should be well stored so that the
topsoil will be reused in sites restoration.
g) Site restoration to as near preconstruction
conditions as possible should be initiated and
completed as soon as possible.
h) Afforestation along the roadside and at where the
original vegetation has been destroyed wilL be
beneficial to ecosystem balance. The native tree,
such as Chinese pine and Huashan pine, should be
chosen as the replanting trees.
i) The contractors should be trained and possessed of
necessary environmental knowledge.
9.5.3 Measures for Traffic Safety During Construction Stage
(1) Good traffic management should be conducted by both
traffic police stations and contractors to avoid traffic
jam.
(2) Transportation of construction materials should be
carried out during night and early morning to avoid the
peak hours.
(3) Reasonably use of existing roads and the alternative
access.
(4) Good planing and arrangement of all the constructive
demolishing activities.
9.5.4 Operation Phase
During operation phase, the major environmental impact come
from auto exhaust and traffic noise. The follows are the
mitigative measure.
(1) Improvement of Auto Technical Features
Improvement of auto technical features are complex duties.
But several kinds of exhaust cleaning devices are available.
At the same time, we suggest that NEPA enacts improvement
targets and standards of auto exhaust as soon as possible. So
as to shorten the distance of auto technical features between
91i



home and abroad.
Furthermore, set up vehicle emission monitoring stations at
the toll gates to control high emission vehicles, about 10-
20%, so that the air quality along the highway to meet the
national requirements.
(2) Speed Limitation During Night-tiine
According to the calculation, if large/medium vehicles speed
.is less than 30 Km/h, and small cars speed is less than 60
Km/h, the traffic noise would not impact the people's sleep.
(3) Closing Vehicle Windows when Pass the Tunnels
Install signs at the entrances to tunnels warning drivers and
passengers to close the windows.
(4) Dangerous chemicals transport
The transportation of any hazardous materials must be
reported in advance. All the transport activities must be in
conformity with the relevant regulations.
9.5.5 Recommendati-ons
- New resident buildinqs will not be permitted insides
60 m of the highway;
- New buildings that are sensitive to noise should be
avoided within 100 m away from the highway;
- Use of.no-lead gas should be encouraged. Planting of
vegetable, except tuber vegetable, within 40m away
from the highway will not be permitted.
9.6 Monitoring Plan
9.6.1 Purpose of Monitoring
The purpose of environmental monitoring is to supervise the
implementation of various environmental protection measures
and make timely adjustments on the basis of monitoring
results.
9.6.2 Monitoring Plan
Monitoring actions and targets are established for the phases
of the project as follows. The monitoring stations are
illustrated in Attached Map 4.
92



9.6.3 Budget for environmezntal Monitoring
The instruments and equipment that will be used for the
highway environmental monitoring are presented in Table 9-6-
3. If the budget for annually operation is RMB yuan 100,000,
then the discount ralue(12%) will be RMB yuan 746,900 after
20 years operation.

10 CONCLUSIONS
a) The existing air quality and sound environment
of assessment area met the environmental
requirements of the EIA. There is no any industrial
pollution source in assessment area.
b) The existing ecological environment in the
assessment area is the primitive natural
environmental with a picturesque scenery.
c) The project construction will cause some short-
term, restorable, unfavorable effects on the
assessment area because of soil erosion,
construction noise and dust. Fortunately, the
negative effects can be minimized if the
appropriate measures are applied.
d) Traffic noise in the far future of operational phase
will meet 4th class requirements of the national
standards. However, one school will be slightly
disturbed by traffic noise during near future of
operational phase. Another two schools will be
impacted in the far future of operational phase.
But the impact can be controlled by means of
sound insulation.
e) During the far future of operational phase, the
daily average of all the air pollutants at the 4
types segment are all below the Secondary Standard
of Air Quality.
The maximum ground concentrations of NOx and TEC at
type C road segments will be above the criteria.
Fortunately, the type C road segments is not a
residential area, so the exceedances of NOx and THC
will do not disturb people too much.
f) The lead particles from vehicles exhaust-gas may
98



accumulate in the soil where is close to roadside,
but it will not result in a soil pollution.
Planting tuber vegetables inside the distance of 40
meters from the highway wiLl be encouraged.
g) Construction activities may destroy the
vegetation along the proposed highway.
Restoration measures must be taken to minimized
soil erosion.
h) There were no any rare animals and plants along
the proposed route. The proposed highway passes two
historic sites, slightly impact.
i) After the completion of the proposed highway, the
developing and utilization of the rich minerals
resources in Shangluo region will be speed up.
j)  The proposed highway will greatly improve the
regional economic development. Especially to the
the undevekoped area, the highway will bring forth
a significant social economic benefit.
k)  From the view of environmental protection, the
recommended route is reasonable and feasible.
