1 THE GENERAL
1.2 Background and Objectives of The Report
1.1.1 Background
Weinan-Tongguan expressway is an essential segment of the
National highway No. 310 and a key section of "*"shaped
highway framework in Shaanxi. It will connect Weinan, Xi'an,
Tongguan and Henan in the east and west respectively. The
project is assigned by Transportation Ministry in document
No. 172 in 1989. Based on the document, the highway will be
finished by end of the ninety "five-year" plan. Shaanxi
Provincial Institute of Environmental Protection Science was
entrusted by STD to compile the report
1. 1.2 objectives
The proposed Weinan-Tongguan expressway is a trunk way
through the eastern Guanzhong plain . Some adverse influence
to the environment will arise. Aims of the report are to
survey natural and social environment quality, monitor
background levels of air, noise, soil and grains. We will
also predict influence of the project on environment in the
proposed area, and offer some proposals to control it. So as
to mitigate the influence to an allowable level.
7.1.3 Necessity
(l)Weinan district is one of the most developed areas in
Shaanxi. agriculture, energy and rare metal mining of the
district take precedence of the province. It will be bases of
agriculture and heavy chemicals in the future. So,
improvement of traffic and transportation conditions is very
important for promoting the area economy.
(2) The present highway from Weinan to Tongguan is
basically grade 3. Some sections are inferior to the grade.
Narrow pavement, overloaded bridges, heavy and tangled
traffic make traffic accidents frequently and autos run at
lower speed. Which have restricted development of the
regional economy. Therefor it is required to better the poor
traffic conditions.
(3) Weinan-Tongguan expressway, a section of tianyungang-
Hecheng national trunk highway, is an important part of
1



"^"shaped highway framework in Shaanxi. With development of
economy,  the traffic volume will be increased greatly.
Therefor, complement of the highway will open the district
and the province to outside .
(4) There are abundant tourist resources in the east
Guanzhong. Huaqin pool, Li mountain, Qin Tomb, Warriors and
Horses Figures, Hua mountain, ancient architecture group in
Hancheng, and so on, which have formed eastern triangle
touring area. Xi'an-Lintong expressway has been finished.
After this project, travel time from Xi'an to Tongguan will
be reduced to a half. All these will benefit the eastern
tourism greatly.
(5) Weinan, Yuncheng in Shanxi and Sanmenxia in Henan have
formed so-called "gold trianglel"area. The area are featured
with abundant resources and good location. Governors of the
three districts have planed to constructed the area as an
economic development centra. From this point, the highway
will play a key role in intensifying links among the three
districts.

3. SOCIAL AND NATURAL ENVIRONMNT OF THE ALIGNMENT
3.1 Natural Conditions
3.1.1 Climate
East Guanzhong plain in which the proposed highway is
situated belongs to semi-damp temperate zone. Mean annual
temperature varies from 11.5 to 13.5 centigrade. Average
temperature of January and July are 1 and 27 centigrade
respectively. The extreme low temperature is minus 20. The
extreme high temperature 45 centigrade . Average annual
precipitation is 585 mm , But most falls between July and
sept.. The maximum depth of frozen earth is 40 cm.
3.1.2 Geology and Topography
Weihe River basin the proposed highway will go on lies
between Qinling mountain and northern mountain , descending
from north to south . Exception to some terraces, the ground
is a open plain. Altitude above sea varies from 330m to 348m.
Geologically, it is a fault basin formed in the Cenozoic Era.
With Fen river basin in the east , so-called Fen-wei basin is
formed .
Qinling and Northern mountain are intensively elevated
fault mountains. Wei river basin lies at the adjoins point of
Qinling latitude-direction structure system, Qilian-Helan-Lu-
liang i'"shaped structure system and new Huaxia structure
system. Of them the first two system are dominating systems.
By end of Yianshan movement, the fault basin was enlarged by
intensive fault movements in direction of the east and
extended it to Fen river basin. In the late tertiary
and early pleistocene, the three faults were developed in
directions of E-W, N-E, N-W, which separated Wei river valley
into four parts: Wei river basin, Lishan fault Weinan fault
and Weibei terrace.
Stratum in the tertiary period was developed completely
The sediment substances are mainly sand, earth and conglomer-
ate
Raving been experienced these diastrophic movements above,
deep river and lake sedimentary was overlapped on the basin
in the pleistocene period.
14



Basic  topographical  features   (loess  platform  and
alleviation plain) of the basin were formed based on the late
Yanshan movement and the Himalayas movement. The present
features were lately developed by the new structure
movements, weather fluctuation and water erosion and
accumulation.
There are two belt terraces in Wei river banks. Which are
plane and the altitude varies from 330m to 348m. The main
sedimentary are: sandy clay, clayed sand, sands and gravel.
But the bi-layer structures are obvious, the upper is shoal
facies and the lower is river bed facies. Basic load-bearing
of the ground varies from 17OKpa to 25OKpa.
Weinan-Hua section of the proposed highway is situated in
the second terrace. Huayin-Hua section runs in a flooded-fen,
near Hun mountain. Huayin-the boundary section goes in
transition area from southern Tongguan plain to Wei and
Yellow river valleys and some sections are close to the
rivers.
3.1.3 Earthquake
Guanzhong plain is one of intensive active quake areas.
107 destroyed quakes have occurred since 1200 A. C. . The
quake action can obviously be divided into three active
periods, i.e the year from 1207 to 1368, from 1485 to 1724,
from 1813 to the present. Generally, the active period is
about 200 years and the interval is about 100 years. Most
quake central were centralized in the fault lines. Intensity
of the quakes were about 7 Rich. scale.
Earthquakes in Wei river basin occurred mostly in guanzh-
ong plain. The scale is 8 Rich. scale.
3.1.4 Hydrology
Wei and Yellow rivers are major rivers through the
alignment and in the direction of the highway. Water level of
the rivers are controlled by Sanmenxia reservoir. The highway
runs where the biggest flood in a century can not reach.
there are more than ten streams risen from northern slope of
Qinling mountain in Weinan-Tonggan section. They are:
Rushui,Yuxian, Tanyu, Shiti, Luowen, Luofu, Xianyu Changjian
15



stream, etc . Drainage areas of them are small. Most streams
risen and fallen calmly in the flood periods.
Groundwater resources in the alignment is abundant. The
groundwater table varies from 10 to 15m deep in the second
terrace, ascending from the west to the east. The watertable
in some areas is.minus. The depth is about 1m.
3.2 Eco-environment
3.2.1 Vegetation
The major tree are: pine, cypress chinese scholar tree,
poplar, chinese toon, paulownia, persimmon, peach, malus,
pumila, elm, walnut, and Bo on.
3.2.2 Animals
The investigation and record of local forest departments
shown that wildlife aninals nearly disappear.
An investigation on rare plant and wildlife was carried
out from June to Aug. 1993. The survey crew worked at Huaxian
and Tongguan for more than 60 days and visited the local
residents. The survey crew had not found any rare plants,
animals and natural conservation area in the assessment area.
There  were  no  any  rare  plant,  animalst  and  natural
conservation area in the assessment area.
3.3 Social Conditions
3.3.1 Regional Economic Conditions
Weinan district the highway will go through is a east gate
of Shaanxi and northwest areas. Geographically, it is a
transition area from east to west China. The district
consists of three cities and eight counties. The total area
is 13,000 sq. km and takes 6.4 percent of the province. The
total population is 4.81 million heads. Table 3-1 and 3-2
describe the details.

NOTE: WN.-Weinan Hx.=Huaxian Hy.=Huayin Tg.=Tongguan in this
table
Weinan district is an important base of energy resources
and rare metal mining. Coal resources is distributed mainly
in Hancheng, Chengcheng, Heyang, Pucheng and Baishui coun-
ties. Hecheng mine, Chenghe mine and Pubai mine are three
major mines of the province. Gold ore distributes mainly in
Tongguan and Euayin counties.   Output of gold in Tongguan
takes the third place of the nation. Output of molybdenum in
Hun county takes the first place of the nation
Smooth terrain, fertile land, convenient irrigation
conditions and intensive cultivation make the district become
an important base of crops. 700 million ton of commodity
18



grains is supplied for the nation every year , Yield of
cotton taken 74.5% of the province in 1990 . Yield of oil
crops taken 22.9% in 1990.
3.3.2 Developing Trends of Reglonal Economy
With the moving of the national economic development focus
westward, a group of large and medium industrial projects
will have been constructed before 2000. i. e. Weihe Fertiliz-
er, Shaanxi General Chemicals, Shaanxi Aluminum, Weinhe Oil
refinery, Gold Refinery, General Shaanxi Chemical Fertilizer
Factory and Pucheng, Hancheng, Heyang Power Plant. Agricul-
turally, Donglei and Yumen Pumping water Projects have been
proceeding. The projects aim at improving the lower yield
farmland and Increasing crops output. All these projects will
benefit the district greatly. By that time , the district
economy will step a new stage and the people's living
conditions will be bettered a lot.
3.3.3 Distribution of The Villages nearby
There are 34 villages with a population of 12,545, among
of them 2991 persons who are living at the first row hourse
along the highway.There are 14 sensitive spots, like schools
and hospitals with a population of 4359. The details see

4.1.2  Assessment of Ambient Noise Background Levels
4.1.2.1 Assessment of Ambient Noise Background Levels at The
Sensitive Sites
Table 4-1 demonstrates that noise level at Shuangquan
Central Primary School 58.0dB, is a little bit high. Because
the school is close to the old Xi'an-Tongguan highway. Noise
levels at the other sensitive sites are lower. Ld, Ln at
schools and hospital are not exceeding the 2nd class standard
of the national Noise Requirement.
4.1.2.2 Assessment off Noise Background Levels at The Villages
From table 4-2, we know that noise background levels at
the villages are lower than the assessment standards in
either day or night. Therefore, the present situation of
acoustic environment is good.
In short, Ld, Ln of the concerned villages are
respectively less than 70dB and 55dB. So the sound
environment quality is satisfying.
4.2 Assessment And Monitoring of Ambient Air Quality

4.2.3.1 NOX
With the exception of Huaxian and Fushui stations 30 min.
concentrations of the other three stations. Chengjiacun,
HuayLn and Gangkou, are all bellow the standard. The daily
average of all the five stations did not exceed the standard
too. The higher exceed occurs at Fushui station, this maybe
associated with the emission of Qinling Power Plant.
4.2.3.2 CO
There were no exceed at all the stations, besides the 30
min. level at Fushui station. This result from the emission
of Qinling Power Plant. The Power Plant should control its
pollution source according to Shaanxi EPA's Action schedule.
4.2.3.3 TSP
The 30 min. values at all five points have exceeded the
secondary standard at different extends, and all the daily
average ranging from 0.67mg/Nm3 to 1.01mg/Nm3 have exceeded
the national criteria (0.30mg/Nm3). The reason is that the
road now available is dirt road, from which clouds of dust
are flying up.
4.2.3.4 Pb, THC, 03
The levels of Pb, THC and 03 are under the standard values.

5.1.1 Prediction Model of Traffic Noise
It is prescribed by 6B3096-93 " Standards of Environmental
Noise of Urban Area" that equivalent sound level (LA.q) must
be applied in traffic noise assessment .
LAeW is defined as the total sound energy received at the
ears of an exposed individual over the period of interest
measured in Pa2h. It is abbreviated to LAeq * The formula is:

Sound fields formed by the vehicles at the roadside are
not only related with traffic volume, but with the highway
structures, vehicle features, shelters and surroundingseas
well. Sound field will be amplified while sound sources is
elevated. Sound spread at the embankments without shelters is
charted in figure 5-1-1. From the figure we know that the
sound field at the roadside is divided into four areas.

----Area I
Sound waves at prediction point R include directly reached
sound and reflected sound of the source S. If we regarded it
as a mirror reflection, LAe  of the prediction point is:
LAeq =LAO+ Lr                              5-1-7
Where:

----ArealU
Besides directly reached sound (S), sound reflected by the
ground exists as well. The equation is:
LAeq = LAO+ ALg                           5-1-9
Where:

-----Area l: directly reached sound and reflection sound
of the image source S';
-----Area 11: directly reached sound only;
…Area IV: diffraction sound area of the source S;
5.1.1.2.4 LAq Attenuation Caused by Roadsides Buildings
LAe attenuation caused by the buildings is calculated in
following:
LAe attenuation caused by the buildings(CALb) depends on
the buildings : When the first row of the buildings takes
40--60% of the area from prediction point to the highway,ALb
is 3dB. When it takes 7O%-90%, ALb is 5dB. If another row is
added , 1.5dB should be added to the ALb. But the maximum
ALb is 10dB.
The famula is:
LAeq=LAO LS-ALb             5-1-11

5.1.5 Environmental Impact Assessment of Traffic Noise
5.1.5.1 Prediction and Assessment at Schools And Hospital
(1) Predicted results of noise level nearby schools and
hospital are all beyond the 2nd class standard (60dB) of the
GB3096-93 from the year of 2000.
(2) The predicted noise level on the sports ground of Bayi
school 55 meters away from the centerline of the highway
exceed the standard, while the classrooms 115 meters away
from the centerline of the highway will be hardly affected by
noise.
(3) Since Fengliang primary school, Bua county, and Fushui
primary school are nearer to the highway, it will be serious-
ly affected by the traffic noise during running period.
(4) The inpatient department of Fushui hospital is close to
the highway. The noise level at the hospital will be 68.1 dB
by 2000, and 72.2dB by 2018. The traffic noise will affect
the hospital in some extent.
5.1.5.2 Hua county town, Huayin development area and
Gangkou town
5.1.5.2.1 Hua county town
The proposed highway passes the south of Hua county town.
Distance from the town to the highway is about 100m. From
prediction results we know that: when height from ground to
the surface is O.9m, prediction noise levels insides 20m will
exceed the standard since 2000. Insides the 40m , noise
levels at height above the ground 4.2m exceed the standard.
Insides the 60m, noise level at the height above the ground
7.2m will exceed the standard since 2018. The prediction
results at 80m far from the highway are lower than the
standard (70dB). But, insides 80m, all night prediction noise
levels will exceed the standard since 2000.
44



When height from the ground to the surface is 2.4m: The
daytime prediction results -insides 20m will exceed the
standard at height of 4.2m above the ground, noise levels
insides the 40m will exceed the standard at the height of
7.2m, the noise levels are under the standard beyond 6Om of
the highway. Noise level insides 4Om will exceed the stan-
dard, insides 60m ,noise levels will exceed the standard at
the height of 7.2m since 2018, Jut beyond 80n all noise
levels are lower than 70 dB. Night noise levels insides 60m
will exceed the standard (5SdB) since 2000 , and night noise
levels insides lOOm will exceed the standard since 2005.
5.1.5.2.2 Huayin Development Area
The highway passes the proposed development area. From the
prediction results we know when the surface height above the
ground is 2.1m:
…---Daytime noise levels insides 20m will exceed the
standard at height of 4.2m and the levels
insides 60m are under the standard since 2000;
---Daytime noise levels insides 40m will exceed the
standard since 2000, but noise levels
beyond 80m are under the standard;
-----Night noise levels insides 60m exceed the standard
and the noise levels insides 80 will exceed the
standard at height of 10.2im since 2000;
-----Night noise levels will exceed the standard in the
area since 2018;
When height of highway surface above the ground is 5.5m:
----All daytime noise levels insides 20m will exceed the
standard at height of 7.2m since 2018r and insides
40m and 60m, the height of exceeded standard is 4.2m
and 10.2m respectively;
-----Night noise levels insides 6Om will exceed the
standard at the height of 4.2m since 2005; Insides
8Om all night noise levels will exceed the standard
since 2005
5.1.5.2.3 GangKou
Based on prediction results that the year , distance and
45



height orders which daytime noise levels will exceed the
standard are : 2000, 20m, 13.2m ; 2005, 40m, 16.2m ; 2018,
60m, 16.2m ; 2018, 60m, 10.2m.
Night noise levels insides 60n will exceed the standard at
height of 10.2m since 2000. All night noise levels will
exceed the standard at height of 4.2m since 2018.
Sound field figures 5-1-5, 5-1-6, 5-1-7 are charted based
5.1.5.3 Villages Nearby
From table 5-1-3 we know that: Noise levels at the
villages which are partly removed will exceed the standard
during the running period. Daytime noise levels at most part
of the remained villages will be under the standard . But
night noise levels will exceed the standard in 2018.

5.2.2 Selection of Prediction Model
The highway is separated into two sections, i.e.
weinan-Huayin section, Huayin-Tonguan section. We consider
the sections as unlimited line sources, the constructing
sections and interchanges as surface sources . For the line
sources, 30 nuin. concentrations insides 200m of the roadside
are calculated, and weighted average values of wind
direction, speed, and stability is applied to the calculation
of daily, annual average concentrations. For the surface
sources, we propose they are formed by the spreading of
points sources .The corrected Gaussian plume models are
applied.

5.2.5 Environmental Impact Assessnent
5.2.5.1 The Max. 30 Min. Concentration of Pollutants at The
Roadside
Based on Figure 5-2-4 and 5-2-5, these findings reveal the
62



following information:
----NO.: When wind direction is vertical to the highway, the
frenquency is 1%-4%, N0x concentration will be above the
class II of the Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3096-82),
0.15mg/Nm. Within 200m downwind of Weinan-Euayin section in
2005; N0, exceedance occur at Euayin-Tongguan section
downwind in  2018. When wind direction is parallel to the
highway, with a frenguency of 14%-23%, exceedances distance
alone Weinan-Huayin section are projected to be 58m in 2000,
95m in 2005 and 200m in 2018; Exceedance distance alone
Euayin-tongguan section will be 75m in 2018.
----CO: It is anticipated that CO concentration at the all
sections and wind directions will meet level II standards
as established by China air quality standard.
----THC:It's projected that THC level will be above the
standard, 0.160mg/Nm3, within 200m at downwind side of
vertical wind in 2018. But exceedance will occur at 155m
from the lane in 2018 when wind direction is parallel to
the highway. There will be no THC exceedance along
Euayin-Tongguan section.
5.2.5.2 Daily Mean Concentration of the Roadside
-----…NO Figure 5-2-6 shown that NOx concentration alone
the highway will be far bellow the national standard,
GB3095-82, i.e. 0.10mg/Nm3, in the predication
period.
-----CO concentration alone all the sections will not
exceed the value of 4.0 mg/Nm3, which established by
the standard GB3095-82.
5.2.5.3 Daily Mean Concentration at the Interchanges
From the prediction results, Table 5-2-12, we know that
concentrations of all the pollutants at interchanges will not
exceed the standard in the predicted years.

5.3.1.3 Assessment of Lead Pollution in Soil
From the table , following conclusions are reached :
-----lead remainder in soil depends on distance , the
further the prediction points are located, the lower the
remainder level is.
-lead remainder in two roadside is affected by wind
direction . Lead remainder level in   south roadside of
Weinan-Buayin section is higher than north roadside . And
which is contrary to Huayin-Tongguan section ;
-----All the predicted remainders will not exceed the
standard in the predicted years;
Lead remainders in table 5-3-1 can be converted to pollu-
tion indices and graded in table 5-3-2.

note : grade 2 means "safe" .
From table 5-3-2 we know that soil pollution belongs to
grade 2 (safe) .
5.3.2 Influence of Traffic on Grains And Vegetables
5.3.2.1 Influence of Lead Pollution on Grains
(1) Influence of Lead in Soil on Grains
Absorption of lead by plants is mainly through roots. The
order of lead remainder levels in plant organs are roots,
stems, leaves, grains. The remainder levels depend on lead
content in soil. Influence of lead content in soil on grains
is analyzed in the report.
Some researches about influence of lead content in soil on
grains have been done . Relations between lead content in
soil and lead content in wheat, soybean are:
for wheat :          Y=0.2696+0.01719X            (r=0.94)
for soybean:         Y=1.59+2.42 lOX           (r=0.959)
Staple crops insides the alignment are wheat and maize
From the table above we know that yield of the grain will not
be affected by lead in soil. And it is hardly possible for
the grain quality to be affected because the soil is "safe".
5.3.2.2 Analysis of Influence of Lead on Vegetables
Cabbage, Chinese cabbage and celery are the staple
vegetables insides the alignment. The report analyses
influence of lead pollution on the vegetables.

After a carefully selection and design, there are no
residents, forest and rare animals around the borrowing
sites.
Because the grave sites are located at river bed, the
environmental impact will be slightly. However, all the earth
borrowing sites will affect cultivation of concerned areas.
Therefore topsoil of the borrowing sites should be stored and
reused in site restoration to Ltinixnize the environmental
impact.
5.3.4  Prediction of Soil Erosion

5.3.5.2 Influence of Poor Geological Conditions
Lianhuasi(KB1+000--K84+000)    and    Xiquandian
(1175+250-K119+250) where the highway will passe are lotus
land, Technically  they belong to soft base.
Groundwater table at Lianhuasi is shallow. Some are
water-covered areas around year. The upper layer of the
ground is gravel soil and the lower is soft soil.
Xiquandian section is located on flooded land of Yellow
river. Some areas are water land. Depth of sludge is from Im
to 2m. Technically , it is soft mould or flow mould.
The two sections above are specially treated as following:
Lianhuasi section: sand stakes or anti-pressure engineer-
ing are applied.
Xiquandian section: removing sludge and refilling sand
74



soil, and building separated layers.
The influence of poor geological conditions at Lianhuasi
and Xiquandian can be avoid by building bridge or refilling.
The refilling measures is recommended.
The alignment lies between the existing road and the hill
slope at the east side of Xiguandian, shown in Attached Map3.
Although the route avoids the large area of wetland, part of
the road section is still affected due to the swamp. Thus,
these sections were designed based on soft earth condition.
The engineering measures include change the soiL under
roadbeds and installation of protection slopes. The area of
occupied wetland are presented in Table 5-3-8.

The pecuniary loss due to occupation of ponds and wetlant
is anticipated to be 378 thousand yuan (RMB). In order to
compensate the pecuniary loss and infiltration, several ponds
are going to be established nearby.
5.3.5.2 Influence of landslides
Based on survey , we sure that the highway will not
impacted by landslides.
5.4 Influence of Traffic on Culture Relics And Tourist
Environment
5.4.1 Irmpact on Historical sites
The proposed project will affect 14 historical sites,
shown in Attached Map 3, which presented in Table 5-4-1.

construction. If and cultural relic is found in the construc-
tion, the site must be properly protected and report to the
relative agency at one. At present, one highway and one
railway pass the ruins of the Western City Wall. Tongguan
Ancient  Town.  Although  the  designers   selected  the
alternatives carefully the proposed alignment has to pass
through the Western City Wall, and pass the ruins the East
Gat, Tongguan Ancient Town. As a result, the project will
interfere the scenery of the restored East Gate. The
protection measures of the East Gate, Tongguan Ancient Town
will be studied and made a statement by the cultural Relies
Protection Department. The cultural relics protection agency
will unearth the historical sites along the proposed highway
before the highway construction. The cost for the historical
sites investigation has been considered in the project
budget.
5.5 Prediction And Assessment of Influence on Surface Water
Quality greatly.
5.5.1 Influence of The Constructing on River Runoff
There are 18 streams risen from northern slope of Qiiiling
mountain cross the highway. Drainage areas of the stream are
smaller. The lengths are short and the flows are small. 3
large bridges, 12 medium bridges and 8 small bridges will be
built cross the rivers. Some adverse influence on the river
runoff will probably bring out during constructing period.
Backed silt perhaps chokes the waterway if the base pits
will not carefully planed. Theref or, method of changing
waterway during erecting bridge piers period is recommended.
The waterway will Ex narrow if the constructing site
occupies too large rirver bed , especially for small rivers.
Theref or, it is required to avoid constructing the bridges
during flood period .

5.5.2.2 Source Intensity of Pollutants
Lead pollution is the major problem of stream. Lead
sources are mainly from: (1) lead particles deposition; (2)
flowed lead particles with rain; Because lead deposition is
limited. the flowed lead with rain is the major source.
Source intensity of pollutant lead see table 5-5-2.

From the table above we know stream pollution from the
traffic is limited . Lead content of the streams will be
79



under the class 2 of" standards of surface water environmen-
tal quality" in 2018.
5.5.3 Risk Analysis of Traffic Accidents on The Water
Pall ution
Risks of traffic accidents on the water pollution are
caused by loaded hazardous chemicals. If this kind of
accidents would have happened and not have been treated
immediately, streams nearby would be polluted seriously. Dead
of aquatic living things in streams, poisoning of people and
livestock would occur. So, the executives and drivers
concerned muBt pay specially attentions to it
5.5.4 Influence of Effluent Sewage from Constructing Sites
And Service Facility
Pollutants of effluent sewage are mainly COD, BOD
Because effluent sewage are limited . Influence of COD,BOD on
the waters nearby is not obvious.
However the sewage contained suspended solids and oil
must be treated proporly. At each construction site, the
sewage should pass a sedimentation process to remove
suspended solids, and then pass through a sand grill to
capture oil. The oil contaminated sand must be covered up
with earth where is away from the trinking water source. Of
course, water-oil seperator is the best device for the above
purpose.
5.5.5 Influence of Bridges on Streams
Influence of bridges on streams is that the streams will
be choked partly and the capability of flood drainage will be
reduced. This has been considered in designing. For large
bridges, the biggest flood in 100 years can not reaches them.
For medium bridges , the biggest flood in 300 years can not
reach. In this way , influence of bridges on streams is
limited.

6 ANALYSIS OF THE ALTERNATIVES
Weinan-Diaoqiao section of the highway is located in plain
or light hill area geographically. And Diaoqiao-the boundary
section lies in heavy hill area. There are three schemes in
the former section and two-schemes in the later section.
6.1 -Direction of The highway
…---Weinan-Diaoqiao section:
Scheme a: The highway is close to the oLd Xian-Tongguan
highway and Luonghai railway ;
Scheme 2: The highway runs between the railway and the old
Xian-Tongguan highway;
Scheme 3: The highway is close to old Xian-Tongguan
highway.
-----Diaoqiao-boundary of Shaanxi:
Scheme 1: The highway is located in Tongguan platform;
Scheme 2: the highway runs in foot of the north platform,
running along terrace of Wei river and Yellow river valleys.
6.2 Comparison And-Selection of The Alternatives
6.2.1 Weinan-Diaoqiao section
Scheme 1 (k57+200-k120+360):
Advantages:
-The location is higher and the roadbase will not be
affected by backwater from Sanmenxia reservoir. Stability of
the highway is good.
-The highway passes flooded fan in front of mountain.
Where the ground is slight slope and drainage engineering are
easy to be built.
disadvantages:
-----The highway will cross Luonghai railway three times
and the old Xian-Tongguan highway five times. construction of
the highway will frequently be interrupted by the traffic.
-Removal quantity is great for too many villages and
factors nearby. And street or semi-street highway is as long
as 7.5km.
81



-----lOkm of the old Xian-Tongguan highway ueed by the
highway needs a supplementary road.
The highway will be longer than other schemes and far
away from the controlling points.
-----More population will be affected by noise for dense
villages.
Scheme 2 (k57+200-k120+360):
Advantages :
-The roadbase will not be affected by backwater from
Sanmenxia for higher terrain.
…----Drainage engineering are convenient for slight slope.
…----Removals are limited for less villages and factories.
-----The line is short, fluent, and close to the control-
ling points. Besides, the less crosses reduce interrupts from
the railway and the old Xian-Tongguan highway.
Disadvantages:
3km of soft earth roadbase needs treating specially.
------km of the highway is situated at the height where
the biggest flood in a century can reach. Average covered
depth of the flood is 3.36m. The maxi. covered depth is 5.5m.
Scheme 3 (k57+200-kllB+330):
advantages:
-----The route is shorter and high-grade.
-----Less interruption and removals.
-----less populations and less noise influence.
Disadvantages:
-----About 50km of section is located in the covered area
of backwater. Average height of the section is lower 3.5m
than the biggest flood level in 100 years. Refilling and
protection engineering are great.
… Drainaae is difficulty because the surface of some
sections is lower than river bed.
…----3.0 km of soft roadbase needs special treatments.
-----4.5 km of the line runs through military restriction.
---Stability  of most roadbase  is poor  for higher
groundwater table.
82



…Autos have to make a long detour at Hua, 8uayin
interchanges for a long distance to the planed industrial
areas.
6.2.2 Diaoqiao-the Boundary
Scheme 1: (k105+590-k145+360)
Advantages:
-----The route is close to some important economic areas
and gold mining.
-----The roadbase will not be affected by backwater from
Sarnuenxia reservoir. The stability is good and drainage is
convenient.
Disadvantages:
-----The route is located in gully area. 14 extra large
bridges and 4 extra medium bridges nieed building. More
investment and engineering are required.
* ----One highway-railway cross and five highway-highway
crosses make it difficult to build.
-----The route is longer and more passages are needed.
Schemes 2 : (klO5+.000-k141+657)
Advantages:
-----The route is shorter, fluent and high-grade. Less
investment and engineering are needed.
-----It is convenient to join Shanxi highway at Qili
village.
--The route connects national highway No. 310 straigh-
tly.
Disadvantages:
…Soft earth layers at some sections need special
treatment.
-----10 km of another highway (grade 2) is needed to reach
Tongguan town.
…Great mount of removals at Xiqiandian.
From the comparisons of the schemes above(details see
table 6-1), we know that the scheme 2 has many advantages
over the others. In view of environmental protection. it is
feasible too.

7 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY
Integrated methods of quantity and quality are applied to
analyze economic, environmental and social benefits.
7.1 Analysis of Economic Benefit
7.1.1 Economic Benefit
Economic benefit of the project means the benefit obtained
by all users. It include: direct economic benefit, benefit of
shorted distance, benefit of saving travel time, benefit of
increased traffic volume, reduced cost of traffic accidents
and so on. direct economic benefit see table 7-1.

7.1.2 National Economic Assessment of The Regional
If social rate of discount(SRD) is 12% and internal rate
of return(IRR) is 16.94%, rate of the benefit to the cost
(RBC) is 1.54 . When the cost is increased by 20% or the
benefit is reduced by 20%, IRR is 14.71% and 14.23%
respectively. Even if the both factors act at the same time.
IRR is still 12.24, higher than SRD (12%).
7.1.3 Financial Evaluation of Project
Estimation  total  investment  of  the  project  is
1,345,318,500 yuan RNB . Wold bank loan is 64,000,000
U.S.dollars. The loan interest is 5.6% and the validity is
five years. The exchange rate of U.S.Dollar to RMB is 1:8.7.
Therefor financial comprehensive rate of discount is 2.4 and
2.5 respectively. Detail financial indicators are stated

Capability analysis of pay-back:
The total pay-back capital is 556.80 mill. yuan RMB and
average pay-back period is 15 years. Total interest is 361.70
mill. yuan . Because of good economic benefit, the final
balance is 717.37 mill.
7.2 Analysis of Environment Eenefit
The environment will mainly be impacted by noise and air
pollution.
7.2.1 Traffic Noise
Prediction and assessment of the influence have been
analyzed in chapter 5. The measures to control noise at
different sites are stated in following:
(1) Sensitive Sites
To supply the hospitals and schools with a quiet sound
environment in the concerned area, applying some effective
anti-noise measures is very necessary. The details are
presented in Table 10-3, 10-4 and 10-5.
(2) Villages
Except for removed villages, the affected population is
less than 1500.
There are 11 villages located within 20m away from the
highway, 6 villages 20-40m away from the highway and 4
villages 40-60m away from the highway. The population density
is much small than urban area. 4th class noise standard was
applied to the assessment. The results shown that a few of Ld
were above the standars. The sound difference between indoor
and out-door noise was 3-6 dB. Boweve, in 2000, Ln exceedance
will occur at some villages, the affected villages and
population are listed in Table 7-2.

7.2.2 Air Pollution
583758.75t oil will be saved from 1999 to 2018. Which
means that 54105.48t CO, 10522.59t NOX,, 20485t lead and
6018.26t TBC will be reduced during the period.
7.2.3 Save Land
Farmland reducing is very serious problem in the region
The line will occupied land 429.9 ha. Because we have
considered the problem and will take measures of reclaiming,
refilling measures. The actual occupied land area is 387.8ha.
Besides. 70000m3 coal ash is used to pave the roadbase.
Which, one hand, mitigates the pollution, in another hand,
about 1 ha of coal ash field will be saved
7.3 Analysis of Social Benefit
For details, see the paragraph 1.1.3 "Necessity".
87



8 RISK ANALYSIS
Risk of highway is mainly from traffic accidents and leak
of hazardous chemicals.
8.2 Factors of Risk
-----bad weather, e. g. rain, snow, frog, strong wind, the
surface freezing, etc;
-----driver violence, e. g. drunk, exceed the speed limit,
slan the brakes on, etc;
-----too short distance between two cars;
-----poor management and capability of accident treatment;
---questionable traffic signs;
-----loaded hazardous chemicals.
8.2 Measures of Traffic Accident Control
-----during bad weather: speeding up, braking, turning
suddenly and other dangerous operations should be avoided.
reasonable distance between cars and tyre chain are recom-
mended;
----…training and examining of drivers are required;
…----enhancing supervision and accidents treatment duty;
…----fair signs and signals;
-----alarming telephones and supervision facilities;
---treating  hazardous  chemicals  accidents  soon  and
carefully,

10.6 Measures and Proposals of Environmental Protection
10.6.1 Measures of Environmental Protection During
Construction Period
10.6.1.1 Construction Noise
Table 5-1-1 indicated that construction noise level at 50O
from the jobsite during night will exceed the standard. The
construction should be stopped at night in order not to
interrupt the residents sleeping.
10.6.1.2 Reduction of Particle Deposition
Watering cars will spring on the surface of constructing
sections. Reduction res-ults see table 10-2.
The building material, such as earth, stone and lime,
should be stored with cover cloth or watering on them.
Reasonably arrange the work schedule to shorten the storing
time. In addition, to minimize the impact from asphalt mixing
sites, all the asphalt mixing sites should be equipped with
dust collector and located at downwind side 500m away from
residential area.

rate of reduction (%)   80.9     51.6      40.9      30.2
-------------------------------------------…--------------
20.6.1.3 Treatment of Sewage And Garbage
To avoid surface water pollution, the sewage, garbage and
human waste, from the construction site and temporary living
area, must be collected and then treated, or transported to
disposal site. But never discharge the waste directly into
the streams.
10.6.1.4  Passageway and Culvert
The proposed highway either obstructs exchanges between
the two sides villages or hinders runoff. The designers paid
98



attentions to resolve these problem. 98 culverts, 107
passageways and 31 overpasses are going to be built along the
highway. These facilities will be hot only beneficial for
coming and going of the two sides residents, but also runoff
follow.
10.6.1.5 Construction of Bridges
Occupation of rivercourse should be limited during bridge
construction. To ensure the rivers capacity of flood dis-
charge, flood-relief channel or rivercourse changing are
necessary.
10.6.1.6  Water Conservancy Facilities
To avoid disturbing irrigation system, any water
conservancy facilities interrupted by the construction
activities should be repaired immediately.
10.6.1.7 Cultural relics
Establish a unearthing and action plan for the cultural
relics depending on the classification. The action must be
taken prior to the highway construction. If any cultural
relic is found in the construction field, the cultural relic
should be well protected and reported to relative agency as
soon as possible.
Although the highway will disturb the East Gate of
Tongguan Ancient town, 14 million yuan (RMB) will be saved
due to the short cut. Moreover, the reconstruction of the
East Gate will be promoted by the proposed project. After
reconstruction, the East Gate will become a sign of Shaanxi
exits   and   entrances.   Experiences   shown   that   the
reconstruction will not impact the cultural relic, but
develop tourism resources.
See also Cultural Relics Protection Report for detailed
action plan.
20.6.1.8 Mitigative measures for Soil Erosion
All the topsoil associated to the construction activities
should be stored for reusing in restoration.
a).keep slopes gently in earth sites to avoid soil erosion;
b).restoration and afforestation should be taken as soon as
possible;
99



c).adequately design to reduce earth/stone work amount;
d).reasonably arrange work schedule to avoid construction in
rainy season;
e).use drainage and ditches to draw mud flow away from
farmland.
10.6.1.8.1 Engineering Measures
To protect the side slopes of roadbase, the followings
engineering measures will be adopted:
Slop protection   used for sections of gradient is
less than 2:2.0, slop surface make up of cobbles, cob-
bles/clay or bricks.
--- Retatining wall   used for section of loess hill
with a gradient is greater than 1:0.75. The retatining wall
can prevent the hills from landslide.
---- Protection wall    used for the section with very
steep slop and easy be damaged by weathering,as well as for
protection of the embankment slop.
20.6.1.8.2 Vegetational Measures
Chosen suitable native bushes and grass to plant along the
roadside and on protection slop.
In conclusion, suitable , effective measures or the
combination of control methods and management should be taken
according to the specific conditions and cases to prevent
soil from erosion.
10.6.2 Mitigative Measures During Operational phase
10.6.2.1 Air Pollution Control
(2) asphalt mixing site should be located at downwind
side 500m away from residential area to prevent people from
Bap pollution.
(2) Highly emission vehicles will not allow to run on the
highway.
(3) Planting trees and grass along the roadside to clean
ambient air.
10.6.2.2 Afforestation
Afforestation should function environmental aest hetics and
resisting pollution.
(1) Afforestation of Central Segregation belt
100



Chinese ilex will be major af forestation plant in the
separation belt. Besides, pomegranate, yew podocarpus and
oleander will be mixed. space between Chinese ilexes is 3.Om.
Space between the mixed plants is G.Om . Grass will be
planted in the remainder place.
Functions  of  central  afforestation  not  only  act  as
aesthetic feelings but mitigate psychological risk of face to
face driving and light interruption at night. Therefor
designed height of the plants should be 1.2m.
(2) Afforestation of Roadside
The slope protection will be covered by grass. Chinese
scholar, glossy privet, plane tree will be interplanted in
embankments. Space between two tress is Om.
Metasequoia, pine, cypress and other decorated plants e.g.
peony, rose will be planted around the interchanges.
70.6.2.3 Measures of Noise Control
(1) No horning and driving at high speed during night
(2) Measures at Sensitive Sites
Measures at the sensitive sites see table 10-3, 10-4 and
10-5.
The noise standars for village are: Ld-70 dB, Ln=55 dB.
And the standards for hospital and school are: Ld=60 dB,
Ln=50 dB.
20.6.3 Countermeasures And Proposals
-----New resident buildings will not be permitted insides
60m of the highway;
----New sensitive buildings to noise should be avoided
insides lOOm of the highway;
----Departments of urban planing should consider the
distribution of noise at the highway nearby in
planing urban development;
10.6.4 Monitoring Plan
Monitoring actions and targets are established for the phases
of the project as follows. The monitoring stations are
illustrated in Attached Map 3 (See table 10-6 and 10-7).

11 CONCLUSIONS
11.1 Ambient Environmental Quality
…---Acoustic environment is good. Soil and vegetables
have not been-polluted;
-----Air quality is good comparing with the standard.
11.2 Prediction of Environmental Quality
(1) Traffic Noise Levels
-----Noise levels at schools and hospitals have exceeded
the standards entirely; The proper mitigative
measures should be applied to maintaina a quiet
environment for the schools and residents.
-----Day time noise levels insides 40m of the highway will
exceed the standards 2.5 dB in 2018. But populations
living in the area only take small part of
populations living in the alignment;
(2) Ambient air quality will be lowed during running
period. But air quality along the existing highway
will be improved.
(3) Soil erosion will heavily occur during constructing
period;
(4) Tuber vegetables can be planted within 40m from the
highway.
(5) Sensitive buildings insides lOom of the highway will
not be permitted;
(6) From the view of enviromnental protection , the
recommended route is reasonable and feasible;
(7] If measures in the report would be adopted influence
of the construction on environment would be mitigated
to allowable levels.
