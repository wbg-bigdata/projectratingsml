1. TRANSPORT BOTTLENECKS AND REFORMS'
A. BACKGROUND
1.1   The transport system in China has grown considerably over the last four decades.
Since 1952, the length of the highway system increased by a factor of nine and the length
of the railway network more than doubled. Despite this development, the transport
network is one of the sparsest in the world compared with the area and population it
serves. There is now a gap between transport supply and demand that is manifested by
the existence of transport bottlenecks, the administrative rationing of limited transport
capacity, the poor quality of services and losses to the economy.
B. TRAFFIC
1.2   China had experienced rapid growth of traffic during 1980-89 when the economy
grew at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent. Traffic growth declined when the
economic growth slowed down during 1989-90, as the supply constraints became more
conspicuous. However, resumption of high economic growth since 1991 has brought
about a corresponding surge in transport demand.
1.3   Traffic Growth.  Despite the capacity constraints and related bottlenecks,
between 1980 and 1993 the ton-km of freight have grown at 7.4 percent per year and the
passenger-kilometers at 11.8 percent per year. Highway freight traffic grew at the highest
annual rate of 13.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for railway traffic and 8.1 percent
for coastal and inland waterway traffic. Despite its rapid growth, intercity passenger
travel per capita in China remains very low, at about two thirds of the level for India.
This is due primarily to the severe capacity constraints. Civil aviation traffic is rapidly
expanding and has grown 20.9 percent per year since 1980, but still represents a small
share of total traffic with most long-distance journeys made by rail (Table 1.1).
1.4   Transport Demand and Modal Split Trends. Although the railway's share of
traffic has declined over the last decade as the share of road traffic has grown, rail transport
still dominates freight and passenger traffic in China. In 1993, 39.2 percent of freight and
44.3 percent of passenger traffic turnover were attributable to rail, with the remainder
moved by road, inland waterway, coastal shipping, pipeline, and civil aviation. The
movement toward a market economy will increase demand for market-responsive transport
services, favoring a shift to road transport but still leaving a growing market for the
relatively low-cost rail transport system.

and Management Issues, Options and Strategies, February 1994.

C. TRANSPORT REFORMS
1.5   In the past decade, China's economic reforms have aimed to increase economic
efficiency through measures designed to reduce national government intervention in the
production and distribution process, reduce the Government's deficits and subsidies to
state-owned enterprises, and open the economy by expanding trade and allowing further
participation of private and collective enterprises. In the transport sector, several reforrns
have been undertaken in line with these objectives-many with Bank assistance.
1.6   These initiatives are helping to spur the growth and modernization of the transport
system. However, much more needs to be done to bring about the changes required to
deal effectively with the emerging issues. To alleviate the transport bottlenecks and
rationalize the transport system, the Government will need to take the following measures
by the year 2000:
(a)   increase the total level of transport investment in relation to GNP, to expand
capacity to meet the new traffic demands and to clear up the backlogs
caused by past underinvestment;
(b)   aim for balanced investments among the major freight transport modes of
railways, highways, and waterways in terms of optimal economic cost of
transport;
(c)   realign further the prices of freight transport services and those of the major
commodities, especially coal, to bring them closer to their real costs;
(d)   increase further the productivity of existing transport assets through
technological modernization and management reforms; and
(e)   improve and expand the multimodal transport system, both across and
within modes, with particular emphasis on more extensive use of containers.
D. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
The National Highway Network and its Utilization
1.7   China's road network consists mainly of aging roads with neither the capacity nor
strength to carry current and projected future traffic. Many of the roads need upgrading
in addition to normal maintenance and rehabilitation. A Bank policy study on road
deterioration in developing countries classified China among the countries with an
extensive and obsolete road network in need of modernization to meet the rapid growth in
road transport demand.  Although China has not neglected road maintenance, its
outmoded maintenance technology would not be sufficient to arrest the accelerated
deterioration of the aging road system network. China needs to mobilize domestic and
external resources for modernizing its road system with special emphasis placed on
technology transfer, institutional improvement, and development of skills.



1.8   The rapid growth of highway traffic stems not only from the country's rapid
economic growth but also from other factors such as the national policy of shifting short-
haul transport from rail to road as well as the expansion of the service sector and rural
industries. Furthermore, with the increase in foreign trade, growth in transport demand
will be concentrated in transport corridors serving the main ports and their hinterlands
and, with containerization of higher-value commodities, most domestic movements of
this foreign trade are expected to go by road.
1.9    Growth in the truck and bus fleet has been fairly steady at an average annual rate of
12.3 percent over the last 12 years, with particularly strong growth in small passenger
vehicles.  Growth in the tractor and motorcycle fleets has increased sharply, with
motorcycles showing the strongest growth of all vehicle types. The composition of vehicles
using China's roads is diverse, including a variety of motorized and a large number of other
(nonmotor) vehicles. The tractor and motorcycle fleets, for example, at 5.4 million and 6.5
million respectively, well exceed the size of the truck and bus fleet. Tractors and
motorcycles offer a relatively cheap and basic form of transport, but contribute significantly
to traffic congestion and are among the major causes of road accidents.
1.10  The trucking industry consists of publicly-owned trucks operated by trucking
companies affiliated with local (provincial or district) highway authorities, and other trucks
operated by factories, cooperative organizations and, recently, private individuals. The
relaxation of trucking regulations in the early 1980s allowed own-account trucks to haul
cargo for other factories and cooperatives and thus promoted competition between public
and own-account trucks. While market forces are expected to play a more important role in
shaping the industry in the future, it is necessary to understand the current constraints to
such development and to identify the measures needed to allow the reshaping of the
industry to take place. In order to explore these issues more fully, a Provincial Trucking
Study was included as a component of the Bank-assisted Henan Provincial Highway Project
and was completed in 1994, and a separate study of the trucking industry was completed by
the Bank in 1995.
1.11   Road safety is an important issue in the development of China's road sector, as
traffic continues to grow rapidly on all roads and a high-speed, national highway network
is developed. The frequency and numbers of people involved in traffic accidents have
reached serious proportions in China. The annual fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles in
China is 46, as compared with rates of 33 in India, 12 in Indonesia, 5 in Mexico, 9 in
Thailand, 18 in Hungary, and 2 in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom
(Table 1.2). However, the annual fatality rate per 100,000 population in China is the
same or less than that for developed countries. This reflects the low motorization rates
(vehicles per 1,000 population) in China.. The social and economic costs of these
accidents to the Chinese economy reached almost $1 billion annually.2
2 The costs analyzed in this case included loss of life, injury, property damage, reduced productivity, and
medical, funeral, and legal costs.

1.12 Responsibility for highway safety matters was transferred from MOC and the
provincial Communications Departments to the Ministry of Public Security and its
provincial units in 1988. This decision created transitional administrative problems.
Cooperation between the provincial highway administration bureaus and the concerned
public security units is still weak. Under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway
Project (Loan 3929), a road safety manual and a safety audit system will be developed. The
Bank-financed Xinjiang Highway Project (Loan 3787) and the Guangdong Provincial
Highway Project (Loan 3530) contain pilot programns that address the traffic accident black
spot problem. The Second Conference on Asian Road Safety is scheduled to be held in
Beijing October 28-31, 1996. The Bank is discussing with GOC the possibility of holding a
National Road Safety Seminar in 1997, to be followed by a similar Provincial Road
Seminar in 1998.
Highway Administration, Planning and Finance
1.13  Administration of the highway network is the responsibility of the provincial
governments, through the Highways Bureaus of the Provincial Communications
Departments. The central government's MOC provides general policy guidance and
support to the provinces through its nationwide policies and regulations, specifying
design and construction standards.   However, the Provincial Communications
Departments are financially independent of MOC and carry out all road planning,
construction, maintenance, and operation of roads and waterways in the provinces.
1.14  While the provinces manage the country's highway network, MOC is responsible
for planning and investment strategies for the development of the National Highway
System. MOC has been evolving a long-term strategy for the systematic upgrading of the
national system in key corridors over a 30-year planning horizon. Known as the National
Trunk Highway System (NTHS), the system, comprising 12 major roads for the exclusive
use of motor vehicles (Map IBRD 27046) would connect all the provincial capitals and
cities with populations exceeding 500,000. Development of the NTHS has been accorded
highest priority in investment planning for the highway sector. Priority for early
construction is being given to two north-south corridors (Beijing-Zhuhai and Tonjiang-
Harbin-Shenyang-Qingdao-Shanghai-Fuzhou-Guangzhou-Sanya); two east-west corridors
(Lianyuang-Zhengzhou-Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi-Houerguosi   and   Shanghai-Nanjing-
Jiujiang-Wuhan-Chengdu) and the three corridors of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Shenyang
and Chongqing-Beihai, and to those routes already identified as congested and hindering
economic activity.
1.15  A system for funding highway construction and maintenance is well established,
although there are differences between provinces according to local needs and
circumstances. The main revenues are generated by the Road Maintenance Fee (RMF),
typically levied on the revenue of freight and passenger transport companies and on the
capacity of own-account vehicles. The RMF is levied by the provinces who retain the
majority of the monies after remitting a portion to Central Government agencies. MOC
also directly receives revenues from the Added Vehicle Purchase Fee, a supplementary

earmarked tax on vehicle imports and sales, and uses these funds, which currently reach
about Y 2 billion/year, to contribute financing for: (a) the roads included in the national
highway network, providing a higher share of financing for the poorer, inland provinces and
a lower share for the richer, coastal provinces, and (b) construction or rehabilitation of rural
roads located in economically less-developed areas.
E. BANK GROUP PARTICIPATION
1.16  The Bank Group has supported initiatives by the Govermnent in the transport
sector through loans and credits totaling $5.6 billion for 33 projects (Table 1.3). The
dialogue between the Govermnent and the Bank Group on transport sector operations and
strategy has been strengthened through long-term strategy studies for railways, highways
and ports development, and through project preparation activities and project-financed
studies as well as sector studies carried out in collaboration with Chinese authorities. The
various studies have, inter alia, emphasized the areas of multimodal transport investment
and the setting of sectoral priorities based on systemwide economic evaluation
techniques.3
Transport Sector Work
1.17  Recent Bank Group reports on the transport sector include China's Railway
Strategy (No. 10592-CHA, February 1993), Highway Development and Management:
Issues, Options and Strategies (No. 11819-CHA, February 1994), and Strategies for Road
Freight Development (No. 12600-CHA, January 1995). In addition, studies on the
trucking industry and highway financing have been completed under ongoing projects, a
study of the provincial road construction industry is being undertaken under the Fujian
Provincial Highway Project, a study of interprovincial traffic facilitation and a highway
capacity study are being undertaken under the National Highway Project (Hebei/Henan),
a study of intercity passenger transport is being carried out under the Xinjiang Highway
Project, and a study of highway maintenance is being included in the proposed project.
In addition, a study for improved prioritization of highway investments and improved
highway feasibility study methodology is currently under preparation and is expected to
be completed by the end of 1995. A program for institutional strengthening of MOC is
being prepared and will be supported under a technical assistance credit (China Reform,
Institutional Support and Preinvestment Project-CRISPP, Credit 2447-CHA). The Bank
Group also conducted a survey of the national water transport system in the mid-I 980s,
which has reaffirmed the need to further exploit the large potential of the Chinese
waterways.
3 Six of the studies have explored multimodal pricing and investment issues in a more comprehensive
and more economically oriented analytical framework than was formerly available to China's
decisionmakers: the Guangdong Comprehensive Transport Planning Study (GCTPS); the Yangtze
Economic Zone Transport Study (YEZTS); the Coal Transport Study (CTS); the Railway Investment
Study (RIS); the Southeast Coastal Region Strategic Issues in Ports and Shipping Development Study
(SIPS); and the Price Reform Study.



- 6-
1.18  On the basis of its project and sector work, the Bank has an opportunity to deepen
its involvement and assist the Govermnent in the design and implementation of institutional
and sectoral reforms in areas such as strategy formulation, investment planning, pricing,
financing, deregulation of transport services, operational efficiency, and transfer of
advanced transport-related technology through training and provision of up-to-date
equipment.  Chinese authorities and the Bank Group are currently preparing a
comprehensive transport sector strategy paper that is expected to help guide sector
development in a consistent, cohesive policy framework.
The Bank's Experience and Strategy in Highways
1.19  Of the 14 Bank-assisted highway projects in China, two have so far been
completed (the First Highway Project and the Shaanxi Highway Project). The former
project achieved its original objectives and demonstrated the benefits of improved
accessibility to economically less-developed regions. Economic activity in the area of
influence of most project roads surged and income levels increased noticeably.
Furthermore, the Bank's involvement facilitated the acceptance of competition in the
contracting for road works in preference to force account operations even for smaller civil
works contracts, as well as the merits of supervision of construction by specially assigned
units.
1.20 The Bank strategy for highway lending in the medium term is detailed in Highway
Development and Management: Issues, Options and Strategies. The strategy is to continue
supporting institutional development and sectoral reforms aimed at modernizing the
highway system and its management, and supporting investmnents focused on high-priority
links of the NTHS and the provincial road networks that feed into it.
1.21  While some institutional development and sectoral reform  components will
normally be included in every project, specific issues identified during the Bank's dialogue
with the government, will be addressed selectively in individual provincial projects. During
the next few years, the projects' investment components will continue to focus on high-
priority links of the national highway system, to support the development of the provincial
road networks, and to provide all-weather access to the poor areas to help alleviate poverty.
F. LESSONS FROM PREvious BANK OPERATIONS
1.22  Previous highway projects in China emphasize the importance of rigorous, early
preparation for major civil and traffic engineering works and for procurement processes,
where tendering often takes longer than expected. Advance preparation of bidding
documentation and independent design reviews have also fostered smooth
implementation and have helped reduce variations during the implementation period.
The design of traffic engineering facilities (traffic monitoring, telecommunications,
tolling and lighting) must be advanced so that these works would be finished shortly after
completion of the civil works for high-grade highways.



- 7 -
1.23  Land acquisition and resettlement of affected people have also led to
implementation difficulties, including delays, in Chinese highway projects. A large
number of people are typically affected by resettlement in China, particularly along
important economic corridors where highways are being upgraded and constructed. The
institutional requirements for resettlement of these numbers of people are significant;
under the proposed project, resettlement has received considerable attention to ensure
institutional capability to provide adequate compensation and to implement Resettlement
Action Plans.
1.24  Experience in the environmental area in China has generally been favorable.
However, more attention should be paid to environmental supervision during
construction, training of environmental personnel, and environmental monitoring during
both the construction and operation phases.
1.25  Bank experience emphasizes the importance of adequate construction quality of
roads. Poorly constructed roads lower economic benefits and vehicle operating cost
savings, and may reduce reliability and/or accessibility of the road. Higher costs also
result from premature deterioration, where corrective actions in the form of increased
maintenance and/or rehabilitation are required.  Construction quality has also been
highlighted as a sector issue for Bank highway projects. Effective remedial actions
include careful formulation of supervision arrangements, including engagement of
foreign experts, training of local supervision staff and equipping the supervision teams
with the necessary laboratory equipment, surveying instruments, transportation and
telecommunications facilities.
1.26  There is a growing concern that adequate funding for highway maintenance is not
now being generated to cover an expanding and more expensive highway system.
Previously, this was not an issue-adequate funds were being set aside for this purpose.
Experience with rural highways in Africa and South Asia and with the Bank's Shaanxi
Highway Project in China has shown that provision of basic access through all-weather
roads and provision of nonmotorized transport are effective means of reducing poverty in
rural areas, especially when combined with programs for socioeconomic development.
1.27  Based on the Bank's experience with institutional and policy aspects of highway
projects, the phasing of studies and technical assistance and the intensity of Bank
supervision are important for positive, sustainable outcomes. Institutional components
that are implemented early in the project period tend to have a greater impact, as
compared with free-standing studies carried out in the advanced stages of a project.
Systematic supervision and follow-up of the findings of studies and technical assistance
components by Bank missions also enhance project outcomes. Ultimately, the success of
the road safety component of the project depends upon the Borrower's commitment to the
objectives of the component and its ability to ensure effective coordination between the
Traffic Police and the Highway Department-the main two agencies involved in the
implementation of this component.

2. SHAANXI PROVINCIAL TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. SITUATION AND ECONOMY
2
2.1   Shaanxi Province, located in China's middle west, has an area of 205,000 km and
a population of 34 million (1993). The average population density is 162 persons per
km2, almost double the national average. Administratively, the Province is divided into
107 counties under 10 prefectures. Its capital, Xian, has a population of about 2.75
million. The climate is cold in winter and hot in summer, with an annual rainfall of
653 mm.
2.2   Shaanxi's GNP per capita is about 32 percent below China's average, and the
Province has large areas of poverty (Table 2.1). Shaanxi has the second largest number
of officially designated poor counties in China (50 out of 107) and the fifth largest poor
population (5.0 million or 6.25 percent of China's poor), 80 percent of whom live in two
northern and three southern prefectures. Lack of transport infrastructure is one of the
factors behind the depressed economic conditions in these areas.
B. TRANSPORT NETWORK
2.3   Shaanxi has a well-developed, transport network, heavily dominated by road and
railway transport (May IBRD 27047). The railway network in Shaaulxi includes the
Longhai, Baocheng, Xiantong, Xihou, Xiyan, Xiangyu and Yangan railway lines with a
total length of 2,149 km (in 1992). The Xian-Ankang railway line is now under
construction. Also, the Longhai railway line is being electrified. It is planned that during
the Ninth Five-Year Plan (9FYP), the Yanan-Shenmu railway line would be constructed.
2.4   The airline network of Shaanxi consists of five airports, of which Xianyang
airport (for Xian City) is classified as international, and is now being expanded. The
number of air passengers has increased rapidly (15.2 percent per year), from 140,000 in
1980 to 1,010,000 in 1994 (Table 2.2a).
2.5   The inland waterway system in Shaanxi provides a local service, with an average
hauling distance of 73 km in 1994. The province's major navigable river, the Hanjiang,
runs west to east across the south of the province. Because Shaanxi is an inland province
with short river estuaries, the role of inland waterways is rather limited. It transported
0.34 million tons in 1994 (Table 2.2b) or 0.1 percent of the total.
2.6   Shaanxi's highway system extends about 39,000 km (in 1994), which ranks
thirteenth in China. Of this total, 16 km (0.04 percent of the total) are expressways,
73 km (0.2 percent) are Class I roads, 1,387 km (3.6 percent) are Class II roads,
10,772 km (27.6 percent) are Class III roads, 19,286 km (49.3 percent) are Class IV



- 9 -
roads, and the remaining 7,522 km (19.3 percent) are unclassified roads (Table 2.3). The
administrative classification of the road system in 1994 was as follows:
km                         %
National                            3,999                         10.3
Provincial                          4,798                         12.3
County                             15,211                         38.9
Township                           13,164                         33.7
Other                               1,887                          4.8
ITtal                           39,059                        100.0
2.7    Highways provide a major means of transport in Shaanxi and are the only means
of transport for some areas. The density of the system is 18.75 km per km2, ranking
thirteenth in China. However, the highway network is not well-distributed in the
Province: it is dense in the central belt of the Province, moderately dense in the north and
sparse in the south. At present, 1,000 townships and 11,000 villages (concentrated in the
southern and northern parts of the Province) have no all-weather access to a road suitable
for motor vehicles. It is not surprising that these are also the main poverty areas in the
Province. Most of the network was built in the 1960s to low design standards suitable for
light vehicles and low traffic levcls. About 70 percent (27,096 km) of the roads are
paved, but the pavements are generally of low bearing capacity for the vehicles that
presently circulate on them. Due to the substantial growth in traffic volume and steady
rise in the use of heavy vehicles, these roads increasingly are becoming inadequate to
meet needs.  The provincial government is giving high priority to repairing and
strengthening these roads and to expansion of the highway network, especially high-grade
highways and roads to alleviate poverty.
C. TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH
2.8    Over the period 1980-94, traffic has been rising strongly in all modes, with
growth rates on highways being significantly higher than those on railways. In 1994,
highways transported 87 percent of the passengers and 32 percent of the passenger-
kilometers and 87 percent of the freight tons and 18 percent of the ton-kilometers in
Shaanxi (Tables 2.2a and 2.2b). Railways carried a lesser portion of freight tonnage
(13 percent) and the largest amount of ton-kilometers of freight (82 percent), reflecting
the very long haul distances (1,263 km by rail vs. 41 km by road). Air transport, albeit
very small, is playing an increasingly important role in Shaanxi because of the increase of
foreign visitors to various historical and cultural attractions, particularly the Terra Cotta
Warriors Museum. Highway traffic, nevertheless, rose at high rates, 10.5 percent per



- 10-
year for freight ton-kilometers and 13.5 percent per year for passenger-kilometers (Tables
2.2a and 2.2b).
2.9   The increase in road freight and passenger transport is mostly related to the
improvement and upgrading of low-class roads. During 1980-94, the total length of Class
III and IV roads increased by about 890 km and 3,600 km, respectively. In 1980,
highways transported 46 million passengers, growing to 202 million passengers in 1994,
which represents an annual growth rate of about 11.1 percent.
2.10   Highway traffic includes slow-moving vehicles, mainly tractors of various sizes,
bicycles and other nonmotorized vehicles. In 1994, this slow-moving traffic accounted
for about 10 to 20 percent (in the converted traffic volume) of all motorized traffic along
major roads. Although this traffic is decreasing on main roads, it is still a major factor in
road congestion and traffic accidents. To tackle this problem, Shaanxi has started
development of access-controlled highways where traffic volumes are sufficiently high to
justify them, including the proposed high-grade highways.
D. THE VEHICLE FLEET
2.11 The total vehicle fleet has expanded rapidly (14.3 percent per year for motorized
vehicles) in the nine years between 1985 and 1994 (Table 2.4). During this period, the
fleets of medium- and small-size trucks, and buses and passenger cars grew by 41 percent
and 16 percent per year, respectively, reflecting the growth in prosperity and also the
light-vehicle needs of the growing number of smaller enterprises in the economy. Also,
motorcycles registered an impressive annual growth rate of 31 percent. Tractors, which
reached 256,000 units in 1993, are mainly used for agricultural purposes, but also travel
on the roads. This rapid growth poses particular problems to transport planners, in and
around the larger cities, especially the capital, Xian.
E. THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY
2.12  Road freight services have expanded significantly. Between 1985 and 1994, the
total volume of freight carried by trucks grew by about 6 percent annually, while freight
turnover grew by 7.1 percent annually (Table 2.5). During the same period, the share of
total freight ton-kilometers carried by private transport companies increased from
34 percent to 42 percent. The average haul distance for both public and private transport
companies remained almost stable for the past 10 years-about 60 km by public trucks
and about 30 km by private trucks.
F. HIGHWAY SAFETY
2.13   Road safety is a serious problem in Shaanxi, as elsewhere in China. In 1994,
1,604 persons were killed and 3,982 persons were injured in the 7,664 accidents reported
to the police in that year (Table 2.6). The relatively low number of accidents reflects a
low degree of police reporting, especially in rural areas. But the severity of accidents (the
number killed in relation to the total number killed and injured) is high. International



comparisons of the number killed in traffic accidents per 10,000 vehicles show that the
rate in Shaanxi is about 30 times higher than that for Western Europe and North
America..
2.14  While there is increasing concern about road safety, the Shaanxi Provincial
Transport Department (SPTD) has had less scope for action following the reorganization
of responsibility for road safety matters in China in 1988. Most responsibility for matters
affecting road safety now lies with the Traffic Police of the Public Security Bureau
(PSB), including that for vehicle testing and inspection, driver training and licensing,
propaganda on safety, enforcement of traffic laws, including imposition of fines,
operation of traffic signals, highway patrols, and all aspects of accident, reporting,
investigation and research.  However, SPTD retains responsibility for all matters
concerning safe highway design and traffic signs and markings. SPTD and the Traffic
Police would work together under the project to develop a modest program to address the
road safety problem in Shaanxi (paras. 3.30 - 3.31).
G. HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION
2.15  SPTD controls all highway undertakings in the province (Chart 1). SPTD reports
directly to the provincial government and acts as its administrative arm for planning,
budgeting and financing of highway transport in the province. SPTD conforms to the
general transport policy and technical guidelines issued by MOC.
2.16  The administration of the road network in the province takes place at three levels:
(a) Shaanxi Provincial Highway Administration Bureau (SPHAB) (Chart 2); (b) general
highway bureaus in each prefecture and city; and (c) local-level highway units of the
county highway bureaus. SPTD administers all highways in the province through
SPHAB. Apart from the high-grade highway, SPHAB is responsible for all highway
matters, including construction and maintenance, but receives professional and technical
guidance from the Engineering Administration Department of MOC. It has a staff of 200.
The 10 municipal and prefectural highway bureaus and local highway units of county
highway bureaus have a total staff of about 34,950 (or I person per kilometer), of which
technical personnel are 1,655.
2.17 The Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration Bureau (SHGHAB) (Chart 3)
was established in 1989 and is under the administration of SPTD. SHGHAB has 100
headquarters staff and is responsible for construction, maintenance and operation of high-
grade highways in the province.  Specifically, it is in charge of three highway
management departments: Xian-Tongchuan Highway, Xian-Weinan Highway and Xian-
Baoji Highway. It currently has a staff of about 580 in these three department offices.
H. PLANNING, BUDGETING AND FINANCING
2.18  Planning. SPTD has overall responsibility for planning, construction, operation
and maintenance of the provincial highway network. The prefectural and county
authorities have considerable autonomy in planning smaller road investments, but the



- 12 -
planning of trunk roads is subject to the approval of SPTD. Each administrative group
prepares investment plans for the highway network under its jurisdiction and submits
them to the planning division of SPTD by September of each year for the next year's
plan. SPTD approves the next year's plan for each county or local authority concerned
before the end of March. Similarly, using inputs from lower-level administrative groups,
SPTD prepares the five-year road development plan, reflecting national or provincial
development policy guidelines and objectives. After review and approval by Shaanxi
Provincial Government (SPG), the plans are implemented.
2.19 Budgeting. In common with other provincial communications departments in
China, SPTD's planning division adopts a balanced budget policy. The proposed
highway expenditures are balanced against the revenues earmarked for highway
development; the amount of investment approved for each year is closely related to the
revenues expected for the same year. The necessary adjustments are made after October
of the same year.
2.20 Financing. Highway funding sources and expenditures are summarized in Table
2.7. Data for 1994 are displayed in Figure 2.1. The largest source of finance is the road
maintenance fee (RMF), accounting for 36.7 percent of the total for the province in 1994.
SPTD retains 72.5 per cent of revenues from RMF.

2.21   Other sources of revenue include grants from MOC, (13.5 percent of total) in
1994, and various sources of self-raised funds (49.8 percent). The province also raises
highway funds by adding a passenger tariff surcharge, currently Y 0.01 per passenger-km.



- 13 -
The amounts collected from this source are used mainly for the construction of bus
terminals.
2.22  In addition to road user charges discussed above, fuel taxes are levied by MOF
but are not allocated back to highway funding. Fuel taxes currently amount to 43 percent
of the base price of gasoline and 13 percent of the base price of diesel fuels. Total fuel
prices, including taxes, are significantly higher than international market prices, both for
planned allocations and for open-market consumption (Table 2.8).
I. ENGINEERING, CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE
2.23  Engineering. Road and bridge projects are designed by the planning and design
institutes at the provincial, prefectural and county levels. The Shaanxi Provincial
Highway Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) (Chart 4) is qualified for Class I roads
and expressways and is responsible for all major road, bridge and tunnel projects.
SPHSDI is competent and has qualified and experienced personnel, as well as equipment.
The design institutes at the municipal and county levels are responsible for lower-grade
county and township road design works.  These design institutes are, in general,
competent and have experienced personnel for carrying out their respective highway
design tasks.
2.24  Construction Supervision. The Quality Control Center under SPTD, established
in 1988, is responsible for quality testing, bidding, and overall supervision of all transport
projects in Shaanxi on behalf of SPG. The Quota Center under SPTD, established in
1990, is in charge of auditing the project costs of all transport projects in Shaanxi, and
takes part in the feasibility study, project assessment and budget compilation. Generally,
these centers have relatively competent personnel to supervise and audit the works
adequately.
2.25 Construction. The Shaanxi Provincial Road and Bridge Company (SPRBC) is
mainly responsible for the construction of key highway projects, especially high-standard
highways and large bridges in Shaanxi. The municipal and county highway bureaus have
their own construction units to carry out construction of minor projects within their
administrative districts.  However, in recent years, competitive bidding has been
introduced in the province, following the SPC directive that all major civil works be
awarded after competitive bidding. Many of the larger regional and urban construction
bureaus, railway engineering and mining engineering units have been reorganized into
financially independent contracting companies. Thus, the construction units under the
communications departments of the various cities and provinces can also participate in
transprovincial bidding activities. Contractors for 17 civil works contract sections for the
proposed high-grade highways will be selected through prequalification and international
competitive bidding (ICB) (para. 3.61).
2.26 Maintenance. Highway maintenance is carried out by county highway bureaus
under the control of municipal authorities. Presently, the methods of maintenance work
are generally labor-intensive. Out of the total 39,059 km (as of 1994) highway network



- 14 -
in Shaanxi, about 27,000 km (70 percent of the total) are paved and 58 percent are all-
weather roads. But the pavements are of low bearing capacity for the vehicles. The high-
grade highways are maintained by SHGHAB, and other highways by SPHAB. The main
maintenance problem has been the poor riding quality of road surfaces stemming from
labor-intensive and low-technology practices. Most of the pavements have exceeded
their design life and need major overhaul. Also, overloading of trucks and tractors is a
serious problem, which accelerates deterioration of the pavement. The quality of road
maintenance will be addressed under the proposed project through a study of highway
maintenance (para. 3.29), provision of maintenance equipment (para. 3.24), and training
of personnel involved in the management and execution of maintenance activities (para.
3.33).
J. TRAINING
2.27  The staff of SPTD are, in general, experienced, but have not been exposed to new
technology and therefore often use outmoded work methods and equipment. The staff of
SPTD have benefited from the training provided under the completed Bank-financed
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project (Loan 2952-CHA). The proposed project will
support the training efforts of SPTD by (a) providing training to personnel of the relevant
institutes and schools; (b) strengthening the basic administrative and operational
functions of SPTD; (c) strengthening maintenance planning and its implementation,
which involves the management of maintenance organization and equipment, the
collection of traffic data, and the establishment of a road data bank; through training of
their staff and provision of modem equipment.
K. HIGHWAY DEVELOPMENT
2.28  Shaanxi's investments in highways have increased from Y 2.51 billion during the
7FYP to Y 6.14 billion during the 8FYP (1991-95). The details of the highway network
expansion over the 8FYP and 9FYP are shown in Table 2.7.
2.29  The highway development plans of Shaanxi set goals for three different time
horizons: long term up to the year 2020, medium term up to 2010 and short term up to
the year 2000. The short-term plans for highway development are embodied in the 9FYP
for Shaanxi (Tables 2.9 and 2.10). By the year 2000, it is anticipated that 130 km of new
expressways, 110 km of new Class I highways, 140 km of new Class II auto-only
highways and 790 km of new general Class II highways would be constructed. Also,
about 4,900 km of county and township roads would be rehabilitated or constructed on
new right-of-way.
2.30  The most serious problem for realizing the planned developments by the year
2000 would be the availability of the required financial resources. SPTD's 9FYP calls
for expenditures of about Y 14.08 billion and revenues of about Y 12.24 billion, or a
shortage of about Y 1.84 billion. The expenditures include Y 5.64 billion for new
construction (including high-grade highways), Y 3.16 billion for rehabilitation and
upgrading of existing roads; Y 0.64 billion for periodic maintenance and Y 0.69 billion or



- 15-
routine maintenance. The expected deficit is expected to be met from: (a) sale of land
(Y 120 million); (b) fees on coal and oil transport (Y 200 million); (c) increase in fees on
transport of passengers (Y 200 million); (d) sale of operating rights of some of the
completed high-grade highways (Y 400 million); (e) adoption of build-operate-transfer
(BOT) schemes for three new tunnels (Y 400 million); (f) increased contribution from
MOC (Y 100 million); and (g) domestic loans (Y 170 million).
2.31  The Province's Master Plan for Poor Areas (8-7 Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation
1994-2000) has set as its goal to provide year-round access to every poor township and
80 percent of the villages in Shaanxi. The transport component of this plan calls for the
completion of 403 road projects (totaling 8,918 km), of which 4,858 km are to be
rehabilitated, 1,670 km to be newly constructed on Class IV roads, 2,024 km to be
upgraded from unclassified status to all-weather roads, and 366 km to be upgraded from
Class IV to Class III. The total cost of these improvements is about Y 1.5 billion ($175
million) or about 15 percent of the Province's 9FYP highway sector investment.
2.32  The proposed highway developments are ambitious, and there is a danger that
maintenance could be sacrificed for new construction. As a percentage of total highway
expenditures in Shaanxi, maintenance has decreased from about 18.0 percent in the 7FYP
to 13.0 percent in the 8FYP and is expected to be 9.4 percent in the 9FYP, largely as a
result of large increases in construction expenditures. SPTD is, however, aware of these
trends and plans to improve highway investment planning and prioritization. Also, it is
considering ways of allocating a greater share of financial resources to maintenance. The
institutional strengthening/ training contained in the proposed project (paras. 3.32-3.33),
the provision of maintenance equipment (para. 3.24) as well as the study of highway
maintenance should help improve investment planning and highway maintenance and
increase SPTD's institutional capacity to implement its future development and
maintenance programs.

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT FORMULATION AND PREPARATION
3.1   The support of highway development in Shaanxi is particularly important in light
of the province's national strategic transport location, in addition to its own infrastructure
development requirements. One of its key transport corridors is the east-west Tongguan
(Henan Border)-Xian-Baoji (Gansu Border) route. This route is a part of one of the two
east-west high-priority corridors in the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS). The
Bank's strategy for highway lending has supported the development of this NTHS. The
Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE), which is one component of the proposed Second
Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project constitutes an important link of the above-mentioned
east-west corridor of the NTHS. Under the proposed Second Henan Highway Project,
which was appraised in November 1995, the 136 km section between Luoyang and
Sanmenxia would be undertaken. Under the proposed Second Xinjiang Highway Project,
which is now being prepared, the 262 km section between Urumqi and Kuitun would be
constructed.
3.2   The proposed project was prepared under the directives of the Shaanxi Provincial
Transport Department (SPTD), with the guidance of SPC, MOF, MOC and the People's
Bank of China. The feasibility studies for the major highways contained in the project
were prepared by SPHSDI. Following the identification mission in October 1994 and the
preparation mission in April 1995, the project was appraised in July 1995.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
3.3   The proposed project has the following objectives:
(a)   support continuing development of road infrastructure to relieve
congestion, improve access to important archeological and tourist sites,
facilitate mobility and increase the efficiency of road transport in the
interest of stimulating economic activity by supporting a slice of the
Shaanxi highway investment program (including national, provincial,
county, and village roads) during the 9FYP;
(b)   assist in the implementation of policies to alleviate poverty in the poor
areas of the province;
(c)   promote development of institutional capabilities of SPTD, through
training and other means, in planning, design, operations and maintenance
of Shaanxi's highway network; and



- 17 -
(d)   increase the safety of road transport.
3.4   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for China, presented to the Board in June 1995, supports China's strategy to
reduce poverty and to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks by, inter alia, rapidly modernizing
and expanding its highway system. The proposed project furthers both of these goals by
reducing poverty in Shaanxi through a program of rural highway improvements targeted
at the poor counties and implementing the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway segment of the
NTHS.   Furthermore, Bank assistance to NTHS construction should facilitate
interprovincial trade and promote long-distance and transit road traffic, which in turn
would help arrest a growing regionalism while furthering the liberalization, facilitation
and cost reduction of transport, key requirements for market-oriented reforms to succeed.
Bank support is also justified by project assistance to institutional development, which
among other things would include a study of the various options to provide an east-west
bypass around Xian (which is a part of the east-west corridor of the NTHS) and a
highway maintenance study to improve the allocation of highway maintenance funds
among various maintenance activities, introduce the market mechanism in highway
maintenance, and improve methods of highway maintenance through introduction of a
higher degree of mechanization. Bank involvement is also expected to benefit the design
and the quality of construction of works to be constructed (this has been problematic in
some other projects) as well as the traffic safety on roads. The project would also foster
improved practices in the areas of environment and land acquisition and resettlement of
affected people.
C. PROJECT SCOPE
3.5   The scope of the project includes:
(a)   Construction of five high-grade highways (Map IBRD 27048) comprising:
(i)    a 78.1 km four-lane expressway between Weinan and Tongguan
(Henan Border);
(ii)    a 73.6 km four-lane Class I highway between Tongchuan and
Huangling and doubling of the existing two-lane Class I highway
between Yaoxian and Tongchuan (18.4 km);
(iii)    a 48.3 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway between Lantian
and Xiaoshangyuan;
(iv)    a 5.9 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway connecting Lintong
and the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum;
(v)   an 34.8 km two-lane Class II auto-only highway between Famen
Buddhist Temple and Jiangzhuang; and between Jiangzhuang and
Tangyu.



- 18-
(b)   upgrading of the 32 km Xian-Sanyuan Class I highway by providing full
control of access, traffic safety devices, and installation of a
telecommunication system;
(c)   construction, rehabilitation and upgrading of three linking roads with a
total length of about 8.2 km that would interconnect and feed traffic to the
proposed high-grade highways at interchanges;
(d)   improvement and new construction of about 4,100 km of rural roads in a
program to help alleviate poverty (RIPA) in poor counties in Shaanxi;
(e)   provision of equipment for:
(i)   control of construction quality and for monitoring of the
environment during the construction of the high-grade highways
and their linking roads;
(ii)   operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways;
(iii)    maintenance of the Shaanxi provincial highway network (other
than the high-grade highways); and
(iv)   institutional strengthening of the SPTD and related institutions and
the traffic police;
(f)   a road safety component to help reduce accidents on Shaanxi's highways;
and
(g)   institutional strengthening and training (IST) of the staff of SPTD and its
related agencies and institutes by enhancing capabilities in high-grade
highway construction supervision and operations; highway investment
planning, including the carrying out of the study of alternative locations of
the Xian east-west bypass; maintenance of high-grade highways and other
roads, including a study of highway maintenance; and implementation of
RIPA and highway traffic safety components of the project.
(a)   Construction of High-Grade Highways
3.6   The basic design characteristics of the five proposed high-grade highways, as well
as the status of the design and bid documents for these highways, are shown in Table 3.1.
These high-grade highways would be operated as toll highways. This would entail:
(a) supply and installation of electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment for toll
collection, telecommunications and lighting facilities. However, the equipment to be
provided to each highway would vary depending on the class of highway and the
projected traffic volume, and; (b) construction of management and maintenance
buildings, parking areas and service areas;



- 19-
3.7   Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE). The proposed WTE would serve one
of the most heavily developed corridors in Shaanxi Province and form part of one of the
12 NTHS corridors in China selected by MOC for expressway development and as the
eastem gateway to Xian and would parallel National Highway No. 312.
3.8   The existing road between Weinan and Tongguan (National Highway 312) is a
Class III road, with no separation of motorized and slow-moving traffic and presently
carries about 5,000 mte per day and cannot accommodate projected traffic beyond 2000.
Widening of the existing road would not be feasible because of extensive side
development in several townships and the poor construction of the existing pavement and
drainage structures.
3.9   The eastemmost 20 km would not achieve their full economic benefits unless the
WTE were to be connected to the existing National Highway 310. This would be
accomplished through construction of a 6.1 km Connecting Road between Yangjia and
Baijiazhai, completely in Henan Province. Shaanxi and Henan Provinces have agreed
that construction of this connection would be completed at about the same time as the
WTE. This Connection has been included in the proposed Second Henan Highway
Project (to be financed by the Bank) and to be presented to the Board in June 1996.
Assurances were obtained from MOF at negotiations that the Connecting Road will be
open by December 31, 1999, the time that construction of the Weinan-Tongguan
Expressway is expected to be completed
3.10  Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH). In addition to a four-lane Class I
highway between Tongchuan and Huangling, the proposed THH would include doubling
of the existing half Class I highway between Yaoxian and Tongchuan, completed under
the Bank-financed Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project (Loan 2952-CHA). Also, since
the existing road from Xian to Sanyuan (also completed under the Bank-financed Shaanxi
Provincial Highway Project) is a Class I highway without access control, SPTD agreed to
upgrade this highway to a four-lane highway with full control of access by the year 1997,
to be compatible with the THH. This upgrading is included as a component of the
proposed project.
3.11  The THH would serve as the northern gateway to Xian and provide access to the
coal mining base of Tongchuan, and the energy resource base of Huangling county.
Also, it would serve the important touristic attraction of the Yellow Emperor in
Huangling. Construction of the THH would constitute a main step in Shaanxi's effort to
better serve the northern part of the province a region that contains many of the poor in
Shaanxi.
3.12 Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH). The proposed LXH two-lane Class
II auto-only highway would provide service to the poor Shangluo prefecture and improve
the access from the south to Xian..



- 20 -
3.13 Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway (LTWMH). The proposed
two-lane Class II auto-only highway would form a branch from the Xian-Lintong
Expressway to serve the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum.
3.14  Famen Buddhist Temple-Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (FJTH).  This
highway would provide access to both the Buddhist temple at Farnensi, the National
Taibaishan Forest Park and the Tangyu Hot Springs.
(b)   Upgrading Xian-Sanyuan Class I Highway.
3.15  Initially, this highway was constructed without access control and many accidents
are taking place. It carries a high traffic volume (about 10,000 mte per day). With the
construction of the THH, the Xian-Sanyuan Highway would be the only section between
Xian and Huangling without access control, although it carries the highest traffic volume.
The proposed works consist of: (a) construction of about 42.9 km of service roads;
(b) construction of 13 overpasses for tractors and bicycles, 5 overpasses for pedestrians, 2
underpasses for vehicles, 4 overpasses for vehicles and 3 interchanges; (c) provision of
safety facilities comprising 122 traffic signs, 55.6 km of fence, 43.6 km of guard rail,
5.4 km of concrete guard rails, and about 25,700 m2 of pavement markings; (d) planting
of grass and shrubs; and (e) installation of 86.2 km of communication cables and 174
emergency telephones. Because of the urgency of these improvements, work on them is
expected to start in May 1996 and be completed by June 1997.
(e)   Linking Roads.
3.16  The opening of the high-grade highways would bring a significant increase in
traffic to the roads connecting them to the cities along the existing roads and to other
transversal provincial roads. Without the proper linking to the cities and towns from
interchanges, these high-grade highways would not be effectively used. Based on a
comprehensive review of these linking roads, SPTD selected three roads with a total
length of 8.2 km for new construction and improvement (Table 3.2). Due to the short
length of these roads, they are included within the designs of the related sections of the
high-grade highways. In addition, four other roads with a total length of 21 km would be
constructed or improved by 1999. But, these will be implemented by SPTD in
cooperation with the local towns/counties using their own funds. SPTD assured the Bank
that these improvements will be implemented and completed on time. Moreover, 1 km
on both sides of the linking roads at each interchange would be improved under the high-
grade highway component, if the existing road condition cannot meet the required
standards.
Supervision of Construction of the High-Grade Highways and Linking Roads
3.17  Based on the experience gained from completed and ongoing Bank-financed
highway projects in Shaanxi and other provinces, a combined team of local engineers,
technicians and other personnel and foreign consultants would be set up to supervise the
construction of the high-grade highways and linking roads.  The organizational



- 21 -
arrangements and terms of reference for the construction supervision of these highways
have been drawn up by SPTD and were found to be adequate (Chart 5). The team would
consist of about 314 local staff and 8 international experts. The total input by the
international staff is estimated at about 196 person-months including 4 person-months to
train 311 local supervision staff for one month in China, as well as 30 local staff for one
month (30 person-months) abroad. The international supervising engineers would be
integrated into the organization with operational responsibilities.  Furthermore, the
international consultants would help establish procedures at all levels of the supervisory
work, including on-site inspections and laboratory testing, and train local staff both
through formal training sessions and on-the-job. The international experts would be
retained until completion of the construction of the major highways.
(d)   Improvement and new road construction for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA)
3.18  Poverty in Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi Province has a population of 34.4
million, with 10 prefectures and 107 counties. Fifty of these counties, with a combined
population of 5.0 million (6.3 percent of China's total poor population), have an annual
per capita income of less than Y 500 and are classified as poor counties. Shaanxi has the
second largest number of poor counties in China and is the Province with the fifth largest
poor population. The Province's Master Plan for Poverty Alleviation (1994-2000) has set
its goal for every poor county township and 80 percent of the villages in Shaanxi to have
all-weather access to a main provincial road axis.
3.19 Road Transport in Poverty Areas. Currently, six of the Province's townships
and some 11,000 administrative villages do not have all-weather access to highways.
Due to financial shortfalls, there is also a shortage of needed bridges and culverts and this
contributes to a further deterioration in the existing road network from poor drainage and
water erosion. Additionally, 191 roads have serious traffic congestion and 46 roads (a
total of 738 km) are not linked to the rest of the Province's rural road network. SPTD, in
cooperation with the Shaanxi Provincial Planning Committee (SPPC), Shaanxi Poverty
Alleviation Office (SPAO) and the Leading Group for Transportation for Poverty
Alleviation (LGTPA), has developed a program of Roads Improvement for Poverty
Alleviation (RIPA) to rehabilitate, upgrade and construct road systems in the province's
50 poor counties in order to provide the rural poor better access to the main provincial
highways.
3.20 RIPA Component. The component will finance some of the road improvement
projects that meet agreed economic and social criteria, under procedures similar to the
Roads Improvement Program (RIP) components in other provincial projects in China
(Zhejiang, Henan, and Guangdong). Priority will be given to rural road segments that,
through related road systems, are clearly linked to: (a) current (or planned) productive
and economically viable development projects; and (b) investments enabling productive,
though landlocked, populations to have easier access to education, health and other social
services.



- 22 -
3.21   Selection of RIPA Packages. The criteria, screening and selection process to be
used were agreed with SPTD, and are detailed in Annex 1. As a result, a RIPA program
consisting of 31 highway systems in 25 poor counties and with a total length of about
4,068 km was agreed with SPTD. On the basis of initial analysis of aggregate data for
poor counties and road systems, and of the cost effectiveness of road systems under the
RIPA program, SPTD selected a first batch of RIPA systems for further technical,
economic and social feasibility analyses. The first batch covers five systems with a total
length of about 320 km in three prefectures (Yulin, Shangluo and Ankang).
3.22   Processing of RIPA Packages. The road systems to be financed under this
component will be drawn from the pool of RIPA systems mentioned above (para. 3.21)
and their submission for approval to the Bank will be effected in manageable batches of
projects. The documentation developed as part of the Bank approval process will
constitute a Project File including: (a) an Economic and Social Benefit Analysis (as
detailed in Annex 1) including evidence that each of the proposed systems meets the
agreed EIRR criteria; (b) a Technical Analysis, including proposed works, alternative
engineering designs and estimated costs; (c) an Environmental Action Plan for each
system, and an Environmental Impact Assessment for subprojects that involve new road
construction or substantial widening/land acquisition (para. 3.35); and (d) a Resettlement
Action Plan for each system (where at least 200 people are affected by land acquisition
and/or resettlement). For systems affecting less than 200 persons, specific information
related to impacts, cost estimates and the implementation schedule should be provided
(para. 3.44).
3.23   Supervision and Maintenance of RIPA. Each batch submitted for approval will
also include an Implementation and Supervision Plan, covering the implementation
process,4 supervision5 and monitoring of works, both for each system as well as for the
prefecture and county agency responsible for each system. SPTD will also submit a
Maintenance Plan describing who (township, county or prefecture) will maintain the
system after completion, the organizational structure for maintenance of the RIPA
system, the equipment and personnel needed to implement each maintenance plan and the
training needs anticipated under this plan over the implementation period.
4 The process involves the preparation of design and bid documents, invitation of bids, bid evaluation,
selection of the contractors, signing of contracts, mobilization by contractors and time to physically
implement the works.
5 A RIPA supervision plan will show the construction supervision tasks to be undertaken, organizational
structure for construction supervision, staffing requirements, training of the supervision staff if
necessary, office space, transport and communication requirements, laboratory requirements, and
surveying equipment as well as the estimated cost of supervision.



- 23 -
(e)   Equipment
3.24  The equipment to be provided under the project has been identified by SPTD and
reviewed by the Bank. The agreed lists of equipment, together with their estimated costs,
are available in the project files. These lists include equipment required for operation and
maintenance of the high-grade highways, construction quality control and highway
research, environmental monitoring, maintenance of the existing highway network
including RIPA roads, institutional strengthening of selected institutions, and equipment
for highway safety. The preliminary total equipment cost is estimated at about Y 132
million ($16.0 million), of which $8.3 million would be in foreign currencies. The Bank
and SPTD agreed that the equipment lists should be looked at as subject to reasonable
change with regard to type and number, and consequently, some flexibility should be
exercised during project implementation to properly allow for changing circumstances
and needs.
3.25  Equipment for High-Grade Highways. To set up and efficiently operate the
central laboratory in Xian and the regional laboratories in Huaxian, Jinsuoguan,
Jiangzhuang and Lantian in support of the construction supervision activities, there is a
need for equipment and instruments, particularly for soils and asphalt concrete testing. In
the course of drawing up the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), the equipment and
instruments required to implement the environmental protection measures have been
identified. For the operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways, equipment
requirements have also been identified.
3.26  Equipment for Maintenance of Roads. This equipment consists of urgently
required equipment for routine, periodic maintenance and heavy repair of roads to
replenish the equipment fleet of the provincial and county maintenance units. This
equipment would be used for maintenance of the existing highway network including
RIPA roads.
3.27  Equipment for Institutional Strengthening.  These consist of specialized
equipment for support of the institutions and training schools affiliated with SPTD that
would be strengthened under the proposed project (para. 3.33), as well as equipment for
traffic safety.  The latter consist of equipment required for enforcement of speed
regulations, as well as a computer and related software for treatment of accident data.
Highway Maintenance
3.28  Highways in Shaanxi are generally well maintained.  In 1995, only 30 km
(0.3 percent) of the 8,942 km of trunk highways (national and provincial) were in poor
condition, 30.5 percent in excellent condition, 58.0 percent in good condition and
11.2 percent in average condition. The corresponding conditions for the prefectural roads
(12,445 km) in 1994 were as follows:  3.6 percent excellent, 68.2 percent good,
26.7 percent acceptable and 1.5 percent bad. The conditions for the remaining roads
(about 17,600 km) are not known at this time, but it is generally believed that they are in
worse condition than the other roads. SPTD intends to reduce the percentage of roads in



- 24 -
acceptable and bad conditions. To this effect, assurances were obtained at negotiations
from SPTD that it would, by April 30 of each year commencing in 1997 and ending in
2003, furnish an annual highway maintenance report for the Bank's review and
comments, which would: (a) show the length of each class of road by condition
(excellent, good, fair and bad), (b) establish targets for the following year, including an
estimate of the required physical works (routine maintenance, periodic maintenance,
rehabilitation and upgrading) and the cost thereof, and; (c) measure the results and the
actual expenditures against the targets and the budgetedfunds thereof
3.29  SPTD would carry out a highway maintenance study consisting of four parts: the
first focused on organizational structure and the introduction of market mechanisms in
highway maintenance; the second on improving maintenance methods and techniques,
with emphasis on more mechanization; the third on improved methods of collecting and
analyzing traffic volume data, and; the fourth on the development of a provincial Road
Data Bank system. Annex 3 summarizes the TOR for the proposed study, which will be
undertaken by a team of local specialists assisted by international experts. The results of
the study would benefit MOC and all provincial Communication/Transport Departments
in China. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall. (a) by June 30,
1996, establish a Leading Group to guide the highway maintenance study and to provide
comments on the results and recommendations thereof; (b) undertake and, by
September 30, 1998, complete the said study in accordance with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank; (c) by December 31, 1998, furnish the said study, together with
the comments of the said Leading Group, to the Bank for review; and (d) take
appropriate steps to implement the said study's recommendations, taking into
consideration the comments thereon of the Bank and the said Leading Group.
(f)   Road Safety Program
3.30  During 1990-94, an average of 8,000 traffic accidents per year occurred on
Shaanxi's highways, resulting in 1,530 fatalities and 4,500 injuries. Annex 4 summarizes
the existing road safety situation in Shaanxi and related problems and presents an
implementable road safety program, which was confirmed with SPTD and the Traffic
Police for inclusion it in the proposed project.
3.31  The design of the high-grade highways included in the project as well as their
linking roads was reviewed from a safety point of view by the Italian design review
consultants and Danish and Norwegian safety experts. Consequently, those designs have
been prepared to a high standard and reflect safety considerations adequately. The road
safety program included under the project comprises: (a) establishing a Leading Group
for Traffic Safety Coordination to coordinate between SPTD and the Traffic Police (the
main agencies involved in highway safety). It is expected that the Leading Group for
Road Safety Coordination would be established by the end of February 1996. Its
establishment would be a condition of project presentation to the Board and its continued
operation would be confirmed in the annual Project Monitoring Reports; (b) improving
traffic accident reporting forms, reviewing the geographic location (of accidents) coding



- 25 -
system, installing a Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP); (c) establishing
a Traffic Safety Unit in SPTD and training its staff to undertake accident black spot
identification and design and carry out a pilot program of black spot improvements and
establish safety and audit procedures and checks; (d) undertaking a study to evaluate the
driver training system, including one month of support by an international expert (see
Appendix 1 of Annex 4 for terms of reference); (e) provision of equipment to support the
above-mentioned activities, and; (f) evaluation of the implementation of the Shaanxi
Road Safety Program by an independent local expert (I person-month). SPTD agreed to
provide a special budget of Y 10 million ($1.20 million) over four years to cover the cost
of the accident black spot pilot program and traffic safety studies under (d) and (f) above.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that Shaanxi would maintain: (a) a Leading
Group with representatives from SPTD and the Traffic police, for traffic safety
coordination, policy-making and planning, with functions and responsibilities acceptable
to the Bank, and (b) a Traffic Safety Unit within SPTD, with functions and
responsibilities acceptable to the Bank, to serve as the Secretariat for the said Leading
Group and to carry out a pilot black spot improvement program under terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank Also, agreement was reached during negotiations that SPTD
would, pursuant to terms of reference acceptable to the Bank: (a) by December 31, 2000,
complete a black spot identification and improvement program; (b) by December 31,
2001, have an expert acceptable to the Bank prepare an evaluatio of its Road Safety
Program according to indicators acceptable to the Bank
(g)   Institutional Strengthening and Training
3.32  The purpose of the Institutional Strengthening and Training (IST) component is
to strengthen the SPTD capabilities in the following priority areas: (a) High-Grade
Highway construction supervision and operations; (b) Project Implementation
Management; (c) Highway Planning; and (d) maintenance of High-Grade Highways and
Other Roads. It will also strengthen SPTD's capabilities in new areas of investment,
specifically in: (e) studying the feasibility and preferred location of the Xian east-west
bypass; (f) Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation and (g) Road Safety. The total
cost of the Institutional Strengthening and Training component is estimated at Y 45.10
million, of which $3.10 million are in foreign currencies (Table 3.3).
3.33  The IST Component will consist of three elements:
(a)   Intensive Strengthening (IS) of research and training organizations
through the development of staff capabilities to deliver training in new
areas and in bolstering their hardware and equipment for new functional
capacity. This element would include activities in the following institutes
and centers
(i)   the Provincial Traffic School (PTS) (Chart 7) and the Provincial
Traffic Technical School (PTTS) (Chart 8), which are both under
the supervision of SPTD's Education Division, strengthening of



- 26 -
staff capabilities and program offerings in traffic engineering and
in high-grade highway maintenance programs;
(ii)   the in-service Vocational School (VS) (Chart 8) and the SPTD's
short-term management in-service Staff Training Center (STC );
(iii)   the Highway Research Institute (HRI) (Chart 9) and at the Shaanxi
Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute.(SPHSDI);
(iv)    other institutions of SPTD such as the Provincial Information
Center.
(b)   Training for SPTD and project personnel within Shaanxi (2,975 trainees
for 2,490 person-months of training), in other Chinese provincial training
institutes and schools (80 person-months) and abroad (63 person-months).
The total level of training under the project involves 3,278 persons for a
total of 2,898.6 person-months at an estimated cost of Y 10.13 million
($1.22 million), of which $0.91 million in foreign currencies. This
estimate includes projected training in the areas of environmental
monitoring and supervision (Annex 5), and construction supervision (see
para 3.17). Table 3.4 presents a short description of each training activity,
both in China and abroad, number of trainees and the total person-months.
(c)   Strengthening New Functional areas. This element would consist of:
(i)    Study of Xian Bypass. The Xian Bypass constitutes a part of the
east-west NTHS corridor passing through Xian. The study would
investigate the various reasonable alternative locations, compare
them from traffic service, economic and financial, environmental,
archeological and resettlement aspects; select the best alternative
and determine its economic and financial viability as well as the
interim improvements until the bypass is implemented. Annex 2
includes the terms of reference (TOR) for the proposed study. The
study will be conducted by a team of local experts supported by
nationally  renowned  traffic,  city  planning,  economic,
environmental and archeological experts, as well as three
international experts in the areas of urban planning and transport
development, traffic engineering and highway design, and
archeology, resettlement and environment.  Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall (1) maintain a review
panel comprising representatives of the concerned provincial
agencies and the central government to guide the study of the Xian
east-west bypass and provide comments on the results and
recommendations thereof; (2) undertake and, by June 30, 1997,
complete tne said study in accordance with terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank; (3) by August 31, 1997, furnish the study



- 27 -
to the panel and the Bank for review; and (4) take appropriate
steps to implement the recommendations of the said study, taking
into account the comments thereon of the said review panel and the
Bank
(ii)    Road Maintenance Studies will be carried out as part of the IS
component.  The various parts will focus on improving the
organization of highway maintenance, the allocation of funds
among different maintenance activities, methods of maintenance,
the monitoring of maintenance and the use of an RDB/PMS system
to make these more useful as tools of highway investment planning
(para. 3.28);
(iii)   Support of the Roads Improvement for Poverty Alleviation
(RIPA) component through two main avenues: (1) strengthening
of the capacity of the Unit in SPTD's Highway Administration
Bureau dealing with Poverty Alleviation; and (2) provision of
training, particularly in Road Maintenance (both management and
technical aspects) to county- and township-level personnel.
(iv)    Support to the Road Safety component through provision of
training and hardware for staff in the SPTD's Traffic Safety Unit.
D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
3.34 Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been carried out for all the major
highways and link roads included in the proposed project. Environmental Action Plans
(EAPs) have been prepared, incorporating Bank comments on earlier drafts, and found
satisfactory to the Bank, as were the EIAs. However, as the documents for the Xian-
Sanyuan Highway have only recently been received and are currently being reviewed, the
submittal of an acceptable environmental assessment and action plan for this highway
wouild be a condition of negotiation.
3.35  For the RIPA component of the proposed project, it was agreed that a Sectoral
Environmental Assessment approach would be applied. All RIPA subprojects will be
classified into two categories. Category I subprojects are those with no new road
construction nor substantial widening/land acquisition, etc. Since no major adverse
impacts are anticipated, only EAPs will be prepared for this category of subprojects.
Category II subprojects are those with new road construction or substantial widening/land
acquisition, etc. For these, both EIAs and EAPs will be prepared. EIA reports and EAPs
for the first-year package of subprojects were prepared and submitted to the Bank in May
1995. Only one of these systems was classified as Category II subproject. All project
EIPs and EIAs are satisfactory to the Bank.
3.36  Major enviromnental impacts include noise and air pollution during the
construction and operation phases (particularly Weinan-Tongguan Expressway,



- 28 -
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway and Xian-Sanyuan Class I Highway), alteration
of hydrological regimes, soil erosion and impacts on local ecology during the
construction (all projects but particularly Tongchuan-Huangling Highway and Lantian-
Xiaoshangyuan Highway), impacts on cultural relics (particularly Tongchuan-Huangling
Highway and Weinan-Tongguan Expressway), and transportation of construction
materials (all projects).
3.37  The EAPs specified the appropriate mitigation measures, enviromnental
monitoring plans, institutional arrangements to implement the EAPs, training and
equipment requirements, and the budget needed for environmental protection. Major
mitigation measures include adequate selection of alignment, appropriate design of
culverts and overpasses/underpasses to minimize social disruption, reconstruction of
irrigation channels where appropriate, water sprinkling to prevent dust during the
construction, construction of noise barriers and forest belts, installation of double-glass
windows, etc., to minimize noise and air pollution during the operation phase. The
engineering design and technical specifications for the highways will incorporate
appropriate measures required to be taken for environmental protection.  It was
ascertained that the proposed highways would not affect ecologically sensitive areas and
that their construction and operation should have no adverse impact on the environment
through the implementation of EAPs. The summary of the EIAs and EAPs are presented
in Annex 5 and copies of the EIAs and EAPs are available in the Project File and the
Public Information Center. Assurance were obtained at negotiations from SPTD that:
(a) the environmental protection measures stipulated in the EAPs and preparation of
EAPs for RIPA systems for subsequent years would be carried out in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) SPTD would furnish to the Bank an annual
environmental monitoring report for the high-grade highways during the construction
phase andfor each of the first three years following completion of construction..
E. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
3.38  In compliance with Chinese laws and regulations, which generally conform to the
Bank's policies on involuntary resettlement, SPTD prepared the resettlement action plans
(RAPs) for all project high-grade highways (including the respective linking roads), and
the first year package of the RIPA component. As the RAP for the Xian-Sanyuan
Highway has only recently been received in the Bank and is still being reviewed, the
submittal of a RAP acceptable to the Bank for this highway would be a condition of
negotiations. These RAPs form the basis for implementation of resettlement and land
acquisition in the proposed project. The main objective of the resettlement program is to
ensure that all categories of affected persons are able to at least restore, if not improve,
their standard of living after resettlement. Also, every effort is exerted to minimize
acquisition of productive farmland and residential areas and enterprises in order to reduce
adverse project impacts.

High-Grade Highways
3.39 Approximately 14,213 mu of land (948 ha) affecting 13,097 persons will need to
be acquired and 548 houses (2,477 persons) and 34 enterprises (employing 2,156
workers) will be affected by the high-grade highways. About 3,734 mu (249 ha) will also
need to be leased temporarily during construction. The total number of persons affected
is 17,730. Most of those affected by the loss of land will be rehabilitated through
redistribution of land in their existing villages. However, 1,042 affected people will be
provided with nonagriculture-based resettlement and their residence registration will be
changed from "rural" to "urban." As for affected enterprises, 23 (employing 1,736
people) will need to be relocated. The total number of people relocated will be 2,154
(467 households). A detailed socioeconomic survey of the affected persons will be
carried out by the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) before the RAPs are
implemented. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the entire project is
about $45 million.
3.40  Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations. The affected
people will be informed through newspaper, radio, television, etc. about the project and
the proposed land acquisition and resettlement program. The Land Acquisition and
Resettlement (LA&R) institutions will also disseminate information through meetings,
documents and notices. The affected persons will be informed about the compensation
standards, the LA&R institutions at the various levels, the arrangements for provision of
nonagricultural jobs, the provisions for redressal of grievances and the proposed
arrangements for internal and external monitoring of the LA&R program. This will be
done by distributing a Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) to each affected
household. The RIB will be distributed to the affected households two months after
completion of project negotiations.
3.41  Implementation. Implementation of the RAPs (except for Tongchuan-Huangling
Highway) was initiated in October 1995 and will be completed by the end of September
1996, i.e., at least one month before the proposed start of construction.  The
implementation of the Tongchuan-Huangling RAP will start in August 1996 and will be
completed in May 1997. The resettlement process will be administered by the respective
local governments at city/county, township and village levels in accordance with the
terms of agreement between SPTD and the local governments involved, which will be
based on the provisions of the RAPs. A leading group will be set up for each high-grade
highway for coordination with local governments in accordance with the provisions of the
RAPs. A summary of the RAPs for the high-grade highways and linking roads is
presented in Annex 6. A copy of the RAPs will be deposited in the Public Information
Center. Assurances were obtained at negotiations from SPG that all LA&R activities
with respect to the high-grade highways and linking roads as well as the RIPA
subprojects would be completed according to the RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank



- 30 -
3.42  Grievance Redressal and Appeals Process. If any affected person is dissatisfied
with any aspect of LA&R, they can lodge a complaint wit the respective county-level
LA&R office or directly to the LA&R monitoring office under the LARLG. If the issue
is not resolved within three weeks, a written grievance can be submitted to the LARLG.
The LARLG should resolve the issue within four weeks. If the affected person is not
satisfied by the decision of the LARLG, he/she can lodge a written appeal to the county-
level people's court. In case the decision of the county-level court fails to satisfy the
affected person, a second appeal can be lodged in the court of the city/prefecture. The
decision of this court will be final and binding. These arrangements are considered
satisfactory.
3.43 Monitoring and Evaluation. Implementation of the RAPs would be internally
and externally monitored for physical progress, disbursements and audits and
socioeconomic impacts.
(a)   Internal Monitoring. The internal monitoring, to be carried out by the
provincial government, will monitor the implementation of the RAPs. A
summary of internal monitoring will be submitted every six months to the
Bank.  The first internal monitoring report will be submitted by
September 30, 1996.
(b)   External Monitoring.  The task of external monitoring of RAPs'
implementation by an independent agency has been entrusted by SPTD to
SASS. Apart from physical monitoring of the LA&R program, which will
also be carried out by the internal monitoring agencies, SASS will
concentrate on evaluation of the implementation of the RAPs. External
monitoring will start along with the initiation of LA&R activities and will
continue one year beyond project completion (until 2001). Monitoring
reports will be prepared every six months and submitted to the project
head office and to the Bank. The first external monitoring report will be
submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1996. A final monitoring and
evaluation report will also be prepared after project completion (based on
"follow-up" socioeconomic survey of the affected persons) and submitted
to the Bank by December 31, 2001.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the monitoring of the socioeconomic
impact of the resettlement process for the high-grade highways and linking roads as well
as for the Xian-Sanyuan Highway and the RIPA roads would be carried out against the
RAPs in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Implementation of the RAPs would also be
monitored through the routine project supervision and project quarterly progress reports
(paras. 3.74-3.76).
RIPA
3.44  The RAPs for the first year's package of the RIPA component have been prepared
by SPTD and found to be satisfactory by the Bank. Separate RAPs will be prepared for



- 31 -
each system under the RIPA component where 200 or more persons are affected by land
acquisition and/or resettlement. For systems affecting less than 200 persons, specific
information related to project impacts, cost estimates and the implementation schedule
will be prepared. Approval of the RAPs for the RIPA component will be a condition of
disbursement for these systems. About 1,248 mu (83.2 ha) of land will be acquired for
the roads under the RIPA component, constituting the first year's package. About 1,291
persons will be affected by land acquisition and 355 persons will need to be relocated.
The compensation and resettlement policies and the implementation framework for land
acquisition and resettlement under the RIPA component are the same as those for the
high-grade highways and the linking roads. The external monitoring and evaluation of
resettlement implementation under the RIPA component will be carried out by SASS on
the same lines as described for the high-grade highways.
F. COST ESTIMATES
3.45  The total project is estimated to cost about Y 4.62 billion or about $557 million
equivalent, including land acquisition and physical and price contingencies, as
summarized in the table on the following page and as detailed in the Project Cost
Summary (Table 3.5). The foreign exchange cost is estimated at about $213 million, or
about 38 percent of the total. Base costs are estimated in December 1995 prices.
Physical contingencies are calculated at 10 percent of the base cost of works and
construction supervision of the high-grade highways, linking roads and RIPA component.
Price contingencies have been calculated for foreign costs, using international annual
escalation factors of 3.3 percent in 1996, 2.3 percent in 1997, and 2.5 percent in each of
1998, 1999 and 2000. Price contingencies for local costs are based on local annual
escalation factors of 10.5 percent in 1996, 8.5 percent in 1997, 7.0 percent in 1998,
6.5 percent in 1999, and 6.2 percent in 2000.
3.46  The costs of civil works are based on work quantities calculated from preliminary
or final engineering designs. The costs were computed on the basis of MOC's standard
manuals for labor and equipment productivity, the related annually updated costs and the
current market costs of materials. The unit rates were checked against the unit prices
provided in recent bids for similar highway works executed under Bank financing.
3.47  The estimated cost of equipment is based on prevailing prices and those quoted by
manufacturers and suppliers and includes the cost of equipment delivered in Xian, taxes,
spare parts, and related training if needed to operate and maintain the equipment. The
estimated cost of consulting services are based on recent contracts for similar services
under ongoing highway projects.

G. FINANCING
3.48   The Bank loan of $210 million would finance about 38 percent of the total project
cost or 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost. The Central Government (MOC) would
provide the equivalent of about $144.6 million, while Shaanxi Province would provide
the equivalent of about $201.9 million to meet the remaining costs of the project,
including contingencies. MOC's funding would be restricted to the construction of the
high-grade highways and RIPA. The Bank loan of $210 million would be at the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single-currency loans. It would be lent to the
Ministry of Finance for a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds
of the Bank loan would be onlent to Shaanxi Province at the same rate payable to the
Bank by the Borrower with 0.75 percent per annum commitment fee on the outstanding
balance, beginning 60 days after loan signing, less any waiver. Agreement was reached



- 33 -
with the Borrower at negotiations that it would onlend the proceeds of the loan to the
SPG on these terms. SPG would bear the foreign exchange risks. The Government of
China and Shaanxi Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single-currency loan
terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of
their borrowings by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities with that of
their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They
selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of the loan,
compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The
Borrower judges that it can manage any interest rate risk. China is eligible for single-
currency loans under the expanded program. This loan represents 8.5 percent of the fiscal
year 1996 IBRD lending program to China, well within the 50 percent volume guideline
approved by the Bank The details of project financing are shown in the following table.

H. IMPLEMENTATION
3.49  Implementing Agencies. The implementation of the project would be the
responsibility of SPTD. The execution of WTE, THH, FJTH, LTWMH and their linking
roads would be organized by the Project Execution Office-PEO-in SPTD (Chart 10)
and SHGHAB. The execution of LXH and RIPA component would be organized by
PEO and SPHAB. The General Supervision Office under SPTD would be in charge of



- 34 -
supervision of construction of the project. Concerning the high-grade highways, the
supervision of construction would be undertaken by a joint international/local supervision
team. PEO would carry out the implementation of equipment procurement, IST and
studies on the Xian bypass, road maintenance and road safety. Implementation of the
road safety component will be the responsibility of SPTD and the Traffic Police in PSB,
with the Leading Group for Traffic Safety Coordination providing coordination between
them. The International Tendering Company (ITC) would be retained by SPTD as the
procurement agency for all aspects of civil works of the project requiring ICB and for
equipment to be procured from abroad. Upon completion of the high-grade highways, it
is expected that SHGHAB and SPHAB would be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the highways in accordance with their own job scope. Since the high-
grade highways are segments of the national highway system, MOC would also provide
general supervision and guidance for execution of the project.
3.50 High-Grade Highways and Linking Roads. The implementation program for
high-grade highways is shown in Annex 7. All civil works except for THH would be
tendered at the same time. THH is expected to be tendered in early 1997. The traffic
engineering contracts would be tendered about the middle period of the civil works for
each high-grade highway. The invitation for prequalification of contractors for civil
works for high-grade highways was issued in November 1995 and the whole
prequalification process would be finished by March 1996.
3.51  The detailed designs and draft bidding documents (17 contract sections) were
completed by the end of December 1995. Acquisition of land and the resettlement
process are expected to be completed by the end of September 1996. The installation of
E&M systems for the operation of WTE would be scheduled to commence around March
1999 and be completed by June 2000. The construction of service facilities along the
high-grade highways would be a continuous process during the implementation period.
The high-grade highways are expected to be completed by December 2000.
3.52 Supervision of Construction of the High-Grade Highways and Linking
Roads.  A team  of provincial personnel, local engineers and technicians, and
international consultants would be established to supervise the construction of the high-
grade highways and the linking roads. The joint supervision team (JST) would be headed
by a Chief Supervision Engineer. A Resident Engineer would be stationed on site for
each of the 17 civil works contracts. Terms of reference for the consultants were
approved by the Bank. Invitations to short-listed consulting firns (to be approved by the
Bank) for supervision of construction would be issued in February 1996. A firm would
be selected in July 1996. The consultants would be mobilized in September 1996 to
begin training of local personnel in construction supervision and help set up the
supervision organization.
3.53  RIPA.  The relevant highway departments at city or prefecture levels are
responsible for the preparation of designs and bid documents for the systems included in
RIPA and these documents would be reviewed and approved by SPHAB.  The



- 35 -
construction of the systems included in the first package is expected to start in July 1996
and to be completed by March 1998. The construction of the subsystems to be included
in the second, third and fourth packages is expected to start in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively, and to be completed by the end of 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. For
procurement purposes, RIPA systems will be divided into several manageable contract
(bid) sections. Construction of the RIPA roads will be supervised in accordance with the
arrangements summarized in para. 3.23.
3.54 Training. Because of the large size and diversity of the training component,
SPTD would appoint a full-time Institutional and Training Coordinator responsible for
managing the component. He would relate to all organizations in the sector with which
the component is concerned and would share financial control over the resources
allocated under this component. Formal selection procedures for candidates to be trained
would be developed and agreed with the Bank. Training abroad would be preceded by
training within China with the best performers selected for training abroad. Also, all
trainees to be sent abroad would have a good working knowledge of English or else
would take a three-month English language course prior to traveling abroad. Each trainee
would be required to submit a report on training received to his/her parent department or
agency. Moreover, SPTD has indicated that training to be provided under the project
would be related to career development and the professional growth of the selected staff.
At negotiations, agreement was reached that Shaanxi Province shall, by June 30 of each
year commencing in 1996, furnish a rolling two-year training implementation schedule to
the Bank and shall carry out the training under a program acceptable to the Bank.
3.55  Equipment. PEO would be responsible for procurement of equipment. The
equipment required for laboratories, environmental monitoring, strengthening of highway
network maintenance and institutional strengthening would be procured at an early stage
of project implementation (1996/97), while that for the operation and maintenance of the
high-grade highways is scheduled to be procured toward the end of the high-grade
highway construction (1998/1999).
3.56  The project as a whole is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 2001, with
the loan closing date stipulated as December 31, 2001. The implementation schedule for
the project is presented in Annex 7.
3.57 Operation and Maintenance of High-Grade Highways. Shaanxi Province
intends to operate the new highways as toll facilities consistent with their design. Tolls
would be collected at about 19 points (Map IBRD 27048). To ensure that the toll rates
would be appropriately structured and that toll levels would not lead to a substantial
reduction in the benefits of highway investment, the rationale for setting the level of
tolling would be determined based on the findings of a study to be undertaken by the
Province, which takes into consideration latest experience with operation of toll roads in
China as well as similar studies done under Bank-financed highway projects in China.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations from SPG that SPTD shall undertake, and by
June 30, 1999, furnish to the Bank for its review and comments, an analysis and



- 36 -
recommendation for the structure of toll rates on the high-grade highways, taking into
consideration the results of the recent studies on toll rate structures under the Bank-
financed highway projects in China, and the recent experience with toll rates on major
roads in Shaanxi Province and other parts of China.
3.58 High-grade highways except LXH will be operated and maintained by SHGHAB,
with headquarters in Xian (Chart 11). This bureau is expected to establish three
management departments, among which one is in charge of Xian-Tongguan Expressway,
one in charge of Xian-Huangling Class I Highway, and the other in charge of Xian-Baoji
Highway. Under the Xian-Tongguan Expressway Management Department, there are
three Management Offices. One of these management offices is responsible for LTWMH
and the remaining two offices are responsible for WTE. The Xian-Huangling Class I
Highway Management Department has four management offices under its jurisdiction.
Two of these offices are in charge of THH. Also, the Xian-Baoji Highway Management
Department has four management offices, of which Jiangzhuang Management Office is
responsible for FJTH.
3.59 The Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II auto-only Highway will be operated and
maintained by SPHAB with two management offices in Heilongkou and Lantian.
Construction of these management offices, as well as their equipment needs, are included
in the proposed project. SHGHAB is already operating some high-grade highways in
Shaanxi and, following the institutional strengthening contained in the proposed project,
SHGHAB is expected to be capable of properly operating and maintaining the high-grade
highways.
1. PROCUREMENT
3.60  Procurement under the project would be carried out as shown in the following
table. The procurement arrangements for the project have taken into account the
experience gained from previous Bank-financed highway projects. The documentation,
for procurement, which covers the prequalification of contractors, ICB and National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) for civil works, ICB for goods and consultant services
contracts has been standardized for Chinese conditions in cooperation between the
Chinese government and the Bank. Standard documents would be used for all relevant
procurement processes under the project.

contingencies but exclude the cost of land acquisition and resettlement,
which is shown as a separate component.
3.61  Works. The civil works for the high-grade highways would be divided into 17
contract sections. WTE would be divided into five contract sections, THH into seven
contract sections, LXH and FJTH into two sections each, and one contract section for
LTWMH. Electromechanical works would be handled as three contracts. Administration



- 38 -
and maintenance buildings, service areas and toll plazas would be carried out in several
small contracts. The linking roads (three road sections) would be included in the
corresponding contract sections of the main high-grade highways because of the small
size of the works involved. Contracts for civil works and for electromechanical works for
the high-grade highways (100 percent of total) with a total cost of $356.5 million would
be procured under ICB procedures. Contracts would be bid on a slice and package basis;
qualified firms would be allowed to bid for more than one contract so as to attract
international contractors and  large  Chinese  contractors.   The  contracts for
electromechanical works would be bid later during the construction of the high-grade
highways. All contractors for the 17 ICB contracts for civil works would be prequalified.
Domestic contractors competing under ICB would be eligible for a 7.5 percernt price
preference. Domestic contractors are expected to be competitive for all contracts under
this project
3.62  Other works, including small service facilities (toll plazas, maintenance depots,
service and rest areas, administrative buildings, etc.), Xian-Sanyuan Highway, and RIPA
roads, would be awarded following NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. These
works would involve contracts estimated to cost less than $2 million per contract, up to
an aggregate amount of about $59.7 million. Since these contracts are small in value and
scattered throughout the Province and would be implemented over a four-year period,
ICB would therefore be neither justified nor practical, but international firms would not
be precluded from bidding.
3.63 Based on experience with the Road Improvement Program (RIP) in the ongoing
Zhejiang (Loan 3471-CHA), Guangdong (Loan 3530-CHA, and Henan (Loan 3531-
CHA) Provincial Highway projects, generally not more than three bids are received for
contracts whose value is $2.0 million or less. Moreover, most of the bidders come from
the immediate area of the contract works. RIPA involves smaller works and lower value
contracts than RIP, and the works are spread over a very large geographic area. Hence,
for RIPA contracts whose cost is $0.5 million (Y 4.2 million) or less and up to $23.8
million in aggregate, simplified procurement procedures, whereby a minimum of three
bids are invited, would be followed. This has the advantages of time savings in the
bidding process as well as creating more job opportunities for the poor during
construction. Since employment creation is important in the case of RIPA roads, when
the two lowest evaluated bids are within 5 percent of each other, the number of local
people to be employed by each contractor would be considered in the final award of
contract. This will be done by assigning a value of Y 300 per person-month and by
deducting the value of employment from the bid price. The bidder with the lowest
"adjusted" evaluated bid price would be selected.
3.64 Implementation of the Xian-Sanyuan Highway involves a large number of small-
value contracts spread over a large geographic area. As this highway is already open to
traffic and carries a high traffic volume, these works have to be carried out with least
disruption to traffic. Hence, some of these works, with a total value of about $12.2
million would be procured through force account. Also, in the case of very small RIPA



- 39 -
contracts, and under special conditions to be justified by SPHAB, force account could
also be used for procurement of civil works with a total estimated cost of 20 percent,
about $15.9 million, of the total RIPA component. Force account would also be used for
improvement of black spots, with a total estimated value of $1.6 million. This is justified
on the basis of the small value of the works and their wide geographic distribution. The
total estimated cost of the works to be procured by force account is $29.7 million.
3.65  Equipment. Generally, all contracts for goods and equipment costing more than
$250,000 equivalent would be awarded under ICB. However, for equipment where the
number of suppliers is small, limited international bidding would be followed, in an
aggregate amount not exceeding $1 million. All other items or groups of items covering
minor maintenance equipment, laboratories, research and environmental protection
purposes estimated to cost less than $250,000 per contract package, in an aggregate
amount not exceeding $2.5 million would be procured following shopping procedures on
the basis of a comparison of price quotations solicited from at least three suppliers
eligible under the Bank Guidelines for Procurement. Domestic manufactures competing
under ICB would be eligible for a margin of preference in the comparison of bids of
15 percent for goods, or the prevailing custom duties, whichever is lower.
3.66  Consultants. All consultants required for construction supervision, staff training
and studies of the Xian Bypass, highway maintenance, and highway safety would be
selected and employed under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank in accordance
with Bank Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Local expertise available in the various
provincial universities and institutes in the highway subsector would be used as much as
possible.
3.67  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. SPTD requested advance
contracting and retroactive financing in the following areas:
(a)   Traffic Engineering for Xian-Sanyuan Highway. This would allow
safe operation of this road as a fully access-controlled highway by mid-
1997. The amount subject to retroactive financing is estimated at about
$2.3 million.
(b)   Consultants for the Study of the Xian Bypass. This would allow timely
preparation of the study of alternatives and selection of best alternative to
ensure continuity of a high level of traffic service on the east-west trunk
highway (312) through Xian. The amount subject to retroactive financing
is about $60,000.
(c)   Consultants for Development of RDB. This would ensure completion of
development of a provincial level RDB, before the end of 1998, to serve
as an important input into MOC's plans for development of a national
RDB. The amount subject to retroactive financing is about $100,000.



- 40 -
3.68   Agreement to the above three requests for advance contracting and retroactive
financing is recommended, subject to SPTD completing all Bank requirements, including
those for procurement, environment and resettlement. The total amount subject to
retroactive financing is estimated at about $2.5 million. All of this amount would apply
to expenditures after July 1, 1995.
3.69   Bank Review.  Prior review procedures would be used for:  (a) civil works
contracts with an estimated cost of $2 million (Y 17 million) or more; (b) equipment with
an estimated cost of more than $250,000 per contract; and (c) consulting services with an
estimated contract cost of more than $100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals.
This represents about 76 percent and 71 per cent of the estimated value of works contracts
and goods respectively. For contracts below the above-mentioned limits, post-review
procedures would be followed.
J. DISBURSEMENTS
3.70   The proposed Bank loan of $210 million would be disbursed over a period of
about six years, as follows:
Category                           Amount of the     Percent of Expenditures to be Financed

Total                                 210.0
3.71   To  facilitate disbursements, a Special Account would be opened with an
authorized allocation of $17 million equivalent, the estimated average expenditures for a
four-month period. The account would be opened in US dollars in a bank acceptable to
the Bank, and managed by the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Bureau. Applications for
replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or whenever the
Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of its initial deposit, whichever comes first.



- 41 -
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Table 3.6, which takes into
consideration the project disbursement profile for transport projects in China and the
potential risks of delay in project implementation.
3.72  Disbursements would be made against authorized payment requests for work done
under priced contracts for the civil works and for the delivery and installation of the
equipment. Interim certification of civil works completed and costed at unit rates in the
contracts will be prepared by the contractors, reviewed by the supervision teams/units and
payments authorized by PEO. Retroactive financing of up to $2.5 million would be
applied to expenditures made after July 1, 1995 for providing full access control to the
Xian-Sanyuan Highway and consultants for the Xian Bypass Study and the Highway
Maintenance Study. Disbursements for staff training in China or abroad would be made
from the Special Account against the actual costs of travel, subsistence and tuition or
training fees. For expenditures relating to contracts for works of $2 million of less,
training, force account, contracts for goods, each valued at $250,000 equivalent or less,
and contracts for services each valued at $100,000 equivalent or less for firms and
$50,000 equivalent or less for individuals, reimbursement would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting SOEs would be retained
by the implementing agencies and made available for review by the Bank supervision
missions.
K. AUDITING
3.73  The Foreign Investment Audit Bureau of the State Auditing Administration
(SAA) would be responsible for auditing of project expenditures. Actual audits would be
carried out for SAA by the Shaanxi Branch of SAA or the Shaanxi Provincial Audit
Administration Agreement was reached with SPG during negotiations that the project
accounts and the Special Accounts, including SOEs, would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that audit reports would be sent to the
Bank for review within six months of the close of each fiscal year. In the case of the
SOEs, the audit report would contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the
SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals. The
Bank Group currently accepts SAA audits for this purpose.
L. PROJECT SUPERVISION, REPORTING AND MONITORING
3.74  Supervision. The project would be supervised through Bank missions whose
frequency would be guided by the progress of the works. However, on the average, a
mission at about nine-month intervals would be mounted; a Supervision Mission Plan is
presented in Annex 8. In addition to field missions, staff input would be provided at
headquarters for project-related activities such as completion of supervision reports,
procurement documentation and contracts, staff training and equipment proposals and
follow-up and review of the studies on the Xian Bypass, highway safety, and highway
maintenance. Moreover, the Bank would monitor progress of implementation of all



- 42 -
project components through quarterly progress reports to be submitted to the Bank. In
addition, SPTD would submit to the Bank monthly reports on progress of works for the
high-grade highways. A copy of each of the outline quarter and monthly progress reports
is available in the Project File. It is estimated that over the implementation period of the
project the total time expended on supervision would be in the order of 80 person-weeks.
3.75  Monitoring.  During implementation, project performance, including the
achievement of physical targets and attainment of other project objectives will be
monitored by SPTD, PEO, SHGHAB and SHAB through the use of performance
indicators, reports on the environment and land acquisition and resettlement, progress
reports and auditing of project accounts. In addition, upon completion, the project will be
reviewed in an Implementation Completion Report. Annex 9 presents the outline
monitoring plan for the project. The plan defines for each of the project components
indices that will track annual progress in attaining targets during implementation and
impact objectives after the project is completed. The plan specifies how, with what
frequency and by whom, the data for the indicators will be collected. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that SPTD shall, on the basis of performance indicators
acceptable to the Bank, prepare and furnish to the Bank by March 31 of each year
commencing in 1997 and ending three years after completion of the project, an annual
monitoring report, in a form satisfactory to the Bank covering all components of the
project and assessing the extent to which different implementation and development
objectives have been attained in the course ofproject execution and operation.
3.76  Reporting. Based on the monitoring activities described in Annex 9, SPTD will
submit to the Bank an annual monitoring report. This report will be based on the
following reports, which will be submitted to the Bank during the course of a given year:
(a)   A  series of internal and external (independent) monitoring reports
assessing the impact of land acquisition and resettlement on various
segments of the local population, describing the income restoration
strategies followed and the number of people rehabilitated (para. 3.43 and
Annex 6);
(b)   Annual environmental monitoring reports during the construction phase
and the first three years of the operation phase of the high-grade highways
(Annex 5);
(c)   Annual audit reports for the project accounts and financial statements
(para. 3.73);
(d)   Quarterly progress reports for all project activities (including highway
safety) and up-to-date performance indicators (para. 3.74);
(e)   A report, by an independent agency/expert, on the completion of the
highway safety component within six months of the completion of this
component; and



- 43 -
(f)   A Project Implementation Completion Report would be prepared and
submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the loan closing date.



- 44 -
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.1   The economic analysis for the proposed project focuses on the civil works
components that, together with associated construction supervision and design, survey,
and testing, account for over 97 percent of the project base cost. There are two major
subcomponents: (a) the five high-grade highways and their linking roads, and (b) the
RIPA component. Because of the relatively short length and corresponding low
construction cost of the linking roads (21 km for roads), no separate economic analyses
were conducted for these roads. Instead, they were included in the analyses for the high-
grade highways.  The economic analyses were initially prepared by the Shaanxi
Provincial Highway Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) and were reviewed and
updated by the Bank staff in consultation with SPHSDI personnel during project
preparation and appraisal.
A. MAIN BENEFITS AND BENEFICIARIES
4.2   Benefits from the project would accrue to road users in the form of transport cost
and time savings.  Many road users are own-account operators for the producer
enterprises and, mostly in rural areas, a growing segment of privately-owned operators
and farmers, who would capture the benefits of the project directly. Public freight and
passenger services are also likely to respond to increased competition so that transport
costs savings would be passed on to the users. Passengers would, in addition, enjoy the
time savings offered by the project, and the greater riding comfort from better road
surfaces. In the case of RIPA subprojects, social benefits will accrue in the form of
improved access to health and educational facilities and access to clean drinking water
(resulting in lower death rates, fewer work days lost due to sickness, lower educational
dropout rates and increased adult literacy level) and a reduction in expenditures for the
food-for-work program. Also, the feeling of "isolation" would be reduced and the greater
reliability of transport service resulting from the provision of all-weather roads should
provide incentives for more intensive and diversified productive activities.
4.3   The project is intended to encourage better highway management and
maintenance through institutional strengthening of various departments, institutes and
training schools of SPTD, the studies of the Xian Bypass and highway maintenance, and
the provision of modem maintenance equipment. The road safety program can be
expected to result in a reduced number of accidents due to the support it gives to the
traffic police and SPTD and due to the demonstration effect of the accident black spot
pilot program. The project also is intended to strengthen public works procurement
procedures and to upgrade management of the construction entities. The proper design of
all highways included in the infrastructure components of the project should reduce the
number of accidents, and reduced congestion on the existing roads along the high-grade



- 45 -
highways should improve conditions for local traffic, including bicycles and agricultural
vehicles.
B. EVALUATION OF HIGH-GRADE HIGHWAYS
4.4   Economic evaluation was conducted for each of the five high-grade highways
included in the project. SPHSPDI prepared a separate technical feasibility study for each
of these highways. These studies form the basis for the presentation in this report and are
available in the project file.
4.5   Weinan-Tongguan Highway (WTH). The existing Weinan-Tongguan Highway
(WTH, No. 310) has a low technical standard (mostly Class III) with many sections with
steep grades or sharp curves, and bridges and culverts with limited loading capacities for
modem heavy-load truck traffic. Also, many sections carry traffic volumes that exceed
their capacity, particularly along the built-up sections of the road. During 1990-92,
annual traffic accidents averaged about 454 in total, resulting in 45 fatalities and 208
injuries.
4.6   Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH).  About one third of the existing
highway has been improved to Class II standard with the remaining two thirds still Class
III. Several sections have steep grades reaching 9 percent and very sharp horizontal
curves. Again, as in the case of WTH, the existing culverts and bridges limit the size and
weight of trucks that can pass over them. During snowfall in the winter, the road is
blocked on the average two to three times a year, each lasting four to five days. The
existing traffic volumes exceed the capacity of many sections of this highway. Many
accidents occur on this highway, with an annual average of about 385 accidents resulting
in 39 dead and 86 injured people.
4.7   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH). The existing highway has a very low
technical standard (mostly Class IV) with some sections below that. This road lies in the
Qinling Mountains, has narrow pavement width (generally 6.0 to 6.5 m, but with some
sections of 5.0 m width), contains many sections with very steep grades and/or very sharp
curves, and poor sight distance. The operating speed is about 25 to 30 km per hour. As
in the case of WTH and THH, the capacity of this road is exceeded at various sections
and the bridges and culverts restrict the size and load of trucks that can travel on this
highway. Also, the road is blocked by snow and by traffic accidents. During 1988-90
(the latest available data), accidents averaged 117 per year, resulting in 19 fatalities and
103 injuries.
4.8   Famen Buddhist Temple-Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (FJTH).  The
existing highways are Class III, and deficient from the standpoints of traffic capacity,
strength of pavement and geometrical (vertical and horizontal) alignment.  Traffic
accidents in 1992-93 (latest available information) on Jiangzhuang-Famensi Highway
averaged about 24 per year, resulting in 1 dead and 16 injured persons.

4.9    Traffic on the Existing Roads. There was a moderate to high growth in traffic
throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, of between 10 and 17 percent per year. The
following table provides a summary of the most recently available comprehensive traffic
data, and compares the daily traffic total with the estimated highway capacity. Many
sections of the existing highways are operating at or above capacity, and given the high
projected traffic growth rates, substantial additional capacity will be needed for all of
them by the end of the decade. More detailed traffic data is provided in Tables 4.1a
through 4.1 d.

4.10   The presence of mixed traffic, including slow-moving nonmotorized vehicles and
relatively high traffic volumes compared to the capacity of the existing roads, result in
traffic speeds of about 30 to 40 km/hour for motor vehicles with urbanized sections
presenting often substantial delays. The high frequency of accidents and breakdowns of
vehicles cause long traffic delays on the 2-lane existing highways, where emergency
vehicles have difficulty in reaching the accident site.
4.11  Traffic Projections. Origin-destination (O-D) surveys were conducted to provide
a good basis for traffic projection and allocation, in particular diversion from the existing
roads to the new highways. Traffic projections for the proposed new highways take into
consideration diversion of traffic from the existing highways and generation of traffic
through (a) releasing suppressed demand by capacity limits on the existing highways,
especially in the sections close to urban areas; and (b) by the facilitation of economic
growth. Diversion of traffic from the railway was considered where pertinent-in the
case of WTE. A comprehensive study of coal production and transport in northern



- 47 -
Shaanxi was conducted in order to detennine the modal split of coal traffic between rail
and THH and the volume of coal traffic to be carried by THH. Also, the trend toward use
of heavier trucks that carry larger loads of coal was assumed to accelerate if the THH
were to be built. In the case of FJTH, special consideration was given to the transfer of
traffic from tractors to trucks.
4.12  Growth rates for traffic along the various high-grade highways were based
primarily on the economic growth rates for the area of influence of each highway.
Because of the uncertainty in forecasting economic growth rates, three scenarios were
analyzed: high growth, medium growth and low growth. Economic growth rates took
into account the plans of the state, province, prefectures, municipalities and counties
within the area of influence of each high-grade highway.
4.13  It is now recognized that the diversion of traffic from an existing road to a new
toll road takes time to build up to the long-term equilibrium level. Incentives and
inducements are often offered to shorten the period of buildup, sometimes referred to as
the "ramp period." The equilibrium level of diversion for the new highways was
estimated at about 80 percent, except for the Jiangzhuang-Famensi (68 percent),
Jiangzhuang-Tangyu (60 percent) and Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum
(23 percent) highways, which will have a number of alternative routes available. Traffic
would also be generated by the improvements brought about by the new highway, at a
level estimated at about 6 to 8 percent of normal traffic. The projected traffic volumes for
each high-grade highway by section and that remaining on the existing road(s) for the
medium-growth scenario and for cases both with and without tolls, for the years 2000,
2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 (2018 in some cases) are presented in Tables 4.2a through 4.2f.
The corresponding traffic volume projections for the low- and high-growth scenarios are
available in the technical feasibility study reports.
4.14  The Proposed New High-Grade Highways. On the basis of the traffic forecasts
summarized in these Tables, the appropriate technical standard for each high-grade
highway was determined, as shown in Table 3.3 Staged construction (building a two-lane
Class II highway initially and expanding it in the future to a four-lane expressway) was
considered for the Qilicun-Baijia section (near the Henan Border) of WTE and for the
THH. However, it was rejected in both cases because the net present value of the total
transport cost (construction cost plus maintenance cost plus vehicle operating cost) for the
four-lane expressway was found to be lower than that for staged construction.
4.15  Alternative Alignments. The recommended alignment for each of the high-
grade highways was selected after consultation with the affected local and regional
governments from several alternative alignments on the basis of minimization of total
transport costs, amount and difficulty of land acquisition and resettlement, and
archeological and environmental considerations.  Besides the existing road, three
alternative alignments were considered for WTE, two for THH and two for the doubling
of the existing highway frorn Yaoxian to Tongchuan, four for LXH, three for FJTH, and
two for LTCWMH. In addition, the selected alignments focused on analyses of



- 48 -
alternatives for the different difficult and expensive high-cost items such as tunnels for
THH and LXH, very long bridges, soft soils, and large-scale flooding such as in the case
of WTE.
4.16  Economic Analysis. The economic analysis was carried out separately for each
of the five high-grade highways. For the purpose of calculation of the indices of
economic analyses, the highways were divided into sections as shown in Tables 4.4a
through 4.4d. The economic analysis was prepared using April 1995 prices. Only the
medium and low traffic projections were used. Two toll options were analyzed, operation
of the highway with tolls and without tolls. The economic costs were derived from
financial costs by deducting taxes and duties and price contingencies. The cost of
materials were adjusted on the basis of border prices and that of land on the basis of the
net market value of the land's production.
4.17  Each high-grade highway was assumed to be constructed according to the
implementation program depicted in Annex 7 and to have an economic life of 20 years.
In addition to the cost of construction, the costs of period maintenance (pavement
overlays) in the eighth and sixteenth year after the road is put into operation and the
annual costs of routine highway maintenance and toll operations were included. The
residual value of each highway section was assumed to be 50 percent of the initial
construction cost.
4.18  Benefits were estimated to accrue primarily from savings in vehicle operating
costs and travel time. Additional quantifiable benefits arise from generated traffic,
reduced congestion on the existing road, and savings in accident costs.  Average
economic vehicle operating costs by vehicle class for the existing and proposed roads are
shown in Table 4.3. These costs vary by vehicle speed, which in turn varies with the
traffic volume and the capacity of the highway. The benefits due to reduction in traffic
accidents took account only of the savings in physical damage to vehicles and were
estimated by assuming that the accident rate on the new highway is one half of that on the
existing road.
4.19  Effect of Tolls. It is intended that the five high-grade highways be operated as
toll roads, which would involve higher costs of construction and operation, due to the toll
facilities, and a loss of potential benefits. Imposition of tolls would have the effect of
reducing traffic volumes along the high-grade highways. There is not yet enough
practical experience in China to forecast accurately the impact of tolls on traffic volumes,
economic viability and financial viability of the tolled highways. Tolls would be set at a
level to pay back the loans involved (the Bank loan in the case of this project) and not the
whole construction cost. Usually, they are set at about one third of the difference in
vehicle operating costs between the existing highway and the new tolled highways.
Generally, this level of toll is expected to reduce traffic volumes by about 20 percent.
However, toll levels would not be known until the highway is about to be open to traffic.
SPTD is to submit to the Bank by June 30, 1999 a study of the tolls to be charged on the
high-grade highways (para. 3.57).

4.20   The results of the basic economic evaluations of the highways are shown in the
following table, with more complete results shown in Tables 4.4a through 4.4d. These
tables show the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for both the medium and low
traffic projections, with and without tolls in each case. The table shows that the expected
value of the EIRR, assuming that both the medium- and low-traffic projections have a
50 percent probability of occurrence, and that all these values are above the minimum
acceptable value. The full sets of economic analyses showing the streams of annual costs
and benefits and the EIRRs and sensitivity analyses for each high-grade highway by
section for high, medium and low traffic growth scenarios and with and without tolls are
available in the engineering feasibility study report for the various high-grade highways.

Note: When the economic evaluations were made, the Famensi-Tangyu Highway was considered as two independent
projects.
4.21    Sensitivity Tests. The EIRRs in Tables 4.4a through 4.4d, summarized in the
following table, show the impacts of changes that could affect the economic justification
of constructing the new highways. They show the impact of eliminating the value
attrib-uted-to savings in the time of the vehicle occupants, of a halving in the effect of the
new highways in generating additional traffic and of adopting a low forecast of traffic
growth. The following table also shows what increases in project costs or reductions in
project benefits would be necessary to result in their having unacceptably low values of
EIRR.   With  very  few  exceptions, the sensitivity  tests indicate that it would be
economically feasible to construct the highways as proposed and operate them as toll
facilities. The four exceptions, which merit further comment, are Lintong to Terra Cotta
Warriors Maseum. Famensi to Jiangzhuang and Famensi to Tangyu with a low traffic
projection, and Lintong to Terra Cotta Warriors Museum with a zero value of time
savings.

Note: Basic evaluation is for medium level traffic projection, with tolls applied to the proposed new road.
When the economic evaluations were made, the Famensi-Tangyu Highway was considered as two independent projects.
4.22   The road to the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum  is a tourist road. The number of
tourists is difficult to predict and has shown large variations in growth in the last 10
years. The numbers of national tourists appears to be closely correlated with the state of
the national economy, while the number of international tourists appears to be closely
correlated with China's political relationship with Japan and the United States, the origin
countries of most foreign tourists. The projected growth in the number of tourists has
been estimated conservatively based on the growth in the last 10 years, but there are
expectations of a higher tourism growth in a period of stability in China's international
relations. So, in the case of this highway, the probability of a high traffic outcome is
greater than the zero value assumed generally (para. 4.23). It would need a probability of
only 10 percent to be attached to the high traffic forecast for all the sensitivity tests of the
Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway to produce acceptable results, and this level of
probability is appropriate for this particular highway. The implications of a zero value of
time savings is that tourists would be prepared to spend all their time in traffic jams
waiting to reach the sites they wish to visit rather than visiting the sites themselves. This
is a highly improbable assumption, particularly for the type of visitor to the Terra Cotta
Warriors Museum, most of whom visit the museum for a single day and wish to
maximize their time at this important site. So the importance of a zero time value
evaluation of the project is relatively low.
4.23   Similar arguments apply to the Jiangzhuang-Famensi Highway, which leads to the
Famensi Temple, a historic site of major international significance, having been the
center of Chinese civilization in the Early Zhou period and considered to be the source of
many aspects of Chinese culture. The pagoda at the Famensi Temple dates back at least
to the second century A.D. Four pieces of finger bone revealed when the pagoda
collapsed following an earthquake in 1986 (it has since been reconstructed) are widely
credited with being those of Buddha and are possibly the holiest religious relics in
Buddhism. When the proximity to the Temple to the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum is
considered, the number of foreign tourists likely to visit the Temple is expected to
increase rapidly and the number of national visitors will also increase rapidly as it is
becoming a center for Buddhist worship again. For this reason, the expected value of the
EIRR of the project should take account of a greater than zero probability of the high
traffic projection and as with the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway, a probability of



- 51 -
just over 10 percent or more for the high traffic projection would be sufficient to make
the expected value of the EIRR acceptable.
4.24  Additional sensitivity tests were carried out in relation to the Tongchuan-
Huangling Highway, to investigate the optimization of the opening date of this Highway,
given that more than half the traffic on this road comprises trucks carrying coal from two
groups of mines, those at Yijun and Huangling itself. Both groups of mines are close to
the proposed alignment of the Highway. In the medium projection for the economy, coal
production in Huangling is projected to more than triple between 1990 and 2000, from
4.41 million tons to 15 million tons. Even in the low projection, output is expected to
reach 13.55 million tons. In the same level of projection, self-consumption of coal in
Huangling for the year 2000 is projected at 300,000 tons, while a further 270,500 tons
will be transported north. The railway will have capacity for only 12 million tons,
leaving about 2.4 million tons to be transported south by road. When, as in this case, the
estimated road traffic is the difference between two rather uncertain projections, then the
confidence that can be placed on the estimates is even less than usual, and given the high
proportion of coal trucks on the THH, particular attention must be paid to the sensitivity
of economic evaluation results to variations in the traffic projections.
4.25  Most of the coal produced at the Huangling mine is transported by rail, so far as
the railway has capacity, to the high consumption areas in the south of China , and the
excess is transported by road to Tongchuan or Xian. Coal transported by road, with a
final destination outside Shaanxi, is transferred to rail at Tongchuan, while coal for
domestic and commercial consumption in Xian is transported all the way by road. The
Huangling mines cannot transport all their output by rail because of the limited capacity
of the rail link and the future need of the railway to transport the increased output of
mines in the north of Shaanxi where road transport is not a viable alternative. A new rail
line from Xian to the north of Shaanxi was opened in 1991, but its capacity for
transporting coal to the south of China is constrained by the capacity of the Lintong-Xian
section, which it must use to reach its destination.
4.26  The existing mines in the Huangling group are nearing the end of their productive
life but will be replaced by new mines currently being developed. The rate of production
of these new mines will be constrained by the capacity of the transport systems that serve
them. The proposed THH will provide sufficient capacity for the mines to operate close
to or at their optimum technical rate of production. The mines at Yijun, which are part of
the Jiaoping mining area, also have problems of transport capacity for their output, with
the rail link only having capacity for 4.7 million tons compared with a current and
projected output of 6 million tons. The highway system is having to provide capacity for
about 1.3 million tons, a figure that is not expected to change significantly over the next
20 years.
4.27  As part of the evaluation of the alternative of phased construction, an analysis was
made of the optimum opening date for the first phase, of the full four-lane THH. It was
found that the optimum opening date was as early as possible, and that the net economic



- 52-
benefits of the project reduced by about 10 percent for each year of delay up to five years,
and escalated much faster for further delay. The traffic need for the second stage would
be only about four to five years after completion of the first stage, but the earthworks and
civil works component of the total cost amounts to more than 65 percent of the total and
all this must be incurred from the outset. Not surprisingly in these circumstances, the
economically preferable solution turns out to be to construct the road in a single stage.
C. EVALUATION OF RIPA COMPONENT
4.28  The RIPA component of the project is aimed at rehabilitating and upgrading
basic-access roads in low-income counties of the province, with a view to increasing
accessibility to basic health, social and education services as well as to markets to
increase the social sustainability of these areas. It is expected that in the long term, the
program will stimulate increased economic activity and employment and significantly
contribute to a reduction of rural poverty.
4.29  The nature of the expected benefits of the component precludes many of them
from a quantified analysis, and many others can only be estimated approximately, so the
expressed economic rates of return must be considered as minima and as representing
only part of the value of this project component. For the first year subprojects of this
component, the quantified benefits include only reductions in vehicle operating costs,
reduced accident costs, and time savings to vehicle occupants. Unquantified benefits
include improved health, higher education achievement, increased social relations, and
increased output and incomes.  For second and subsequent year subprojects, the
quantified benefits will take account of generated trips for health, social, education,
employment and commercial purposes. The total population that will benefit from this
component is the total population in the area of influence of the proposed highway
systems in the selected counties with a low income. The counties for inclusion in the
subproject were selected using a mix of economic and social indicators. A total of 31
road systems with a length of 4,067 km in 25 counties were chosen for rehabilitation,
upgrading or new construction. The total number of people who are expected to benefit
from the RIPA component is about 2.72 million, or about 54 percent of the poor in
Shaanxi Province. Only those components identified for inclusion in the first year of the
project have been evaluated. These projects will benefit about 520,000 people. The
estimated economic rate of return for these five systems varied from 13.5 to 18.7 percent
with an average of 15.6 percent (Table 4.5).
D. PROJECT RISKS AND ACTIONS
4.30  The principal risks facing the project are:
(a)   delay in completion of the connecting road between the WTE and the
continuation of Route 310 in Henan province;
(b)   delays in completion of the highways themselves as a consequence of
design changes;



- 53 -
(c)   maintaining a high quality of construction when there is strong pressure
for the projects to be con'pleted on time and within budget;
(d)   ensuring that sufficient funds are allocated to maintenance of the
remainder of the highway network when there is strong pressure to
complete the construction of the project and other new highways;
(e)   ensuring that operational efficiency and traffic safety are accorded high
priority;
(f)   that the traffic projections will not be realized, that traffic will not divert to
the new highways to the extent projected and that users will not take full
advantage of these and other new highways to update their vehicles to
introduce larger and more cost effective trucks.
4.31  (a) Connecting Road.  The first significant risk facing the project is the
possibility of delay in completing construction of the 6.1 km connection between Yangjia
and Baijiazhai, which would affect the utilization (and consequently the benefits) of the
Weinan-Tongguan Expressway. However, this risk has practically disappeared since the
connection has been included in the proposed Second Henan Provincial Highway Project,
which is expected to be presented to the Board in June 1996.
4.32  (b) Design Changes. Based on experience with the ongoing highway projects,
risks center on delays in implementation, particularly for the highway investment
component, due to design changes and the long time required to handle variation orders
during construction as well as to the late start in the traffic engineering component,
objections raised by people living along the right-of-way caused by insufficient
consultation, and unexpected archeological finds. However, preparation of this project
has benefited significantly from the Bank's experience in similar highway projects in
China, as well as from the active involvement of MOC and the review of the design and
bid documents for the high-grade highways by qualified experts.  Moreover, the
conceptual design of the traffic engineering component has been completed and more
attention is being given to the resettlement and land acquisition problem, including more
consultation with the local people affected by the high-grade highways. Extensive
archeological surveys were conducted to reduce the probability of unexpected finds.
Also, the relatively large value of contracts for construction of the high-grade highways
would attract the larger and more capable contractors and would ensure successful
completion with little or no delays.
4.33  (c) Construction Quality and Cost Overruns.  Uneven and sometimes
substandard quality of works as well as cost overruns are another risk that should be
addressed. This problem is generally caused by laxity of construction supervision as well
as the points mentioned in para. 4.32. In this project, more attention will be given to
construction supervision arrangements, including engagement of foreign experts and
training of local supervision staff. Also, the Bank will increase its supervision efforts by
involving the Resident Mission and utilizing local consultants in the supervision of the



- 54 -
RIPA component. In addition, SPTD is one of the strongest provincial highway
organizations in China and is familiar with Bank procedures since the proposed project is
the second highway project to be financed by the Bank in Shaanxi Province.
4.34 (d) Allocation of Resources to Highway Maintenance. In view of the relatively
fast expansion of the NTHS and other high-grade highways and their related high
construction costs, there is growing danger that not enough resources will be devoted to
the maintenance of non high-grade highways, including roads contained in the RIPA
component under the project. As pointed out in para. 3.28, SPTD has agreed to allocate
sufficient resources to highway maintenance during the 9FYP and continue to monitor
the condition of existing roads. The proposed project includes a study of highway
maintenance, training of staff in highway maintenance, and provision of equipment for
highway maintenance.
4.35  (e) Operational Efficiency and Traffic Safety. Recent experience suggests that
once the high-grade highways are in operation, operational and safety risks will need to
be addressed. The traffic engineering component of the project will be reviewed by
qualified technical experts. Also, the proposed project includes equipment and training of
staff for the operation and maintenance of the high-grade highways. SPTD would further
benefit from a study of management, operations and maintenance of high-grade highways
to be included in the proposed Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.
4.36  The success of the highway safety component also depends on good cooperation
between SPTD and the Traffic Police, which has in the past been difficult. However,
under the proposed project, a Leading Group for Road Safety Coordination will be
created, and consideration is being given to holding a highway safety seminar in China in
1997 to help raise awareness of the safety problem and to increase the level of support at
various governmental levels to this very important issue.
4.37 (f) Traffic Growth, Diversion to the New Highways and Truck Replacement
Policy. The medium projections of traffic growth are dependent on a continued growth
in the national and provincial economy and the maintenance of a high rate of growth for a
period of 20 years. With the exception of the subprojects described in para. 4.21, all of
the highways show an acceptable result for their economic evaluation, even with low
traffic projections that would result in traffic levels about 60 percent of those of the
medium-level projection. The risk that traffic will not even reach the level of the low
traffic projection is very low and would only arise if there were to be a collapse of the
national economy, not considered a significant risk.
4.38  A greater risk is that traffic will not divert to the new highways in the volumes
expected (para. 4.13) and that measures would be taken to induce a higher use of these
highways that would significantly reduce their economic benefit. Experience from China
and other countries indicates that it takes about four years for the traffic diversion to a
new road to build up to its expected level, and that it is essential for maximizing the final
diversion rate that this period be used for an intense promotion of the benefits of the new



- 55 -
highway to potential users. There is a significant risk that if the diversion to the new
highways is not as high as projected, especially in the early years of their operation, the
Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration Bureau might be tempted to introduce
measures to artificially increase the diversion, such as increasing the level of tolls on
parallel unimproved roads or cutting back on maintenance or development of those roads.
Any such policy, while possibly resulting in a more favorable financial outcome to the
SHGHAB, will at the same time reduce the economic benefit of the new highways and
should therefore be discouraged. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that all possible
measures are taken that do not increase the costs of using the parallel roads but that do
increase the attractiveness of the new highways. Such measures would be proposed by
the technical assistance for institutional development in relation to operation of the new
highways.
4.39  The lack of a high-grade national highway network is a severe impediment to the
introduction of high-capacity and high-efficiency large trucks. Although the construction
of such a network is a necessary condition for the use of such trucks, many other
conditions must also be created for their use to become widespread. If these measures are
not taken and truck operators continue to use two-axle trucks, the expected benefits of the
new highways will not be fully realized. Many of the other necessary conditions need to
be applied at a national level and to be taken in coordination by several different
ministries. Since China does not have a good record of interministerial cooperation in the
transport sector, there is a significant risk that these conditions will not be created. It will
require pressure from truck operators for the necessary policy changes to be made, and
this in turn will require pressure from the clients of truck operators for more efficient
services.  The results of a study of traffic facilitation across provincial boundaries,
included in the National Highway Project: Hebei/Henan (Loan 3748-CHA), will be used
as a basis for Hebei and Henan Provinces to implement changes in this regard, and these
could also be of benefit to Shaanxi and other provinces in China. SPTD should monitor
the progress of these changes and act to implement those of them that produce positive
results.

ANNEX 1: ROADS IMPROVEMENT FOR POVERTY
ALLEVIATION (lUPA)
1.    China has an estimated population of 80 million at or below the poverty line (less
than Y 300 per year/person in 1993). Nearly all of them are rural poor, concentrated in
resource-deficient areas, and comprising entire communities located mostly in the upland
sections of the interior provinces of northern, northwestern (including Shaanxi) and
southwestern China. The 9FYP's strategy for poverty alleviation has the following
priorities: (a) integration of production, education, health, family planning and transport
programs into comprehensive local intervention packages; (b) expansion of the Food for
Work Program to cover the construction of terraced agricultural lands; and (c) increased
support for agricultural extension and training and farmers' marketing systems. Lack of
road access to an area increases transport costs so substantially that only high value-to
weight products will be profitable to market. Overall, 16.1 percent of poor county
townships lack road access, most others have such access available only in the dry
seasen.
2.    A threefold screening process was agreed: (a) an initial screening designed to
select into the pool of possible projects those that are located in "priority counties,"
counties whose composite ranking on selected demographic, economic and social criteria,
identifies them as most in need of "poverty alleviation" measures; (b) a second screening
focusing on the cost effectiveness of each roads improvement system per population
served; and (c) a detailed economic and social analysis of those RIPA systems that
successfully meet the criteria of the first two screening procedures.
First-Stage Screening
3.   Identification and Definition of Poor Counties. In 1986, the State Planning
Commission (SPC) designated all counties with annual per capita income of < Y 150 as
poor counties. Thirty-four counties of Shaanxi were included in this category. In
addition, Shaanxi Provincial Government (SPG) designated another 35 counties where
the annual per capita income was Y 150-200 as poor counties. In 1993, SPG used the
following criteria for defining poor counties:
(a)   counties that received poverty alleviation funds from SPC and SPG during
1986-93, and in 1993, their per capita annual income was < Y 600;
(b)   the 35 counties that were defined as poor by SPG in 1986 and in 1993, if
their income was < Y 500; and



- 98 -                     ANNEX I
(c)   all other counties whose per capita annual income in 1993 was < Y 400.
Accordingly, 50 counties were designated as poor by SPG. This was subsequently
approved by SPC in 1993. These 50 counties are the ones that were considered in the
initial screening for RIPA projects.
4.    Ranking and Selection of Poor Counties for RIPA. Rank ordering, based upon
socioeconomic and poverty criteria, was necessary to prioritize the geographic locations
of RIPA components. Shaanxi's countries were ranked according to a composite score
taking into account the following indicators:
(a)   Income Ranking. To assess the extent of poverty in the poor counties,
this ranking used average incomes as an indicator. Average per capita
income in 1993 varied from Y 200 to Y 500, and was allocated 5 points in
the ranking system. Counties with the lowest incomes were given the
highest ranking. The counties with per capita average incomes of Y 200-
260 were given 5 points, Y 261-320 with 4 points, Y 321-380 with 3
points, Y 381-440 with 2 points and Y 441-500 with only 1 point.
(b)   Poverty Ranking. This indicator is intended to identify the "very poor"
in each county (people with incomes of < Y 300 in 1993). The indicator is
based on the actual number of "very poor" per 10,000 persons in the
county. The index varies from 1 to 36, and was allocated 5 points. The
counties with highest index were given the highest rank. The counties
with the index of 29-36 were given 5 points, index of 22-28 with 4 points,
index of 15-21 with 3 points, index of 8-14 with 2 points and index 1-7
with 1 point.
(c)   Value of Agricultural Production. As most of the poor are agriculture
and forestry dependent and are unskilled laborers, counties with larger
land areas in agriculture and forestry are ranked higher. Total land area in
agriculture and forestry (mu per km2 of county land) was used as a
surrogate index and was allocated 5 points. This varied from 1200 mu per
km2 to 8,800 mu per km2. When this index was in the highest range of
7,300-8,800, 5 points were allocated, 4 points for 5,800-7,299, 3 points for
4,300-5,799, 2 points for 2,800-4,299 and 1 point for 1,200-2,799.
(d)   Value of Mineral Production. Lack of access increases the transport cost
of mineral resources and hinders their exploitation; therefore, counties
with higher value of mineral production were ranked higher. This ranking
index was allocated 5 maximum points and varied from Y 12 to 132
million (1993 value). When the value of annual mineral production
reached Y 108.01-132.00 million, that county was given 5 points,
Y 84.01-108.00 million 4 points, Y 60.01-84.00 million 3 points, Y 36.01-
60.00 million 2 points and Y 12-36 million 1 point.



- 99 -                     ANNEX I
(e)   Social Development Indicators. Education and literacy, health care,
access to clean drinking water suffer when there is inadequate all-weather
access. Counties with the least social development by these measures
(based on 1993 data) were ranked the highest for RIPA. These indicators
were allocated 5 points as follows: (i) Population without clean drinking
water varied from 5 to 77 percent of total county population. When this
was 241 percent, that county was allocated 1 point. Other counties were
allocated zero points. (ii) The number of health workers per 10,000
persons was used as an indicator of access to health services and was
allocated 1 point. It varied from 12 to 40. Counties with lower access (<
25 health workers per 10,000 persons) were given 1 point. All other
counties with higher degree of health access were given zero points.
(iii) Percent of people who cannot read or write (number of persons per
10,000 population) was used an educational indicator. This varied from
0.29 to 15.33. Counties with the higher illiteracy (7.7 persons per 10,000
population) were allocated 1 point. All other counties with higher literacy
were allocated zero points.  (iv) Food for Work Program  (FWP)
expenditures in each county varied from zero to Y 1.2 million per year.
They were used as a surrogate to unemployment and were allocated 2
points.  Counties in the bottom  one-third range of FWP annual
expenditures (<Y 400,000) were given zero points, middle-third range
(Y 400,000-800,000) with 1 point and the top third range (>Y 800,000)
given 2 points.
Selection of Prefectures for RIPA
5.    Based on the above ranking for all the 50 poor counties, the average range for
each of the 10 prefectures was then computed; the average ranking by prefectures varied
from 9.0 to 18.0:
(a)   Lantian county in Xian prefecture had the highest rating of 18.0. It was
decided not to include this county for RIPA as it is adjacent to Xian and
economic development of Xian will likely spill over into this county.
(b)   Weinan prefecture had the next highest average ranking of 15.5. Road
density (km of roads per km2) is quite high in Weinan now. It is also near
to Xian. Its high rating comes from its economic indexes (used in the
ranking system) rather than poverty conditions. Hence this prefecture was
not chosen for RIPA.
(c)   Lin You (Baoji City) prefecture had the lowest rating of 9.0 and therefore,
it was not included.
(d)   Xian Yang prefecture had a rating of 11.6, although the total population of
the very poor is very low. Its higher rating was derived mostly from its



-100 -                     ANNEX 1
economic base rather than poverty conditions. It is also close to Xian. All
of its administrative villages are now fully accessible by all-weather roads.
Hence it was not selected for RIPA.
(e)   Tongchuan prefecture had a rating of 10.3 and it is mostly urban and
suburban in its settlement pattern. Population of the very poor is small
and the poor had a little better income than in the other prefectures. There
is also a major highway financed by the Bank in this prefecture. There are
more roads in this prefecture than elsewhere. Hence it was not chosen for
RIPA.
6.    The remaining five prefectures containing 34 counties were chosen for RIPA.
These are:
(a)   In Northern Shaanxi:
(i)    Yulin Prefecture.  Yulin prefecture has 12 counties and an
average ranking of 12.58. Although Yulin City county had a low
rating of 9.0, it is included in RIPA because all the systems should
connect to this administrative center. Wubao county is excluded
from RIPA because it has excellent water transport systems now.
All the other 11 counties are included in RIPA.
(ii)    Yanan Prefecture. There are eight counties in this prefecture
whose average rating was 9.50. Three counties below the average
rating were dropped from RIPA (Yencheng, Zhichang and
Yichuan) leavingfive counties in RIPA.
(b)   In Southern Shaanxi:
(i)    Hanzhong Prefecture. The average ranking for this prefecture
was 11.25. Zhengbai county had a ranking of 10.0 and it is
included because 59 percent of the villages do not currently have
any road access. Allfour counties are included in RIPA.
(ii)    Ankang Prefecture. Ankang has seven counties and had an
average ranking of 11.14. Only two counties had below the
average ranking: Baihe (8.0) and Zhengping (10.0). These two
counties are included because they do not have adequate access
now. Therefore, all seven counties are included in RIPA.
(iii)   Shanglo Prefecture. Shanglo prefecture had an average ranking of
13.28, the highest among the five prefectures chosen for RIPA. All
seven counties are included in RIPA.



-101-                      ANNEX I
Second-Stage Screening of Poor Counties
7.   Identification of RIPA  Road Systems.  Based upon the proposed road
improvements (segments) in the Shaanxi Provincial Poverty Alleviation Plan, roads were
grouped into RIPA systems based upon: (a) continuity of the system; (b) maximization
of the population served, and (c) connectivity to as many settlements as possible. Using
the above criteria, 59 RIPA Road Systems were identified in 34 RIPA counties. The
estimated total cost of these 59 systems was Y 1. 03 billion.
8.    Screening of RIPA Initial Basket for Implementation. The System Cost Ratio
(SCR) or the cost of proposed improvements per population served in the influence area
of the systein (proposed investment divided by the population) was used to screen the
initial RIPA systems basket. The "influence area population" was defined as the total
population getting new access and better or improved access because of construction or
upgrading of new RIPA Systems. RIPA system costs varied from a very low
Y 90/person in the influence area to a high of Y 1,619/person served. This high range is
due to variations in the density of settlements and differences in topography.
9.    RIPA Implementation Basket. By applying the above rank ordering procedure
and deleting the very high cost systems, the basket of proposed RIPA Road Systems was
further reduced to 31 systems adding up to about 4,068 km in 25 counties with an
estimated cost of Y592 million.
10.  Initial Basket. For the first batch of systems to be implemented during the first
year of implementation of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, it was agreed
that a start will be made both in the northern and southern Shaanxi as follows:
(a)   Yulin Prefecture (system #4): 93 km (49 km of new construction and
44 km of rehabilitation to Class IV level) located in Fugou County within
the Loess Plateau in northeast Shaanxi. Total cost estimated at Y 14.7
million;
(b)   Yulin Prefecture (system #9): 82.6 km road upgrading to Class IV level.
Located in Shuide County adjacent to Shanxi Province. Total cost
estimated at Y 8.9 million;
(c)   Shanglo Prefecture (system #46): 42.8 km in adjoining mountainous
Zhashui and Zhenan Counties. Total cost estimated at Y 18.29 million;
(d)   Ankang Prefecture (system #36): 47.02 km of upgrading to Class IV
level road. Located in Langao County adjacent to Sichuan province.
Total cost estimated at Y 12. 88 million; and
(e)   Ankang Prefecture (system #41):  55 km for upgrading two road
segments of unclassified to Class IV level road. Located in Baihe County
adjacent to Hubei Province. Total cost estimated at Y 16.35 million



-102 -                      ANNEX 1
The above five RIPA systems were estimated to cost about Y 71.1 million.
Third-Stage Screening of RIPA System
11.   The third-stage screening consists of an analysis of the economic and social
benefits of each of the road systems included for consideration at the end of the second
screening. The following criteria will be used in this stage:
(a)   Analysis as Groups of Small Systems. The road segments will be
analyzed as groups of small systems rather than on a segment-by-segment
basis. RIPA roads need not be paved roads but must provide all-weather
access, and thus the proposed systems can include "unclassified
Nonmotorized Transport" (NMT), (e.g., bicycles, animal-drawn carts,
tractors, and jeeps) roads, "unclassified-under Class IV" all-weather
roads, and "classified roads-Class IV and Class III."
(b)  - Use of Motorization Data to Identify NMT Requirements. Data on the
number of motor vehicles (in different classifications such as cars, trucks,
motorcycles, tractors) in the counties to be connected by the proposed
RIPA systems is required for this analysis. This information should be
reviewed in the context of recent high growth of motorization in many
parts of China. The primary purpose of the review is to assure that the
type of road systems proposed (classified, motorized, nonmotorized ) fits
with the trends in the motor vehicle population and their use. Where there
are very few motor vehicles, NMT road connections should be carefully
considered.
(c)   Variations in Expected Minimum Economic Internal Rate of Return
(EIRR). This will depend upon the types of roads within the proposed
system. The system classification for analysis of EIRR will be based upon
the dominant class of road within the system. For example, if the
dominant part (>50 percent of length in km) is unclassified, then the EIRR
expected will be that for unclassified roads (both new and rehabilitated).
If the dominant part of the system is Class IV, the expected EIRR will be
that for the Class IV roads (new, upgraded and rehabilitated).
12.   The expected EIRR will vary as follows:
(a)   Unclassified Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR of 8-10 percent.
(i)    All new roads for Nonmotorized Transport (bicycles and animal
carts) and farmers' vehicles (tractors and jeeps), which may not
necessarily be designed for trucks but primarily to provide access
to farmers and their local economic activities; and
(ii)    New and rehabilitated all-weather unclassified roads.



-103 -                      ANNEX 1
The expected EIRR for primary access roads is lower than the other
classes of roads. Therefore, the EIRR, in this case, must be supported by
higher social benefits (population getting new access, population getting
better access and improvement in the social indicators included in the
county ranking system (outlined below).
(b)   Class IV Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 10-12 percent
These roads include upgrading of unclassified roads to Class IV,
rehabilitation of existing Class IV roads, and any new Class IV roads. If
the EIRR is low, then social benefits (as discussed below) should be high.
(c)   Class III Roads: Expected Minimum EIRR 12 percent
These roads include new and rehabilitated Class III roads , and roads
upgraded from Class IV to Class III.
13.   Social benefits will be defined as increases in access to health (potable water),
educational services (reduced educational dropout rates and adult literacy) and improved
access to employment (reduced dependence on FWP expenditures). These rates will be
calculated by extrapolation with the existing situation in nearby comparator counties with
greater access to roads. The proportion of the total population getting new and better all-
weather access (through improved connectivity and reduction of travel time and cost) will
also stand as an indicator of social benefits. These social benefits will be calculated for
each RIPA system to be evaluated prior to its inclusion into an implementation package
for Bank approval.
14.   Population getting new all-weather access and population getting better access
(improved connectivity and reduction of travel time and cost) because of RIPA systems
will also be an indicator of social benefits. This will be calculated for each RIPA system.

ANNEX 2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR FEASIBILITY
STUDY OF XIAN BYPASS
Introduction
1.    Xian is one of the birthplaces of China's ancient civilizations. It was the capital
of 12 Chinese feudal dynasties (including Zhou, Qin, Han and Tang) and had an
important role in Chinese history and the political, economic and cultural development.
For centuries it was not only the most prosperous city of China and perhaps the largest in
the world, but also as the origin of the Silk Road from China to India and Europe, at the
center of economic and cultural trade between the eastern and western civilizations. This
long history has left Xian a wealth of cultural relics, and now the territory of Xian
resembles a huge underdeveloped historical site and museum.
2.    Since a group of invaluable cultural relics, including the Banpo Relics and the
Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses, Xian has been a popular national and international
tourist city, famed as one of the four ancient capitals of the world. The unique tourist
resources provide one of the economic advantages of Xian city: With exploitation and
preservation of cultural relics in Xian, its position as a world-famous historical city will
grow and its tourism will develop rapidly. Xian has the potential to become the major
historical tourist holy land in the Far East.
3.    Today, Xian is one of the largest cities of China. It is located at the border
between eastern and western China and has already become a key traffic hub. Two of the
recently designated national highways of China go through the city.  That from
Lianyungang port on China's east coast to Huorguesi at the west border is the principal
east-west highway artery, which is planned to be constructed before 2000. In addition,
Xian is also planned to become the largest highway transportation hub in western China.
4.    Through more than 40 years of construction and development, Xian has become
the principal center of politics, economics, culture, science and technology and
infornation in northwest of China. At the same time, it has also become the largest
commercial and trade center in northwest China. However, in road construction Xian
falls far behind its development in other areas. In recognition of its pivotal status in the
national transportation network, and of the impact of the volume of through traffic on the
environment of the historic city center, early in 1985 the first study for a Xian Bypass
scheme was started. Since then the city has continued to expand, but its highway
development has failed to keep pace. Already, city development has extended far beyond
the proposed the city's Second Ring Road, while the ring road itself is still not finished.



-105-                       ANNEX2
5.    The city lacks even one through expressway and transiting vehicles still have to
go through the city along the urban roads designed and built for nonmotorized transport,
firther aggravating the rapidly growing problem of urban traffic congestion. Since the
Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90), several high-grade highways, such as the Xian-
Lintong expressway, the Xian-Tongchuan Class I highway, the Xian-Baoji expressway,
etc., have been completed; so that vehicles can be easily and rapidly collected from or
distributed to the area outside the city center. But, it is very difficult for vehicles to go
through or enter and exit through the other side.
6.    Today, the problems of traffic in the downtown are very serious. The capacity of
urban roads is low, impeded by frequent intersections; traffic jams and accidents occur
with high frequency; and there are increasing conflicts between pedestrians,
nonmotorized and motorized transport. The average speed of vehicles on urban roads is
less than 20 km/hr and decreasing rapidly and vehicle emissions are creating problems for
pedestrians, cyclists and residents. Even the fabric of the historic city walls is being
destroyed by the impact of vehicle-induced pollution. The problems arising from this
chronic traffic situation have become the main constraints on regional socioeconomic
development.
7.    For many years the vehicle fleet of Xian city has been increasing at an annual rate
of more than 10 percent, and the taxi fleet has been growing even faster. Unless remedial
measures are taken to address the city's transport problems and to mitigate the rapid
motorization, the environment and cultural relics in downtown Xian city will be seriously
affected.
8.    In order to allow the social development of the city, reduce traffic congestion and
improve the environmental quality of the city, it is planned to construct a further ring
road as well as complete the second ring road, the latter by the end of 1997. Although
this will reduce traffic congestion for a time, the construction of a bypass to take through
traffic out of the city center will also be needed.
9.    Study of the possible location and alignrnent of the Xian Bypass has now been
going on for 10 years. After much investigation, research and discussion involving
collection of data on social, economic, traffic and engineering conditions of Xian city, the
following reports have been produced:
(a)   Report of the Trunk National Highways I (Shaanxi Province);
(b)   Alignment Schemes Statement of Xian Bypass-A Section of a Trunk
National Highway (Prefeasibility Study Report of a Xian Bypass);
(c)   Feasibility Study Report of Xian Bypass;
(d)   Supplementary Feasibility Study Report of the Section from Youjiazhuang
to Guanting of Xian Bypass Study;



-106-                      ANNEX2
(e)   Report on Alignment Scheme of Xian Bypass and North Section of Ring
Road 2 and Viaduct Scheme; and
(f)   Study Report on Alignment Adjustment of Xian Bypass Investigation and
Study Report on Viaduct Scheme of Xian Bypass-Preliminary Design of
the section from Youjiazhuang to Guanting of Xian bypass.
10.  In the course of these studies, governors of the provincial government, city
government and the Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD) have devoted
many resources of time and money in arranging conferences, in which many leaders of
relevant provincial and city departments and experts participated. Furthermore, experts
from the China International Engineering Consultant Corporation (CIECC), the Ministry
of Communications (MOC) and the MOC Highway Planning and Design Institute have
reviewed the project reports. Evaluation, in all its senses, and choice of an alignment of
the Xian Bypass is the focus of this additional study.
11.   Xian lies at the center of the Guanzhong Plain, which extends from Henan
Province in the east to Gansu Province in the west. The satellite cities, Xianyang and
Lintong, are both to the north of the city. Eastbound and westbound traffic makes up the
majority of transit traffic. So, based on the principle that as a major section of a trunk
national highway through a large city, the alignment of Xian Bypass should be short,
economical and convenient to link the Xian-Lintong expressway, the Xian-Tongchuan
Class I highway and the Xian-Baoji expressway, forming a high grade highway network
with its center at Xian. It is accepted that the alignment of the Xian Bypass should pass
to the north of the city. After many years of study on the alignment of the Xian Bypass,
three alternative alignment concepts have emerged:
(a)   Scheme 1: Near-to-Downtown Concept (also known as the Viaduct
Scheme). The alignment of this route would be short and close to the city
center, and able to attract more traffic than the other possible routes. But
because it is very close to the downtown area, the damage to the city
environment would be serious and the land acquisition construction costs
would be very high.
(b)   Scheme 2: Extension of the Eastern Bypass Concept (of Han Dynasty).
The alignment of this concept would be further to the north of the city
center, able to attract both east-west through traffic and much traffic
destined for the center as well. Furthermore, it would conveniently link
the existing high-grade highways in three directions-east, north and west.
But the west section of the scheme would inevitably pass through the
ancient Changan City (of the Han Dynasty), an area of preservation by the
State. Although the eastern half of the route (from Youjiazhuang to
Guanting) has been approved by the State Planning Committee (SPC),
agreement on the western half has still to be reached. Because the
western section goes through a site of important cultural relics, it has to be



-107 -                     ANNEX2
studied and reviewed and agreed by the State Cultural Relics Preservation
Authorities. If the answer from the state cultural relics preservation
authorities is negative, this scheme will not be considered further.
(c)   Scheme 3: North of the Changan City Relic, close to the Wei River
Concept. This route could avoid the above relic preservation and city
environmental problems, and could attract most of the east-west transit
traffic from the city. However, it is too far away from the city center to
attract the inbound and outbound traffic, and would therefore have a
smaller impact on relieving traffic congestion in the center than the other
concepts..
12.   MOC, SPTD and the World Bank have agreed that a Xian Bypass would be a very
important section of the whole trunk national highway from Lianyungang port to
Huorguesi, and its construction is important for the social and economic development of
Xian city. However, there has not yet been a comparative study of the engineering,
economic, financial, environmental and historic consequences of the alternative route
concepts. Consequently, it was agreed that such a study would be included in the World
Bank-financed Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project
13.   These Terms of Reference have been prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Highway
Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) and agreed with MOC and the World Bank.
Study Organization
14.   Because of the importance of the Xian Bypass and the complexity of the issues
involved, and in order that the study work can proceed successfully and reach a
conclusion within a reasonable time, a Leading Group will be formed, comprising
representatives of the interested parties of the Provincial and Municipal governments. Its
task will be to guide, coordinate, check and review the work of the Study Team. Under
the leading group, the Study Team will comprise engineers, economists and technicians,
mainly from SPHSDI and relevant research units. The Study Team's task will be to
undertake the technical work of the study, under the direction of the Leading Group.
Appendix 1 presents the detailed organization structure of the Leading Group and the
Study Team as well as the allocation of study team members to study tasks and the
related person-months.
International and National Experts
15.   Because of the complexity of the Xian Bypass Study, international and national
experts will be contracted to give technical guidance to the study, maintain the excellence
of the analyses and review the draft reports of the Study Team, and to make suggestions
for modifications or additions to them.



-108-                        ANNEX2
16.   Three international experts will be needed in the following areas:
(a)   City planning and transport development;
(b)   Traffic environment impact, with special experience in archeology and
cultural relics; and
(c)   Traffic engineering and highway design.
The first expert (city planning and transport development) will visit Xian for 15-20 days
before the Inception Report, Traffic Report and draft Final Report are prepared; the
second and third experts should arrive in Xian 20 days before the Traffic Report and draft
Final Reports are prepared. Each visit to Xian will require 10 days time, including three
days' report reading time in their country before traveling.  Travel time will be
considered as four days, so the average paid days per trip will be 14.  The total
international experts' time will be equal to about 4.5 person-months. Appendix 2
presents the terms of reference for the international experts.
17.   SPHSDI will directly contract the three experts, following World Bank guidelines
and from a short list of consultants for each position agreed with the Bank
18.   A team of 13 experienced national experts will also be established to provide
advice as requested by the study team and review the three reports. Experts with the
following specializations will form the team:
(a)   Highway Planning                 (2 persons)
(b)   Highway design                   (4 persons)
(c)   City planning and city traffic  (3 persons)
(d)   Traffic enviromnental impact     (2 persons)
(e)   Archeology and cultural relics  (2 persons)
19.   All the national experts shall arrive in Xian about 15 days before each report
(Inception, Traffic and draft Final Report) are prepared and will stay in Xian about 7 days
each time. The total input will be about 12 person-months.

2010 and 2020, with medium and low forecasts being made for each year.
(e)   Using demand matrices compiled from demand forecasts, a standard
allocation model of demand to modes and routes, forecast future highway
demand for each link of the network (without Xian bypass). Repeat the
assignment for each alternative route concept, taking account of the trip
generation or suppression characteristics of each of them. The road
network for each alternative should include the proposed alignment of the
bypass, modifications or additions to connecting roads and interchanges.
Traffic data collection will be undertaken by SPHSDI and XCPDI. The analysis

shall be proposed to be investigated and compared from an engineering
feasibility, economic and financial feasibility, environmental and impact
on cultural relics point of view.
(b)   The views of provincial, city and local governments, residents, and
technical experts on these alternatives shall be sought.
(c)   A comparative evaluation of the alternatives will be made, using a
consistent and comprehensive framework and using the same level of
analysis and optimization of each alternative. The most appropriate
alternative will be recommended, with an indication of why it is
considered preferable to those rejected. (SPHSDI will be in charge of the
above work.)
32.   This recommendation, together with the supporting arguments and information,
will be presented to the national and international experts for their opinions. These
opinions will be presented together with the recommendation to the Leading Group. The
Leading Group will consider the recommendation and accept or reject it. The decision of
the Leading Group will be communicated to MOC, MOF and the World Bank, together
with an explanation in the case of a rejection.
33.   The construction scale, technical standard and a reasonable schedule for
construction of the Xian bypass will be determined, once a decision on the route location
has been made and agreed (including the optimum opening year and whether staged
construction should be applied).

- 118 -        Appendix 2 to ANNEX 2
APPENDIX 2 TO ANNEX 2: STUDY OF XIAN BYPASS:
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS
Introduction
1.    The Shaanxi Provincial Government, through the Shaanxi Provincial Highway
Survey and Design Institute (SPHSDI) is about to commence a study of alternative
locations for a bypass to the city of Xian, one of the most important cities in the social
and cultural history of China. In addition to staff of SPHSDI, the Study Team will
include representatives of the Xian City Planning, Design and Research Institute, the
Shaanxi Provincial Archeology Research Institute and the Shaanxi Provincial
Environmental Institute. The Study will be under the direction of the Leading Group, led
by a representative of the Provincial Governor.
2.   It is proposed to contract three international experts to advise on particular aspects
of the study methodology and to review the relevant portions of the three draft reports to
be produced by the Study team. The foreign costs of the study, including all costs of
international experts whether incurred inside or outside China, will be financed from the
proceeds of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, expected to be presented to
the Board of the World Bank in March 1996.
3.    The Terms of Reference for the Study are attached to these terms of reference for
the three international experts. Each of the three experts should have a minimum of 15
years' professional experience and to be familiar with the transport sector in China,
particularly urban highway development, from the point of view of their own area of
expertise.
Experience Required
4.    The first expert should have expertise in the relationship between transport
development and city planning. He/she should have a postgraduate or professional
qualification in city planning or urban development, as well as in transport or civil
engineering with a specialty in transport or traffic. It is expected that the person selected
will have worked on transport development projects in historic cities, preferably in
developing countries. It would be an added advantage if the expert has experience in
transport studies in China and/or other Asian countries, and be familiar with the
institutional environment within which highway projects are prepared and evaluated in
these countries.
5.    The second expert should have experience in the environmental impact of traffic
in urban areas, with a knowledge of the specific impacts of noise and air pollution on
residents, pedestrians, nonmotorized transport and historic buildings.  Given the



- 119 -         Appendix 2 to ANNEX 2
importance of preservation of archeological and cultural relics in determining the route of
the bypass, this expert should have particular experience in measures to protect sites of
archeological and cultural importance in the planning of urban highways or other major
infrastructure projects. He/she should have a postgraduate qualification in environmental
science and in transport planning (or with transport as a major component of the
environmental science qualification). It would be an added advantage if the expert
selected is familiar with the environmental regulatory framework in China and/or with the
institutional requirements for a project's final environmental approval. He/she will have
worked on a number of urban infrastructure development projects in historic cities,
preferably in China or other Southeast Asian countries.
6.    The final expert will have a professional or postgraduate qualification in traffic
engineering and highway design, with a specialty in urban transport. He/she will have a
wide experience in the transport and traffic aspects of urban highway development,
particularly in respect of intersection and interchange design and location, the interaction
between motorized and nonmotorized road users, and the distribution of traffic from
urban highways through the urban areas to their final destinations. It would be an added
advantage if the expert has experience in similar studies in Chinese or Southeast Asian
cities where rapid motorization has been an issue and where integration of urban
highways into the built environment has been successfully managed.
Responsibilities and Outputs
7.    All three experts will be required to provide specialist advice within their area of
expertise as requested by the Shaanxi Government, always within the time limits of their
contract. All requests for advice will be sent to the experts in writing in English (fax) and
replies should be made in the same form. In general, replies to specific queries will be
required within seven calendar days.
8.    The experts will also be required to review the draft reports to be produced by the
Study Team and to provide comments during one-week review meetings in Xian. The
first expert should attend all three meetings , while the second and third experts should
attend only the second and third meetings. The proposed timing for the review meetings
is:
May 15, 1996       Inception report (including recommendations of the routes to be
investigated, detailed work schedule and the results of traffic
counts and surveys. -
October 31, 1996    Traffic report, including results of traffic projections and traffic
assignments to alternative routes, and initial environmental
assessments and reviews of cultural relic sites likely to be affected
by each route and the possible remedial measures to be taken in
both cases.



-120 -         Appendix 2 to ANNEX 2
February 10, 1997   Final report, including all the evaluation assessments of each route,
a comparative assessment of the alternative routes and a
recommendation for the alignment of the bypass
9.    Draft reports will be provided to the experts at least 15 working days in advance
of each meeting and preliminary written comments (In English or Chinese) should be
submitted by the experts to SPHSDI with a copy (in English) to the World Bank at least
two days before the start of each meeting.
Contract
10.   Each input to review of a report will be equivalent to about 14 person-days and
the total contracted time will be about 2 person-months for the first expert and 1.25
person-months for each of the other two experts.



-121-                      ANNEX3
ANNEX 3: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR HIGHWAY
MAINTENANCE STUDY
Background
1.    Shaanxi is an inland province in middle-west China. In 1994, it had a population
of about 34.8 million and an area of about 206,000 square kilometers. Transport is
predominantly by road and rail. In 1994, road transport accounted for about 87 percent of
the tons and 18 percent of the ton-kilometers, as well as 87 percent of the passengers and
32 percent of the passenger-kilometers. Road transport has been increasing at an annual
rate of 12 percent and is expected to increase by about 10 percent annually over the next
decade.
2.    The present highway network consists of about 39,000 km, of which about
8,800 km are national and provincial roads maintained by the Shaanxi Highway
Administration Bureau (SHAB). About 72 percent of the highway network is paved, and
only 4 percent are classified as Class II highway (2-lane roads) or higher standard.
Generally, roads are reasonably well maintained. In 1993, only about 20 percent of the
roads were considered to be in fair or bad condition. However, maintenance is labor-
intensive and not much equipment is used, with the result that the quality of the riding
surface is rough, which adversely affects the vehicle operating costs.
3.   In Shaanxi, highway maintenance is under the control of the High-Grade Highway
Administration Bureau (SHGHAB) and SHAB. SHGHAB is responsible for the high-
grade highways in the Province; the total length of which is about 174 km. Presently five
maintenance stations maintain these roads. SHAB is in charge of the maintenance of the
trunk highway system (about 9,700 km) and exercises its control of this network through
10 prefectural highway districts, which are in turn in charge of 112 county-level highway
districts. As for the maintenance of the county and township roads, this is done through
10 local highway maintenance sections (one for each prefecture) and 103 maintenance
stations at the county level. In total there are 903 maintenance squads and about 30,000
people are involved in highway maintenance, or about 1 person/km, which is high in
comparison with developed countries.
4.    The condition of the roads is determined monthly by routine checks of the county
districts, and is checked quarterly by the central districts. SHAB inspects the condition of
the roads on sample basis once every six months. No scientific measurements are used in
determining the condition of the maintenance of roads. Consequently, this system tends
to overinflate the percentage of roads in good condition. The data on traffic volumes on
roads is collected through 3 continuous counting stations, 159 periodic stations (where
traffic volumes are collected for three days each month) and 659 general survey stations



-122-                      ANNEX3
(where traffic is counted for two days each year). These stations cover only 72 percent of
the total highway network. Data transfer and analysis is done manually, which requires a
long time and results in errors. Consequently, traffic volume data is not adequately taken
into consideration in determining the conditions of roads.
5.    The Shaanxi Provincial Transport Department (SPTD), under the guidance of
MOC, started developing a modem road data bank (RDB) and pavement management
system (PMS). A prefectural-level RDB has been successfully completed and will be
implemented in 5 of the 10 prefectures in Shaanxi by the end of 1996. SPTD wants to
develop a provincial-level RDB. However, these systems have not yet been used as
effective tools in better management of highway maintenance.
6.    SPTD is aware of the problems facing highway maintenance in Shaanxi Province.
SPTD considers the productivity of the existing highway maintenance to be rather low
and the quality of maintenance to require substantial improvement. Consequently, it
intends to undertake a four-part Highway Maintenance Study to lay the foundations for
better use of existing resources (financial, human and management, equipment and
materials) to achieve a higher quality of more efficient and less costly maintenance of
highways in Shaanxi.
7.    The first part of the study is centered on improved ways of conducting
maintenance primarily through introduction of. the market mechanism in highway
maintenance operations. The second part is concentrated on introduction of more
mechanization of highway maintenance operations to improve quality and increase
productivity. The third part of the study is focused on collection of traffic volume data
(motorized and nonmotorized traffic) so as to reduce the time required for collection and
analysis of data, increase accuracy of the collected data, and provide on a more timely
basis the needed traffic volume data that is required for planning, investment decisions,
and maintenance purposes.  The fourth part of the study is directed toward the
development of the provincial-level RDB.
Objectives of the Study
8.    The objectives of the study are to increase the productivity and the quality of
maintenance operations and to help SPTD properly prepare itself for the orderly
introduction of the market mechanism in its maintenance operations. To achieve these
objectives, the study will focus on the following four main aspects of highway
maintenance:  (a) introduction of the market mechanism in highway maintenance,
primarily through maintenance by contract; (b) increased mechanization of maintenance
operations to improve the quality and efficiency of maintenance operations; (c) improved
methods of collecting and analyzing traffic (motorized and nonmotorized) volume data;
and (d) development of a provincial-level Road Data Bank.

Main Study Activities
9.    The main activities require to carry out the above-mentioned four aspects of
highway maintenance to include, but are not necessarily limited to the following
activities.
10.   Organization of Highway Maintenance
(a)   Conduct a comprehensive review of SPTD's operations and organizational
structure, and identify the activities/functions, in the organization,
operations and management of its road and highway network (with
emphasis on maintenance), which are suited for commercial operations.
This may refer to the organization equipment and technical capabilities,
staffing and funding to carry out the operations and management of these
functions.
(b)   Analyze each of the above functions in terms of current performance, and
propose alternatives, which specify the organizational, technical and
fnancial implications.
(c)   Analyze the implications of the above on the role of SPTD in highway
operations with emphasis on highway maintenance. This may entail that
SPTD would play less the role of an implementing agency and more of a
regulatory and supervisory entity. Special attention should be given to the
question of surplus labor resulting from shifts in the role of the SPTD.
(d)   Estimate the implications of the changing role of SPTD  on its
organizational structure, management, labor force and skills mix, and
associated training and institutional capacity requirements.  Special
attention should be paid to the transitional arrangements required.
(e)   Consider the legal and institutional implications of the above, taking into
account the central and provincial policy, regulatory, financial and
enforcement frameworks.
(f)   On the basis of the above, the study should make some preliminary
recommendations regarding future courses of action by SPTD (both in the
transitional period and in the long-term), with special emphasis on
highway maintenance.  Also, the results of the study should be
documented in a final report.
11.   Mechanization of Highway Maintenance Operations   -
(a)   Review the existing methods of highway maintenance and identify the
operations which are suitable for introduction of machinery. Pertinent



- 124-                     ANNEX3
information and experience of foreign countries, especially the developed
ones, would be very useful in this regard.
(b)   Identify the types and main specifications of equipment that are best suited
to the various maintenance operations, taking into consideration the
existing levels of mechanization, cost of new machines versus availability
of funds, and skills of existing labor as well as the required training to
properly operate and maintain these equipment.
(c)   Identify the main materials, as well as their quantities and geographic
distribution, required to properly operate and maintain the higher levels of
mechanization of maintenance operations.  These include fuel, oil,
lubricants, and spare parts. Also, estimate the requirements for building
structures to house these equipment, stores for materials and spare parts, as
well as garages for maintenance of these equipment.
(d)   Investigate the required instruments required to ensure proper quality
control in maintenance operations, including laboratories and their staffing
and related training of staff.
(e)   Study various ways for organization and deployment of the machines for
highway maintenance. This should be related to the overall organization
of highway maintenance, introduction of the market mechanism into
highway maintenance as well as to the main types of maintenance
operations (routine, periodic, rehabilitation), and size of existing and
future maintenance operations as well as their geographic distribution.
(f)   Assess the impact of higher mechanization on the number and skills of
existing labor involved in highway maintenance, training required to
properly operate and maintain the new machinery, and propose realistic
means of dealing with excess labor taking pertinent current laws and
practices into consideration.
(g)   Assess the financial implications of the various levels of mechanization of
highway maintenance operations on the overall budgets for highway
maintenance. At present, most of the financial resources are used for
salaries of maintenance labor and management.
(h)   On the basis of the above, propose a realistic and appropriate higher level
of mechanization for highway maintenance in Shaanxi and outline a time-
phased plan of action for gradual and orderly introduction of
mechanization in highway maintenance. This plan must be relatively easy
to carry out and can be used in other provinces in China. It should also
recognize that levels of mechanization increase over time and as the
economy of a province develops.



-125 -                      ANNEX3
(i)   Prepare a final report that documents the results of this study.
12.   Improved Collection and Analysis of Traffic Volume Data
(a)   Review  existing methods of collection of traffic (motorized and
nonmotorized) volume data and their analyses.
(b)   Review existing number and geographic distribution of equipment for
collection of traffic volume data and relate these to the functional and
administrative classes of highways.
(c)   Based on the above two activities, identify the problems with the existing
system of collection and analysis of traffic volume data and the speed with
which these data are made available to the highway maintenance agencies.
(d)   Determine an overall system for collection of traffic volume data in
Shaanxi Province including number and location of continuous traffic
counting stations and periodic counting stations (including definition of
the period-quarterly, monthly, and for how many days each time). This
system should be capable of identifying types of motor vehicles and
nonmotorized traffic. Criteria for the establishment of each type of traffic
counting station should be established. This should help in deciding
location and number and type of stations to be added in the future. The
system for traffic volume data should be related to the Road Data Bank
being developed in Shaanxi Province.
(e)   Based on experience in other provinces in China as well as in other
countries, identify the type of equipment best suited for collection of
traffic volume data. A comparison of these equipment should help define
the equipment best suited for Shaanxi.
(f)    Estimate the number of equipment by type needed as well as their costs in
both foreign and local currencies and develop a time-phased action plan
for acquisition and deployment of these equipment.
(g)   Review the various methods for transmission of traffic volume data from
the collection sites to the place(s) where data will be processed and/or
analyzed, and determine the methods best suited for Shaanxi's conditions.
(h)   Develop a system  for analysis of traffic volume data including its
hardware and software requirements. Maximum use should be made of
existing software and the emphasis should be on adapting the available
software to Shaanxi conditions rather than developing new software. The
software should: (i) have adequate statistical analytical capability of
traffic flows; (ii) provide for correction of traffic flows to reflect hourly,
daily, and monthly changes in traffic flows; (iii) help produce trend and



-126-                       ANNEX3
features of sectional traffic flows; (iv) analyze traffic volumes by axle
loads; and (v) analyze traffic volume to capacity relationships.
(i)    Determine the specific agency/units within SPTD  that should be
responsible for maintenance of the traffic volume equipment, the
collection and transmission of data, and the analysis of data and provision
of reports to other units/agencies within SPTD. Also, realistic time
schedules should be developed for the step-by-step and orderly flow of
information from the traffic volume measurement sites to reports on traffic
volumes to the various units/agencies in SPTD. The related manpower
requirements, as well as training needs, should be estimated.
(j)    Estimate the capital cost of the equipment for collection of traffic volume
data and of the hardware and software for analysis, training costs, as well
as the annual cost of running the system.
(k)   Document the results of this study in a final report.
13.   Provincial Level Road Data Bank
(a)   SPTD is recognized as one of the leaders in China in the development of
RDB. It has already developed a prefectural-level system (in Baoji) and
will complete its implementation in 5 of its 10 prefectures by the end of
1996. The proposed provincial-level RDB serves as the intermediate line
between the prefectural-level RDB and the MOC-level RDB. Hence, it
has to be developed within the overall framework set by MOC. Moreover,
it could form the basis for the system to be adopted by MOC for use in all
provinces in China.
(b)   Determine the functions of the provincial level RDB. Tentatively these
are to:
(i)   provide most up-to-date and accurate information for highway
planning, design, maintenance and management;
(ii)   provide reports and maps and to exchange information with other
concerned departments and provide information services for the
public;
(iii)   allow the user to add (after authorization) limited function and
attribute data;
(iv)    establish client/server network with the prefectural-level RDB;
(v)    use multiple-media technology to provide graphics, images and
data to users;



-127-                       ANNEX3
(vi)   allow dynamic queries, segmentation and linear overlay; and
(vii)   interface with the Chinese Pavement Management System (CPMS)
to process highway network maintenance analyses.
(c)   Determine the appropriate scope of the data including range of data
collection, geographic information that is consistent with the desired level
of coverage and depth of investigation.
(d)   Develop and implement an open data base system that would give the user
more flexibility to modify and add data items or to add new functions to
meet the needs of highway management.
(e)   Develop a client/server architecture that allows more flexibility and
expansion possibilities in the future. This architecture is more economical
and practical than other systems.
(f)    Develop a system that can process special geographic features and output
highway theme maps (GIS) that meet the growing needs of highway
management.
(g)   Using research on road broken chainage dynamic processing technique,
solve the problems of data processing due to changes in mileposts caused
by reconstruction of highways and their spatial graphic processing.
(h)   Document the results of the study in a final report.
Study Organization and Staffing
14.   Because of the importance of the study and the complexity of the issues involved,
and in order that the study can proceed successfully and reach realistic conclusions, a
Leading Group will be formed, comprising representatives of SPTD, Provincial Labor
Department, Provincial Machinery Department and MOC. Its task would be to guide,
coordinate, check and review the work of the Study Teams. Four Study Teams, one for
each of the four aspects of the study, will be formed. These teams will include engineers,
organization and labor specialists, computer specialists, economists and technicians
mainly from SPTD. SPTD would, as needed, utilize Chinese experts from other
organizations in Shaanxi and other provinces in China. Also, international experts would
be utilized to give technical guidance to the study teams, maintain the excellence of the
analyses and review the draft reports of the study teams and make suggestions for
modifications or additions to them.
15.   Four international experts would be needed for a total of about 8.5 person-months
in the following areas:



-128 -                     ANNEX3
(a)   One highway organization and maintenance expert with a minimum of 15
years of experience in the field of organization and management with
emphasis on key issues of institutional arrangements in highway
departments, especially maintenance operations. The services of this
expert will be required for 1.5 months for the study of introduction of the
market mechanism in highway maintenance and for general assistance to
the other three studies, especially the study of mechanization of highway
maintenance.
(b)   One labor economist/specialist with a minimum of 15 years experience in
the field of labor economics and relations, with emphasis on issues related
to surplus labor. The services of this expert will be required for 1.5
months for the study of the introduction of the market mechanism in
highway maintenance as well as for the study of mechanization of
highway maintenance operations.
(c)   One senior highway engineer with a minimum of 15 years experience in
maintenance management, with emphasis on equipment for highway
maintenance. It is envisioned that the services of this specialist will be
needed for about 1.5 months, primarily for the study of mechanization of
highway maintenance operations, but also for general support to the other
three studies.
(d)   One highway engineer with a minimum of 15 years experience in
development of RDB, PMS and in highway maintenance. The services of
this expert will be required for about 4 person-months for the development
of the provincial RDB.
16.  In addition to the services of the international experts, local staff would be trained
in the following areas as follows:
(a)   8 persons would be trained for one month abroad (total 8 person-months)
in the areas of maintenance management and maintenance by contract, and
11 persons would be trained in the same areas in China for one month
(total 11 person-months).
(b)   2 persons would be trained for one month abroad in the area of traffic
volume data collection and processing (total 2 person-months) and
6 persons would also be trained in the same areas in China for I month
(total 6 person-months).
(c)   Training for RDB development consisting of:
(i)    5 persons for 3 weeks (total 3.7 person-months) abroad in the area
of road view video image capture system;



-129-                      ANNEX3
(ii)    5 persons for 3 weeks (total 3.7 person-months) abroad in the area
of object-oriented database/programming technology;
(iii)   2 international experts for a total of I person-month to train local
experts in the area of GIS technology.
17.   The cost of the above training is estimated at about $200,000 for training abroad,
and Y 310,000 (equivalent to about $37,000) for training within China, and $30,000 for
two international experts to come to China. The total cost is estimated at about $267,000.

Reports
19.   For each of the four areas of the proposed study, it is expected that the following
reports will be prepared and where pertinent will be reviewed by the international and
national experts and would then be submitted to the Leading Group and the World Bank
for review and comments.
(a)   Inception Report. This report will be completed within two months of
the start of each of the four parts of the study and would include the
revised work plan, comments on the terms-of-reference as well as
proposed changes to them and the related staffing and study
implementation schedule.

ANNEX 4: ROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT
General
1.    The traffic accident situation in Shaanxi (as in other provinces in China) is
serious. During 1990-94, annually about 7,860 accidents took place, resulting in about
1,540 fatalities and about 4,290 injuries. The number of accidents is not high, but this
may reflect a low degree of reporting of accidents, especially in rural areas. However, the
number killed is relatively high, and the rate of 75 killed per 10,000 motor vehicles is
high and is about 40 times higher than that for Western European and North American
countries. But, the number killed per 100,000 population (0.5) is less than that in those
same countries. Also, the severity rate (26 percent) defined as the number killed divided
by the total number killed and injured is high.
2.    Due to this situation, the Bank engaged the services of two separate experts-one
a Danish and the other a Norwegian safety expert under Danish and Norwegian Trust
Funds respectively, to study the topic, identify the problems, develop a generalized
program for tackling the road safety problem and define a component for inclusion in the
proposed project. The Danish and Norwegian experts visited Shaanxi in April 1995
(preparation/preappraisal) and July 1995 (appraisal of the project), respectively, and
submitted their final reports in May and August 1995 respectively. These reports form
the basis for the contents of this annex.
Institutions Involved
3.    Roadway safety is a complex subject involving many issues (driver, vehicle, road,
environment, engineering, education, enforcement, attitudes and behavior, etc.) and many
entities. The Traffic Police Team of Shaanxi Public Security Bureau (PSB) has the major
role. It is responsible for vehicle testing and licensing, driver training and testing, traffic
law enforcement, information and education, and collection and treatment of accident
data. In each prefecture, there is a Traffic Police Branch and in each county, there is a
Traffic Police Brigade. Each brigade has one or more Traffic Police Squadrons, which
are responsible for the management of traffic as well as propaganda. The total number of
traffic police in Shaanxi was about 6,500 in 1995. The Shaanxi Provincial Transport
Department (SPTD) is responsible for design, construction and maintenance of highways,
as well as installation and maintenance of road traffic signs and markings. Also, the
Shaanxi Scientific Research Institute, when asked by Public Security, undertakes vehicle
testing and studies of accidents. Hospitals treat accident victims and ambulance services
transport victims.



-133 -                      ANNEX4
Existing Situation
4.    There is a variety of traffic safety activities taking place in Shaanxi province.
These activities do, however, seem to be relatively isolated activities. Even though most
of the activities are managed by SPTD and PSB, and there are reasonable relations
between the two, there seems to be limited coordination. The most important deficiency
does seem to be the total lack of long-term planning within the field of traffic safety.
Another important problem is that there is little development work going on within this
field. The main objectives of the traffic safety component will therefore logically be to
strengthen the capacity for policy-making and planning, and to initiate some pilot
development work. This should hopefully start a lasting process consisting of the
development of regular traffic safety planning and coordination, which is a prerequisite
for efficient comprehensive traffic safety work. It is further believed that the pilot work
on black spot improvement will start a lasting process, as this way of working has proven
to be one of the most efficient activities within traffic safety work. Also, the work on
accident statistics will hopefully give birth to future research on the relationship between
accidents and accident contributing factors.
5.    It was observed that the existing accident data collection system is adequate, even
if there is room for improvement. This system was elaborated a few years ago and is
used in all provinces, and hence it is not subject to local modifications for the time being.
6.    It should be noted that in general, both in SPTD and PSB, there is an agreement as
to the description of the accident situation as unsatisfactory.  When it comes to
monitoring and improvements, however, it is sometimes difficult to get a positive
response. There is a general reluctance in considering possible improvements. The
present situation and present procedures are to a certain degree considered as sacred, and
improvements are not looked for.
7.    The agreements presented on the following pages are based on the discussions
between the missions, SPTD and PSB. The implementation of some elements will be
subject to approval by the Provincial Government.
Traffic Safety Policy And Planning
8.    Leading Group For Traffic Safety Planning. It was agreed to establish a
Leading Group for traffic safety coordination, policy-making and planning. The Leading
Group will be chaired by the Vice Governor, and it will have two representatives from
each of SPTD and PSB. The Deputy Directors of SPTD and PSB respectively will act as
Vice Chainnen. The main functions of the Leading Group will be to monitor the accident
situation and to propose strategies and policies as well as comprehensive traffic safety
plans to the Provincial Government. Such plans should include all aspects of traffic
safety work, also those parts which are outside the responsibility of SPTD and PSB. The
analyses of the situation should be done on a yearly basis. Short-term action plans should
also be developed on a yearly basis and objectives and longer-term plans should equally
be revised at regular intervals. The Leading Group will be a permanent group, and its



-134 -                       ANNEX4
activities will go on after the termination of the project. The Leading Group will act as a
board for the Traffic Safety Unit (see below). It is anticipated that the Leading Group
will meet a few times per year. The Leading Group shall be established by the end of
February 1996. Establishment of this group will be a condition for Board presentation.
SPTD will inform the Bank once the Leading Group has been established. The first
tentative policy and action plan shall be presented by the end of 1997.
9.    A Traffic Safety Unit. It was agreed to establish a Traffic Safety Unit (TSU) in
order to prepare the work for the Leading Group. It is suggested that TSU be
administratively situated in SPTD. TSU will be staffed by personnel from SPTD and
PSB. One part of TSU will be permanently staffed. This part will act as the secretariat of
the Leading Group. The Secretariat will be established by February 29, 1996, and the
Bank will be informed once it is established.
10.   The Secretariat will carry out analyses of the traffic accident situation, and on the
basis of such analyses it will prepare traffic safety objectives, strategies and short- and
long-term traffic safety plans. These objectives, strategies and plans will be presented to
the Leading Group, which will discuss them in an annual conference on traffic safety.
When adopted by the Leading Group they will be presented to the Provincial
Government. The Secretariat will monitor the situation and suggest new actions to be
taken and new studies to be undertaken. The Secretariat will also act as a resource group
for the authorities. In carrying out their duties, the Secretariat should have the possibility
to get professional assistance from the staff in SPTD and PSB when needed.
11.   Shortly after its creation, two members of the Secretariat will be offered a four-
week study trip abroad. The training will focus on accident monitoring, on the
elaboration of traffic safety objectives and the development of traffic safety policies and
plans, and also on the necessity to undertake regular traffic safety development work and
research. Another part of TSU will carry out various traffic safety studies. The staffing
will correspond to the need defined by the ongoing studies. The studies will be initiated
by July 1996, and the Bank will be informed on their initiation.
Safety Audit Procedures
12.   It has been seen in industrialized countries that despite detailed road design
manuals, new road plans do not meet all the requirements for safety. Many countries are
now introducing what is called safety audits of new road plans. This work consists of the
development of a number of check lists and guidelines that explain how to check road
design to ensure that the roads do not contribute to the occurrence of accidents.
13.   It was agreed that such safety audit procedures shall be developed by TSU during
the project period. In this regard, Shaanxi Province should avail itself of the safety audit
work to be carried out under the Bank-financed Shanghai-Zhejiang Highway Project
(Loan 3569-CHA).



-135 -                       ANNEX4
Improved Computer Software
14.   The existing accident data collection form provides a large amount of data on
each accident. This makes it possible to analyze the accident data in many ways that are
useful for traffic safety planning and traffic safety work. However, the current software
only allows a few such analyses to be carried out, which seriously hampers the
exploitation of the accident data.
15.   It was agreed to improve the traffic accident reporting forms, review the coding of
the geographic location of accidents, install the British Transport Research Laboratory
(TRL) Microcomputer Accident Analysis Package (MAAP) at PSB headquarters and at
TSU, and train the staff in the related activities. Twenty-five police staff from all
prefectures would be trained in registration, location coding, and data verification. An
international consultant for 3.5 person-months would help in the training, installing
MAAP, revising the accident data forms and geographic location system as well as
adjusting the MAAP system on the basis of early experience with its use.
Pilot Black Spot Work
16.   Traffic safety work in industrialized countries has shown that the improvement of
traffic accident black spots is one of the most efficient traffic safety measures. Black spot
improvement work consists of the following steps:
(a)   Identification of black spots
(b)   Analyses of the accident situation
(c)    Selection of improvement measures
(d)   Implementation
(e)   Monitoring
17.   It was agreed that pilot black spot work be carried out as part of the project during
the first four years of the project period (1997-2000). For this purpose, a black spot
group will be established with TSU. The group will consist of five persons from the
Road Maintenance Section and the Road Management Section of the Highway
Administration Bureau.
18.   The study shall be carried out as an experiment with control site. Some 20-30
black spots will be identified. Out of these, some 10-15 are selected at random for
treatment. The rest will constitute the control sites. It will be tried to select half of the
black spots at grade intersections (X-crossings and Y-crossings) and half of them at road
sections. Some should be near urban areas and some in rural areas.
19.   It is reported that black spots can be identified with the existing accident data
analyses program. The data forms will be made available by the police at the prefecture



-136 -                       ANNEX 4
level, where they are stored. The accident reports and sketches from the accidents at the
black spots will be made available to the black spot group by the police at the county
level.
20.   For the analyses of the black spots and their traffic, the group will be provided
with a vehicle, a photo camera, a video camera and monitor, a speed radar, a friction
detector and two rulers (steel and leather), and for office work it will be provided with a
computer and a printer.
21.   Three members of the black spot unit will initially be trained in China for a total
of 5 person-months and outside China for a total of 3 person-months. Also, about 3.5
person-months of international expert(s) will be provided for general support of the Unit,
review of results of studies and guidance on new activities to be undertaken.
22.   Subsequent to the analyses, SPTD will implement the proposed improvements. A
special budget of Y 10 million will be established by SPTD for this purpose. One million
yuan will be allocated the first year, and then two, three and four million in the following
years. This special budget will also cover all specific costs related to the black spot
analyses.
23.   The black spot work is expected to be initiated by January 1997 and go on for a
four-year period. After termination of the pilot black spot work, the black spot work will
be transferred to the Maintenance Section at the prefecture level on a permanent basis.
The personnel who participated in the pilot black spot work would be responsible for the
training of the relevant personnel at the prefecture level.
Storage of Accident Files
24.   In order to carry out black spot work, it is necessary to get hold of complete data
concerning the accidents at the black spots. The identification of the black spots will
identify the place of the black spot and the number of accidents at the black spot, and it
will provide serial numbers of the accidents that have occurred.
25.   The definition of a black spot is a place where many accidents have happened
during a certain period of time. It is obvious that one has to consider a period covering a
number of years. At present, it is required to keep the accident data for at least three
years, and current practice in Shaanxi province is to destroy the files after three years. It
is obvious that this can seriously hamper the possibility for carrying out black spot work.
It was therefore agreed that this practice will be changed, and that accident files will be
kept at the county level for five years in the future.
Accident Analyses
26.   The knowledge about accidents and their contributing factors is extremely limited
today. The police identifies what they consider to be the "cause" of the accident.
Thereby they can determine the percentage of the accidents which is caused by for



-137-                         ANNEX4
example "reckless driving." This is, however a legal consideration, and it is seldom
fruiitful for initiating traffic safety actions. It is widely accepted today that an accident is
a multifactoral event, meaning that it is a combination of many factors, which in a certain
combination leads to an accident. This implies that the accident can be avoided by
influencing any of the present factors. An important step in traffic safety work is
therefore to identify factors that are overrepresented in accidents.
27.   It was agreed that TSU would undertake statistical work to describe the accidents
according to all the contributing factors that are available on the accident form currently
in use. This could, for example, be used to determine the number of accidents per type of
vehicle. When compared with the vehicle population, this will give an idea about the
relative risk between the different types of vehicles.
Driver Training Study
28.   Driver training and driver behavior are important factors that affect the occurrence
of accidents. Despite a very long driver training period and an apparently comprehensive
training curriculum, the Shaanxi traffic police claim that unqualified drivers are an
important accident-producing factor. This could imply that there are deficiencies in the
driver training system, and that safety improvements could be obtained by improving the
driver training system. Appendix 1 to this Annex presents the outline terms of reference
for a study of driver training in Shaanxi. The study will be carried out by a local team
assisted by 1 person-month of an international specialist. The results of the study would
be useful to Shaanxi Province, MOC, PSB, and other provinces in China.
Evaluation of the Traffic Safety Component
29.   The objective of the traffic safety component is, first of all, to initiate activities
that will start processes leading to improved traffic safety in a longer perspective. In
order to reach the objective, it is important that all activities are carried out and that there
is a reasonable follow-up. If this is not the case, correcting actions should be taken. It
has therefore been agreed that by the end of the fifth year, a qualified Chinese consultant,
acceptable to the Bank, for 1 person-month shall carry out an independent evaluation of
the implementation of the highway safety component.
Costs
30.   Table 1 summarizes the cost of the road safety program.  The total cost is
estimated at about Y 13.0 million, of which Y 10.0 million is for implementation of the
accident black spots.
31.   Implementation Program. The road safety program will be implemented over
four years (1997-2000). Equipment is expected to be procured in 1997. Training will be
implemented during 1997 and 1998 and the driver training study in 1998.
Implementation of the accident black spots will span four years (1997-2000).

APPENDIX 1 TO ANNEX 4: OUTLINE TERMS OF
REFERENCE FOR DRIVER TRAINING STUDY
Background
1.    The traffic accident situation in Shaanxi Province, expressed as the number of
persons killed per 10,000 vehicles, is relatively representative of the situation in China,
but very poor compared to industrialized countries.  Important improvements are
therefore needed. Driver training and driver behavior are important factors that affect the
accident situation. Despite a very long driver training period, and an apparently
comprehensive driver training curriculum, the Shaanxi police claim that unqualified
drivers are an important accident-producing factor. With the hypothesis that good
training produces qualified drivers, and that qualified drivers are safe, this could imply
that there are deficiencies in the driver training system, and that safety improvements
could be obtained by improving the driver training system.
Content
2.    The study should basically compare actual driver behavior with required behavior.
It is important to select behavioral elements that are believed to be related to traffic
safety. The driver's knowledge in first aid should also be included in the study. When
behavior deficiencies are detected, the study should discuss if the deficiencies are most
effectively corrected by improved training or by law enforcement, and hence make
suggestions as to improvements in the driver training system.
Scope of Work
3.   (a)   Define required behavior for a number of behavioral elements:
approximately 5 person-months;
(b)   Observe actual driver behavior: approximately 35 person-months;
(c)   Detect discrepancies between required and observed behavior:
approximately 10 person-months;
(d)   Evaluate the most efficient improvement agent: approximately 10 person-
months; and
(e)   Make suggestions as to improved driver training procedures:
approximately 12 person-months.



- 140 -         Appendix 1 to ANNEX 4
4.    The study will be carried out by three representatives from SPTD during a two-
year period. During the initial phase of the study, the team will be assisted for one month
by an international specialist on driver behavior research.
Budget
5.    The study will require 6 person-years at a total cost of Y 60,000. This cost
element is included in the budget for the traffic safety component of the Second Shaanxi
Provincial Highway Project. It is believed that no further manpower input is required.
6.    The study will further require I person-month input from an international expert
at a total cost of about Y 200,000. This cost element is included in the budget for the
traffic safety component of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project.
7.    Other cost elements, particularly related to data collection, are difficult to
evaluate. Such cost elements will be covered by a special budget (Y 10 million)
established by SPTD for black spot improvement and traffic safety studies as a part of the
Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project.



-141-                      ANNEX5
ANNEX 5: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND
ACTION PLAN SUMMARY
A. BACKGROUND
1.    Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of the following four major highways
were carried out by Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Environmental Protection Science [(a)
and (d) below] and Xian Highway Transportation University [(b) and (c) below]. The
EIA reports were submitted to the Bank in October 1994 and reviewed by the Bank
during the identification mission in October 1994.
(a)   Weinan-Tongguan Section (WTE: 78.1 km) of Xian-Tongguan
Expressway;
(b)   Northeastern Section of Xian Bypass (11.0 km) of Xian-Tongguan
Expressway;
(c)   Tongchuan-Huangling four-lane Class I Highway (THH: 71.3 km) and
doubling of two-lane Class II Auto-only Highway (Yaoxian-Tongchuan
Section: 18.4 km); and
(d)   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II Auto-only Highway (LXH: 48.3 km).
2.    Based on the comments by the Bank, revised EIA reports and Environmental
Action Plans (EAPs) of the above highways, EIA reports and EAPs of the following
three, two-lane Class II Auto-only highway connections, and an Environmental
Assessment Summary (EA Summary) covering all seven highways were prepared and
submitted to the Bank in January 1995. The Bank commented in March 1995 and further
discussed them during the preparation mission in April 1995. During the preparation
mission, it was decided that the Northeastern Section of the Xian Bypass will be dropped
from the project, considering that the approval had not been obtained from the central
government agencies including the Cultural Relics Department on the proposed
alignment of the Northwestern Section of the Xian Bypass, which would affect the
alignment of the Northeastern Section. The draft final EIA reports, EAPs of all the six
highways [(a), (c) and (d) in para. 1 and (a)-(c) in this para.] including interconnecting
roads, and the EA Summary covering them were submitted to the Bank in May 1995.
(a)   Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum two-lane Class II Auto-only
Highway (LTH: 5.9 km);
(b)   Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple two-lane Class II Auto-only
Highway (JFH: 20.1 kin); and



-142-                      ANNEX S
(c)   Jiangzhuang-Tangyu two-lane Class II Auto-only Highway (JTH:
15.7 km).
3.    Regarding the rural roads improvement program to alleviate poverty (RIPA) in a
number of poor counties, it was agreed that a Sectoral Environmental Assessment
approach would be applied. Accordingly, EIA reports and EAPs for the first batch of
projects under the RIPA component were prepared and submitted to the Bank in May
1995.
4.    These EIA-related documents including those for the six high-grade highways and
RIPA projects were reviewed and discussed during the appraisal, and the revised EIA-
related documents were submitted to the Bank in September 1995, and found satisfactory.
5.    An EIA was also undertaken for the improvement/upgrading of Xian-Sanyuan
Class I Highway (XSH) and its relief road, which was added to the project during the
appraisal in July 1995. The EIA report and EAP were submitted to the Bank in October
1995, and reviewed by the Bank during the highway mission in November 1995. Based
on the comments by the Bank, the revised documents were submitted in December 1995
and found satisfactory.
6.    The process of environmental review in)volved inputs from various units in the
province, including environmental protection bureaus, research institutions and
universities. The affected groups and NGOs along the highways, and the people subject
to resettlement and land acquisition in particular, have been intensively consulted.
7.    The policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of
development projects in China were followed during preparation and evaluation of the
EIA, as well as the Bank's OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Major laws and
regulations applied to the EIA for the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project are

C. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
10.   Geology and Topography: Weinan-Tongguan Expressway and three Class II
auto-only highway connections (LTH, JFH and JTH) go through the areas in the Wei
River Basin, Guanzhong Plain with Qinling Mountains to the south and the Wei River,
Jing River and the Yellow River to the north. The land is broad, plain and partially
terraced with an average height of approximately 340-400 m above the sea level. The
Guanzhong area is one of the areas of active earthquakes and Xian is on the earthquake
belt with 8 scale intensity between the Fen River and Wei River. The intensity of the
typical earthquake in the Wei River Basin is usually about 7 scale. The Lantian-
Xiaoshangyuan Class II Highway goes through the mountains and hilly areas in front of
the Qinling Mountains, along the valleys of Senen Winding River, Lan Bright River and
Clear River. Both sides of the river valleys are steep and the rivers run quite fast. The
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway (THH) goes through the southern part of the
North Shaanxi Loess Plateau, getting higher toward the northwest. THH goes through
loess ridges along the Wang River, the Half Valley and Xi River and then rock-based
mountains with steep cliffs and deep valleys.
11.   Climate and Hydrology. Except THH, the other proposed highways are being
constructed in the eastern part of Guanzhong Plain where the climate is fairly warm
(average temperatures range 13-14C), wet with long winters and summers, and with
moderate rainfall that concentrates in July, August and September (annual rainfall range
600-700 mm). THH goes through the southern part of the Loess Plateau, where average
temperature ranges 9-1 0C and annual rainfall from 630 to 650 mm. The highways under
the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project traverse many rivers, all of which belong
to the Wei River drainage area in the Yellow River System. The Guanzhong Plain is rich
in underground water, which is 5-15 m deep and used for drinking and farming.
12.   Economic Situation: Shaanxi is an inland province, located in the middle west
of central China, has 205,000 km  area and a population of 34 million. Its current
economic development ranks at medium level in China. The province is divided into
three areas, namely Northern Shaanxi Plateau, Guanzhong Plain and Southern Shaanxi
Mountains. The northern Shaanxi is rich in coal, natural gas and petroleum, becoming an
important base of energy resources in the country. Guanzhong Plain is the hub of
developing Shaanxi economy with its dense population, developed economy and
industries. This area also has rich tourism resources. There are plenty of mineral
deposits, biological and hydroelectric resources in Southern Shaanxi that need to be
further developed.
13.   Land Use: The main land use of the project areas is agriculture. The Guanzhong
area is the grain store of the province and the products are mainly wheat and corn with an
annual productivity of 500-650 kg/mu. Apples, grapes, etc. are also produced in the area.
The land on the hills and in the valleys is rather sterile with undeveloped irrigation and
poor yield. The annual yield of wheat or corn is approximately 140 kg/mu in Tongchuan
and no more than 240 kg/mu in Huangling.



-146 -                     ANNEX5
14.   Ecological Setting: There are three categories of vegetation in the project areas,
namely Guanzhong Plain, southern part of the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau and the
hilly area in front of Qinling Mountains. After being farmed for thousands of years, the
natural vegetation in Guangzhong Plain is nearly wiped out and all the land that can be
cultivated has become farmland with wheat, corn or fruit trees. The rock-based mountain
area west to the National Highway No. 210 in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau is
sparsely populated and well covered with natural forests (coverage of approximately
87 percent). The loess ridges, hills and valleys are covered with secondary forests and
bushes. The major plants are oaks, poplars, Chinese pines, birches, cypresses. etc.
Except for about 26 km (KI08-K134) of Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway (THH),
the vegetation in the valleys and on the loess ridges along THH is rather poor with the
forest coverage of approximately 27 percent. The area in front of Qinling Mountains is
mainly farmland with wheat, corn and sweet potatoes and secondary forests. The main
vegetation includes cypresses, white skin pines, and Chinese pines. The secondary
forests are mainly with Chinese pines and Hua pines.
15.   Shaanxi is rich in wildlife. Qinling Mountains, in front of which Lantian-
Xiaoshangyuan Highway (LXH) goes through, is a natural wildlife protection area. The
wildlife in the area includes river deer, bears, pandas, leopards, wild goats, long-tail
chickens, etc., but they are mainly living in the West Qinling Mountains. There are also
many wild animals such as gold-skin leopards (Class II national preservation) and
reindeers in the Northern Mountains where THH goes through. In addition, there are
many wild hogs, roe deer, wolves, foxes and birds in the Province. However, these
animals are living in the deep mountains and not around the alignments of the proposed
highways. During the field investigations hardly any wild animals, rare or endangered
species, were observed along any proposed alignment.
16.   Cultural Relics: Guanzhong area is one of the places from where Chinese
culture originated. There are relics of Lantian men of millions of years ago, prehistoric
Banpo men and Emperor Xuanyuan, who is often called "the father of the nation". Xian
was called Chang'an in the ancient times. Since the Shang and Zhou dynasties, II
emperors made their courts in Xian, leaving the area with rich cultural relics and
historical sites. According to the information provided by the Shaanxi Archaeology
Research Institute in 1994, some short lengths of the proposed highways will go close to
the national and provincial cultural sites, but only a few pass through remains that need
preservation measures.
17.   Air Quality: The measured ambient air quality data indicate that the air quality
along the proposed highways is generally good. Carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations
are below the ambient air quality standard except along some sections of THH and
Lintong-Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Highway (LTH). NOx concentrations are also
below the standard except for some sections of Weinan-Tongguan Expressway (WTE).
Total suspended particulates (TSP) concentrations exceed the standard in WTE, THH and
LTH, mainly due to the resuspension of road dust. TSP concentrations also exceed the



-147 -                     ANNEX5
standard slightly in some sections in Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple Highway
(JFH) and Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Highway (JTH).
18.   Noise: Present acoustic environmental quality is generally good along most of the
proposed highways. In some sections of WTE, the noise level in the daytime reaches the
noise standard, and a noise level of 60.8 dB(A) was measured at night in Saying, which
exceeds the standard [55 dB(A)]. The noise level exceeds the Class II standards in
daytime and at night at the school in Majiashan of THH.
19.   Water Quality: Measured surface water quality data generally meet the water
quality standards.
D. POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND THEIR MITIGATION MEASURES
20.   Major potential impacts and their mitigation measures regarding Weinan-
Tongguan.-Expressway, Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Highway, Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan
Class II Auto-only Highway and Three Highway Connections (Lintong-Terra Cotta
Warriors Museum, Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple, and Jiangzhuang-Tangyu) are
summarized below and incorporated in the Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) of the
proposed highways. The EAPs stipulate how the environmental impacts identified in the
EIA will be dealt with in the design, construction and operation phases, and what
institutional arrangements have been made for the implementation of the EAPs during the
three distinct phases. The key elements of the EAPs are summarized as Appendix 2 of
this Annex.
Design Phase
21.   The project was developed in accordance with the "Three Synchronization" rule
in China, which requires that development projects should incorporate environmental
protection measures in planning/design, construction and operation phases.
22.   Alternative Alignments: Alignments of proposed highways were selected from
among several alternatives in order to minimize land acquisition, social and economic
disturbance, adverse environmental impacts including air pollution, noise at sensitive
areas, water quality degradation and ecological disruption, and to avoid cultural relics
sites and unfavorable geological conditions.
23.   Social Disruption: In order to minimize problems of community separation and
isolation due to the project construction a large number of underpasses and overpasses
were incorporated into the project design. For example, 178 crossings (2.8 crossings per
km), 8 large, 10 medium and 6 short bridges, and 6 interchanges were included in the
design of WTE to minimize social disruption.
24.   Soil Erosion: A total of 16,588 m of slope protection, 7,030 m of retaining walls
and 164 culverts were included in the engineering design of WTE in order to facilitate
natural drainage and avoid soil erosion and slope failures. In addition, temporary and



- 148-                      ANNEX5
permanent drainage systems were designed to minimize soil erosion and alteration of
hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation. Similar measures were also
incorporated in the engineering design of other proposed highways.
25.   Noise and Air Pollution: Noise and air pollution mitigation measures were
identified and integrated into the design and bid documents. These include construction
of noise barriers, installation of surrounding walls, double-glass windows, etc. Some
buildings will be relocated due to the significant noise impacts.
26.   Water Pollution: Adequate permanent and temporary drainage systems were
incorporated in the project design to minimize surface water pollution and disturbance to
irrigation channels and existing drainage systems. Septic tanks were designed for service
area facilities in order to prevent direct discharge of waste water to public water bodies.
Underground storage tanks for gasoline and other hazardous materials will be installed to
prevent groundwater contamination.
27.   Cultural Relics:  A special cultural relics survey was carried out during
November/December 1994 by Shaanxi Provincial Archaeology Research Institute
(SPARI), following the relevant rules and regulations in China to identify cultural relics
to be affected by the project. Altogether 28 cultural sites along the proposed highways
were identified to be protected. One is under national protection, three are under
provincial protection and nine are under county protection.  The other 15 are not
classified under any special protection.  They include Yaozhou Kilns (national
importance) and Wangjiahe Remains (provincial importance) in Tongchuan along the
Tongchuan-Huangling Highway, and Hengzhen Remains and Tongguan Ancient City
(provincial importance) along the Weinan-Tongguan Expressway. Under the guidance of
the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeological Bureau (SPAB), a special action plan for the
preservation of cultural relics was developed to carry out detailed field reconnaissance,
excavation and preservation of identified cultural relics and remains under the proposed
project.
28.   Flooding: Bridges, culverts and roadside drainage systems were adequately
designed to meet requirements for safe discharge of flood (300 years for large bridges and
100 years for the others).
Construction Phase
29.   Fugitive Dust and Other Air Pollution: Quarries, material borrow sites, waste
disposal sites and transportation routes to construction sites were identified as the major
areas that create dust and other air pollution. Road surfaces, excavation areas and
construction sites will be sprayed with water and kept moist particularly near towns,
water sources and other sensitive locations. Access roads will be upgraded, widened and
paved where necessary, and sprayed regularly to minimize fugitive dust. Stockpiles and
storage areas will be either covered or sprayed. Construction materials will be covered
during hauling to prevent undue dust or debris on roads. Asphalt and concrete mixing



-149-                       ANNEX5
equipment will have dust collectors and will be located at least 500 m downwind of
residential areas. Construction machines will be equipped with exhaust gas control units.
30.   Noise:  Since operations of machinery associated with excavation and road
construction may cause hearing damage in the event of prolonged exposure, hearing
protection will be provided for construction workers. Construction machinery and trucks
will be equipped with proper noise control devices and will be properly operated and
maintained. Construction activities will be prohibited between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 am
near residential areas. Transportation of construction materials will be undertaken with
careful consideration to minimizing noise impacts on residents along the roadside.
Traffic management, including dissemination of traffic rules and setting up of speed
limits will be strengthened.
31.   Soil Erosion: Erosion control will be undertaken by minimizing the removal of
vegetation and by installing silt traps and other prevention measures. Excavation sites
will be reclaimed, stabilized and re-vegetated following the completion of construction
activities. Silt screens will be placed at excavation sites as appropriate. Where arable
land is selected as a material borrow site, fertile top soil will be removed, stockpiled and,
after completion of excavation, restored, and the land will be reverted to its original
condition. Temporary ponds will be placed where appropriate within construction sites to
capture eroded soil.
32.   Water Pollution: Measures will be taken to prevent direct discharge of polluted
water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation channels. Septic tanks will be
installed at construction camp sites to prevent direct discharge of sanitary sewage to
public water bodies. Sewage sludge and domestic waste from construction sites and
camp sites will be collected to be used as fertilizer or properly disposed of. Drinking
water at construction sites will meet China's national drinking water standards. Disposal
sites will be approved and secured to avoid environmental contamination. Construction
of bridge piers and material excavation from watercourses will be avoided during the
rainy seasons. Drainage interception facilities will be installed at bridges to prevent
polluted runoff from entering watercourses.
33.   Cultural Relics: Construction works will be stopped in case new cultural relics
are discovered as a result of road construction or excavation activities. The Shaanxi
Provincial Archaeological Bureau (SPAB) and the Shaanxi Provincial Archaeology
Research Institute (SPARI) will be informed immediately and a field survey of the site
will be undertaken. Necessary mitigation measures will be identified and implemented
under the supervision of SPAB and a detailed action plan will be developed as
appropriate before the construction work resumes.
34.   Traffic Management: Local resources will be used to the extent possible to
avoid long-distance transportation of construction materials. Adequate traffic control
measures will be implemented in consultation with the Transportation and Public
Security Departments when roads are congested during the construction period. The



-150 -                     ANNEX 5
contractors would be required to provide adequate diversions and signs where the
construction crosses existing roads. Where sections of existing roads are used for
transportation of construction materials, temporary service roads will be constructed as
appropriate to alleviate congestion of existing roads.  A  construction material
transportation plan will be developed to avoid hauling activities during peak hours
especially on existing roads.
Operation Phase
35.   Noise and Air Pollution: Two of the most significant problems during the
operation period will be noise and air pollution from exhaust gas. According to the EIAs,
noise levels at environmentally sensitive sites along Weinan-Tongguan Expressway
(WTE), Tongchuan-Huangling Class 1 Auto-only Highway (THH) and Xian-Sanyuan
Class I Highway (XSH) will significantly exceed the noise standards set as the
assessment criteria. Similarly, NO, concentrations will exceed the ambient air quality
standards (Class II standards) at several sensitive sites. In order to supplement the EIA
results and identify necessary mitigation measures, special studies were carried out on
traffic noise protection measures for WTE, THH and XSH. Based on the above studies,
the following measures were identified and integrated in the EAPs to be implemented in a
phased manner.
36.   For WTE, Taoxia Hospital and Xiaoquen Primary School will be totally relocated
by 1999. Approximately 660 m of noise barriers will be installed by 1999. Classrooms
near the proposed expressway will be used as warehouses and the same area of
classrooms will be built on the other side of the schools (Fengliang and Fushui Primary
Schools) by 1999. Also, approximately 1,920 m of surrounding brick walls will be
constructed or made higher by 1999 around the noise-sensitive buildings such as schools
and hospitals. Approximately 1,140 m of additional walls will be constructed or made
higher in 2005, depending on the monitoring results. Further noise protection measures
such as construction of walls and installation of double-glass windows will be undertaken
at 21 noise-sensitive sites in 2013, depending on the monitoring results.
37.   For THH, approximately 260 m of walls will be constructed or made higher by
2000 around the noise-sensitive buildings.  Approximately 900 m2 of glass-walled
corridors (called front corridors) will be built by 2000 to enclose Mineral Hospital and
Yichi Middle School buildings along the proposed highway. Depending on the
monitoring results, 130m of walls will be constructed in 2?05, and double-glass
windows at two sensitive sites and 360 m2 of front corridors at one site will be installed
in 2015.
38.   For XSH, approximately 400 m of noise barriers will be installed at Liulincum
and about 250 m of surrounding brick walls will be made higher at Jinxing School by
2000. An additional 450 m (at four sensitive sites) and 1,280 m (at seven sensitive sites)
of surrounding brick walls will be constructed or heightened in 2010 and 2020
respectively, depending on the monitoring results.



-151-                      ANNEX5
39.   Vehicles which do not meet noise and exhaust emission standards will be barred
from using provincial roads including the proposed highways. A tailpipe gas inspection
station will be established at Huaxian Interchange of WTE to enforce emission laws.
Public awareness campaigns and education will be undertaken to familiarize people with
air and noise pollution regulations. In order to avoid future noise and air pollution
problems, development of residential areas will be prohibited within approximately 20 m
from the edge of the proposed highways and construction of sensitive buildings such as
schools and hospitals will be prohibited within 50 m.  In order to avoid lead
contamination in crops from vehicle emissions, Chinese cabbage and other types of
vegetables will be replaced by nonedible crops within 40 m of WTE alignment after
1998.
40.   Risk of Hazardous Material Spills: The Public Security Department (PSD) and
the Transportation Department (TD) will be informed prior to transportation of hazardous
materials on the roadway, especially with regard to the nature of the hazardous materials,
the time, routes and parking places of vehicles transporting such materials.
Transportation of hazardous materials will be restricted based on the guidance of PSD.
Pertinent danger sign will be posted on the vehicles indicating the nature of hazardous
materials.  Emergency-response facilities will be installed to respond to accidents
involving spill of hazardous materials and a contingency plan will be developed to deal
with such accidents.
E. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
41.   During the construction and operation of the proposed highways, environmental
monitoring will be carried out to verify the actual impacts on the environment, identify
unexpected environmental problems at an early stage, and adjust environmental
protection measures as appropriate. The Environmental Monitoring Group in the Central
Supervision Laboratory will be mainly responsible for environmental monitoring during
construction. Noise, vibration and fugitive dust will be monitored by the environmental
supervisor at each construction contract section.  During the operation phase, the
environmental monitoring activities of all the proposed highways will be carried out by
the Environmental Monitoring Office to be established under the Shaanxi Provincial
Transportation Department (SPTD). An annual monitoring report would be furnished to
the Bank during the construction phase and for each of the first three years following
completion of construction.
42.   The major items to be monitored during the construction phase are air quality,
noise, and water quality. Lead in soil and crops and vehicle exhaust inspection will be
monitored in addition to the above items during the operation phase. The detailed
monitoring plan is presented below.
43.   Air Quality: Items to be monitored will include fugitive dust (by environmental
supervisors) and TSP during the construction phase and nitrogen oxides (NOJ), CO and
TSP during the operation phase. During construction, TSP will be monitored four times a



-152-                      ANNEX5
year for consecutive three days each time. Fugitive dust will be monitored in the first,
fourth, seventh and tenth days when construction work starts, and thereafter every 10
days. Monitoring sites will be construction sites, quarries and material borrow sites, and
major roads used for transportation of construction materials. Fugitive dust will be
monitored at least six places around construction sites. During the operation phase, NOR,
CO and TSP will be monitored twice a year, each time for five consecutive days and four
times per day. Monitoring sites have been identified in the EAPs.
44.   Noise and Vibration: During the construction phase, monitoring will be carried
out by Jn environmental supervisor in each contract section 2-3 times a day on a weekly
basis at construction sites and major roads used for transportation of construction
materials. Ad-hoc monitoring will also be undertaken. During the operation phase,
monitoring will be carried out four times per year, in daytime and at night at the sites
identified in the EAPs. Ad-hoc monitoring will also be undertaken.
45.   Water Quality:  During the construction phase, biological oxygen demands
(BOD) and/or chemical oxygen demands (COD), suspended solids (SS), oil, dissolved
oxygen (DO), temperature and pH will be monitored one month before the construction
works start and three times per year for two consecutive days at major public water
bodies, particularly rivers where bridges are being constructed. During the operation
phase, the same parameters will be monitored twice per year in consecutive two days at
the sites identified in the EAPs.
46.   Other Items: Pollutants in vehicle exhaust gases (CO and hydrocarbons in
gasoline vehicles, and particulates in diesel-powered vehicles) will be randomly inspected
at Huaxian Interchange at WTE. Lead content in soil and crops will be monitored once a
year during the operation phase at five locations along WTE.
F. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF RIPA COMPONENT
47.   The Rural Roads Improvement Program to Help Alleviate  Poverty (RIPA)
includes 157 road segments under 31 systems (a set of road segment) in 25 poverty
counties of Shaanxi Province. Since the road segments under RIPA are large in number,
and most of the RIPA projects are upgrading of the existing roads and small in the size of
construction works, it was agreed that the Sectoral Environmental Assessment (EA)
approach would be applied to the RIPA projects.
48.   The Sectoral EA approach is summarized as follows:
(a)   Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE). All the RIPA projects will be
classified into two categories, Category I and Category 1I. For the RIPA
projects under the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project, however,
IEE for all RIPA projects was not carried out because necessary
information for classification was not available at the initial stage.
Therefore, classification needs to be done during the preparation of each
batch of projects, based on the above criteria.



-153 -                      ANNEX 5
(i)    Category I projects are those that are not expected to have
significant environmental impacts.  This category of projects
include upgrading of existing roads without substantial widening
and land acquisition.
(ii)    Category lI projects are those that may have potentially significant
environmental impacts. This category of projects include new road
construction, upgrading of existing roads with substantial widening
and land acquisition, and other road upgrading projects passing
through environmentally special areas such as national parks,
nature reserves, and important cultural heritage.
(b)   Preparation/review of EIA and EAP Reports: For Category I projects,
only Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) are required to determine
various environmental protection measures to be implemented under the
projects, based on the principles of environmental protection measures.
For Category II projects, both EIAs and EAPs are required. All EIA
reports and EAPs will be submitted to the World Bank and reviewed by
the World Bank together with the application of a batch (package) of
projects.
49.   Regarding the RIPA projects under the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway
Project, only two road segments (No. 375 and 379 under No. 46 system) will be newly
constructed, while the remaining 155 road segments will be upgraded mainly from
unclassified roads to Class IV roads. The major upgrading works include:
(a)   improvement/construction of culverts;
(b)   widening of roads in a small number of road segments; and
(c)   upgrading of road conditions to all-weather earth roads.
50.   The RIPA projects will be carried out in four batches. Eight road segments in five
systems were adopted for the first batch of RIPA projects to be implemented in the first
year. Based on the above criteria, two road segments (No. 375 and 379 under No. 46
system) were classified to be Category II and the remaining six were classified as
Category I.
51.   Major Environmental Protection Measures for the RIPA Projects. Major
environmental protection measures to be commonly implemented for most RIPA projects
are summarized below and listed in Appendix 2.
Environmental protection measures during the design stage
(a)   Soil Erosion: Additional retaining walls will be constructed to protect
farmland, cultivated fields and forests.  Temporary and permanent



-154-                       ANNEX 5
drainage systems will be constructed to minimize soil erosion and
alteration of hydrological regimes, including impacts on irrigation
channels. Trees and grass will be planted to minimize soil erosion, air
pollution and enhance good landscape along the proposed road.
(b)   Water Protection: Additional temporary and permanent water pipes,
water channels and sluice will be constructed to guarantee safe drinking
water.
(c)   Selection of Borrow Sites and Disposal Sites: Appropriate borrow sites
and waste disposal sites will be identified to minimize impacts on
farmland, forests and other land use.
Environmental protection measures during the construction stage
(a)   Dust/Air Pollution: All reasonable steps, including watering, will be
taken to minimize dust pollution by construction works, particularly in
places near towns, water sources, etc. Stockpiles and storage areas will be
covered or watered to prevent dust pollution.  Trucks to transport
construction materials will be covered to minimize spills. Tar heating
sites will be located far away from residential areas on the lee side of the
wind direction.
(b)   Soil Erosion/Water Pollution: Temporary channel or conduit will be
constructed for irrigation and drainage, during the construction of a
permanent drainage system. Spoil will not be stored on riverbeds,
farmland, forests and cultivated fields to protect water sources and natural
ecology, and prevent interruption of rivers and flooding. Rivers and water
sources will be cleaned up as appropriate if they are interrupted by soil and
spoil. All reasonable measurers will be taken to prevent direct discharge
of polluted water from construction activities into rivers and irrigation
channels.
(c)   Construction Camps: Adequate measures will be taken to prevent water
pollution by wastewater from construction camp sites. Drinking water
will meet China's national drinking water standards. Garbage will be
collected in garbage cans in fixed places and disposed of regularly.
(d)   Noise: Where residences are located near the construction sites, noisy
construction works will be undertaken during the daytime. Maintenance
of machines and trucks will be strengthened to keep them with low noise.
(e)   Conservation of Land Resources: Forests will not be used for material
borrow sites. Arable land will not be selected as material borrow sites as
much as possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, appropriate
rehabilitation works will be undertaken to minimize impacts on ecosystem



-155 -                     ANNEX 5
and agriculture. Education of construction workers will be strengthened to
protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching will be
strictly prohibited.
(f)   Risk of Accidents: Management regulations will be established to ensure
safe construction activities.
(g)   Cultural Relics: If fossils, coins, artifacts of value or antiquity, structures
and other remains of geological or archeological interest are found, the
local cultural authority will be immediately informed of such discovery,
and excavation shall be stopped until identification of cultural relics by the
authorized institution of preservation is completed.
(h)   Traffic Management: Adequate traffic management will be undertaken
to avoid traffic congestion during the construction period. Appropriate
transportation plan for construction materials will be developed to use
adequate routes and avoid transport activities during heavy traffic hours.
Environmental protection measures during the operation stage
(a)   Transportation Management: The Public Security and Transportation
Departments will enforce necessary management measures for safe
transportation, including safe transportation of hazardous materials.
52.   Environmental Monitoring for the RIPA  Projects.  The enviromnental
monitoring will be carried out by local environmental monitoring centers through
contracts with the county construction bureaus, and the results will be reported to the
prefectural construction and environmental bureaus for review. -For the Category I
projects, dust and noise will be monitored during the construction phase and TSP and
noise during the operation phase. Water quality monitoring both in the construction and
operation phases will also be undertaken for Category II projects.

Design Phase
1. Route Selection     The alignments were selected from several altematives to    SPTD/SPHSDI
minimize land acquisition, impacts of air pollution and noise
on residential areas, and to avoid unfavorable geological
conditions and cultural relics.
2. Social Disruption   Adequate number of large, medium and small bridges and      SPHSDI
underpasses/overpasses were designed to meet the requirements
for crossing of local people, animals and vehicles.
3. Soil Erosion        Planting of trees and grasses on median dividers, side slopes,  SPHSDI
and along the roadside, was included in designs where
appropriate. Slope protection, retaining walls, protection walls
were incorporated in the design.
Temporary and permanent drainage systems were designed to   SPHSDI
minimize soil erosion and alteration of hydrological regimes,
including impacts on irrigation channels.
4. Dust/Air Pollution    In addition to I above, quarries, material borrow sites and waste   SPHSDI
disposal sites were selected, taking into account the dust and
other problems at environmentally sensitive locations such as
residential areas.
5. Water Pollution     Wastewater treatmnent facilities were designed for service areas    SPHSDI
(WTE, THH and LXH).
Drainage facilities were designed to prevent surface runoff from    SPTD/SPHSDI
the road to farmland.
6. Noise               In addition to I above, adequate measures such as noise     SPHSDI
barriers, brick walls and double-glass windows were identified
and integrated in the design and bid documents (WTE, THH
and XSH).
7. Flooding            Bridges and culverts were adequately sized to meet          SPHSDI
requirements for safe discharge of design flood (300 years for
large-scale bridges, 100 years for other bridges).
8. Cultural Relics     Cultural relics survey was carried out and a cultural relics  SPARIISPHSDI
preservation plan was developed.

from silting up rivers, water channels, or the existing irrigation
and drainage systems.
All reasonable measurers shall be taken to prevent direct
discharge of polluted water from construction activities into
rivers and irrigation channels.
3. Construction Camps   Adequate measures, such as provision of septic tanks or sewage   Contractors
treatment facilities, will be taken at the construction camp sites.
Sludge in sewage treatment pits will be disposed of regularly.
Drinking water will meet the China national drinking water
standards.
Garbage will be collected in garbage cans at fixed locations and
disposed of regularly.
4. Noise               Where residences are located within 500 m from the          Contractors
construction sites, noisy construction works will be undertaken
during the daytime (6:00am-10:OOpm).
Maintenance of machines and trucks will be improved to
minimize noise.

5. Protection of Land    Forests will not be used for material borrow sites (THH and  Contractors
Resources              LXH).
Arable land will be avoided as material borrow sites wherever
possible. If excavation has to be done in arable land, top soil
layer will be saved and retumed after construction work is
completed, so as to minimize impacts on ecosystem and
agriculture.
Education of construction workers will be strengthened to
protect natural resources, wild plants and animals. Poaching
will be strictly prohibited.
Construction trucks will be driven on the temporary roads to
avoid damage to the farmland.
6. Construction Safety   In order to guarantee construction safety, efficient lighting  Contractors
equipment and safety signs will be installed on temporary roads
during the construction, and adequate traffic regulations will be
adopted and implemented for temporary roads.
7. Cultural Relics    Excavation will be stopped immediately if any cultural relics  Contractors/
are found, and the local cultural authority will be informed of  SPAB/SPARIV
such discovery. Excavation will not be resumed until      Eng. Supervisors
identification of cultural relics by the authorized institution of
preservation is completed and necessary measures identified.
B. Traffic and         Local construction materials will be used as much as possible to   Contractors
Transportation         avoid long distance transportation, especially of earth and stone.
Adequate actions to direct traffic will be taken in consultation
with Transportation and Public Security Departments, to
prevent or minimize traffic jams during the construction period.
Where sections of existing roads are used for transportation of
construction materials, subsidiary roads will be constructed as
appropriate, so that the existing roads are not significantly
congested.
Plan for transportation of construction materials will be
developed to avoid transport activities during hours of peak
traffic.
Operation Phase
I. Noise and Air      Noise barriers or other appropriate noise protection measures  SPTD
Pollution             will be installed at locations where noise exceeds standard,
based on the results of monitoring.
Forest belts will be constructed mainly to prevent air pollution    SPTD
problems.
2. Vehicle             Vehicle noise and emissions inspection will be strengthened. If   SPTD
Management             vehicle noise and/or emissions exceed standards, the vehicle
will not pass inspection on roads till the problem is rectified.
There will be a random exhaust gas emissions inspection station
at Huaxian Interchange of WTE.
Public awareness and education will be promoted to familiarize   SPEPB/SPTD
people with the problems of air pollution and noise from
vehicles and with related regulations.

Materials Spill       and SPTD) will be informed before transport of hazardous
materials is carried out, especially with regard to time, routes
and parking places of vehicles to carry these materials. The
vehicles and drivers will be inspected. Proper danger sign will
be painted on the vehicles. Transport of hazardous material will
not be allowed during the traffic peak time (mainly WTE<
THH< XSH and LXH).
Hazardous materials will not be transported together with  SPPSD/SPTD
passengers, other goods or materials (mainly WTE, THH, XSH
and LXH).
Emergency response facilities will be installed to respond to
accidents including spill of hazardous materials and a
contingency plan will be developed to deal with such accidents
(mainly WTE, THH and XSH).

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
1.    Context. This annex summarizes the land acquisition and resettlement aspects
associated with the Second Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project. It is based on the
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial High-Grade
Highway Administration Bureau in May 1995 for the six high-grade highways (including
the linking roads) to be constructed under the project and the RAPs for the roads under
the RIPA component prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Highways Administration
Bureau.
2.    Legal Basis of Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Land ownership in China
rests with the government and the collectives. Collective land is cultivated by- farmers
and is managed by village councils. Cultivation rights are given to the people for varying
durations (for 3 to 15 years). Acquisition of land for development projects is governed by
national laws, provincial implementation regulations and project specific regulations
issued by provincial, municipal or county governments. Since 1982, authorities in China
have substantially revised their regulations on resettlement for different types of projects.
A specific model has been developed for resettlement arising from projects in transport
and industry. At the core of this model of resettlement are the following objectives: to
avoid or minimize resettlement; to restore or improve the standards of living of the
adversely affected people; to consult affected localities during the project design stage; to
compensate villages for land acquired from them and to compensate individuals for
houses, standing crops, or other individually held assets; to provide land to adversely
affected persons through redistribution of land in villages or to provide jobs in enterprises
to members of villages where land per capita holdings fall below specified minimum
amounts; to restore disrupted infrastructure or compensate its owner(s); and to entrust
implementation of land acquisition and resettlement to local governments.  These
principles substantially meet the requirements of Bank policy on involuntary
resettlement. Based on national principles for transport projects, the Shaanxi provincial
government will issue Land Acquisition, compensation and resettlement guidelines for
high-grade highways and RIPA component roads.
Project Components and Their Location
3.    The project involves construction of the following high-grade highways:
(a)   Weinan-Tongguan Expressway                       78.1 km
(b)   Tongchuan-Huangling Class I Auto-Only Highway    73.6 km
and Yaoxian-Tongchuan Class II Auto-Only Highway    18.4 km
(c)   Lantian-Xiaoshangyuan Class II Auto-Only Highway  48.3 km



- 173-                     ANNEX6
(d)   Jiangzhuang-Famen Buddhist Temple Class II
Auto-Only Highway                                18.9 km
(e)   Jiangzhuang-Tangyu Class II Auto-Only Highway    15.9 km
(f)   Jinjian-Qin Terra Cotta Warriors Museum Class II
Auto-Only Highway                                5.9 km
In addition to the above high-grade highways, the project also involves improvement of
the 32 km Xian-Sanyuan Highway and construction of roads under the Roads for
Improvement of Poverty Areas (RIPA) component. These roads are located in 25 of the
poorest counties in the northern and southern parts of Shaanxi province.
Survey of Land Acquisition Impacts
4.    High-Grade Highways. The construction of the high-grade highways and roads
under RIPA will require acquisition of land and resettlement of affected persons. A
detailed census survey of affected persons and properties was carried out in November-
December 1994 by the Shaanxi Highway Design and Survey Institute, in collaboration
with local governments and the affected persons in the project affected areas. The results
of these detailed surveys were summarized in detailed impact tables and field maps
showing the affected houses, farmlands and enterprises. Table 1 shows the summary of
land acquisition and resettlement impacts for the high-grade highways. The six high-
grade highways proposed to be constructed pass through 11 cities/counties and 45
townships. A total of 14,213 mu of land (15 mu = 1 hectare) will need to be acquired
permanently, affecting 13,097 persons while 3,734 mu will be required temporarily
during the construction period. Most of the affected persons will be rehabilitated through
redistribution of land in their existing villages. The residence registration of 1,042
persons, who cannot be provided agricultural land through land redistribution, will be
changed from rural to urban and 580 of these persons will be provided nonagricultural
jobs in enterprises. Some 548 residential houses (2,477 persons) and 34 enterprises
employing 2,156 workers will be affected. Out of these 467 houses (2,154 persons) and
23 enterprises will need to be relocated. The total number of persons affected by the
project is therefore 17,730. The total cost of the land acquisition and resettlement
program is estimated at Y 374 million (about $45 million).
5.    RIPA Component. The first year's program of the RIPA component (consisting
of five highway systems) will affect 1,291 persons due to land acquisition and 355
persons due to house relocation. About 1,248 mu (83.2 ha) of farmland and 63 houses
(5,007 m2) will be affected due to construction of roads under the RIPA component. All
the persons affected by land acquisition and/or resettlement will be rehabilitated through
land redistribution. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement for the first-year
programs under RIPA is Y 3.4 million (about $400,000).

6.    Socioeconomic Survey. The Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences has been
contracted by SPTD to carry out socioeconomic surveys of the affected persons before
the initiation of implementation of the RAP.
Principles of Resettlement
7.    The main objective of the resettlement program under the project is to ensure that
all categories of affected persons are able to at least restore, if not improve, their standard
of living after resettlement. Both national and provincial governments have adopted
principles to guide the process of resettlement in such a way that the above central
objective is achieved. These principles aim to: (a) minimize acquisition of productive
farmland and residential areas in order to reduce adverse project impacts; (b) relocate
houses and enterprises as close as possible to their initial location; (c) replace or improve
the standard and area of housing; (d) consult the affected persons regarding resettlement
options, choice of resettlement sites and the adequacy of compensation rates; (e) pay
compensation (including those without residence registration certificates) to all affected
assets at their replacement value; (f) replace farmland through land redistribution in the
same village; (g) in cases where land redistribution is not possible, to provide jobs in
enterprises and change their residence registration from rural to urban, and (h) complete
resettlement of the affected persons before construction work on the project is initiated.
Legal Framework and Policy Provisions
8.    SPTD has prepared the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) based on the following
regulations governing land acquisition and resettlement issues in Shaanxi province:
(a)   The Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China for land
acquisition and resettlement (June 1986),
(b)   Implementation regulations for Land Administration of People' Republic
of China (January 1991),



- 175-                      ANNEX6
(c)   Implementation procedures for Land Administration of Shaanxi province
(September 1987),
(d)   Regulations for Management of Urban Houses Removing in Shaanxi
province (March 1993).
In addition to the above regulations, Shaanxi Provincial Government and SPTD have
formulated certain provisions for resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons
which are described in the RAP dated May 1995 for the high-grade highways included
under the project.
Compensation and Resettlement Policies
9.    Farmland Acquisition. A majority of the persons affected by land acquisition
will be provided farm land in the same village through land redistribution. However, if
the per capita farmland holding after land acquisition falls below 0.1 mu for any affected
village and the village cannot be merged with some other village in the vicinity, the labor
declared surplus will be rehabilitated by providing nonagricultural jobs in enterprises.
Their residence registration will be changed from rural to urban, with the approval of the
Shaanxi Provincial Government. Compensation to the collective for the farmland
acquired will be paid at six times the average of annual output value of crops for the past
three years. Standing crops will be compensated at their market value.
10.   Land Leasing. Land will be required temporarily for construction of access
roads (to construction sites), material storage yards, working plants, workers' residences,
etc. Compensation will be negotiated with the local governments and will include the
following: (a) compensation for crops; (b) compensation for leased land equivalent to the
value of production of the land during the leased period; (c) cost of restoration of land to
its original condition after the project is completed. The compensation rates calculated by
aggregating the above costs are described in the RAP. No buildings will need to be
relocated due to temporary land leasing and no land redistribution of affected persons is
necessary.
11.   Affected Houses. Compensation for affected houses and buildings, owned by
enterprises or individuals, will be paid at replacement rates, negotiated with each city/
county and in consultation with the affected persons. The affected houses will be
demolished only after the affected persons have moved into their new houses. Land for
new houses and buildings will be provided by the village and the cost of the land will be
paid by the project. Specific compensation rates that represent replacement levels of
compensation are given in the RAP.
12.   Affected Enterprises. The affected enterprises will be relocated close to their
original location on land provided by the village but paid for by the project. Affected
assets will be compensated for at replacement rates and no depreciation will be deducted
while calculating the compensation payable. Workers will be employed in the same
reconstructed enterprises and they will be paid a work stoppage allowance equivalent to



-176 -                     ANNEX6
their basic wage for the duration of stoppage of work. The affected enterprises will also
be provided a production stoppage allowance for an agreed period, based on the average
net profit in the six months preceding land acquisition.
13.  Infrastructure and Other Affected Assets. Compensation for infrastructure and
other affected assets will be paid at replacement cost to the affected individuals,
collectives or governments, depending on the ownership of these assets. The rates of
compensation for affected infrastructure and other assets are provided in the RAP.
14.   Nonagriculture-based Rehabilitation.  A total of 1,042 persons along the
Tongchuan-Huangling Class I highway cannot be rehabilitated through land
redistribution. The residence registration of these persons will be changed from rural to
urban.  Persons between 18 and 55 years of age will be given employment in
nonagricultural enterprises; those above 55 years of age will receive old-age pension and
those below 18 years of age will receive "living subsidies."
15.   Job Creation. For providing jobs to eligible affected persons, two existing
enterprises (a chemical plant and a cement packing factory) will be expanded, and a new
Building Materials Plant will be started. About Y 30,000 per new job will be provided to
the enterprises providing jobs to eligible affected persons. In addition to this, Y 3,000 per
worker will be provided to the enterprises as "training allowances." The labor employed
by these enterprises will get a minimum wage of Y 200-300 per month and they will be
employed as permanent employees. A job transition allowance will be provided to
eligible persons at the rate of Y 150 per month for three months from the time of land
acquisition/work stoppage. After this period, this allowance will be increased to the
minimum wage level in the enterprise-affected area. The exact number of affected
persons to be employed in each of these enterprises and a time schedule for providing
employment have been included in the RAP.
16.   Self-Employment. The affected persons who do not wish to accept the jobs
offered to them can opt for self-employment. There are about 80 such persons in the
project. They will be paid about Y 25,000 each as resettlement subsidy.
17.   Pension and Living Subsidy. Old-age pension, to be provided to those among
the affected persons who are above the age of 60 will be Y 2,000 per year. Those below
18 years of age will be provided with a living subsidy of Y 1,000 per year.
18.   Preferential Policy. Those who have difficulties in restoring their original
standards of living can be provided an additional allowance of Y 500-1,000 per year.
19.   Payment of Compensation. Compensation for standing crops, houses and other
private structures will be paid directly to the affected persons. Compensation for affected
land, public infrastructure, and the resettlement subsidy will be paid to the county
government. The county government will be responsible for the rehabilitation of the
affected persons and for replacing the affected infrastructure. In case some enterprises
agree to provide jobs to the affected persons who are declared surplus labor, the



-177 -                     ANNEX 6
resettlement subsidy can be provided directly to these enterprises. Compensation for
affected enterprises will be paid directly to the enterprises. In case of private enterprises,
the compensation will be paid directly to the persons who own these enterprises.
20.   Moving and Transition Allowances. Each affected household will be paid the
following allowances: (a) a moving allowance at the rate of Y 50 per person; and
(b) transition allowance at the rate of Y 20 per person during the transition stage of house
construction.
Institutional Responsibility
21.   A "Project Headquarters" will be set up for facilitating implementation (including
RAP implementation) of the project. The Headquarters, set up in October 1995, consists
of the Deputy Provincial Governor, mayors of affected cities, a Director of SPTD, and
representatives of the provincial planning committee, the provincial construction
department, the provincial financial department, the land management department and the
electric power administration. Under the Project headquarters, Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Leading Groups (LARLGs) will be-set up for each of the highways. Each
leading group consists of deputy mayors of affected cities, deputy county magistrates
from each affected county, three representatives of the City land administration and
representatives from the City Traffic bureau, the city urban construction bureau. The
leading group is responsible primarily for coordination of the implementation of the land
acquisition and resettlement with the local governments, in accordance with the
provisions of the RAP. Since the actual implementation of the land acquisition and
resettlement program will be carried out primarily by the local county goverrnents, Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Offices (LAROs) have been set up in each affected county
consisting of 7 to 12 members including deputy county magistrate, director of land
administration, and representatives from other county-level offices. Similar groups will
also be organized at the township and village levels.
22.  In order to ensure regular monitoring of the land acquisition and resettlement
program, a "Land Acquisition and Resettlement Monitoring Office" (LARMO) set up
under the Headquarters will carry out internal monitoring of the implementation of the
RAP. The LARMO consists of a deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Land
Administration (SPLA), chief of Land acquisition office of SPLA, and representatives of
construction division and finance division of SPTD, and a representative of the
monitoring and audit division of the Shaanxi High-Grade Highway Administration
Bureau (SHGHAB). The implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement
program will be reviewed on a monthly basis until the completion of resettlement.
23.  In order to strengthen the LA&R division of SHGHAB, six more staff have been
added to the division. The new and existing staff will be provided training in land
acquisition and resettlement in March 1996. The new staff was appointed on October 5,
1995.



-178 -                     ANNEX6
24.   SPTD has engaged the Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences for extemnal
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement program. They will also conduct a
socioeconomic survey of affected persons before the start of land acquisition
implementation.
Implementation Schedule
25.   Except for the Tongchuan-Huangling Highway (THH), the implementation of the
RAPs was initiated on October 1, 1995 and will be completed by the end of September
1996, i.e., at least one month before the proposed start of construction. The detailed
implementation schedule for the land acquisition and resettlement program is given in
Table 2. The implementation of the RAP has been divided into the following three
phases: (a) the preparation phase (October 1995-February 1996); (b) the implementation
phase (January 1, 1995-September 30, 1996); and (c) the evaluation phase (October 1996-
December 2000). The implementation of the THH will start in August 1997 and will be
completed in May 1997. The implementation of the RAPs for the first year's package
under the RIPA component was initiated in October 1995 and will be completed by the
end of 1996.

Costs and Budgets
26.   The cost of the land acquisition and resettlement program is included in the
overall project budget. The annual requirement of funds will be included in the annual



-179 -                     ANNEX6
project investment plans. An itemwise cost table of all land acquisition and resettlement
activities is given in Table 3.  An allowance for physical contingency at the rate of
10 percent of the total LA&R budget has been provided for. Compensation amounts
payable to the affected persons will be adjusted every year by the annual inflation factor.
This factor will be determined based on: (a) price index of construction projects labor
cost and (b) price index of material cost of construction , both published by the Shaanxi
Provincial Statistical Bureau every year. Management cost at the rate of 3 percent of the
total LA&R cost will be paid to the county level (2.5 percent), township level
(0.4 percent) and village level (0.1 percent). Expenditures that exceed the budgeted
amounts (including physical and price contingencies) will be reported by the Planning
Division of SHGHAB, reviewed by the Construction Division and will be approved by
the Traffic and Energy Division of the Shaanxi Provincial Planning Committee.

Grievance Redressal and Appeals Process
27.  If any affected person is dissatisfied with any aspect of land acquisition and
resettlement, they can lodge a complaint with the respective county level LA&R office or
directly to the LA&R monitoring office under the LARLG. If the issue is not resolved
within three weeks, a written grievance can be submitted to the LARLG. The LARLG
should resolve the issue within four weeks. If the affected person is not satisfied by the



-180 -                       ANNEX6
decision of LARLG, he/she can lodge a written appeal to the county-level people's court.
In case the decision of the county-level court fails to satisfy the affected person, a second
appeal can be lodged in the court of the city/prefecture. The decision of this court will be
final and binding.
Information Dissemination, Participation and Consultations
28.   The affected people will be informed through newspaper, radio, television, etc.
about the project and the proposed land acquisition and resettlement program. The
LA&R institutions will also disseminate information through meetings, documents and
notices. The affected persons will be informed about the compensation standards, the
LA&R institutions at the various levels, the arrangements for provision of nonagricultural
jobs, the provisions for redressal of grievances and the proposed arrangements for internal
and external monitoring of the LA&R program. Each affected household will be given a
Resettlement Information Booklet (RIB) containing the above-mentioned information. It
will also list the individual resettlement entitlement of each affected person in the
household. The RIB will be distributed to the affected households two months after the
completion of loan negotiations for the project. Apart from being informed, the affected
persons and their representatives will also participate in:  (a) efforts to minimize
resettlement through choice of appropriate alignment alternatives; (b) survey of affected
persons and properties; (c) selection of new residential areas; (d) construction of new
houses; and (e) monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities.
Monitoring and Evaluation
29.   Two types of monitoring systems, one internal and the other independent and
external will be established concurrently.
30.   Internal Monitoring. The internal monitoring, to be carried out by the provincial
government, will monitor the implementation of the RAP and ensure compliance with the
administrative policies and regulations. It will ensure that (a) compensation is paid to
affected entities as per the established rules; (b) appropriate employment opportunities
are created for the affected persons; (c) the resettled persons are satisfied with the
compensation levels and the location of new sites; (d) all the employees of affected
enterprises have been reabsorbed in the same enterprises after relocation; (e) land
reallocation to affected persons is according to the provisions of the RAP; (f) adequate
rehabilitation arrangements have been made for persons without proper residence
registration certificates; (g) appropriate written records and accounts are maintained for
all resettlement expenses and cost overruns, if any; and (h) the information dissemination
and grievance redressal process is implemented efficiently. A minimum sample of
25 percent of the total affected population will be covered under internal monitoring.
Data regarding households covered under the monitoring process will be collected and
stored for subsequent comparisons. Internal monitoring will be carried out in two phases;
phase I will be initiated after compensation amounts have been distributed to the affected
persons so that the monitoring results can be used to initiate remedial actions; and



-181-                      ANNEX6
phase II will start after the resettlement activities have been completed. The internal
monitoring agency will have the authority to report noncompliance with RAP provisions
and other deficiencies in the implementation program. A summary of internal monitoring
reports will be submitted quarterly to the project head office and every six months to the
World Bank. The first internal monitoring report will be submitted by September 30,
1996.
31.   External Monitoring. The task of external monitoring of RAP implementation
by an independent agency has been entrusted by SPTD to the Shaanxi Academy of Social
Sciences (SASS).  Apart from  physical monitoring of the land acquisition and
resettlement program, which will also be carried out by the internal monitoring agencies,
SASS will concentrate on evaluation of the implementation of the RAP. SASS
monitoring staff will select random samples for detailed monitoring, hold discussions in
affected areas/resettlement sites, and collect secondary information from project agencies
and the internal monitoring agencies. External monitoring will start along with the
initiation of land acquisition and resettlement activities and will continue beyond project
completion (until 2000). The first external monitoring report will be submitted by
December 31, 1996. In order to facilitate comparisons in standards of living before and
after resettlement, a socioeconomic survey of the affected persons will be carried out
before initiation of RAP implementation.  Subsequent monitoring reports will be
prepared every six months and also submitted to the World Bank. A final monitoring and
evaluation report will also be prepared after project completion and submitted to the Bank
by December 31, 2000.

ANNEX 9: MONITORING PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT
1.    The following sections describe a number of monitoring indices that could be
used in conjunction with the various project components, to "measure" the extent to
which different implementation and impact objectives are being attained in the course of
project execution and operation. They refer specifically to indicators for use with
objectives related to:
(a)   Highway Revenue and Expenditure and Highway Maintenance
(b)   High-grade Highways, Parallel Roads and Traffic
(c)   Road Improvement for Poor Areas (RIPA)
(d)   Environment
(e)   Land Acquisition and Resettlement
(f)   Highway Safety
(g)   Institutional Strengthening and Training
2.    The indicators fall into two categories: those related to imnplementation targets
(pointing to progress in reaching intermediate and end-of-project objectives) and those
related to developmental impact objectives (pointing out both the, more immediate/short-
term conditions resulting from project investments as well as the longer-term outcomes of
these investments).
3.   It is hoped that the indicators selected will be such that the monitoring effort itself
would not constitute an undue strain on project management but will be used as an aid
and tool of effective project management.
A. REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND HIGHWAY MAINTENANCE
Highway Revenues And Expenditures
4.    The highway sector is going through a period of rapid expansion. The revenues to
finance this expansion presently come mostly from a Road Maintenance Charge, levied
on all vehicles as a fixed annual charge or as a percentage of the gross revenues for
commercial vehicles and buses. However, in the future, revenues from tolls are expected
to form an increasing proportion of total revenue. The largest single item of proposed



-194-                     ANNEX9
expenditure is new construction, which leaves some fear that insufficient funds might be
available to finance a level of maintenance that will improve the existing condition of the
road network. The proposed financing plan for the sector has been reviewed by the Bank
and found to be reasonable in terms of its revenue projections and its proposals for
highway maintenance expenditure. The outcome revenues and expenditures will be
monitored throughout the implementation period of the project, so that any deviations
from the planned amounts can be quickly identified and any necessary remedial measures
to ensure sufficient funding of maintenance can be taken.
Highway Maintenance
5.    During a period of increased expenditure on new road construction, there is a risk
that insufficient funds will be applied to maintenance of the existing highway network,
and that the condition of the network will therefore deteriorate rather than improve. The
monitoring indicators for Highway Maintenance will therefore monitor both expenditure
on maintenance and reconstruction and the surface condition of the roads of each Class.
The specific indices will be:
(a)   Annual expenditure  on  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  and
reconstruction, by class of road. The objective expenditures will be those
shown in the Table of Projected Revenues and Expenditures of the
Provincial Highway Sector;
(b)   Categorization of the condition of the road surface into Excellent, Good,
Average and Regular, using the subjective criteria currently used in by
SPHAB. In time these should be replace by measures of IRI. The
objective proportions in each condition category for each road Class in
each year will be those agreed with the Appraisal Mission

D. MONITORING INDICATORS FOR ENVIRONMENT
Construction Period
7.    Environmental Supervision: One of the environmental supervisors in each
contract section will be assigned or nominated to carry out the supervision of the
environmental protection measures addressed in the Environmental Action Plans (EAP)
and integrated in the bid documents. The results will be included in the engineering
supervision reports and reported periodically to the environmental protection staff at the
district level. The results of environmental supervision will be annually reported to the
World Bank through the annual report to the World Bank. The monitoring items will
include:
(a)   brief description on environmental protection measures supervised/
inspected during the reporting period; and
(b)   brief description of problems regarding environmental protection measures
and their reasons and possible solutions.
8.    Environmental Monitoring:   Environmental monitoring items, methods,
frequencies, monitoring sites have been clearly decided in the EAP (see appendix).
Environmental monitoring will be carried out by an environmental monitoring group in
the Central Supervision Laboratory except noise and dust, which will be conducted by
environmental supervisors at respective contract sections. The results will be reported to
the environmental protection staff at the district level. The results of environmental
monitoring will also be annually reported to the World Bank through the annual report to
the World Bank.

E. MONITORING OF LAND AcQUISmON AND RESETTLEMENT
12.   The monitoring and evaluation of the Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) agreed
between the Bank and the Borrower will be carried out both internally and externally
(Amc&&). Internal monitoring will be carried out by the Planning Departnent and the
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Department of SPHGHA. An internal monitoring
report will be submitted to the Bank every six months, with the first one due on
September30, 1996 and the last one on the completion of the land acquisition and
resettlement activities. The Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences will conduct the external
monitoring of resettlement and will submit a monitoring report every six months, with the
first one to be submitted by December 31, 1996 and the last one at the completion of the
project (December 31, 2000).
13.   The main indicators of land acquisition and resettlement monitoring have been
identified and are included in the RAPs. They are:
(a)   Timely payment of compensation to affected entities of various categories
according to the levels described in the RAP;
(b)   Progress of construction of new houses and quality of construction, also
distance from old houses
(c)   Progress in land redistribution;
(d)   The type of productive use to which compensation amounts have been put
by the local (township and village) governments;
(e)   Restoration of production/ business activities of affected enterprises.
Payment of all types of compensation (in accordance with RAP) to affected
enterprises and workers;
(f)   Propose linkage of resettlement activities with the project implementation
schedule (resettlement to be completed at least one month before start of
construction);
(g)   Restoration of civic infrastructure at the new sites;
(h)   Levels of satisfaction of the affected persons;



-199-                       ANNEX9
(i)   Income levels and standards of living after resettlement.
F. TRAFFic SAFETY MONITORING INDICATORS
The Accident Situation
14.   The general accident situation in the Province should be measured by the
following two indicators:
(a)   Number of killed per year per 10,000 vehicles
(b)   Number of killed per kilometer per year for each Class of road
For the new Expressway, the accident rates using the above indicators should be
compared with those expected for this Class of road.
Black Spots
15.   A certain number of black spots will be identified. Half of them will be treated, in
order to form an experiment group, while the remainder will form a control group. After
treatment, the accident rates expressed as fatalities or injury accidents in the two groups
will be monitored, in order to find the effect of the black spot treatment. Also, accident
data will be collected for each identified black spot for two to three years before and after
the improvement program begins and ends.
16.   The specific indicators for each black spot would include but not be limited to:
(a)   Have all the black spots been analyzed as required and the required
number been treated?
(b)   Have the black spots been physically improved?
(c)   The accident rate at the treated black spots and at the control sites.
(d)   The accident rate before and after the treatment at each site
Operational Indicators
17.   (a)   Has the Leading Group been established as planned, and is it continuing to
function effectively?
(b)   Is the Traffic Safety Unit/Secretariat established as planned?
(c)   Are the agreed studies initiated and executed as planned?
(d)   Are the safety audit procedures developed and used as planned?
