DAQING OILFIELD-GAOTAIZI RESERVOIR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2231-CHA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Daqing
Oilfield-Gaotaizi Reservoir Project in China, for which Loan 2231-CHA in the
amount of US$162.4 million was approved on January 25, 1983. The loan was
closed, after four eytensions, on June 30, 1990. The last disbursement was
made on August 8, 1990. The undisbursed amount, $523,955.38, was cancelled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Energy and Industry Division
of Country Department III of the Asian Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's PCR mission
i.n July 1990, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

DAQING OILFIELD-GAOTAIZI RESFRVOIR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2231-CHA)
PROJECT COMPLETICN REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Oblectives
1.        The objectives of the project weres  (a) to augment oil production
through the development of the Gaotaizi (G) reservoir and to assist in identi-
fying new reservoirs by the provision of seismic equipment; (b) to transfer
modern technology which would in turn enhance efficiency in both exploration
and production; and (c) to strengthen the institutional capabilities of the
Daqing Petroleum Administrative Bureau (DPAB) through training (Part I, para.
3).
Implementation Experience
2.        The project was implemented successfully with a considerable cost
underrun. This was mainly due to conservative project cost estimates and
exemption of import taxes and duties. Most of the physical components were
completed largely on schedule. However, the initial delays in procurement
(about two years) have, in turn, led to significant delays in the implementa-
tion of various technical assistance and training components. These delays
could be attributed to a number of reasons, including 1Rt- of experience with
Bank procedures, fragmentation of responsibilities amoi., arious Chinese agen-
cies, and cumbersome internal clearance procedures. In retrospect, the imple-
mentation schedule envisaged at the time of project appraisal for certain
components was overly optimistic.
3.        The enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pilots are the only project compo-
nent which were not completed by the closing date. The extended delays (about
seven years) from the original schedule are attributable to the delays in the
consultant's study and in procurement of equipment and construction, for which
both DPAB and the suppliers were responsible (Part I, para. 5).
Results
4.        The project objectives have been substantially met.  Specifically,
the G reservoir was successfully developed.  Bank-financed equipment for seis-
mic survey and interpretation contributed to improvements in the success ratio
for exploration. The objectives of transfer of specialized technology and
institution building were largely achieved through on-the-job training by
international consultants and contractors for the various studies and well
services, by importation of modern erquipment and related training by the sup-
pliers, as well as by local and overseas training. However, the timing of the
above technology transfer was delayed as a result of delays in procurement.
Nevertheless, the results of technical assistance and training were largely
positive in enhancing DPAB's capability in critical facets of petroleum
exploration and development activities (Part 1, para. 6).

Sustainability
5.        Estimates of oil reserves and production from the G reservoir have
been revised upward from the appraisal estimates. DPAB has taken steps to
carefully monitor the reservoir performance and apply appropriate measures
including infill drilling, modified water flooding and EOR techniques to help
achieve the production targets. In view of the foregoing, it is reasonable to
expect that the potential economic benefits of field development would be
sustained (Part I, para. 7).
Findings and Lessons Learned
6.        This was the first Bank-financed petroleum project in China.  The
project entity's lack of experience with Bank procedures contributed to sig-
nificant initial delays in procurement. These delays were exacerbated by
inadequate interagency coordination and cumbersome internal clearance proce-
dures. Unlike the offshore,petroleum companies, DPAB did not have the author-
ity to procure Bank-financed goods/services directly nor was it allowed to
process Bank loan disbursement applications directly. As in the case of other
onshore petroleum bureaus, DPAB had to procure through an auithorized agent and
disburspment applications were centrallv processed by the China National
Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), fomerly the Ministry of Petroleum Industry
(MOPI). The above institutional arrangements were not conducive to efficiency
and contributed to delays in procurement and disbursements (Part I, para. 4).
7.        The Bank played a significant catalytic role in technology transfer
and institution building. In general, the Bank performed well, assisting the
borrower at all stages of project preparation and implementation. During
project supervision, Bank staff assisted DPAB with procurement activities and
mobilization of consultants, and exchanged views with DPAB in the review of
various technical studies. However, in retrospect, the Bank could have helped
reduce the delays in consultancy studies by assisting the prcject entity in
drafting a better focused scope of work in the terms of reference for consul-
tants. Further, the draft terms of reference should have been prepared before
project field appraisal rather than during project supervision (Part I, para.
8).

Loan Number : ?231-CHA
RVP Unit    X Asia Region
Country     : China
Sector      : Energy
Subsector   : Petroleum
2. Background
2.1       China has been remarkably successful in the development of its
petroleum resources. However, during the last decade, technological problems
have been increasingly encountered as the petroleum sector expands the scope
of activities to cover more difficult areas. Mainly due to an extended period
of isolation prior to the eighties, certain Chinese techniques, equipment and
practices in a broad spectrum of activities in petroleum exploration and pro-
duction have become outmoded, and less efficient/effective than modern indus-
try standards. Moreover, sophisticated state-of-the-art technology in
enhanced oil recovery, which is crizical for increasing oil production from
aging fields, is lacking in the country.
2.2       The Government of China (GOC) first requested for Bank assistance in
the petroleum sector in the early eighties at a critical juncture when China's
oil and gas production started to decline from its peak level in 1979. Thus,
the Bank's participation was driven by the urgent need to assist the Govern-
ment in the formulation and !-mplementation of remedial measures to arrest oil
production decline, focusing in particular on technology transfer and institu-
tion building. This operation was the first of a series of five Bank-financed
petroleum projects in the country. As Daqing is by far the largest oilfield
in China, successful completion of this project had a significant impact on
the petroleum industry in the country. However, in accordance with current
Petroleum Lending Guidelines (OMS 3.82), the Bank generally will not in future
participate in similar oil development projects without cofinancing or the
participation of the private sector.

3. Project Objectives and Description
3.1       The objectives of the project weret (a) to augment oil production
through the development of the Gaotaizi (G) reservoir and to assist in identi-
fying new reservoirs through the use of modern seismic equipment; (b) to
transfer modern technology which would in turn enhance efficiency in both
exploration and production; and (c) to strengthen DPAB's institutional capa-
bilities through training.
3.2       The project comprised the following components:  (a) G reservoir
development--drilling and completing about 615 oil wells and about 206 water
injection wells; installation of facilities for oil/gas production and trans-
portation as well as for water injection; and installation of general utili-
ties; (b; training--establishment of two training centers, for skilled workers
and professionals respectively; (c) establishment of a computer center and
laboratories for operationa;ly-oriented research, enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
and oil/gas/water gathering, treatment and transportation; (d) provision of
seismic equipment; (e) technical assistance--provision of six technical stud-
ies; and (f) 3-D seismic survey and preinvestment study for Zhongyuan Oilfield
as part of the preparation for the second Bank-financed petroleum project in
China.
4.  Project Design and Organization
4.1       The project was designed to develop the G reservoir with the least
cost method. It was elso designed to be a vehicle for transferring modern
petroleum technology and institution building at Daqing. The project adopted
a building block approach in the design of technical assistance and training
components which was appropriate. In particular, completion of the relevant
pre-investment studies were conditions of disbursement for the EOR pilots and
prototype station components.
4.2       The project was nmainly implemented by the Daqing Petroleum Adminis-
trative Bureau (DPAB), with the assistance of local and foreign consultants/
contractors. Production Company No.1 (PCN1), a subunit of DPAB, is responsi-
ble for the development of G reservoir. Most of the physical components were
largely implemented on schedule, thanks to the special project team which was
set up in PCN1 to facilitate coordination and monitoring of project implemen-
tation.
4.3       However, considerable delays in procurement were initially encoun-
tered in part due to lack of experience with Bank procedures, fragmentation of
responsibilities among various Chinese agencies, and cumbersome internal
clearance procedures. Unlike the offshore petroleum companies, DPAB did not
have the authority to procure directly Bank-financed goods/services, nor was
it allowed to ?rocess Bank loan disbursement applications directly. As in the
case of other onshore petroleum bureaus, DPAB had to procure through an autho-
rized agent (International Tendering Corporation) and disbursement applica-
tions were centrally processed by the China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC), formerly the Ministry of Petroleum Industry (MOPI). The above insti-
tutional arrangements were not conducive to efficiency and corLtributed to



-3-
delays in procurement and disbursements. These delays were exacerbated by
inadequate coordination among the concerned agencies.
5. Project Implementation
5.1       The project was implemented successfully with a considerable cost
underrun. Most of the physical components were completed largely on schedule.
However, the initial delays in procurement (about two years) have, in turn,
led to significant delays in various technical assistance and training compo-
nents. These delays could be attributed to a number of reasons, including:
(a) a slow process in soliciting and evaluation of bids, in part due to the
lack of experience and inadequate interagency coordination; (b) protracted
contract negotiations; (c) frequent revision in the scope of certain consult-
ancy studies, and lack of clear understanding between the project entity and
the consultants; (d) the large number of contracts (325) covering a broad
spectrum of oilfield activities even though the contract packaging was appro-
pLiate; (e) certain suppliers delayed performance of their contracts; (f) the
consultants for the safety study went bankrupt and had to be replaced; and (g)
export restrictions under tle Coordination Committee for Multilateral Export
Control (COCOM) led to time lost in awaiting for export license and subsequent
downgrading of the computers for seismic data processing. In retrospect, the
implementation schedule envisaged at the time of project appraisal for certain
components was overly optimistic.
5.2       G Reservoir Development.  This component was successfully completed
on schedule and within budget.
5.3       Surface Facilities.  Except for a prototype station, the surface
facilities were completed about one year behind the appraisal schedule. The
delays were mainly due to construction difficulties encountered during the
severe winter periods which extend over four months.
5.4       The construction of a prototype station was completed about three
years behind the appraisal schedule as a result of the delays in consultants'
study. Due to problems related to computerized instrumentation, which have
not been resolved by the supplier, this station has not yet been commissioned.
It is expected to be commissioned shortly, about four years behind the origi-
nal schedule.
EOR Pilots
5.5       Based on the consultants' study and screening of various EOR pro-
cesses, DPAB selected two processes (CO2 and polymer flooding) for installing
three pilot projects in the depleted sands in Putohau reservoir. DPAB has
drilled all the wells for the pilots and has completed the surface facilities
for the C02 pilot. Facilities for polymer flooding are expected to be com-
pleted shortly. These pilots and an evaluation of their performance will be
completed by end-1992.
5.6       The EOR pilots are the only project component which were not com-
pleted by the closing date. The extended delays (about seven years) from the
original schedule are attributable to the delays in consultants' study and in



_4-
procurement of equipment and construction, for which both DPAB and the suppli-
ers were responsible.
Studies
5.7       All six studies provided under the project were completed satisfac-
torily by foreign consultants, albeit delayed by about three years from the
original schedule. Discussions on the results of these studies are in para.
6.8.
5.8       Three-D seiep-c survey and preinvestment study for Zhongyuan
Oilfield were implemented satisfactorily by the Zhongyuan Petroleum Explora-
tion Bureau. Discussions on this component will be included in the PCR for
the Zhongyuan-Wenliu Petroleum Project (Loan 2252-CHA).
Project Costs
5.9       The total financing required (including front-end fee of $2.4 mil-
lion) amounted to $332 million equivalent, as compared against the appraisal
estimate of $674.3 million equivalent (Table 5A in Part III). The cost under-
run amounted to 49 percent in US dollar terms and 14 percent in RMB terms,
reflecting a significant devaluation of RMB against the US dollar.l/ The
above cost underrun could be attributed to a number of reasons, including: (i)
the appraisal estimate for physical contingency (15 percent) was conse- ative,
even though it was prudent since this was the first Bank-financed operation in
the country; (ii) local inflation rates were considerably lower than antici-
pated; (iii) exemption of import duties and taxes which were included in the
appraisal estimate ($28 million); and (iv) the scope of gas treatment facili-
ties was reduced from the original plan as a result of the installation of a
gas processing planit for overall Daqing which was beyond the scope of this
project.
Project Financing
5.10      A comparison of actual project financing with appraisal estimates is
set out in Table 5A, Part III. Possible cofinancing with export credits did
not materialize. Instead, tubular goods were centrally procured by MOPI and
resold to various oilfields in local currency. The financing requirements for
all th'- local currency components were met by DPAB's own resources.
Disbursements
5.11      A comparison of actual disbursements with appraisal estimates is
presented in Table 3, Part III. As noted above, procurement and related dis-
bursements were delayed considerably and the closing date was extended by four
years. Actual costs of imported goods and services financed by the Bank were
close to the appraisal estimate; the Bank loan was 99.7 percent disbursed and
$0.5 million of the loan canceled.
1/   The exchange rates for US$1 at project appraisal and completion were
Y 1.8 and Y 4.72, respectively.



-5-
Loan Allocation
5.12        The original and actual loan allocation is shown in Table 5,
Part III. Unallacated amounts ($32.5 million) were largely reallocated to
equipment auid materials for production.
6. Project Results
Project Objectives
6.1       The project objectives have been substantially met.  Specifically,
the G reservoir was successfully developed. Bank-financed equipment for seis-
mic survey and interpretation contributed to improvements in the success ratio
for exploration. The objectives of transfer of specialized technology and
institution building were l4rgely achieved through on-the-job training by
international consultants and contractors for the various studies and well
services, through importation of modern equipment  lad related training by the
suppliers, as well as through local and overseas training. However, the tim-
ing of the above technology transfer was delayed as a result of delays in pro-
curement. In sum, the results of technical assistance and training were
largely positive in enhancing DPAB's capability in critical facets of petro-
leum exploration and deve]opment activities.
Petroleum Reserves and Production
6.2       At the .;me of project appraisal, recoverable oil reserves from G
reservoir were rougi..y estimated by DPAB and Bank staff/consultant at 51 mil-
lion tons and 32 million tons, respectively, with projected annual production
peaking at 3.8 million tons. Based on the latest reservoir study and well
results obtained since project appraisal, the latest reserves and production
estimates entail a considerably higher areal extent of the G reservoir, and
require a significant increase in well drilling and related surface facilities
over a longer period than originally envisaged (eight years instead of four
years). In essence, this project was the first phase of the G reservoir
development, which was confined to the areal extent of the reservoir and pro-
ject period (1982-85) as defined at the time of appraisal. Under this first
phase of development, the recoverable reserves are now estimated at some
56 million tons. Together with the second phase development (1986-89), which
is beyond the scope of this project, the total recoverable oil reserves have
been revised upward to 76 million tons, with annual production peaking at some
five million tons in 1988/89.
6.3       The higher than expected reserves and production estimates were
attributable to the following: (a) the appraisal estimates by Bank staff/
consultant were conservative, though prudent since this was the first Bank-
financed petroleum project in the country; (b) implementation of various rec-
ommendations emerged from the reservoir engineering and drilling/well comple-
tion studies, including improvements in well spacing, drilling and well com-
pletion practices, and water injection techniques; and (c) fracturing of the
reservoir. The average daily production peaked at 26 tons per well in 1985 as
compared with the appraisal estimate of 19 tons per well. In sum, the reser-
voir condition was considerably more favorable than originally anticipated.



- 6 -
6.4       The significant variances between appraisal and latest estimates of
petroleum reserves demonstrate the geological uncertainties inherent in petro-
leum operations. Further, given the heterogeneous nature of the G reservoir
and the discontinuity of individual oil sands, it is not surprising that there
are considerable variations in estimates of recovery and production rates.
Seismic Survey and Interpretation
6.5       DPAB's technical capability and efficiency in undertaking seismic
sur-rey and interpretation were enhanced under the project. Sixteen staff from
the bureau -were trained overseas by the stipplier of seismic survey equipment.
The imported specialized equipment allowed DPAB to survey dlfficult areas
which were previously inaccessible, and efficiency in seismic survey was
improved by 50 percent.  In addition, two high speed computers are now oper-
ating at full capacity and process some 25,000 line-km in 2-D and 200 km in
3-D se'smic data each year.. The modern equipment for seismic survey, along
with the computers for seismic processing and interpretation, assisted DPAB in
the selection of well locations. This has, in turn, contributed to a marked
improvement in DPAB's success ratio for exploration from 32 percent to 48 per-
cent.
Computer Center
6.6       The computer facilities at Daqing were upgraded under the project,
covering mainly the following areas: (a) seismic processing and interpreta-
tion; (b) reservoir engineering; (c) data base management for oilfield opera-
tions; (d) economic evaluation of field develepment plans based on reservoir
simulation and risk analyses; and (e) computer aided design for surface facil-
ities. Eighty-six staff from DPAB were trained overseas by the suppliers for
computer operations. After an initial period of training by suppliers at
Daqing, the comrputer center has been operated entirely by Chinese staff and is
presently util.'zed at over 90 percent of its capacity.
Laboratories
6.7       DPAB has set up modern laboratories for reservoir rock and fluid
analysis to support reservoir management at Daqing. In addition, based on the
recommendations of the consultants for EOR study and pilot design, DPAB has
set up state-of-the-art laboratories appropriately equipped to support EOR
activities. About 40 staff were trained overseas and over 80 technicians were
trained locally by foreign consultants. As eavisaged during project apprai-
sal, these laboratories have contributed to the enh_ncement of reservoir man-
agement, including close monitoring and analyzing of the wells and fluid data.
Technical Assistance and Training
6.8       Studies:
(a)  Reservoir Engineering Study.  The results of this study indicated
that oil-in-place reserves in G reservoir are considerably higher
than the appraisal estimate (para. 6.2). DPAB considers the results
of the study satisf£ctory and the consultants' recommendations for
optimal development of the reservoirs study are being implemented



effectively. During the course of the study, DPAB staff received
on-the-job training in the processing of reservoir data for evaluat-
ing production performance and economic analysis of reservoir devel-
opment. Further, the software obtained from the consultants is
being used to update the study on G reservoir and to undertake simi-
lar studies for other reservoirs in Daqing.
(b) Drilling and Completion Study. The consultants reviewed the exist-
ing practices and made recommendations for improvements. The con-
sultants also assisted DPAB in the implementation of the recommended
well drilling and completion design which emerged from this study.
The impact of this study is significant in enhancing operational
efficiency. In particular, many of the down-hole problems previ-
ously encountered have been reduced considerably in DPAB's vast
drilling operations (2,500 wells were drilled in 1989). This has,
in turn, shorteneo the tiame required for well drilling (from an
average of 10 days to 7 days).
(c)  Surface Facilities Engineering Study.  This study included the basic
engineering design of prototype stations. Based on the consultants'
recommendations, a prototype station was constructed and this is
expected to have a demonstrative effect in promoting overall DPAB's
operational efficiency. Further, this study proved to be an effec-
tive vehicle to enhance the engineering design skills of local coun-
terpart staff.
(d,  Safety Study.  As noted above, the original consultants for this
study went bankrupt and had to be replaced (para. 5.1). While this
lhad contributed to a delay in completing the study, the quality of
the study was not adversely affected. The consultants assisted DPAB
in the improvements of oilfield safety management, including the
design of appropriate safety measures and standards, and increasing
the awareness of oilfield workers fcr safety needs. The recommen-
dations emerged from this study are being implemented in stages.
Under the second phase of the study, safety personnel were trained
overseas on the relevant computerized safety devices.
(e)  Training Study.  The consultants designed the curricula for workers
training as well as for supervisory personnel at the two training
centers. Most of the sophisticated training equipment has been
installed, except for a simulator due to the supplier's delay in
installation.
(f) EOR Study. This study, which was satisfactorily completed, provided
the preliminary basis for selecting the EOR process which could be
tested in two pilot programs and developed for the optimum oil
recovery at Daqing. The consultants will continue to assist DPAB in
the implementation of these pilots. Based on the results of the
pilots, and subject to economic viability, the selected EOR process
could be applied full scale at Daqing to enhance oil production.



-8-
Training
6.9       Since its inception in 1983, the two training centers (provided
under the project) have trained 3,750 workers and 5,952 middle level managers.
In addition, 26 engineers were sent abroad for masters and doctorate degree
programs, and 12 of these students have completed their study and are now
participating in DPAB's research activities. Separately, a modern training
eimulator was provided un',` the project. However, due to the supplier's
delay in commissioning,  -.4   Aining simulator is not yet operational.  DPAB
is following up this iP.'U .tn the supplier and it is expected to be resolved
in the near future.
Economic Reevaluation
6.10      The quantifiable benefits of the project are derived from the
development of the G reservoir, mainly in the form of oil production for
domestic use and/or export, and to a much lesser extent, associated gas pro-
duction for domestic use. At the time of appraisal, oil production was
assumed to start one year after the initial investments for the project and
the economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at 91 percent. However,
actual production started one year earlier than expected; net cashflow was
positive from the first year of project implementation, thus rendering the ERR
calculation (which is based on year-by-year cashflow) not meaningful.
6.11      Despite considerably lower world oil prices than originally antici-
pated, the economic benefits of the project are presently estimated to be
higher than the appraisal estimate mainly due to higher than expected oil
production from the G reservoir, coupled with sharply lower local costs which
in turn were mainly attributable to the devaluation of the RMB. Based on
DPAB's latest reserves estimates and projected production profile for first
phase development of the G reservoir, the net present value of the project (at
12 percent discount rate) is now estimated at $2.9 billion, as compared
against the appraisal estimate of $2.4 billion (Annex 1). The high incremen-
tal benefits, which are typical of petroleum development projects, are partly
attributable to the benefits from the "sunk costs" of earlier exploration in
the Daqing Oilfield.
Financial Performance
6.12      DPAB Finances.  Salient features of DPAB's finances over the period
1981-89 are summarized in Annex 2. Domestic oil prices have remained consid-
erably lower than international oil prices. The actual financial results for
1984-85 fell short of expectations mainly because the domestic oil price
increases envisaged at the time of project appraisal did not materialize.



-9-
Based on the Chinese accounting system,2/ DPAB started to report net losses
in 1989 mainly due to high taxation and inadequate oil price adjustments.
6.13      Notwithstanding a significant decline in profitability, DPAE's cash
generation has remained robust, albeit also suffering from a declining trend.
Over the past ten years, it has maintained a high self-financing ratio of no
less than 40 percent and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than three
times. Further, net government take from DPAB has consistently remained high,
even though it has decreased from Y 6.7 billion in 1981 to Y 3.5 billion in
1989. However, these traditional cash generation indicators for enterprises
fail to reflect the broader issue of financing shortfalls for sector develop-
ment. In the absence of remedial measures, including narrowing the gap
between domestic and international oil prices, the issue of financing con-
straints will become increasingly serious since maintenance of oil production
from aging fields in Daqing will require sharply increased investments.
6.14      Since DPAE has limited financial autonomy and does not operate on a
typical commercial basis, its financial perfarmance, especially in regard to
operating efficiency, cannot be measured in the same manner as a commercially
oriented enterprise, and the application of the Bank's normal covenants for
revenue and/or cash generation covenants is of limited significance. For
these reasons, the conditionalities for this project did not include any tra-
ditional financial performance covenant. Instead, the Bank's objective to
promote prudent financial management was achieved through DPAB's compliance
with the financial covenant which required the extension of PCN1's financial
planning horizon and furnishing the Bank with its five-year rolling plan, and
annually reviewing such plans with the Bank.
6.15      Project Finances.  Domestic oil prices are significantly lower than
international oil prices. Based on the assumption that DPAB's oil prices will
remain at the present level in real terms, the financial rate of return of the
project is now estimated at 41 percent, as compared with the appraisal esti-
mate of 36 percent (Annex 2). This difference is mainly because of the favor-
able impact of higher than expected oil production and project cost underruns
more than offset the adverse impact of higher taxes and lower than expected
domestic oil prices.
Environmental Impact and Safety
6.16      DPAB has conducted its drilling and production operation with due
attention paid to environmental considerations. The oil and liquid wastes
were collected and treated. The separated oil was mixed with the produced
oil. The separated water was treated and reinjected into the reservoir in a
closed system. These arrangements have proved effective in minimizing envi-
ronmental hazards.
2/   There are certain anomalies of Chinese accounting.  In particular, the
operation expenses of DPAB do not reflect any amortization for explora-
tion. On the other hand, a significant share (about 50 percent) of
DPAB's production costs are in fact provisions for capital expenditures
and thus not considered as costs by generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP).



- 10 -
6.17      Prior to this project, the safety arrangements in Daqing Ollfield
were not in conformity with the international petroleum industty standards.
The safety study conducted under this project made recommendations for
addressing the major safety issues. During project implementation, DPAB fully
recognized the importance of safety measures by implementing the consultants'
recommendations.
7. Project Sustainability
7.1       As noted above, estimates of oil reserves and production from the G
reservoir have been revised upward from the appraisal estimates. DPAB has
taken steps to carefully monitor the reservoir performance and apply appropri-
ate measures including infill drilling, modified water flooding and EOR tech-
niques to help achieve the production targets. In view of the foregoing, it
is reasonable to expect that the potential economic benefits of field develop-
ment could be sustained.
8. Bank Performance
8.1       The Bank played a significant catalytic role in technology transfer
and institution building; Bank staff assisted DPAB in diagnosing its techno-
logical gap and in designing the various TA and training components built into
the project. In general, the Bank performed well, assisting the borrower at
all qtages of project preparation and implementation. During project supervi-
sion, Bank staff assisted DPAB with procurement activities and mobilization of
consultants, and exchanged views with DPAB in the review of various technical
studies. However, in retrospect, the Bank could have helped reduce the delays
in consultancy studies by assisting the project entity in drafting a better
focused scope of work in the terms of reference for consultants. Further, the
draft terms of reference should have been prepared before project appraisal
rather than during project supervision.
9. Borrower Performance
9.1       While extended de..ays were encountered in procurement, the physical
components were largely completed within one year of the original schedule.
Coordination and monitoring of project implementation was facilitated by the
establishment of a special team. Further, tight budget control by DPAB con-
tributed to the significant cost underrun of the project. DPAB staff fully
appreciated the project objectives of technology transfer and training; modern
petroleum technology and equipment inducted under the project have been effec-
tively applied at various facets of exploration and development activities.
10. Project Relationship
10.1      The Bank and DPAB developed a good working relationship in the
course of project preparation and implementation.



- 11 a
11. Consultant Services
11.1      The consultants performed well and their reports were largely well
received by DPAB. oreover, local counterparts who worked with the consul-
tants received valuable on-the-job training.
12.  Project Documentation and Data
12.1      Both the Staff Appraisal Report and Loan Documents provided an ade-
quate framework for project implementation. Supervision reports provided an
adequate review of the progress of the project. The DPAB contribution to the
PCR, and their provision of documentation during the PCR mission, was useful
for completing the PCR.

PART II.  PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORRO/WERS PERSPECTIVE 3/
1. Project Achievements
1.1       The results of the development of the Gaotaizi (G) resarvoir were
better than expected. At the time of appraisal, oil produceion was projected
to commence in 1983 with 171,000 tons. Actual oil produci in started in 1982
with 140,000 tons. Peak production was expected to be in 1987, with 3.8 mil-
lion tons. Actual production in 1987 was 5.03 million tons. Accumulated
production up to 1989 was expected to be 16.732 million tons, as compared with
actual production of 24.75 million tons. The revenues remitted to the state
amounted to Y 40.69 million. In sum, good economic and social results were
achieved by the project.
1.2       We believe the most significant achievement of the project came from
the technical assistance component, and the transfer of technology which came
with the imports of modern equipment and computers.
1.3       Reservoir Study.  The advanced tomography method in well logging was
mastered by the study team. The method of digitalizing logs by computer has
the advantages over that of the manual plotting In both quality and speed.
Computer software is now being used instead of manual interpretations in
interpreting parameters and establishing a log data base. This has also led
to improved well test desi6n and test data collection.
1.4       EOR Study.  Through the consultancy services, technical data
exchange and overseas training, advanced enhanced oil recovery methods have
been studied and a complete set of methods of polymer performance evaluation
and parameters measurement has been established. In addition, a chemical
flooding model and a miscible-phase displacement model have been imported.
This increased the processing capacity of the computer system. The pilot test
of gel-polymer flooding with close well spacing was performed by using the
3/   Summarized from a comprehensive report prepared by DPAB.  A copy of the
report is in the project file.



- 13 -
methods of numerical simulation of oleophilic reservoir, grids variation,
flowing resistance change, and well working system. The results of the pilot
test were good.
1.5       Drilling and Completion.  Various modern drilling techniques and
equipment, including mud solids control equipment, preflushing liquid, 300 m
surface casing, optimized drill bits with nozzles, annular blowout preventors
of 3,000 psi and KCL-polymer heavy density mud have been introduced and this
has facilitated drilling. Cementing and completion techniques have also been
improved.
1.6       Prototype Station.  Various techniques have been introduced, includ-
ing computer-controlled pumping units, metering and transferring stations,
oil/gas/water separation methods, oily water treatment with coalescor, water
deaeration, etc. All these techniques not only improve the design of surface
facilities but also will be of benefit in production management, improved
working condition, economic efficiency and in cutting down energy consumption.
1.7       Safety Study.  The proposals by consultants, their teaching methods
and recommendations as well as imported teaching facilities have improved
safety management and strengthened the safety consciousness of the workers.
1.8       Training Center.  The 21 courses given by specialists in the train-
ing center have formed a good basis for DPAB in establishing a training center
for workers and technicians.
2. Suggestions for Future Improvements
2.1       Consultancy Studies.  The studies should be better defined and,
where necessary, divided into several studies according to the special tech-
niques required. It has proved impossible for one or two foreign companies to
provide all the specialization required by a broad study. A case in point is
the EOR study.
3. Evaluation of the Roles of the World Bank and DPAB
3.1       The success of the project has been due to the friandly cooperation
between the specialists of the World Bank, foreign consultants and DPAB's
staff. The assistance provided by Bank staff in procurement, review of con-
sultant studies, economic and financial analyses was very helpful and greatly
appreciated.
