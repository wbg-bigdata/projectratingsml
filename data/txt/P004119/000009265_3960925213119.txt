Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Korea - Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project (Loan 2491-KO)" prepared by
the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office with Part II contributed by the
Borrower.
All objectives of the project were achieved. Implementation of the
physical components was exemplary.  Benefits from the project facilities, in
terms of improved water supplies in the Metropolitan Region of Seoul, were
immediate and substantial. Studies carried out under the project on: (a) the
reorganization of the water sector; (b) improving the organization and management
of the implementing agency; and (c) rationalizing bulk water tariffs were
executed satisfactorily and their recommendations accepted. Implementation of
a) has been slow due to the issue's political sensitivity. However, those of (b)
and (c) were effective.  All in all, the project is rated as satisfactory and
sustainability of its benefits as likely.
The Project Completion Report is comprehensive and informative. The

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2491-KO)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Metropolitan
Region Water Supply Project in the Republic of Korea, for which Loan 2491-KO
in an amount of US$95.0 million was approved on February 5, 1985. The loan
was closed on May 24, 1991, one year and five months behind schedule. US$89.3
million of the loan was disbursed, and US$5.72 million was canceled.
The PCR was prepared jointly by the Infrastructure Operations
Division, Country Department I, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The PCR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report for the project, the Loan
Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the
Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2491-KO)
Evaluation Summary
i.         Background.  In 1983, when this project was identified, 372 of the
Korean population lived in the Seoul Metropolitan Region, which included Seoul
and Incheon (the first and fourth largest cities), 38 other cities and towns
as well as many villages. In contrast to the rest of the country, which had an
average population growth rate of 2.1% during the previous 20 years, the
population of the 25 municipalities included in the project had grown by an
average 7.1% p.a. during the previous decade, and four municipalities had
grown by over 10% p.a. Access to water services in the Region was uneven.
About 96% of the population of Seoul City had house connections, but overall
only about 77% of the population in the project area was served by
connections. Demand for water in the project municipalities had outpaced
water production capacity, resulting in water rationing and low pressures as
well as serious conflicts among the various cities (Part I, paras. 1-3).
ii.        Objectives.  The project was intended to relieve water shortages
and expand the water supply to satisfy the residential and industrial needs of
25 municipalities in the Seoul Metropolitan Region. It was expected to
improve services to 5 million people and to raise the population served with
water supply from 77% in 1983 to 92% in 1991 by providing bulk water for 1.1
million additional persons by 1991. Other project objectives were geared to
institution building and sustainability: (a) to establish a basis for an
integrated treated water system; (b) to improve the efficiency of water
services in the Metropolitan Region; (c) to strengthen the organization of
Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO), the institution responsible for
operating the country's bulk water systems serving groups of municipalities
(as in the Metropolitan Region); and (d) to rationalize the policy and
criteria for setting national bulk water supply tariffs (Part I, paras. 9-10
and 14).
iii.       The project comprised the third stage of development of the bulk
water supply system for the Metropolitan Region. It included the construction
and equipping of: (a) a main water intake and booster pumping station, about
11 km of water transmission pipelines and three tunnels with a total length of
6.5 km, delivering water to three water systems; (b) the three water supply
systems; (c) another treated water system, including an independent water
intake, water treatment plant, booster pumping station, treated water
transmission pipeline and tunnel; (d) technical assistance for project
construction, design, supervision and management; and (e) studies to (i)
improve the organization of water and sewerage services in the Metropolitan
Region; (ii) establish corporate planning within KOWACO; and (iii) set
policies for bulk water tariffs (Part I, paras 11-12).



- iii -
iv.        Implementation.  Project preparation and implementation of the
physical components went largely as planned.  During preparation, Bank review
of project designs was instrumental in assisting the Government to select the
least-cost design option.  The only change in the project during
implementation was the extension of the system to an additional community
experiencing water shortages due to unexpected population growth.  The
additional time needed for this work as well as some minor implementation and
procurement delays caused the closing date for the loan to be extended by one
year to December 1990. The delay had only a marginal effect on project
benefits, since most of the municipalities were enjoying improved water
service by end-1989 (Part I, para. 19).
v.         The project studies to achieve institution building and
sustainability objectives were carried out satisfactorily as agreed. However,
while KOWACO strengthened its financial management, tariffs did not keep up
with inflation. The study to improve the organization of water and sewer
services in the Metropolitan Region was expanded to include a reorganization
of water and sewer systems nationwide, with the aim of shifting responsibility
for water supply distribution from the individual municipalities to regional
entities encompassing several contiguous municipalities, as in the Seoul
Metropolitan Region. The regional systems were promoted as a means to address
increasing problems of water scarcity. However, the recommendations of the
study were not implemented due to a lack of consensus on the reorganization
(Part I, paras. 23-25).
vi.        Project Results.  The physical works were carried out substantially
as planned and the quantitative objectives of the project were achieved. An
unexpected rapid growth in the Metropolitan Region's population and water
demand, however, made it necessary to advance construction of the next
(fourth) stage expansion of the water system, even before this project was
completed (Part I, para. 26). While the recommendations of the organizational
studies have not yet been implemented, sector management and KOWACO has been
continuously improving, and a number of progressive steps were taken during
and after the project implementation period (Part I, paras. 27-29).
vii.       Compliance with financial covenants included in the Loan Agreement
was mixed, in some years the financial rate of return was higher than the
covenanted rate of return, and in other years, lower. Always, however, the
financial performance has been satisfactory in terms of meeting operating and
maintenance costs, debt service and development obligations (Part I, paras.
30-35; Part III, Table 9).
viii.      The economic rate of return at project completion was about 21%,
higher than the appraisal estimate of 19%. This rate of return, however,
underestimates the economic benefits of the project (Part I, para. 36).
ix.        Sustainability.  When politically feasible, the recommendations of
the project's tariff and institutional studies should be implemented to ensure
the sustainability of the physical infrastructure built under the project.
Water resources in Korea are becoming scarce, and conservation practices need
to be put in place as soon as possible (Part I, para. 38).



- iv -
x.         Conclusions and Lessons Learned.  The physical components of the
project were timely and well designed, and execution was excellent. The
studies were well conceived, and although the recommendations were not
implemented in most cases, they served to highlight important sector issues.
xi.        There are two lessons to be learned from this project.  First, good
project design is crucial to the successful and timely implementation of the
related physical components. Use of design panels for large, complex projects
is likely to improve the projects (Part I, para. 15). Second, actions by
mature Governments on politically sensitive policy changes with respect to
reorganizations and tariffs are apt to come slowly, and the best role the Bank
can play is to encourage and advise (Part I, paras. 45-46).

Proiect Identitv
Project Name:        Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project
Loan Number:         2491-KO
RVP Unit:            East Asia and Pacific Region
Country:             Republic of Korea
Sector:              Water Supply and Sanitation
Background
1.        In 1983, when the Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project was
identified, Korea had a population of about 40 million, some 37% of whom lived
2
in the 3,000 km Seoul Metropolitan Region.  The Region included Seoul and
Incheon, the first and fourth largest cities in Korea at that time, 38 other
cities and towns, as well as many villages in Gyeonggi Province. Over the
previous 20 years, the population in the Region had grown by an annual average
rate of 5%, compared to 2.1% for the country overall. The population of the
25 municipalities included in the project had grown by 7.1% p.a. during the
previous decade, with four municipalities growing by over 10% p.a.
2.        Access to water services in the Region was uneven.  About 96% of the
population of Seoul City had house connections, but only 74% of the population
in the other 39 cities and towns were served by connections, and several towns
and villages were totally unserved by a piped water supply. Water production
in the Metropo'.itan Region in 1983 reached 1,361 million metric tons (mt),
serving 12 million of the Region's population (or 89% of the area's
population). By 1983, in the project municipalities, demand had exceeded
water production capacity, resulting in water rationing and low pressures as
well as serious conflicts among the various cities served, and only about 77%
of the population in the project area was served.
3.        The Han River was the source of 98% of the water used in the
Metropolitan Region, most of which (60% or 2.6 million metric tons per day
(mtpd)) was provided by two regional water supply systems. Total water
consumption in 1982 was 752 million mt or about 47 m per month per
connection. The main demand was domestic (55%), followed by commercial and
industrial (35%) and public and others (10%). As a result of development of a
third regional water supply system under the project, water consumption was
expected to rise from 173 liters per capita per day (lpcd) in 1983 to 280 lpcd
by 1996 (according to the feasibility study) or, more conservatively, to 230
lpcd as projected by the Bank at project appraisal.
4.        At the time of project preparation (and even now), there was no
single agency in charge of overall planning and programming of the sector. At
the Central Government level, four Ministries were directly involved in the
sector with some overlapping responsibilities. The Ministry of Construction
(MOC), the main agency for the sector, through its Water Resources and Urban
Planning Bureaus, was responsible for the planning, design and construction of



major water and sewerage works and for collecting hydrological data, issuing
licenses for abstraction of water from the major rivers and planning multi-
purpose dams. The Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development
Corporation (ISWACO), a semi-autonomous public corporation under MOC, was
responsible for the operation of bulk water systems serving groups of muni-
cipalities, for the development of multi-purpose dams and land development.
5.         The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), through its Local Finance
Bureau, oversaw the operation of municipal Water Bureaus (WBs), including the
approval of bonds, loans, tariffs and the expansion of distribution and
storage facilities. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) was
responsible for setting standards and quality control. Finally, the Economic
Planning Board (EPB) set guidelines for tariff increases through its Price
Bureau and allocated counterpart funds for MOC's foreign-funded projects.
6.        In 1988, the Government streamlined several public corporations and
established the Korea Water Resources Corporation (KOWACO) as the main agency
responsible for water resources and bulk water supply, while centralizing
responsibility for land development in the Korea Land Development Corporation.
The current acronym, KOWACO, is used hereafter in this report.
7.        KOWACO is a corporation owned by the Government (94%) and the Korea
Development Bank (KDB) (6%). KOWACO has two divisions, the Water Division and
the Dams Division. The Water Division operates and maintains the regional
water supply systems financed by MOC. Regional systems became necessary due
to water scarcity in many areas. As of 1990, there were 13 regional systems,
including three in the Metropolitan Region. The Dams Division operates and
maintains eight dams and the Nakdong Barrage; two additional dams will be in
operation by 1993. Its main source of revenue is the sale of bulk power to
the Korea Electric Power Company (KEPco).
8.        Prior to the Metropolitan Region Project, the Bank had supported two
water supply projects in Korea: the First Water Supply Project (Ln. 2072-KO,
approved in 1981) to expand the systems in the cities of Daegu, Gwangju,
Masan, Changweon and Jinhae; and the Second Water Supply Project (Ln. 2350-Ko,
approved in October 1983) to increase water availability for municipalities in
the Nakdong Basin. These projects demonstrated the capacity of the sector to
implement major physical works efficiently with little or no delay.
9.        The Bank's dialogue with the Government over the course of the
Bank's involvement with the sector centered largely on institutional issues
including: (a) the lack of a mechanism to provide municipal Water Bureaus with
long-term finance for investments; (b) the need for more rational criteria for
setting bulk water tariffs by KOWACO, and retail water tariffs by the
municipalities; (c) the lack of a single government agency responsible for the
sector; and (d) improvement of the efficiency of the organization of the
sector at the municipal level. While cost recovery in the Korean water supply
sector was, and continues to be, excellent, the tariff policies have not been
directed toward more efficient use of scarce national water resources.

Proiect Obiectives and Description
10.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project was regarded as an integrated
solution to the water needs of municipalities in the Metropolitan Region which
lacked other water sources. It was also a vehicle for continuing dialogue
with key government ministries about improving sector coordination,
institutional development and national tariff policies. The objectives of the
project were to: (a) relieve water shortages and expand the water supply to
satisfy the residential and industrial needs of 25 municipalities in the Seoul
Metropolitan Region, thus improving services to 5 million persons and raising
the population served with water supply from 77% in 1983 to 92% in 1991 by
providing bulk water for 1.1 million additional persons by 1991; (b) establish
the basis for an integrated treated water system; (c) improve the efficiency
of water services in the Metropolitan Region; and (d) strengthen the
organization of KOWACO and provide a more rational policy and criteria for
nationwide tariffs for raw and treated bulk water supply.
11.       Proiect Description.  The project comprised the third stage of
development of the bulk water supply system for the Metropolitan Region, using
water extracted from the Han River, which at that time was judged to have
sufficient water to satisfy demand at least to the year 2000. The project
included the construction and equipping of:
(a) a main water intake and booster pumping station for 1,200,000 mtpd
at Paldang, water transmission pipelines about 11 km long and
2,200 mm in diameter and three tunnels 6.5 km long and 3,800 mm in
diameter, delivering water to three water systems described in (b),
(c) and (d) below;
(b) the Incheon water system serving five municipalities to the west and
including a booster pumping station, 560,000 mtpd capacity and water
transmission pipelines 29 km long and 2,400 mm to 1,650 mm in
diameter, and three tunnels 6.5 km long and 3,000 mm in diameter
(the treatment plant for this system would be built, owned and
operated by these municipalities);
(c) the seongnam treated water system serving ten municipalities to the
south and including a water treatment plant of 425,000 mtpd
capacity, a booster pump station, and a treated water transmission
pipeline about 48 km long and 1,800 mm to 1,350 mm in diameter;
(d) about 215,000 mtpd raw water supply to three municipalities and the
new Banweol development area;
(e) the Euijeongbu treated water system serving six municipalities to
the north and including an independent water intake from the Han
River, a water treatment plant of 100,000 mtpd capacity, a booster
pumping station, a treated water transmission pipeline about 24 km
long and 1,100 mm to 900 mm in diameter and a tunnel 1.0 km long and
2,200 mm in diameter;
(f) technical assistance for project construction, design, supervision
and management; and



-4 -
(g) studies to i)improve the organization of water and sewerage services
in the Metropolitan Region; ii)establish corporate planning within
KOWACO and iii)set policies for bulk water tariffs.
12.       Complementary Works.  Six large project cities (Incheon, Seongnam,
Suweon, Banweol, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong) and the Pyeongtaek development area
were expected to use about 80% of the water supplied by the project. These
cities, with consultant support, would prepare Master Plans and staged
programs with assistance from MOHA for improvement and expansion of the
existing distribution systems. Incheon, Bucheon and Gwangmyeong would
construct a jointly-owned treatment plant with financing from the Asian
Development Bank (ADB). All other beneficiary municipalities in the Region,
coordinated by MOHA, were to prepare feasibility studies and expand their
distribution systems to utilize the water supplied by the project.
Project Desiqn and Organization
13.       Least-cost Solution.  Adoption of the least-cost solution was a
major issue during project preparation. This issue, identified by early Bank
missions reviewing completed project feasibility studies, was continuation of
an established practice of lengthy transport of raw water from river intakes
on the Han River to water treatment plants owned and operated by several
contiguous municipalities. This practice had been employed in the two
previous stages of system development. The Bank's analysis indicated that
such a system would be at least 20% more expensive than a treated water
system, and the Bank informed the Government that Bank financing for the
project would be possible only if the lower-cost solution of a treated water
transmission system was chosen. The final solution allowed for a short raw
water pipeline to connect with an existing first-stage pipeline to increase
water supply to Seoul. The rest of the project, however, was based on a
treated water transmission and distribution system, whereby water would be
treated at central plants and then distributed to the municipalities.
Agreement on this change in basic design concept was a critical accomplishment
in project development.
14.       Studies.   The project included the following studies: (a) to
develop a maintenance and inspection program for Stages I, II and III of the
Metropolitan Region Water Supply System; (b) to identify means of
strengthening KOWACO's financial management and corporate planning capacities;
and (c) to recommend policies for setting bulk water tariffs at the national
level. All of these studies were to be undertaken and financed by KOWACO. A
study of the organization of water service in the Metropolitan Region was to
be prepared and financed by MOHA. The MOHA study was expanded later to
include a reorganization of all water and sewerage systems in the country,
with a particular aim of shifting responsibility for water supply distribution
from the individual municipalities to regional entities encompassing several
contiguous municipalities, as in the Seoul Metropolitan Region. All of the
studies were to be carried out with the assistance of consultants (Part III,
Table 9).

15.       Design Review Panel.   Feasibility studies and final engineering for
the project were carried out by consultants financed under the First Water
Supply Project (Loan 2072-KO). The large treatment plants included in the
project posed a number of difficult design problems related to the
approximately 14 km of tunnels, optimal routing of the large diameter and long
transmission pipelines for treated water, optimum pipe sizing and choice of
suitable pipe materials, water quality and corrosion protection throughout the
nearly 175 km of pipeline. To ensure adequate solutions to these problems,
the Bank proposed and the Government agreed to an expert international design
review panel to review the engineering designs. Inputs from the panel
contributed to the sound technical design, and consequently trouble-free
commissioning, operation and maintenance of the completed system. A study was
also carried out of cathodic protection against corrosion of all steel
pipelines laid in the system's three stages.
16.       Project Management.  MOC managed the project efficiently.  The
complementary works were also implemented by the municipalities in a timely
manner under the management of MOHA. In retrospect, agreement of the
implementing agencies, consultants and Bank to advance contracting and
packaging contracts into four lots so as to obtain the maximum benefit from
the procurement process were important elements. The early tendering and
start-up helped to achieve a firmer estimate of project costs at the outset
and to reduce the provision for price contingencies. During negotiations, the
loan amount was revised downwards from US$120 million equivalent to
US$95 million equivalent, partly based on offers received on the first tenders
and a tightening up of the project execution schedule.
17.       Design Changes.  Some minor changes were required during detailed
design and project execution; details are in Annex 1. Project execution
proceeded smoothly with no delays during the construction period. However, at
the end of 1988, the Bank agreed to the Government's request to extend the
system to include the municipality of Pyeongtaek, which was experiencing water
shortages because of unexpected population growth. The extension to
Pyeongtaek contributed to a delay in project completion due to the need for
new designs, the emergence of land acquisition problems and the need to
coordinate the pipeline alignment with a proposed new highway.
Proiect Implementation
18.       Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up.  Project start-up commenced
well before loan signing. Construction of civil works under the four project
contracts began on November 30, 1984, April 13, 1985, October 11, 1985 and
December 17, 1987, respectively. The loan was signed on March 11, 1985 and
became effective on May 7, 1985. Since all bid documents, tender evaluations
and contract awards for the first contract had been reviewed and approved by
Bank staff, disbursement against the first contract was possible as soon as
the loan was declared effective.
19.       Implementation Schedule.  The provision for advance contracting was
a significant factor in reducing implementation delays and in achieving most
of the project's objectives by the original loan closing date. Procurement
was smooth, and contracts for all four lots were awarded on schedule. About
90% of the original project was completed by December 31, 1988, the original



completion date, and all major construction under the revised project was
substantially completed by December 31, 1989, the original loan closing date.
The closing date which had been extended to December 31, 1990 due to the
Pyeongtaek extension, was also necessary because of delays in laying a
pipeline under the Han River, in building a railway crossing, and in procuring
electro-mechanical and laboratory equipment. This delay had no significant
impact on project results since by December 31, 1989 about 92% of the Bank
loan had been disbursed and most of the project municipalities had satis-
factory water service. A comparison of the estimated and actual
implementation schedules as well as the progress of the four contracts are
shown in Annexes 2 and 3.
20.       Project Costs.  At the time of appraisal, the project was expected
to cost US$252.1 million equivalent (including us$11.5 million equivalent in
duties and taxes). Despite the additional works for the Pyeongtaek extension,
the final project cost was about US$239.3 million equivalent (Part III, Table
SB). The cost under-run is attributed to the highly competitive local
construction industry, timely project execution, and expeditious procurement
procedures.
21.       Disbursements.  Disbursements exceeded appraisal estimates in the
first three and a half years of project implementation and never dropped below
92% thereafter (Part III, Table 3A). Loan disbursements for civil works and
consultants were lower than expected by 19% and 25%, respectively, but were 1%
higher for equipment (Part III, Table 3B). In all, US$5.72 of the original
US$95 million loan was canceled: US$5.0 million on April 3, 1989 and US$0.72
on May 1, 1991. At loan closing on May 24, 1991, us$89.8 million of the loan
had been disbursed.
22.       Financing.  As expected at appraisal, the project was financed by
the Bank loan (37%) and government equity (63%) (Part III, Table 5).
Proiect Results
23. Project Studies. The project studies were expected to contribute to: (a)
establishment of a basis for integrated water systems; (b) improvement of
KOWACO's efficiency; and (c) adoption of a more rational policy and criteria
for nationwide tariffs. The reorganization studies (para. 14) were completed,
regional water systems were recommended and implementation plans were
discussed with all relevant agencies. Changes in top government officials and
opposition by Congress, however, resulted in the shelving of the
reorganization plans. This was not totally unexpected; the Staff Appraisal
Report had noted that reorganization of this sector in Korea was a very
sensitive political issue and that changes would be slow.
24.       Study (b) contributed to improvements in KOWACO's efficiency by
identifying measures to strengthen its financial management and corporate
planning. As recommended by the studies, KOWACO began to prepare semi-annual
plans and long-term financial projections, which were considered satisfactory
by the Bank.



-7-
25.       The tariff studies resulted in implementation of national uniform
bulk water tariffs which would allow KOWACO's Water Division to achieve
financial performance levels equivalent to those required by the Bank.
Policies which would allow bulk water tariffs in each region to reflect actual
costs were evaluated also, but that concept was dismissed as being socially
inequitable and politically impossible.
26.       Physical Results.  The project was expected to improve services to 5
million people and provide bulk water for an additional 1.1 million people by
1991. Except for the addition of the extension to Pyeongtaek (para. 17), the
physical works were carried out substantially as planned and the quantitative
objectives were achieved. However, an unexpected rapid growth in the Region's
population and in demand for water, caused by a change in the Government's
spatial development policy, necessitated advancing construction of the next
(fourth stage) expansion of the system, even before completion of the Bank-
assisted third stage project. Appraisal projections of population growth and
water demand therefore proved to be too low.
(a) Population Growth. During project implementation, the
Government apparently reversed its policy of limiting growth in
the Metropolitan Area, and by 1990 the population of the
project municipalities was about one million more than expected
at appraisal and by 1993 should exceed the forecast by almost
three million. Part III, Table 6 gives the incremental
population served by the project, and Annex 4 shows the
unexpectedly high growth in the project area near the end of
the project period.
(b) Water Demand. Annex 5 shows a comparison of average water
demand as forecasted at project appraisal and as recently
calculated by consultants based on actual population growth
trends. The ultimate total supply capacity of the system after
project completion in 1990 was about 1.35 mmtpd (million metric
tons per day). In 1991, total average demand already exceeded
the forecast (1.69 mmtpd) and is expected to reach almost 2.1
mmtpd by 1995.
The Bank could not have foreseen the Government's policy changes which caused
demand in the project area to greatly outpace projections. Because of the
quality of the planning of the overall system, preliminary designs for the
fourth stage were available for immediate implementation. The project was
therefore timely and assisted the Government in meeting its development
objectives.
27.       Institutional Results.  KOWACO has been a continuously improving its
organization, to which the Bank, through this and other projects, (Part III,
Table 1) appears to have made important contributions. The whole problem of
efficient water resource management and efficient provision of adequate
services to the population, while trying to maintain a balance between social
and economic factors, have been a high priority concern to the Government for
many years. The establishment of KOWACO as part of a process of streamlining
public corporations (para. 6), though possibly not directly attributable to
Bank financed operations, is an example of this effort. While implementation



- 8 -
of the recommendations of the organizational studies (para. 23) were not
considered possible at that time, other developments since then are promising.
28.       After a review of the status of the sector, particularly the rapid
increase of river pollution, the Government, in 1989, formulated a National
water Improvement Program (NWIP) with the objectives of insuring good quality
water to the total population and improving the efficiency of the sector. The
NWIP, comprising a fundamental reorganization of the sector, was approved by
the President in September 1989, and its implementation was to be coordinated
by the Prime Minister and an Inter-ministerial committee. Under NWIP, the
municipal WBs are gradually being replaced by Water Agencies which would have
the advantages of corporations, although remaining under the municipalities.
Responsibility for municipal sewerage would be assumed by the Water Agencies
as sewerage operations become financially viable.
29.       During the early 1990's, the planning, construction and financing of
all dams and regional water supply systems are to be transferred from MOC to
KOWACO. Therefore, after construction of ongoing systems is completed
(largely financed by Government contributions), KOWACO would have to finance
future investments from internal cash generation and through borrowing. It
has also been recommended, but not yet decided, that KOWACO should have full
responsibility for management of the main rivers and the construction and
operation of new sewage treatment plants. This step would substantially
improve water resources management.
30.       Financial Results.  Under the Loan Agreement, KOWACO's minimum rates
of return on revalued assets for its Water and Dams Divisions were to be 4% in
1985 and 5% thereafter, and KOWACO's debt service coverage would not be less
than 1.3. The rate of return requirements for the Water Division were
superseded by the Loan Agreement for the Juam Regional Water Supply Project
(Loan 3178-Ko) which required rates of return of not lower than 2% in 1990,
3.5% in 1991, and 5% thereafter. There was no change in the rate of return
requirements for the Dams Division or for KOWACO's debt service coverage.
31.       Although the Water Division's financial performance has been
generally satisfactory, its financial indicators showed a decline during the
years 1988-90. In 1985, the Water Division had achieved a rate of return of
6.6%, but this fell steadily, averaging only about 2% after 1987. The dip in
performance resulted mainly from a doubling of its net fixed assets as new
w,ater systems became operational, the fact that in 1989 KOWACO had to take
over operation of Geum Gang system which has a capacity far exceeding demand
and negative net income, and the lack of tariff increases since 1987 due to
EPB restrictions aimed at controlling inflation. The Dams Division achieved
the covenanted rate of return in all but two years, 1988-89, when a drought
affected its performance. In February 1991, the Government approved a phased
13.6% water tariff increase.
32.       Although its tariff increases were restricted after 1987, KOWACO has
been growing rapidly, and its operating income increased about eight times in
the past seven years. KOWACO's financial performance in 1990 was good, with a
debt/(debt plus equity) ratio of 40% and current ratio of 1.5. Net income was
14% of its equity, and its operating ratio was 72%. KOWACO's financial
statements are given in Annex 6, Tables 1-9.



-9-
33.       In 1990, raw water sales by the Water Division reached 1,373 million
tons per year, which was lower than the 1,520 million tons per year forecast
at appraisal, but are expected to increase ravidlv particularly in the
Metropolitan Region. The working ratio during 1985-90 averaged about 70%, but
had reached about 76% in 1990 since the water tariff was not increased over
the period. At appraisal, the working ratio was expected to average about 67%
during this period with about 64% by 1990. Financial statements of the Water
Division are shown in Annex 6, Tables 2-5.
34.        For the Dams Division, working ratios during 1985-90 averaged about
18% (going from about 11% in 1987 to almost 26% in 1988), rather than the 13%
projected at appraisal. Sharp increases in power sales in 1987 and 1990
caused the rates of return on revalued assets to reach 9.0% and 7.0%,
respectively. In other years during the 1986-90 period, the rates of return
were much lower (2.5% to 4.1%) because the average tariff for power sales did
not increase. The actual average rate of return for the period therefore
slightly exceeded the 5% agreed at appraisal, but only because of the surge in
power sales. Financial statements of the Dams Division are shown in Annex 6,
Tables 6-9.
35.       In the near future, KOWACO's role as a development agency will
diminish unless its responsibilities are expanded to include river basin
management and sewage treatment and disposal as recommended (para 29). There
are few possibilities for new regional water supply systems and no more major
dams are planned. Thus, KOWACO would become mainly an operating agency and,
from a strictly financial standpoint, there would be no need to require rates
of return which would generate funds much in excess of what would be needed
for good operation and maintenance and for debt service.
36.       Economic Results.  The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the
project, based on existing water tariffs and project benefits which are
expected to be reflected in real estate values, is estimated at about 21%
(Annex 7, Table 1), somewhat higher than the 19% estimated at appraisal.
sensitivity analysis shows that a 10% decrease in benefits would reduce the
ERR to 19.3% while a 15% increase in operating expenses would reduce the ERR
negligibly (to 19.7%). However, these rates of return underestimate the
economic benefits of the project because: (a)they are based on the average
charges for treated water, which only partially represent the consumer
willingness to pay for water (as evidenced by excess consumption charges up to
three times higher than the average tariff); and(b)they exclude other
important but difficult to quantify benefits like the provision of improved
services to current consumers, the improvement of living standards, and the
health and general welfare of the population. The water provided by the
project is the only water source for most municipalities in the area and is
therefore essential for the Region's development.
37.       The Proiect's Impact.  The project had an immediate impact on the
water supplies to the project municipalities, many of which had been
experiencing rationing, water shortages and low pressures.  Although it became
clear even before completion of the Bank-assisted third-stage system that
demand would soon exceed capacity, the next stage of the system's expansion
had already been planned and could be implemented without delay. There was
consequently a steady improvement in the quality of service. Much, however,



- 10 -
remains to be done by the project municipalities, including efforts to reduce
unaccounted-for water, which is reportedly about 40% in the Metropolitan Area.
The results of the tariff and organizational studies should also be
implemented for the full benefits of Bank involvement to be realized. The
Bank is continuing its dialogue with the Government on these important
matters.
Project Sustainability
38.       Because of the high unaccounted-for water in the Seoul Metropolitan
Region, aggressive action is required from the Government and project
municipalities in implementing programs for reducing wastage through leakage.
This also applies to implementation of recommendations of the cathodic
protection studies carried out under the project. For the country as a whole,
exploitation of water resources has gone about as far as it can, and serious
actions to conserve water for municipal and industrial use are needed
urgently. The recommended expansion of KOWACO's responsibilities to include
river basin management and sewage treatment (para. 29) should be implemented.
Furthermore, bulk water tariffs should be designed more to reflect the
differences in the marginal cost of water in the different regions as a means
of discouraging water use where water is scarce, rather than being based
entirely on the politically expedient social considerations which have
controlled tariffs decisions to date.
Bank Performance
39.       Bank management performed very well at the early stages of the
project, from identification through preparation, detailed design, contract
packaging, procurement and project start-up. Bank management played a key
role in persuading the Borrower to accept the least-cost solution. When
delays occurred, Bank staff performed well and gave needed support. The Bank
missions also worked hard, though unsuccessfully, to convince the Government
to implement recommendations of the national water tariff studies. It is not
clear whether greater involvement of the Bank at the later stages of the
project would have brought about the reorganization of the sector nationwide
(as recommended in the expanded MOHA study, para. 14).
Borrower and Implementing Agency Performance
40.       The performance of the Borrower and implementing agencies was
excellent with respect to physical implementation but slow in regard to
implementing recommendations of the tariff and organizational studies. The
problem in making the institutional changes proposed in the latter study has
been a lack of political consensus on a reorganization of the sector. This is
understandable. Since there is an ongoing dialogue on this and other matters,
overall performance of the Borrower is rated satisfactory.



Proiect Relationshils
41.       The relationship of Bank staff with national, local and municipal
government officials as well as with consultants working in the sector has
always been very good. This project was no exception.
Performance of Consultants
42.       The feasibility studies and detailed engineering for this project
were satisfactorily carried out by consultants financed under the Bank's First
Water Supply Project. Because of the complex engineering required for the
project, MOC, on the advice of the Bank, appointed an independent review panel
of international experts to review the designs and provide technical advise.
This panel played a key role in reviewing the designs and contributed to the
success of the physical implementation. The consultants who prepared the
project designs were subsequently employed to supervise construction, which
was performed satisfactorily and in a timely manner.
Performance of Suppliers and Contractors.
43.       All suppliers and contractors performed well and completed
deliveries on schedule.
Prolect Documentation and Data.
44.       The project documentation and data were satisfactory.
Conclusions and Lessons Learned
45.       The physical components of the project were timely and well
designed, and execution was excellent.
46.       There are two lessons to be learned from this project.  First, good
project design is crucial to the successful and timely implementation of the
related physical components. Use of design panels for large, complex projects
is likely to improve the projects (para. 15). Second, actions by mature
Governments on politically sensitive policy changes with respect to
reorganizations and tariffs are apt to come slowly, and the best role the Bank
can play is to encourage and advise.

METROPOLITAN REGION WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (LOAN 2491-KO)
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWERS PERSPECTIVE 1/
Evaluation of the Bank's Performance and Lessons Learned
1.        Bank staff had considerable experience in the sector and were
recognized as professionals in all respects. All mission members had the
appropriate skills for both the preparation and supervision of the project.
Since this was the third project in the sector, the Bank and Borrower,
represented by the government officials and the engineering consultants,
worked very smoothly both in procurement and in implementation. Technical
inputs from Bank professionals in contract packaging and specialized matters,
such as cathodic protection, surge control and operation of large pumping
stations, were especially appreciated.
2.        The timing between missions (both full supervision missions and
those as part of another related mission) was adequate. There were no
significant delays caused by mission timing. There were changes in some
mission members, but all of the staff were experienced in the sector, and
there were no major problems on this account. There were also changes in
government officials, but this too did not affect the project. Communications
between the Bank and Borrower were satisfactory. The major lesson learned is
that the somewhat greater time spent in thorough project preparation resulted
in smooth implementation, without any major design changes.
Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
3.        The engineering consultants' staff performed satisfactorily and
increased their construction management skills. The Ministry of Construction
and the engineering consultants effectively organized the construction team
into four offices (one for each contract) and a main field office to avoid
major delays in construction.  The physical facilities as originally defined
were almost 90% completed by the original closing date of December 31, 1989.
Both of the treatment plants were working satisfactorily, and 70% of the
additional population served under the project were receiving water supply by
early 1989. The delay of one year in the closing date to December 31, 1990
therefore did not result in any delay in achieving the project benefits. The
principal reasons for the delay were that: i) permission for crossing the
Seoul-Pusan main railway line took longer than expected; ii) extension of the
Song-Pyeongtaek line was added to the project during implementation; and
iii) land acquisition problems had to be resolved on this line. The project
was built well within the original cost estimate, and more than US$5.0 million
of the Bank loan was canceled at the Government's request since these funds
were available locally.

ANNEX 3
Construction Progress
General
1.        The Metropolitan Region Water Supply Project (3rd stage) was scheduled
to be completed by the end of 1989, but the completion was delayed by one year,
and the closing date of that loan amount was extended to the end of 1990.
Construction progress of the four lots giving reasons for delays in discussed
below.
Lot No. 1
2.        The intake facility works, civil works, architectural works, sanitary
facilities works and electrical works were completed, and the transmission piping
works and tunnelling works were already completed and raw water supplied beginning
November 1988. This lot was completed on December 26, 1988 as scheduled.
Lot No. 2
3.        The construction works for this lot except the Kyeongbu-railroad
crossing section were almost completed by the middle of November of 1988 and raw
water was supplied to the Anyang area. The raw water supply to Inchon area was
commenced from June 15, 1989 because the works of the Kyeongbu-railroad crossing
section was incomplete due to discussions with the Korean Rail Road Office. Other
appurtenant facilities works were completed in time and Lot No. 2 was completed on
August 30, 1989.

complete except for about 518 m in the section of Songtan and Pyeongtack City
boundary. Water supply was commenced during October of 1988; the connection to
the city boundary of Songtan was made available during December of 1988. The
pipeline section of about 518 m section at the Songtan and Pyeongtack city
boundary, was part of a road expansion project, and was delayed due to the acqui-
sition of land and discussions with the executing office of road construction.
This lot was completed on December 20, 1989.
Lot No. 4
5.        Euijungboo system water supply facilities were commission in early
November 1987, operating from the Emergency Intake Station, and 30,000 CMD of
treated water was supplied to the Euijungboo City. The Han-River crossing
pipeline works were completed, and accordingly, the supply of raw water from
Paldang Intake Station was commenced from December of 1988 to the Water Treatment
Plant. A quantity of 100,000 CMD of treated water was supplied, by the water
treatment plant. The control and instrumentation facilities works in the water
treatment plant were installed and this lot was completed on December 29 1988.
Lot No. 4-1
6.        The Han-River crossing pipeline works comprising, 1,9233.3 m of pipeline
(D-1,200-1,650 m) and seven valve chamber were installed and protection works of
wire cylinders provided. This lot was completed on December 26, 1988.
