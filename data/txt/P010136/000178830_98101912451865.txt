PAKISTAN
FOURTH CREDIT FOR THE AGRtICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
I. THE SECTOR
A. Agriculture in Pakistan
1.01      The Islamic Republic of Pakistan covers some 197' M ac (80 M ha).
Because of a mainly arid climate, only 47.5 M ac are cultivable; of these
33.6 M ac are irrigated, mainly within the Indus River system, the biggest
single irrigation system in the world. The current populattion of about 76 M
is growing at an annual rate of about 3%.  Since 1947, per capita output has
risen at about 1.5% per year, reaching about US$190 (at 1975-77 prices), leav-
ing Pakistan one of the poorest countries in the world. T'hus, the Govern-
ment of Pakistan's (GOP) development plans in recent years have been geared
to increasing production in order to create additional employment opportuni-
ties and to alleviate poverty.
1.02      Agriculture is the mainstay of Pakistan's economy.  It accounts
for about 35% of GNP, employs about 60% of the labor force and, directly and
indirectly, produces nearly two-thirds of Pakistan's export earnings, prin-
cipally from cotton and rice. Since establishment of the State in 1948 GOP
has introduced a wide range of programs to stimulate agricultural production.
These have included as targets: accelerating the development of irrigation;
reclaiming saline and waterlogged areas; introducing high yielding varieties
of wheat and rice; increasing the use of fertilizers through both importing
and expanding local production; extending the use of pesticides; developing
a seed industry; and, most recently, improving agricultural extension services.
1.03      As a consequence of these programs agricultural production has
increased. Wheat production has doubled since the mid-sixties, and rice
production since 1967. Despite this progress agricultural production and pro-
ductivity are well below achievable needs and farm incomes are much lower than
should be feasible (lower for example than in several other South Asia
countries) given the overall availability of irrigation water and the rela-
tively favorable climate and soils. Thus production of wheat, the staple
foodgrain, has not kept pace with population growth and wheat imports averag-
ing over one million metric tons annually have been required in recent years.
The 1977/78 wheat crop 1/ was a partial failure due to disease attack. As a
consequence, wheat import requirements for 1978/79 rose to 2.5 million tons,
however production recovered in 1978/79 and exceeded past production levels.
Agricultural annual growth during the period 1974-77 was only about 1.9%.
This contrasts with 3% annual growth during 1971-74 and nearly 6% in the
1960s. Action is needed in many areas if past strong growth is to be
regained. A Bank Agricultural Sector Review mission in 1976 2/ identified

June.

the following to be of particular importance: improvement of agricultural
research; redevelopment of water courses and associated improvements in water
management to make better use of existing irrigation water supplies; improved
supplies of high quality seed; solution of problems of salinity, waterlogging
and drainage; and the development of effective agricultural extension services.
Also needed are incentive pricing policies; increased use of fertilizers and
pesticides; provision of more farm power, and more and better directed agri-
cultural credit. The Bank and GOP have discussed these issues in the context
of the sector report as well as in that of a paper 1/ prepared by the Bank
on the 1978 wheat crisis. The latter stressed the need for better coordina-
tion and cooperation between the Government departments responsible for the
agricultural sector at both Federal and Provincial levels.
1.04      A start has been made in the process of policy adjustment.  Import-
antly, Government intends to give more responsibility to the private sector
in input supply, marketing and processing. Thus, the agricultural processing
industries, except for the vegetable oil industry, have been denationalized.
Plans for increasing the supply of fertilizer, certified seed and pesticides
are being implemented with financial support from IDA and other donors and
the private sector has been given a greater role in the production process,
sale and distribution. Also, with IDA support, GOP is improving agricultural
extension services and USAID has helped GOP initiate water course and water
management improvement programs. Although the latter are on a small scale,
prospects of rapid expansion in the next few years appear good. The agricul-
tural research system is being reviewed with the goal of major reforms, an
exercise in which IDA is participating; and agricultural prices have been
examined and in many cases adjusted upwards. Procurement prices for major
crops are now much closer to world prices than before and differentials
reflect more fully the relative values of different products to the national
economy. Finally, a review of Government investment and related priorities
was undertaken in the context of preparing the revised Fifth Plan, 1978/79
to 1982/83. The plan recognizes the limitations of resources available to
Pakistan and the need to redirect the pattern of economic development away
from large public industry and other long gestation projects towards quick
yielding investments in the agricultural and social sectors.
1.05      A main goal of the Fifth Plan is to accelerate agricultural growth,
in particular to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains 2/ and to expand rev-
enues from agricultural exports. To meet these targets the Plan envisages,
and GOP is attempting, an integrated effort to modernize agriculture and
increase agricultural productivity. It is clear that to achieve this will
require major improvements in the agencies responsible for supporting agricul-
ture. Not least, such improvement is required in the agricultural credit
1/   September 20, 1978.
2/   Although an overall foodgrain shortage exists, Pakistan has a steady
export trade in the high quality Basmati variety of rice. This commands
a high price, e.g. in 1978 the fob price of Basmati rice exports was
about $340/ton compared with $135/ton cif for wheat imports. Annual
exports of Basmati rice have been about 700 thousand MT over the last
three years.



sub-sector, in particular to provide smaller farmers with the means to install
or improve on-farm irrigation facilities, to overcome the draft power shortage,
and to make other desirable and economically viable capital investments. The
project appraised in this report is designed to facilitate such an improvement.
The project would be the fourth IDA operation in support of agricultural credit
in Pakistan. The earlier operations were successful in economic terms overall
and in financial terms at the farm level. They failed, however, to bring about
the consolidation of ADBP as a sound, viable and autonomous development Bank
as envisaged at appraisal and had limited impact on small farm productivity
(see Chapters IV and IX). The proposed new project would pay particular
attention to institution building including the introduction of policies and
procedures designed, to take full account, inter alia, of the potential social
consequences of different lending policies. The proposed project would supple-
ment a number of ongoing and planned Bank Group projects in Pakistan, in
particular the Punjab and Sind Agricultural Extension projects which should
stimulate the demand for credit; the salinity control and reclamation projects
which will stimulate on-farm developments financed by credit; and future water
management projects now in the planning stage.
B. Agricultural Credit in Pakistan
1.06      A 1976 survey 1/ made by GOP of a major farming district in Punjab
Province indicated that relatives, friends, commission agents and money-lenders
provided some 80% of the agricultural credit used by farmers. Since then,
institutional credit has played an increasing role and the relative importance
of non-institutional credit has declined. However, despite the growth in
institutional credit volume, probably more than 70% of all agricultural credit
is still provided from non-institutional sources.
1.07      In 1965/66 institutional credit for agriculture in Pakistan amounted
to Rs 137.8 M. By 1967/68, following establishment of the Agricultural Devel-
opment Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) this had more than doubled to Rs 387.3 M. The
next major development was the entry of the nationalized commercial banks (CB)
into agricultural lending in 1972/73. By 1977/78 annual institutional lending
for agriculture had reached Rs 1.9 billion, of which about Rs 1.2 billion or
65% was disbursed as seasonal credi-t (loans repayable within 12 months) and
the remainder as medium and long-term loans.
1.08      The Fifth Five Year Plan proposes to achieve and maintain an annual
lending target of Rs 3.35 billion cluring the Plan period of which about 50%
would be for development lending. There is little doubt that this target
could be achieved given the liquidity of the CB, GOP's ability to require CB
to increase their involvement in the agricultural sector, and GOP's determin-
ation to expand ADBP activities. 'The plan envisages CB supplying 44% and ADBP
39% of the annual Rs 3.35 billion.

-4-
1.09      The principal agricultural credit institutions are the Federal Bank
for Cooperatives (FBC) and the four Provincial Cooperative Banks; the Agri-
cultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP); and the Commercial Banks (CB).
Lending targets for these institutions are set by the Agricultural Credit
Department (ACD) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and are reviewed by
the National Credit Consultative Council. ACD subsequently monitors the
performance of the institutions in achieving these targets.
Agriculture Credit Department of the State Bank
1.10      All institutional agricultural credit operations are coordinated
by the Agriculture Credit Department (ACD) of the State Bank. It is headed
by a Director assisted by a staff of 25. ACD has three Regional Offices--
at Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta. Its functions include assessment of credit
requirements and establishment of lending targets for FBC, ADBP and CB;
evaluation of the achievements of agricultural credit institutions against
performance targets; and the inspection of ADBP and FBC. The Director of
ACD is a member of the Boards of ADBP and FBC.
Federal Bank for Cooperatives and Provincial Cooperative Banks
1.11      The Federal Bank for Cooperatives was established in October 1976.
It is Government owned with a paid up capital of Rs 200 M (85% GOP, 15%
Provincial Governments). The role of FBC is to support lending to members of
agricultural cooperatives through refinancing loans made by the four Provin-
cial Cooperative Banks (PCB) to their constituent cooperatives. PCB lending
in 1977/78 amounted to Rs 169.4 M, equivalent to 9% of all institutional lend-
ing for agriculture in that year; all of this lending was in the form of sea-
sonal credits. The management, administration and financial condition of
all PCB are weak, but cooperative development is a Provincial subject under
Pakistan's constitution and FBC, which is a Federal Institution, is having
considerable difficulty in promoting reforms in the Provincial cooperative
movements. For this reason FBC cannot use all the funds it has available
for refinance and in 1977/78 had 35% of its investment portfolio in interest-
bearing call accounts. The small volume of FBC/PCB lending, and their con-
centration on seasonal credit make them a relatively insignificant element
in the overall agricultural credit picture. Any change in this situation
which would involve major reforms in the cooperative systems of the four
Provinces is unlikely in the short run.
Commercial Banks
1.12      The CB 1/ which operate through a network of 6,334 offices were
nationalized in 1972 and since then have become increasingly important in the
agriculture sector. In large part, this has been a consequence of GOP estab-
lishing mandatory targets for CB lending in the sector.
1/   The five CB involved in agricultural credit are Allied; Habib; Muslim
Commercial; National; and United.



1.13      The CB have substantial resources; deposits increased in 1977/78 by
some 24% to Rs 48.7 billion of which time deposits amounted to Rs 23.0 billion.
Thus, CB are very liquid 1/ in financial terms and have faced few difficulties
in increasing the volume of their agricultural lending from Rs 85.2 M in
1972/73 to Rs 1,281.8 M, or 68% of all agricultural lending, in 1977/78.
However, 66% of their lending in 197 7/78 was for seasonal lending; and only
Rs 430.3 M for medium and long-term development operations compared with
ADBP's Rs 385.8 M lending for these Latter purposes in the same period.
Additionally, the figure of Rs 430.3 M encompasses credit for marketing and
other commercial activities in the agricultural sector and which may not have
a direct production impact. Also given the strong commercial orientation
of its operations, CB lending for agriculture tend to focus on larger farmers
and for relatively financially risk free investments. 2/ Despite the strong
growth in CB lending for agriculture, agricultural lending remains a relatively
unimportant part of the CB's activities. In 1977/78 CB lending for agriculture
accounted for 2.6% of all CB lending and indications are that recoveries are
in the range of 40 to 50%.
Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan
1.14      The history, terms of reference, and performance of the wholly Gov-
ernment owned Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) are described
in some detail in Chapter II. ADBP was established in 1961] to expand the
activities of its predecessor organizations. These were established to provide
the institutional credit, in particular medium and long-term credit for on-
farm capital investments that was not being made available from either the
commercial or cooperative banking sectors. In 1977/78 ADBP provided some 22%
(Rs 430.5 M) of all institutional agricultural credit of which Rs 385.8 M or
90% comprised medium or long-term credits.
1.15      Given the orientation of the CBs on the safer larger farmers and
the weakness of the Cooperative Banking System, ADBP emerges as the agency
having the greatest potential to provide expanded agricultural credit serv-
ices to smaller farmer.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT BANK OF PAKISTAN
A. Organization and Management
2.01       The Agricultural Development Bank Ordinance No. IV of 1961 estab-
lished ADBP by merging the Agricultural Development Finance Corporation and
the Agricultural Bank of Pakistan, founded in 1952 and 1956 respectively.
1/   To an extent where they are reported to discourage deposits.
2/   Two of the CB operate relatively small supervised creidit schemes for
small farmers. While probably these will grow in size they are
unlikely to assume a significant role in CB lending for agriculture
under present CB policies.



-6-
ALBP is wholly Government-owned with GOP owning 98% and the Provincial Gov-
ernments 2% of the current paid-up capital of Rs 232.5 M. The Bank is ad-
ministered by a 12 member Board. The Chairman is the Chief Executive and
is appointed by GOP. The other members include representatives of GOP's
Ministries of Finance and Agriculture; the Agriculture Credit Department of
the State Bank; and the Ministries of Agriculture of each of the Provincial
Coverninents. In addition, GOP appoints four members from the public agricul-
tural sector, on the advice of the Provincial Governments.
2.02      Traditionally, the Chairman has been selected from among civil
servants. In October 1978, however, GOP engaged the ex head of a leading
Commercial Bank as Chairman. The present incumbent in his previous capacity,
was responsible for many innovations in lending for agriculture. The ADBP
supervised credit scheme is based on one established by the National Bank
under his personal direction.
Operational Structure
2.03      ADBP conducts its operations through a network of 118 branches and
51 sub-branches. Operational units are grouped into 17 regions with overall
supervision and control resting with Regional Managers.
2.04      The branch is the key operational unit; it entertains loan appli-
cations, evaluates them, sanctions them and makes disbursements and loan
recoveries. It is the administrative center for the maintenance of loan,
deposit and expenditure accounts. Branch Managers have a wide variety of
functions that include the promotion of Bank services and the sanctioning
of loans. Until a reorganization that took place in February 1979, Branch
Managers were responsible both to their Regional Manager, as well as to
various head office departments. Numerous problems of conflicting loyalties
and priorities arose from this but the situation has since been corrected
in the course of a reorganization program, designed with the aid of British
financed management consultants. The objective of the reorganization is to
strengthen the regional offices. The consultants are continuing their work
and at negotiations assurances were obtained that the management and train-
ing consultants would be employed until at least December 1980, and that a
loan appraisal specialist be employed by December 31, 1979 until at least
December 31, 1980.
2.05      Total staff strength is 3,343, over 75% of whom serve in the branches.
Some 195 members of the staff belong to the managerial grade, with 205 in the
lower supervisory grade. Appointments to the managerial level are 60% by
promotion and 40% by direct external recruitment. Direct appointees and most
promotees are graduates. Rates of staff remuneration are now comparable with
those paid by CB, and gradually CB fringe benefits are being introduced. The
new Chairman, clearly drawing from his own CB experience of effective staff
motivation, has been instrumental 'in these developments.
2.06      Headquarters.  With the reorganization of February 1979, ADBP
requires no basic organizational changes at headquarters. The reorganization
was based on proposals endorsed by IDA, and submitted by the management
consultants. In the reorganization three main changes were made: creation



- 7 -
of an Operations Division, a Credit Division, and an Agricultural Technology
and Technical Assistance Division. Charts 1 and 2 compare the organization
of ADBP pre- and post-February 1979. The Director of Operations, in charge
of the Operations Division, reports clirectly to the Chairman and has respon-
sibility for top level direction, coordination and control of regional and
branch offices. This single clearly defined operational chain of command
replaces the previous arrangement of multiple and separate links between head
office departments and the branches. The Credit Division, under a Director,
comprises three departments: Project Loan, Supervised Credit, and General
Credit Departments. The Project Loan Department handles large scale "project
lending" (see para 4.05) by working directly from Headquarters. The Super-
vised Credit Department is responsib:Le for formulating the policy for, and
overseeing the operation of, ADBP's credit schemes for farmers of less than
25 ac. The General Credit Department is responsible for developing general
credit policies in the light of its continuing review of thLe progress and
efficiency of ADBP's general credit operations. The Credit Division draws
together a range of responsibilities that, prior to reorganization, were
distributed amongst a number of Headquarters departments.
2.07      Responsibilities of the Agricultural Technology aLnd Technical
Assistance Division (ATD) include the formulation of programs in farm mechani-
zation and tubewell development. For these activities, ADEP would draw upon
engineering services of specialists Einanced under the project one of whom
would be attached to the ATD. With his assistance ATD would liaise, on behalf
of ADBP, with research and development institutions such as IRRI/PAK and the
proposed Agricultural Engineering Directorate of the Agricultural Research
Council (see also para 3.18) and training institutions such as the Agricul-
tural Engineering Training Institutes (AETI). The Planning Division functions
include the preparation of the Bank's five year plan, annual plans with
individual branch targets for loaninlg and recovery, and the monitoring and
evaluation of those targets. This Division would be responisible for project
monitoring and evaluation (see para 4.27).
2.08      Supervised Credit.  The supervised credit program, which provides
both seasonal and development credit to its participants, started in 1974/75
and now operates in seven areas served by the seven regional offices for
those areas. The program covers 134 villages and 23,500 farm families. It
provides selected areas with intensive coverage of ADBP staff to help farmers
identify and prepare investment proposals, to facilitate loan making, and
subsequently to supervise closely the use of these loans.
2.09      Regional and Branch Offices.  Major changes would take place in
the ADBP field organization to permit it to undertake its new orientation
towards smaller farmers, and to improve its recovery performance. These would
include shifts in responsibilities between regional and branch offices; the
amalgamation of the present supervlsed credit program with the Bank's new
program for smaller farmers; and a switch from manual to computerized account-
ing of loan making, disbursement and recovery. The essence of the changes
would be to limit the activities of branches to the making of loans to farmers
operating holdings of 25 ac or more, and to the recovery of the branches'
outstanding loans. The service of farmers smaller than 25 ac would became
the responsibility of the regional offices, who would handle directly loans
making and recovery as under the present supervised credit program. Existing



brancn statf would be reallocated between the branches and the regional
offices wiLh the branches retaining the staff needed to make loans to larger
farmers, operations that should decline proportionally (see para 3.21), and
to    &A tuuLsLiidi1ig lc-c ns.  About half the braach staff would remain in
the branches and be equipped with motorcycles to become mobile credit recovery
offl'ers.  The remaining branch staff would be transferred to the regional
offices where, equipped with motorcycles as under the supervised credit
program, they would become mobile credit officers responsible for making and
recovering loans for farmers of less than 25 ac. This arrangement should give
emphasis to and facilitate the new ADBP policy of concentrating on the needs
of smaller farmers. ADBP believes that, within the project period, it can
serve about 1,400 villages from its existing 17 branches. To release staff
for these activities ADBP would introduce a system of mini-computers each
located at a regional office where branch and regional accounts would be
centralized. The branches would be released from time consuming manual
bookkeeping and adopt a simple computerized system for loan disbursements
and repayments. Branch financial transactions would be on a voucher system.
Copies of payment and repayment vouchers woud be sent to the 17 regional
offices by carrier on a regular basis.
Training
2.10      ADBP Staff College was established at Islamabad in July 1975 with
the objective of providing in-service training. At present, most ADBP train-
ing courses are conducted at the college.
2,11      Priority is being given to training branch managers and assistant
managers. The main activity of the college is a 12-week residential basic
training course which caters for up to 25 trainees normally comprising exist-
ing or prospective branch managers and assistant managers. Outside agencies
such as the National Institute of Public Administration and the Railway
Accounts Academy are also used for training selected ADBP personnel. By
arrangement with CBs and using funds supplied by the Banking Council, the
capacity and teaching capability of the ADBP Staff College is being enlarged
to train CB and ADBP staff. Generally the training is satisfactory but it
is focussed on banking administration and procedures and provides little
training in agricultural loan appraisal, farm planning and the preparation
of package loan programs suited to the needs of different categories of
farmers (see also para 4.24).
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
2.12      ADBP undertakes seasonal lending as well as development lending.
Seasonal lending, is for a maximum of 18 months against a lien on crops or
against surety. Medium term development loans for terms of less than 5 years
and long term development loans with terms of over five years and up to 11
years. Development loans are currently made at 11% interest and against
mortgage of land as security. Down payments of 15% are required, except for
tractors where there is a flat rate of Rs 5,000 (about 7% of the cost of the
popular 45 hp tractor), and in the case of on-farm improvements where 20% is



- 9 -
required. ADBP down payment policy tends, consequently, to favor loans for
tractors.  Medium-term loans usually are for activities such as poultry and
dairying, and long term loans for the purchase of tractors and the instal-
lation of tubewells.
2.13      Although ADBP regulations require full loan appraisal, most apprai-
sals are confined to verifying the applicant's title to land and evaluating
such land as security for the proposed loan. These procedures are facilitated
by the "Loans for Agricultural Purposes Act" of 1973 which introduced an
Agricultural Passbook system to provide the Banks an easy access to all inform-
ation pertinent to a potential loanee's ownership of agricultural land.
2.14      Under the system the potential borrower buys a set of two Passbooks
from any Post Office, one green and one red. He submits the Passbooks to the
Revenue Officer of his area who records the applicant's personal particulars--
photograph, signature/thumb impression, address, etc. and, additionally an
extract from the Record of Land Rights that gives full details of the agricul-
tural land owned by the Passbook holder. Details of outstanding loans made
against land mortgage are also recorded. The borrower takes his (green) comp-
leted Passbook (the red copy is retained by the revenue office) and his loan
application to the Bank (CB, Cooperative or ADBP) of his choice where, sub-
ject to the loan being otherwise supportable, a parcel of land valued at about
25% more than the amount of loan requested from the bank is selected as secur-
ity and entered in the Passbook. The latter subsequently is submitted to the
Revenue Department for registration of the mortgage.
2.15      The Passbook System has reduced the cost of and generally facilitated
agricultural lending processes, but at the same time it has reinforced a latent
tendency in ADBP (and more so in CB) to be more concerned with security than
the financial, economic and social merit of its lending. Under the proposed
project, farmers without land for security would be eligible for loans pro-
vided they met ADBP revised lending criteria and that the venture proposed
was financially and economically viable (see also para. 4.20 and Appendix
Schedule A).
2.16      "Emergency" Lending.  Often ADBP has been used as an instrument for
implementing welfare type programs cn behalf of GOP. These activities, parti-
cularly "Emergency" lending, generally have been incompatible with sound bank-
ing practice. "Emergency lending" has usually been undertaken after national
disasters such as flood and drought when GOP has required ADBP to carry out
extensive lending in affected areas. In these operations, ADBP has had to
disburse its own funds against the recommendation and certification of Rev-
enue Department officials and without the benefit of either proper appraisal
or security. Needless to say ADBP's record of recoveries from such emergency
loans has been poor and such lending has tended to reduce credit discipline,
impair staff motivation, and generally contribute adversely to ADBP's finan-
cial position (see also para 2.24). At negotiations assurances were obtained
from GOP that it would not require the ADBP to undertake emergency lending
except in the event of a major natural calamity and only on an agency basis
for which ADBP would receive a commission to cover expenses.

C. Scale, Purposes and Beneficiaries of ADBP Lending
2.17      The scale of ADBP lending increased steadily following establishment
of the Bank in 1961. In its first full year of operation the value of loans
made amounted to about Rs 77 M; by 1974/75 this total had grown to Rs 396 M.
In 1975/76 lending accelerated and this trend continued through 1976/77, re-
inforced in that year by Rs 133 M of emergency lending, declining markedly in
1977/78. The following tables show the scale, purpose, and beneficiaries of
ADBP lending in the indicated four year period.

2.18      Since 1975/76, ADBP operations have been dominated by lending for
tractors; this has been a consequence of a growing farm power shortage and
the relative ease in making loans for these purposes to farmers with adequate
land as security. On the other hand, the other major role of ADBP in 1960s
and the early 1970s, of financing minor irrigation, in particular tubewells,
has declined steeply as shown in the following table (see also para 5.08).

disbursements of short-term credit, including emergency lending, is indicative
that very little development lending has been made by ADBP to individuals in
these categories (see also para 3.21).

D. Performance
2.20      ADBP was established to encourage productive on-farm investments.
In this role its impact has been significant since it was nearly the only
source of institutional development credit for agriculture until 1974. In
particular, it was the primary sairce of credit for the expansion of private
tubewell development in the 1960s and early 1970s, and thLrough financing farm
mechanization has helped alleviate the farm power shortage.
Financial Operations
2.21      ADBP's sources of funds are capital contributicons from GOP and
Provincial Governments (Rs 232.5 M), borrowings from SBP including loans



- 12 -
from multi- and bilateral lending agencies that are on-lent through SBP
(Rs 1,756 M by June 1978) and deposits by customers. By June 1978, fixed
deposits amount to Rs 98.0 M, savings to Rs 29.4 M, and current accounts to
Rs 10.4 M. As discussed later, ADBP is dependent basically on its borrowings
from SBP.
2.22       ADBP equity was badly eroded by the losses of Rs 124 M sustained in
East Pakistan. Making allowance for this, equity as at June 30, 1978 stood
at Rs 130.4 M. Debt equity ratio rose from 6:1 in 1972/73 to 14:1 in 1977/78.
Since then GOP has injected Rs 75.62 M which, with a concommitant waiver of
ADBP losses in East Pakistan, restored the equity ratio to a 7:1 level at the
end of 1978.
2.23       ADBP borrows from SBP at 8%, i.e., 2% below the prevailing Bank
Rate  of 10%.  It pays interest on depositors' funds at rates from 8.5% to
13.75%, however, deposits are not a large source of funds (see para 2.21).
ADBP's cost of funds is now in the order of 7.5%. With a fixed lending rate
of 11%, ADBP has a spread of 3.5% to cover taxes, 1/ administrative expenses,
reserves, and provision for bad and doubtful debts. In 1977/78 taxes and
administrative expenses alone accounted for 23% of all interest earned, a
further 73% of interest earned was needed to cover the cost of funds, leaving
4% for all other purposes. Because of the inadequate interest spread, even
if ADBP collected all interest due, its operations would be financially
marginal. This is shown by Appendix Tables 2 and 3. In practice, unfortun-
ately, ADBP has a serious problem with overdue payments. This became critical
in 1971/72 when the recovery rate fell to below 35%. Since then recovery
campaigns have been mounted from time to time, but real progress was not made
until 1977/78 when branch lending was linked to branch recoveries. In that
year branches were permitted to make loans for only 75% of total recoveries.
Under these arrangements recoveries improved sharply to 48% in 1977/78 com-
pared with 35.5% in 1976/77. While the final rate is an improvement, it
remains far from satisfactory. The poor recovery situation has caused a
chronic cash flow problem for ADBP. The following table shows recovery
performance since 1971/72:

2.24      ADBP's existence as a vialble and effective banking and development
institution is dependent upon its a'bility to improve its recovery performance.
The individual loan appraisals that will carry out in future and its release
from obligatory emergency lending should reduce the risk of making bad loans
in future. Its history of leniency to defaulters, however, will militate
against better recovery performance in the future unless it is able to actively
pursue the collection of outstanding dues and receives the full support of GOP
and other agencies in this effort. During negotiations assurances were
obtained from GOP/ADBP that all outstanding loan accounts opened in the course
of emergency lending would be transferred to a special account and a collection
program initiated in collaboration with the District Administration. It was
agreed also that after a reasonable period of time ADBP in agreement with SBP
would write off any outstanding balance and be credited with a similar amount
in its account with SBP. The obligation for further collection efforts would
then be transferred to the District Administration.
2.25      ADBP has begun to examine the overdue accounts of its 10 branches
that have performed the worst with a view to writing-off and rescheduling bad
and doubtful debts. Under its original plans ADBP would have completed the
inventory by the end of 1981. During negotiations it was agreed that this
was too long a time span and that the end of 1980 would be a more appropriate
objective. In order to ensure an effective action program to improve revenues,
assurances were obtained that by December 31, 1979, ADBP would submit to IDA
for its concurrence a phased program to be completed by December 31, 1980 for
the examination on a branch-by-branch basis, of all overdue loans including
those extended in the course of emergency lending. Agreement was also reached
with GOP/ADBP on minimum loan recovery rates of at least 60% by July 1980, of
at least 70% by July 1981, and of at least 85% by July 1, 1982; and that ADBP
would require its branches to achieve such levels to qualify for future
lending.
2.26      ADBP's poor recovery performance is not reflected in ADBP's balance
sheet and income and expense statements shown at Appendix Tables 2 and 3.
ADBP accounts show interest income on an accrual basis i.e. whether collected
or not. Thus the income and expense statements which show increases of earned
interest of 23% in 1975/76 (Rs 127.1 M) and a further increase of 39% in 1976/
77 (Rs 176.4 M) do not reflect reall cash income.
2.27      Given the Bank's poor financial performance, in,comes have not been
sufficient to build reserves or to make provision for bad and doubtful debts.
General Reserves have remained unchanged virtually since 1972 at a negligible
Rs 4.7 M while Special Reserves rose to an unsatisfactory Rs 9.5 M in 1978.
Both GOP and ADBP are aware of the unsatisfactory level of the reserve situa-
tion and the Pakistan Public Accounts Committee has propcsed that ADBP make a
provision of Rs 41 M, equivalent to 2% of ADBP's portfolio. ADBP management
believes this is too small, and auditors have recommended an interim provision
of some Rs 170 M. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP
that by December 31, 1979 ADBP shall furnish to IDA a proposal for reaching by
July 1, 1981, adequate levels of the provision against bad and doubtful loans
and of general reserve. Assurances were also obtained that as an interim
measure, by July 1, 1980 ADBP would establish a provision against bad and



- 14 -
doubtful loans of at least Rs 170 M and that GOP would ensure that the funds
required to reach the levels of provision against bad and doubtful loans and
of general reserve are available within ADBP.
2.28       The ADBP rate of 11% for fixed agricultural investment compares
with an inflation rate of 10% in 1978 and an expected rate of 11% for 1979
and 1980. The interest rate for fixed industrial investment is also 11%, both
rates being reduced from 14% in February 1977 as an incentive for investment.
At negotiations GOP informed IDA that any upward revision of on-lending rates
is out of the question at this time of general liquidity in the banking and
private sectors (the latter reflecting the massive growth in overseas worker
remittances and rising private incomes). The GOP fears that any upward
revision would discourage private investment, a risk that it is not prepared
to take at a time when the overall investment rate is only 18% of GDP, a level
considered by GOP to be barely adequate. During negotiations however, GOP/
ADBP agreed that throughout the life of the project ADBP's on-lending rate
would not be less than 11%. This rate together with an additional 3% penal
rate in the case of default and a once and for all evaluation fee of 0.5% of
the long-term investment loans would mean a positive lending rate, given pre-
sently estimated rates of inflation for the next three years. Assurance was
also obtained from GOB that as soon as it is determined that ADBP's lending
rates are not at positive levels in real terms, it would take necessary
measures to achieve levels satisfactory to IDA. At negotiations GOP also
agreed that it would assure a 7% spread to ADBP by making all funds supplied
by SBP on-lending to ADBP at a concessional rate of 4% in place of the current
8%. A spread of 7% between ADBP borrowing and lending rates would be adequate
to cover administrative costs and permit to build up reserves. A further
assurance was obtained from GOB/ADBP that by July 1, 1982 GOB would cause
ADBP to review the spread and furnish the results of the review to IDA for
its consideration.
Accounts and Audit
2.29       Accounts and audit procedures are in line with Bank requirements.
A satisfactory annual audit of accounts as at June 30, 1978 was conducted
by commercial auditors. 1/ A team from the Agricultural Credit Department
of the Central Bank also carries out inspections periodically.
E. The Bank Group and ADBP
2.30       Between 1965 and 1976 IDA provided ADBP with US$67.0 M, in three
credits, 76-PAK, 117-PAK and 157-PAK. The first for $27 M was signed in
June 1965 and reimbursed the foreign exchange costs of tubewells ($10 M) and
farm machinery ($17 M). The second credit was a short-range bridging
operation signed in June 1968. IDA provided $10 M and the Swedish Interna-
tional Development Authority, $5 M. Negotiations chiefly centered around
1/   Messrs. Ibrahim, Shaikh and Co. and Munif Ziauddin and Co.



- 15 -
providing ADBP with a higher interest margin to enable it to operate, on a
profitable basis: an increase in ADBP's lending rate from 6% to 7% was agreed.
2.31      The third credit, 157-PAK for $30.0 H was made in 1969 and closed
in 1976. The project financed the purchase of about 8,000 tractors (63.7%
of the disbursements), 4,600 tubewells (16.3% of the disbursements), and the
balance was used for spare parts and farm management services. Most of the
funds for tractor imports were disbursed as intended; objectives for spare
parts were achieved. On the other hand, disbursements on tubewells fell
short. Disbursements were considerably prolonged, requiring a number of
closing date extensions. The Credit Agreement, consistent with the previous
two, required ADBP to cover its costs, provide for bad and doubtful debts
and to build general reserves. In financial terms ADBP was to accomplish the
foregoing by increasing its lending rate by one point, from 7% to 8%, thereby
obtaining a 4% interest spread between its lending and its borrowing rates.
This proved inadequate and combined with a worsening recovery problem led to a
progressive decline of ADBP's financial situation to the extent that a fourth
IDA operation scheduled tentatively for late 1973 was abandoned. Since that
time Credit 157-PAK has been the subject of an Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) Project Performance Audit 1/ the findings of which were summarized as
follows:  "The agricultural growth impact of the project has been positive,
and estimated ex-post economic and financial rates of return exceeded the
original estimates. However, the source of the achieved growth has been
different from original assumptions. The real production expansion of the
project is mainly attributable to the increase in the cultivated area,
assisted by tractor, and to a lessetr extent to the higher cropping intensity
based on tubewell irrigation and mechanized cultivation. Tractor use itself
resulted in little direct yield increase. A shift in the cropping pattern
also contributed to the rise in the value of output. The socio-economic
impact of tractorization under the project in the context of introduction of
intermediate mechanization (of cultivation but not harvesting operations) has
been substantially consistent with recorded experiences in other countries
such as India and may be summarized as below:
(a) while the rate of return on tractor investments was
generally satisfactory, actual increases in yields and -
cropping intensities were substantially less than fore-
cast at appraisal; and
(b) tractorization led to displacement of tenants by the
land-owner, as farm operations were concerned. However,
the aggregate demand for farm labor was not significantly
reduced because the use of tractor also created new
demands for labor."
2.32      In the face of continuilng GOP requests that the Bank appraise a
Fourth Project, IDA missions to examine ADBP and its operations visited
1/   OED report No. Sec M78-559, dated June 30, 1978, titled "Project
Performance Audit Report; Pakistan - Third Credit for Agricultural
Development Bank (Credit 157-PAK).



- 16 -
Pakistan in March 1976 and July 1977. They found ADBP's financial condition
and operational procedures extremely unsatisfactory. At IDA's urging, ADBP
took advantage of a British technical assistance grant to employ a consult-
ing firm to examine its organization, accounts and procedures. Following the
1977 mission, IDA listed in detail the reforms that ADBP should undertake if
it were to be considered for further IDA support. These included the injec-
tion of additional equity to achieve a debt/equity ratio of 7:1; the writing
off of losses incurred in East Pakistan and held against the account of ADBP,
the divesting of "emergency lending" and cutting back ADBP's annual develop-
ment lending program to about Rs 450 M to give room and time for the intro-
duction of institutional reforms.
2.33      IDA also asked ADBP to reintroduce full individual loan appraisals,
and to take steps to achieve acceptable levels of loan recoveries. It sug-
gested also that GOP treat ADBP overdues as land revenues and consequently
that ADBP staff be appointed as authorized collection agents for land revenue
and that punitive interest should be charged on overdues; introduction of
procedures for a regular follow-up of overdues was recommended as was the
gearing of branch lending to recoveries.
2.34      Concerning the question of development impact, and in line with the
OED observations, the Bank proposed that ADBP run down its credit to larger
farmers for tractors in favor of directing more of its resources to: smaller
farmers; the complementary use of minor irrigation and farm mechanization;
diversified lending; and increases in its supervised credit lending. It also
proposed that ADBP improve the technical capability of its staff, and, that
it monitor and evaluate, on a regular basis, the financial, economic and
social impact of its lending programs.
2.35      Implementation of IDA Recommendations.  GOP and ADBP have gone a
long way in implementing IDA's suggestions concerning financial and adminis-
trative reforms, for example:
(a) GOP has increased its equity in ADBP permitting the latter
to attain a debt/equity ratio of 7:1;
(b) GOP has waived liabilities of Rs 124.3 M incurred by ADBP
in East Pakistan;
(c) GOP has agreed that it would not require ADBP to undertake
emergency lending except in the event of a major natural
calamity and solely as a disbursement agent of GOP funds.
ADBP would be paid a fee for this service:
(d) ADBP cut back its lending program and reduced its seasonal
lending in 1977/78 down 75% from 1976/77 (IDA had suggested
that seasonal lending be restricted to ADBP's medium and
long term borrowers).
(e) ADBP improved its overall recovery performance by 12 percentage
points to 48% by June 1978;



.J II -
(f)  ADBP geared branch lending to recoveries with lending amount-
ing to 75.6% of recoveries in 1977/78. In contrast, during
1974/75 through 1976/77 lending exceeded recoveries by 51%,
91% and 115% respectively.
(g)  GOP has exempted ADBP from the payment of Income Tax.  As
ADBP pays a 50% tax on profits and as in pract:ice interest
is assumed to be collected, whether it is or not, this
should provide ADBP with significant financial relief.
(h)  At the recommendation of ADBP's consultants, ADBP has
started a program for rescheduling and writing-off bad
and doubtful loans with the ten worst branches nlow under
review. Up to 1977/78 ADBP had written off a total of
Rs 5.35 M. An exercise carried out on an ad hoc basis
by Regional Managers in September 1978 indicated that
some Rs 62.3 M represented irrecoverable loans.
2.36      Given the financial and administrative reforms already made by ADBP
and those additional changes that are conditions of the IDA credit proposed
in this report, ADBP's future financial stability appears reasonably well
assured. Measures for enhancing ADPB's development role in particular in-
creased lending for small farmers, have also been accepted by GOP/ADBP.
Thus, the project appraised in this report has as one objective of increas-
ing the development impact of ADBP and, in particular, the proportion of its
lending directed to smaller farmers. It takes account of lessons learnt in
previous ADBP projects especially these recorded in the Project Completion
and Project Performance Audit Reports for Credit 157-PAK.
III. PROJECT AREA AND PROJECT BENEFICIARIES
A. General
3.01      The project would be undertaken countrywide.  It would cover all
areas now served by ADBP branches. The coverage of these is adequate in
areas of high agricultural potential.
3.02      The cultivated area of Pakistan is about 47.5 M ac of which 33.5 M
ac are irrigated. Cropping intensity in irrigated areas is about 99%. Of
14 M ac cultivated under rainfed (barani) conditions, about 10 M ac are cropped
annually with a cropping intensity of about 71%. Cropping intensity in irri-
gated areas could be increased substantially if better use of irrigation
water supplies were made.
3.03      The principal crops are wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane, which
were sown on a total of 26.7 M ac (62% of the cropped area) in 1977/78.  In
terms of cultivated area, fodder is a very important crop. Sown both in the
rabi and kharif seasons it accounts for about 7 M ac or about 16% of the
cropped area and is mostly used to sustain Pakistan's draft bullock popula-
tion which provides the bulk of farm power. The most important rabi crops



- 18 -
are wheat and fodder; for the kharif season they are rice or cotton, depend-
ing on local climatic and soil conditions. Irrigation practices and cropping
intensities vary widely between the country's different agro-climatic zones.
Where double cropping is practiced the two principal rotations are wheat/
cotton and wheat/rice.
3.04       The following table, which is based on the Agricultural Census of
1972, shows farm size distribution in Pakistan, viz,

3.05       About 42% of holdings are owner operated, 24% are farmed by owners
who rent additional land (owner-cum-tenant) and the remaining 34% are farmed
by tenants (Appendix, Table 6). Sharecropping, the most common type of lease,
is usually based on a 50-50 sharing of the crop. Under the 1972 reforms 1/
landlords are responsible for paying land revenue and water charges, and for
providing housing. The costs of fertilizer and agro-chemicals are shared
equally and tenants meet all tillage costs. The 1972 land reforms also make
provision for better security of tenure of tenants.
3.06       Despite apparently favorable soil, water and climatic conditions
yield and production levels are low. For example the average wheat yield of
about 18 maunds per acre is only about 65% of the achieved in neighboring
irrigated areas in India; and cotton yields only about 25% of what would be
a reasonable yield figure. These low yields are reflected in low farm in-
comes, as discussed in para 3.20. Any significant increases in production
and productivity appear dependent upon the completion of the reforms of the
institutions engaged in supporting agriculture, some of which are underway
as improvements in water management and alleviation of the farm power shortage.
1/   These reforms set a ceiling on the individual ownership of land at 100
ac irrigated (200 ac unirrigated) per family member. Operation by an
individual or family head of all the family holdings permits, de facto,
the continued existence of large land ownership units.

B. Inputs and Support Services for Agriculture
Inputs
3.07      Irrigation.  Availability of irrigation water hags increased substan-
tially over the last decade, not least, because of the coumissioning of the
Mangla and Tarbela Dams (total reservoir capacity of 15 M ac-ft) and consider-
able investment in groundwater exploitation, both private and public. However,
because of inefficiencies in the irrigation system, it is estimated that as
much as two-thirds of the water diverted into the system for surface supplies
is lost. 1/ Because of these losses the supply of irrigation from surface
water supplies is limited and, due to unpredictable variations in these sup-
plies, considerable uncertainty exists at the farm level as to whether water
will be available at periods critical to the development of the crop. This
situation is exacerbated by the poor condition of commonly maintained water-
courses, and the lack of an organization that guarantees effectively each
farmers share of the available water. Seasonal fluctuations alone are sub-
stantial. Between 1963/64 and 1969/70 total annual inflows into the Indus
River system were reasonably stable at between 150 and 175 M ac-ft. In
1970/71 they fell to 133 M, remained low through 1972/73, rose to 203 M in
1973/74 and again fell to 114 M ac-ft in 1974/75 before returning to 145 M
ac-ft in 1975/76 and 1976/77. It is to counter this situation that substan-
tial private investment has been made in groundwater exploitation. About
158,000 1-1.5 cusec private tubewells, have been installed representing an
investment of some US$500 M. There is little question that the inability of
the surface irrigation system to deliver an adequate and assured supply of
water is responsible to a large part for the current very modest crop yields
achieved in Pakistan. Indeed, some farmers find an extensive system of
farming, where available water and other inputs are spread as widely as
possible, to be less risky than intensive cultivation where assured and timely
supplies of water are critical for success. Improving water management is a
complex undertaking. In Pakistan, as elsewhere in South Asia, a full con-
sensus has yet to be reached on how the problems should be tackled. However,
acceptance that water management is a problem is increasing, and the Bank,
and other donors, particularly USAID, are giving increasing importance to
water management in their programs of assistance to Pakistan. For example
IDA is financing three Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (Khairpur II,
Scarp VI, and Scarp Mardan) 21 and expects to finance additional water man-
agement projects in future years. USAID is financing watercourse development
projects in various areas of Pakistan. As the introduction of water manage-
ment improvement programs gains momentum, a substantial farmer demand for
credit for the improvement of on-farm irrigation and drainage systems should
develop.
3.08      Fertilizers and Agro-CheMicals.  Fertilizer consumption has quad-
rupled over the last decade, from 214,000 nutrient tons in 1968/69 to an expec-
ted nearly 800,000 tons in 1978/79. Fertilizers, both nitrogen and phosphate,

- 20 -
still have to be imported although by 1981 Pakistan should be self-sufficient
in nitrogenous fertilizer. 1/ By and large the value of fertilizer is well
understood by the farming community. Pesticides are employed on a significant
scale, in particular for cotton. In the case of this crop, however, much needs
to be done to improve the effectiveness of pesticide use. In the Sind exten-
sion prolnct 21 a significant component is the introduction of pest scouting
for this latter purpose.
3.09      Seeds.  As in the case of fertilizer, the value of HYV and of qual-
ity seed is well understood. Seed multiplication and distribution, all in
the hands of the Provincial Departments of Agriculture, have lagged require-
ments in terms of both quantity and quality. Two IDA 3/ financed seed corpo-
rations have been established to cope with the problem and will be producing
certified seed in significant quantity by 1982.
3.10      Farm Power.  It is widely held in Pakistan that the availability of
farm power is inadequate for the increases in cropping intensity that are
possible with current supplies of water and other inputs. Two factors in
particular contribute to this situation. First, over the last decade, the farm
labor supply in rural areas has been reduced sharply by migration of workers
to the Middle East. Second, the work oxen population (the principal source of
farm animal power) has declined substantially since 1960 on all sizes of farms.
The 1960 agricultural census showed a population of 7 M work oxen; the agricul-
tural census of 1972, 5.3 M; and the livestock census of 1976 5.6 M. On the
other hand, the number of tractors operated rose from about 15,000 in 1960 to
an estimated 58,000 in 1978.
3.11      Tractors are used on all sizes of farm.  Even as long ago as 1972
the agricultural census indicated that while only 0.8% of farms owned tractors,
17% of farms rented them and, more significantly, that 15.5% of farms less
than 12.5 ac in size rented tractors and that one in a thousand farmers with
less than 12.5 ac owned tractors.
3.12      In 1978 IRRI/PAK 4/, estimated that the present level of power input
in Pakistan's agriculture totalled 0.12 hp per acre (0.056 hp - animal power;
0.016 hp - human power; and 0.048 mechanical power) compared with a generally
recognized average need in the developing countries of 0.2 hp per acre. The
same study group concluded that taking into account renewals, 24,000 new
tractors would be required in 1979. increasing to 42,000 annually by 1982 when
the national fleet would amount to 162,000 units.

3.13      In most cases in Pakistan tractors were used, and continue to be
used, as substitutes for oxen and to draw an implement, a rigid tined culti-
vator, that prepares a seed bed that produces yields similar to those of seed
beds prepared by traditional methods. An exception is wheat where timing of
planting is critical and the planting period coincides with a sharp peaking
of power demand. Availability of a tractor at this time permits yield gains
at about 15%. 1/ Increases additional to this can be obtained by using more
sophisticated implements that improve the seed bed or permit more accurate
placement of seed and agro-chemicals.
3.14      The Indus Basin Research Assessment Group 2/ has derived material
from the 1972 Census of Agriculture that shows that farmers using tractors,
either owned or rented, achieve a higher cropping intensity than those who
use work oxen, and that increases in intensity are highest where water is
in regular supply, for example in areas served by tubewells. On such areas
that comprise about 20% of the irrigated area, gains in cropping intensity
as a consequence of mechanization are very substantial.
3.15      Presently tractors are nc,t manufactured in Pakistan and manufacture
is not envisaged to start until 1982 at the earliest.  Tractors and farm
machinery were placed on the free import list in early 1979.   Prior to this
there were two channels of import. The Pakistan Tractor Corporation (PTC)
which had a virtual monopoly of imports and expatriate Pakistanis who were
encouraged to export tractors to Pakistan through private channels. PTC
imports farm implements and four makes of tractors Massey-Ferguson, Fiat,
Ford, and Byelarus. There is a 15%' import duty on the CIF value of imported
tractors or CKD kits. The popular 45 hp model retails for about Rs 64,000
(US$6,400); roughly the price that an American farmer pays for the same type
of equipment. PTC has a chain of service stations but many repairs are
carried out by village mechanics. It is expected that with the liberation
of imports private dealers setting up distribution and repair facilities
will be substantially increased.
Services
3.16      Agricultural Research.  Carried out by both Fedieral and Provincial
agencies, agricultural research in Pakistan has failed tc, keep pace with the
needs of the sector. GOP is aware of this and with assistance from USAID
has been strengthening its Agricultural Research Council (ARC). Measures to
improve the ARC, including a substantial increase in its autonomy and the
establishment of a central Agricultural Research Institute have been approved.
1/   World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 210 states in para 5.22.  " ..... It is
only with Mexipak wheat, (the then available high yielding wheat variety)
where yields rose to a greater extent than did fertilizer use, that one
might argue that mechanized production seems to have been associated with
any direct output benefits..." (High yielding wheat varieties now account
for about 72% of Pakistan wheat acreage).

Later this year a joint Pakistan and Bank team force will review the overall
agricultural research situation with the objective of preparing a blueprint
for the reorganization and re-vitalization of the research effort, and iden-
tifying investment projects in research.
3.17      Extension.  While research has lagged, there are many cultural
practices that farmers could adopt profitably. To improve the situation
the Governments of Sind and Punjab have developed with IDA assistance proj-
ects designed to improve the effectiveness of the extension systems of the
two Provinces. Credit 813-PAK finances the introduction of the T&V system
in the Punjab, where, it is expected, about 20% of farmers will be the sub-
ject of the improved system by 1983. Credit 922-PAK finances a project
that aim to provide a T&V system to 25% of Sind farmers by 1984. Follow-up
Drojects aiming at providing an improved extension service for all farmers
in Pakistan are under preparation.
3.18      Farm Mechanization Research and Development.  Both Federal and State
Governments are concerned with farm mechanization research and development.
Currently ARC is establishing an Agricultural Engineering Research Institute
which will take over much of ongoing testing and development work. Such on-
going work includes that carried out under the IRRI/PAK joint program. This
concentrates on the machinery needs of smaller farmers. At the Faisalabad
(Punjab) Agricultural Engineering Training Institute a testing unit under the
Punjab Ministry of Agriculture is giving priority to the testing of imported
tractors in the 25-30 hp range that could be suitable for smaller farmers.
Similar tractor testing activities are also undertaken by the Tando Jam (Sind)
University. ADBP itself proposes to establish a small farm technology devel-
opment fund to be operated by ADBP, with participation from ARC and IRRI/PAK,
that would be used for the provision of grants for the identification, testing
into field conditions, and the promotion of the use and manufacture in Pakistan
of promising equipment for small farmers.
3.19      Little work has been done, or is underway, on the effectiveness of
different types of cultivations on yields. For example, the most common culti-
vation implement is a rigid tined cultivator that in terms of soil cultivation
produces results similar to those of the traditional plow. The Indus Basin
Economic Survey (1978) conducted by the Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA) indicates that only one tractor in three uses any other than a fixed
tined cultivator. Yet, in other countries with similar soil conditions signifi-
cant yield increases have resulted from, for example, deep cultivation using
disc or chisel plows that break up the plow plan that develops following years
of shallow cultivation. The technique has never been evaluated thoroughly in
Pakistan. In the same way techniques such as inter-row cultivation, fer-
tilizer placement, and precision seed drilling could have very beneficial
results but have been neither tested nor promoted in Pakistan. Work is needed
to determine how to optimize the use of tractors. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained that research programs involving the use of smaller
tractors and comparisons of traditional tillage, simple mechanization
(typically 6-8 passes with a rigid tined cultivator set to work 3-4 in. deep),
and treatments involving fewer and deeper cultivations with implements such as
chisel and disc plows would be started. GOP,agreed that by December 31, 1979
its Agricultural Research Council would submit to IDA and IFAD proposals for



- 23 -
carrying out such basic trials of the value of different mechanized techniques
and that following agreement on the program it would be initiated by July 1,
1980.
C. Project Beneficiaries
3.20       GOP defines small farmers as those operating 25 ac or less, and
subsistence farmers as those operating 12.5 ac or less.  The farm models at
Chapter VI indicate that in irrigated areas where cropping intensity averages
about 110%, the income of owner/operator farmers ranges from about Rs 7,000
in the case of the 12.5 ac farm to about Rs 14,000 in the case of the 25
ac farm. In comparison with nationial average per capita incomes of US$190
in Pakistan farm family member per capita incomes range from about Rs 1,050
(US$105) in the case of 12.5 ac farmers to Rs 1,750 (US$175) in the case of
25 ac farmers. The income of share croppers/tenants is approximately 60% of
these levels.
3.21      All farm operators, whose principal occupation is in, and whose
income is mainly derived from agricultural pursuits, would be eligible for
ADBP loans. Special procedures wouLd be adopted, however, to ensure that
smaller farmers benefited to a greater extent than in the past (see para
2.19). Thus, assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP during negotiations
that in terms of the amount of all medium- and long-term loans made by ADBP,
(excluding special project lending which will not exceed 10% of portfolio),
about 50% would be made to operators of less than 25 ac in the first year of
the project, and that this proportion would increase to at. least 60% in the
second year and to at least 75% thereafter; and that at least one third of
the amount of lending to farmers of less than 25 ac, in each fiscal year
would be made to farmers operating less than 12.5 ac.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. General
4.01       The project would finance, through loans made by ADBP, medium- and
long-term agricultural investments--largely in farm mechanization and minor
irrigation--but also in other economic activities such as land improvement,
canal lining, and livestock including work oxen. Through the project the
direction of ADBP lending would switch progressively from its traditional
focus on larger farmers to focus on smaller farmers. Thus, within the three
project years, only about 37% of all ADBP development lencding, compared with
near 90% in recent years, would finance farmers operating holdings of more
than 25 ac. To facilitate this change, and permit tenant farmers to become
ADBP's customers, the requirement that ADBP investment credits be secured by
land mortgage would be removed (see para 4.20). The project would have the
substantial institution building characteristics being designed to enhance
the development impact of ADBP and to improve its financial and administra-
tive efficiency. The former would be achieved by the adoption of full loan



- 24 -
appraisal involving assessment of the financial, economic, and social impact
of loans made; by paying particular attention to the needs of smaller farmers
and amending procedures to facilitate the making of loans to this group; and
by Ljite acLive promtotion of technologies appropriate to the needs of different
categories of farmers and agro-ecological conditions. The improvements in
financial performance and administration would be achieved by continuing with
the reforms and reorganization now underway and introducing additional measures
to improve efficiency. One of the most important would be to modify its field
organization to effectively serve small farmers.
4.02      The project would span approximately the three ADBP fiscal years
1979/80 through 1981/82. The institution building components of the project
would be implemented in accordance with scheduling agreed with GOP and ADBP.
4.03      The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has made
a credit of US$30 M to finance the ADBP lending program over the same period
(see para 4.14). IDA would contribute in parallel with IFAD towards the cost
of development lending. Additionally, the IFAD credit will finance ADBP's
seasonal lending; the costs of improving the Provincial Agricultural Engineer-
ing Training Institutes (AETI); the employment of internationally recruited
experts and the costs of office equipment and transportation for ADBP loan
supervisors.
B. Detailed Features
The IDA Project Features
4.04      The proposed IDA credit (see financing plan at para. 5.02) would
finance a proportion of the costs of ADBP loans made for the following pur-
poses:
Minor irrigation         tubewells, lowlift pumps, and other
minor irrigation equipment;
Farm mechanization       tractors, tillage implements, threshers,
drilling rigs and other farm equipment;
On-farm development      land levelling, canal and drain construc-
tion and lining, storage, and tree plant-
ing and similar activities; and
Livestock                dairy cattle, work oxen, poultry and
other farm livestock.
4.05      Other ADBP lending would be excluded from IDA financing; specifically
excluded would be:
Seasonal lending         inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and
seed; and
Special Project          large loans for purposes such as the processing
lending                 of agricultural commodities and for the manu-
facture of farm equipment.



- 25 -
4.06      Minor Irrigation.  Minor irrigation loans would be made for tube-
wells, lift pumps and flow wells. Such investments would help GOP achieve
its goals of supplementing deficient surface water supplies and installing
horizontal drainage to alleviate waterlogging and reduce the danger of
salinization. Tubewells would be in the yield capacity range of 0.25 cfs
to 1.0 cfs. They would be either diesel powered or electrically energized.
Presently, there is an acute shortage of such small-sized high speed diesel
engines. They are not manufactured locally and would have to be imported.
Assurances were obtained from GOP that the import of such engines would be
facilitated. Pakistan should be able to produce these engines domestically
when a sufficiently large demand is established.
4.07      In the case of tubewells, items financed, would include excavation
of pit and pump bases; drilling, strainer, coir, coarse sand pack, centrifugal
pump and diesel engine or electric motor, delivery pipe and discharge box,
installation and testing, transportation of the equipment, pumphouse, and
transformer and connection in the caLse of electric tubewells. Tubewells would
be drilled by hand or by using a sand bailer powered by a diesel engine. Pri-
vate contractors with the skills and equipment needed for such work are readily
available and the AED of the four provinces also provide such a service. The
cost of diesel tubewells is expected to vary from Rs 26,000 for 1 cfs, to
about Rs 14,600 for 0.25 cfs and that of electrically energized tubewells
between Rs 30,500 for the 1 cfs and about Rs 12,000 for the 0.25 cfs.
Detailed cost estimates of typical tubewell installations are shown in
Appendix Tables 37, 38.
4.08      Lift pumps financed under the project would comprise a pump and
engine combination suitable for pumping from open wells or any other surface
water source. Such sets cost about one-half the price of a tubewell of the
same capacity. It is estimated that the average lift pump used would yield
about 0.75 cfs and cost about Rs 20,000. Flow wells financed under the proj-
ect would be improvements on the traditional animal powered Persian wheel and
consist of an endless chain of small rubber cups spaced about 18 inches apart.
4.09         Neither ADBP nor CB have attempted to develop areas of concentra-
tion for minor irrigation. There are few cases where, in collaboration with
provincial Agricultural Engineering Departments (AED) and other appropriate
agencies such as WAPDA, which is responsible for rural electrification, areas
of high groundwater potential have been identified and inltensified subsidy/
loaning campaigns have been aimed at individuals, groups and cooperatives.
Rather the banks have dealt with individual customers and relied on the
customer to make the initial approach. Under the project such collaborative
efforts would be promoted. As a development agency ADBP would be engaged in
this type of activity--both on its own account and in collaboration with the
CB. During negotiations the introduction of this type of development lending
was discussed with ADBP (see para 4.22). Assurances were also obtained during
negotiations that for its borrowers, ADBP would act as an authorized agent of
federal and provincial Government schemes for groundwater development, as well
as for other agricultural investmerLt incentive schemes in order to simplify
procedures for farmers.



- 26 -
4.10      Farm Mechanization.  Mechanization loans would be made for tractors
and cultivation implements and equipment such as threshers. Machinery so
financed would alleviate a serious farm power shortage and, in the case of
planters, fertilizer drills, inter-row cultivaters, and chisel plows, should
result in higher yields. Additionally, tractors and trailers would augment
the transport capacity in rural areas. An appropriately sized tractor would
be financed for each borrower and in assessing this, consideration would be
given to the capability of the borrower to hire out his tractor and equipment
to other farmers. In determining the appropriate type of equipment ADBP would
take account of the work on farm mechanization being undertaken in Pakistan.
It is anticipated that initially most tractor loans will be for 45 hp 1/
tractors costing the farmer about Rs 64,000 each. Currently this is the most
popular size of tractor. Larger tractors up to 90 hp will be needed by some
borrowers, particularly in the Sind Province, where farms are characterized by
a plow pan that can be broken efficiently only by equipment drawn by more
powerful tractors. ADBP would pay particular attention to promoting the use
of smaller tractors both four- and two-wheeled. Such equipment is now being
tested in Pakistan, and in time an increasing proportion of ADBP resources
is expected to be directed towards the financing of such equipment. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP that special attention
would be paid to the promotion of those smaller tractors properly tested in
Pakistan. A range of tractor drawn equipment would be eligible for ADBP
financing. This would include disc plows and harrows, chisel plows, combine
seed and fertilizer drills, sprayers, roto-tillers, trailers, tined culti-
vators, tool bars and inter-row cultivators, and threshing machines. During
negotiations an assurance was also obtained from GOP/ADBP that farm equipment
likely to have excessive labor displacing characteristics, such as combine
harvesters would not be eligible for ADBP finance.
4.11      Pakistan controls the import of tractors and agricultural machinery--
authorizing imports only when equipment had performed successfully in tests
carried out by testing centers at the Agricultural Engineering Institute
(AETI) and institutions such as IRRI/PAK. GOP has established a Tractor
Review Committee (TRC) which together with the Pakistan Tractor Corporation
(PTC) reviews test reports and advises on imports. Many basic implements such
as cultivators and threshers are manufactured domestically, with some firms
showing substantial annual increases in production and sales. However, the
lack of high carbon steel for the wearing surfaces of implements has been a
constraint. During negotiations GOP/ADBP undertook to arrange the imports of
needed raw material through the Pakistan Agricultural Services Corporation
which is owned by the CB and ADBP.
4.12      On-Farm Development.  Enormous scope exists in Pakistan for on-farm
development such as land levelling and construction and improvement of on-farm
irrigation and drainage facilities. The demand for loans for this type
works has been relatively low in the past. Largely this has been because both
1/   Pakistan uses British hp rates in which 45 hp is equivalent to 35
drawbar hp the commonly used American measure (Appendix Table 9).



- 27 -
federal and provincial governments have tended to ignore the many inefficien-
cies in the Indus irrigation system. These circumstances and the uncertainty
in supply that they engender, militate against investments in on-farm develop-
ment. There is growing awareness, however, that better operation of the
irrigation system and generally better water management are the keys to
agricultural growth in Pakistan. Schemes to improve delivery should create
a growing farmer demand for loans for constructing or improving irrigation
channels and drains on their own properties, as well as for the improvement
of works of this type communally owned, i.e. those below the turn-out of the
provincial government owned irrigation canal. On-farm development works are
undertaken directly by farmers or let out to contractors; in either case the
farmer benefits from the advice and service of the ID and the provincial
agricultural departments. A number of subsidies are available to farmers
undertaking on-farm development such as land levelling, andl de-silting,
straightening and rebuilding tertiary canals. Typically, they are for
about 50% of the cost of the work.
4.13      Other On-Farm Development and Livestock Loans.  The volume of loans
for these purposes hitherto has been minor but demand should increase steadily
in the future as the impact of the improved extension and research services
begins to be felt and as ADBP acts positively to diversify its lending program.
Some of the types of diversified lending that would be carried out by ADBP are
described briefly below:
(a) Livestock. Loans would cover the cost of cattle, work oxen
and equipment needed by farmers or landless peasants who want
to participate in livestock enterprises. A typical investment,
costing about Rs 25,000, would cover the facilities for and
the purchase of up to four' dairy cows.
(b)  Poultry.  Loans would be made to farmers or landless peasants.
A typical investment of this type would be for a 300-bird unit
costing about Rs 35,000.
(c)  Sheep.  Loans would be for the purchase of local wool type
ewes for breeding. An average loan for a small farmer would
be Rs 5,000 for ten sheep.
(d)  Animal Power.  Loans for animal power would be mainly for the
purchase of oxen. The avesrage loan would be for a pair of
oxen involving a total cost of Rs 10,000. Loans would also
be made for the purchase of traditional cultivation imple-
ments as well as for improved farm implements such as simple
seeders.
(e)  Grain Storage.  Loans would be given for the purchase of metal
cereal storage bins locally manufactured, such bins cost
about Rs 5,000 per ton of grain stored.
(f) Tree Crops. Loans would be given for the establishment of
orchards for citrus, almonds, apples, and mangoes. A typical
loan would be Rs 2,000 per acre, with Rs 3,000 per acre for
banana plantings.

The IFAD Project Features
4.14      Development Lending.  The IFAD Loan of US$30 M approved by IFAD
Board on June 26, 1979 would contribute in parallel with IDA to the ADBP
development lending program for the three-year project period. The IFAD
and proposed IDA credits have linked conditions of effectiveness. The
financial arrangements of the IFAD credit are described in para 5.02.
4.15      Seasonal Lending.  IFAD is contributing towards the cost of ADBP
seasonal lending within the project period. ADBP has decided to restrict
its seasonal lending to its borrowers of development finance and thus to
provide a full service for the latter. ADBP has estimated that no more than
10% of its annual lending would be for seasonal purposes. During negotiations
of the IDA and IFAD credits assurance was obtained that ADBP would take
necessary measures to limit its seasonal loans to 10% of its total annual
lending program; and to restrict seasonal lending to the recipients of
medium- and long-term loans. ADBP makes a standard crop loan of Rs 200 per
acre to cover seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and cultivations. Such a loan
covers about 65% of these costs.
4.16      Training and Technical Assistance.  IFAD is financing the following
technical assistance components:
(a) Agricultural Engineering Training Institutes (AETI). IFAD
has agreed to finance the capital costs of improving 11 AETI
located in the Punjab and NWF Provinces; those in the Sind
are adequate. The object of this improvement is to provide
facilities to train farmers and equipment operators in tractor
and implement use and repair including use of more advanced
equipment such as chisel plows and seeders. Costs are esti-
mated to average Rs 2 M per unit made up of buildings Rs 1 M;
teaching materials Rs 50,000; and agricultural equipment
Rs 950,000. Cost details are at Appendix Table 18. Courses
would be residential, last three months, and accommodate 50
students giving an output of 150 trainees by each AETI each
year. A proposed syllabus is at Appendix Table 13.
(b) Technical Assistance. Three internationally recruited agri-
cultural engineers are to be financed by IFAD for a total
of 36 man-months at an estimated total cost of Rs 68,000
per man-month. The engineers would have the following
principal tasks: help train ADBP staff in the assessment
of mechanization needs; assist the AETI in designing and
implementing the training courses, train AETI trainers, and
assist in running the first courses for farmers and equipment
operators; liaise with the farm mechanization research and
development agencies; and assist in the preparation of ADBP
policies relating to the financing of machinery and equipment.
(c) Fellowships. IFAD is also financing fellowships for an
estimated 40 Pakistani agricultural engineers for training
overseas. An estimated provision of US$5,000 per fellow-
ship has been made for travel and expenses.



- 29 -
(d) ADBP Office and Transportation Equipment. A list of
equipment to be financed by IFAD is in Appendix, Table 18.
C. ADBP Lending Procedures
4.17       Under the project full loan appraisal would be re-introduced
gradually for all development lending whether a land mortage is available
for security or not. The speed of this process will be set by the effec-
tiveness of ADBP training progress for loan supervisors and branch managers,
(see para 4.24). Training has been planned to permit full loan appraisal to
be introduced as follows:
1979/80    1980/81    1981/82
Estimated No. of Loans
to be made                      21,500    25,000       26,500
Percent of loans appraised         45%        80%        10.0%
During negotiations assurances were obtained from ADBP that it would pursue
the above targets and that IDA would be informed in advance of the likelihood
of any slippage in their achievement.
4.18       Appraisal procedures are summarized in Schedule 'i and at negotia-
tions assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP that these would be followed. At
appraisal ADBP staff would pay particular attention to establishing the optimal
investment for the farm enterprise concerned. Thus while Zn application might
be for a loan for a tractor and basic cultivation implements, in assessing the
viability of these investments the A1DBP staff would also examine the merits
of complementary investments, for example, in more sophisticated cultivation
equipment, in minor irrigation, and in other on-farm development. The merits
of different sizes of tractor would be examined as well as the alternative of
financing work oxen.  Particular attention would be paid to the possible labor
displacement aspects of proposed investments.
D. ADBP Terms and Conditions of Lending
4.19       Lending terms and conditions are set out in Schedule A and at nego-
tiations GOP/ADBP agreed that ADBP would employ them irrespective of the
source of funds employed.
4.20       Security.  ADBP would abandon its present policy of requiring first
mortage on land as security for its loans. It would replace this by discre-
tionary first mortgages on land, chattel mortgages, guaranitees, liens on
equipment purchased with loans, and other acceptable securities. Assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations.



- 30 -
E. Project Implementation
4.21       ADBP would have responsibility for project implementation except for
the improvement and operation of AETI. Responsibility for the latter would
rest with the GOPun and GONWFP Ministries of Agriculture, which would under-
take directly the building programs and equipment procurement.
Collaborative Development Programs
4.22       In para 4.09 the lack of any sizable collaborative efforts between
ADBP and other development agencies was discussed. Under the project, ongoing
collaborative efforts, notably with the Baluchistan Development Authority and
the Barani (rainfed) Area Development Authority, would be strengthened and
expanded. As a new initiative, consultative committees would be established
at the Provincial (the key links here would be the Provincial Planning and
Development Departments) and ADBP regional office levels on which ADBP and
the agricultural development agencies, including the CB, would be represented.
The objective of these committees would be to identify and cause to be imple-
mented collaborative development programs in areas and activities of high
production potential. Assurances to this effect were obtained during nego-
tiations.
Training and Technical Assistance
4.23       During the project period from 1979/80 through 1981/82 a special
training program of three components would be implemented:
(a) training of ADBP loan supervisors in loan appraisal
procedures at the ADBP Staff College in Islamabad
this would be funded by the Pakistan Banking Council;
(b) training of farmer/tractor operators at Provincial
Government Agricultural Engineering Training Institutes
(AETI); and
(c) training overseas of AETI teaching staff.
4.24       Training of ADBP Loan Supervisors.  During the three year project
period all 250 existing ADBP loan supervisors would undergo loan appraisal
courses of two months duration at the ADBP Staff College and a start would
be made on training an additional 140 supervisors who would be recruited in
the project period. The teaching staff of the College would be reinforced
by an expert who would be financed by British technical assistance. The
expert would be an addition to the team of management consultants now assist-
ing ADBP. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that such a training
specialist would be employed by ADBP before December 31, 1979. The college
would run five courses a year and graduate 100 trainees annually. Thus, by
end 1980 ADBP would be able to post one trained loan supervisor to each of
its 140 branches and two by mid 1982.
4.25       AETIs.  Course held at AETI would last three months; half of the
time would be classroom work and the other half field work. A practical



syllabus would be employed encompassing the most important elements of tractor
and implement maintenance and repair. Under the project each institute would
double its training capacity to three courses per year of 50 students. By the
end of the third year, the AETI should be able to turn out about 1,600 tractors
operators annually. ADBP loan officers would also attend the AETI course in
order to gain experience in farm mechanization.  A recommended AETI syllabus
is at Appendix Table 13. The AETI would also organize, with the assistance of
the ADBP Staff College, annual short orientation or refresher courses in farm
mechanization and the appraisal of loans for ADBP Branch Managers. Two of the
three agricultural engineering experts would assist the AETI in planning and
teaching these courses (see also para 4.16); the third agricultural engineer-
ing expert would be attached to ADBP's Agricultural Technology and Technical
Assistance Division (see also para 2.07).
4.26      Overseas Training of AETI Staff.  The cost of ov,erseas training for
AETI instructors has been estimated at US$5,000 per person including travel.
About 40 AETI instructors would be provided with overseas training during the
project period. The University of Maryland has indicated an interest in
providing training for such personnel.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.27      In the three-year project period ADBP's role in the credit field
is expected to change substantially. Thus, it is essential that a monitoring
system be established to provide a prompt feed back to the Chairman on pro-
gress in key areas such as: introduction of loan appraisal, training, lend-
ing for smaller farmers, diversified lending, lending for small tractors,
and loan recovery. Development and execution of an appropriate monitoring
system would be the responsibility of ADBP. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from GOP/ADBP that by December 31, 1979, ADBP would submit to
and agree with IDA about a monitoring system that, inter alia, would include
the data to be collected by branches and Regional offices, the form in which
it would be collated and dispatched, the personnel responsible for collection
and dispatch, the timing of reporting, and the form in which the material
would be presented to the Chairman and Directors. Assurances were obtained
also that the agreed system would be put into effect before March 31, 1980.
4.28      ADBP would also introduce a system of evaluation to provide data
on the costs, benefits, financial and economic viability and social impact
of the main investments it finances. ADBP would carry out some of it directly
and some of it by sub-contracting to Universities and other suitable insti-
tutions. During negotiations the scope of evaluation studlies was discussed
and assurances obtained from GOP/ADBP that before December 31, 1979, ADBP
would agree with IDA the details of the evaluation procedures to be carried
out in the project period, and would establish the system by March 31, 1980.
4.29      Reporting.  ADBP would send quarterly and annual progress reports
to IDA. During negotiations an initial format was discussed which would be
amended as necessary in the light of future experience.
4.30      Completion Report.  ADBP would prepare a project completion report
not later than six months after the Closing Date. Appropriate assurances
concerning reporting and preparation of the Completion Report were obtained
during negotiations.

the basis of past performance, to comprise less than 5% of the value of
ADBP lending.
Of the total cost of US$238 M some US$13.4 M, or about 6%, are taxes and
duties. The total cost net of such taxes and duties is US$224.6 M. Costs are
based on late 1978 prices, and price contingencies calculated on the basis of
11% price contingency in 1979/80 and 1980/81 and 10% thereafter for the local

component of costs; and 6% annually for the foreign component of costs. Costs
reflect ADBP's anticipated medium- and long-term lending program for the period
1979/80 through 1981/82 which is based on ADBP's own projections amended at
appraisal in the light of past performance and agreed changes in ADBP policies
and procedures. ADBP's projected lending program is shown in detail in
Appendix Table 14.
B.   Financing
5.02      An IDA credit of US$30 M is proposed that would cover 13% of project
costs or about 25% of the foreign exchange cost of the project. An IFAD credit
for a similar amount was approved by the IFAD Board on June 26th. Because of
the disbursement mechanism described in para 5.08 financing by investment
purpose and by size of farm holding would be as follows:

/a   Table excludes technical assistance activities estimated to cost US$5.00.
Table 5.3 shows that about 75% of the proposed IDA credit of US$30 M would flow
to farmers operating less than 25 ac and about 25% of the credit to farmers
operating less than 12.5 ac. The IDA credit would be made to GOP on standard
terms. GOP would on-lend to ADBP, through the State Bank of Pakistan, the
proceeds of the IDA credit, US$30 M; US$21.5 M of the IFAD credit; and its own
contribution of about US$136.1 to the ADBP development lending program. These
funds, totalling the equivalent of US$187.6 would be on-lent to ADBP at 4%
interest. The IDA and IFAD credits would be repayable over a period of 20 years
including five years of grace for repayments of principal; the GOP's contri-
bution would be repaid in accordance with current practice by which ADBP and
ultimate borrowers' loan terms are matched. The IFAD contribution of US$5 M
to ADBP's seasonal lending program together with the GOP contribution of
US$17.3 M for this purpose would be on-lent also through SBP at 4% interest
but with the IFAD credit repayable over a period of five years including one
year of grace, and the GOP contribution repaid as indicated above. The
lending terms and conditions of the IDA and IFAD credits would be included
in a subsidiary agreement between the GOP and ADBP. The execution of this
agreement would be a condition of IDA credit effectiveness. ADBP would
provide about US$5.7 M from self-generated funds to meet the costs of its
development lending program and about US$0.7 M for its seasonal lending
program. During negotiations assurances were obtained that GOP would charge
ADBP a maximum interest rate of 4% per annum on all funds provided for on-
lending.



- 35 -
5.03      The IFAD and GOP contributions for vehicles and equipment and for
the employment of technical specialists for ADBP would be imade available to
ADBP under terms and conditions which would be approved by IDA. The IFAD and
GOP funds that would be passed on to the Punjab and NWF Provincial Governments
for the improvement of AETI would also be made available to the provinces
under terms and conditions which would be approved by IDA.
C. Procurement
5.04      Procurement for items financed under development and seasonal loans
made by ADBP would be based on a System of farmers' choice under which farmers
would purchase equipment from local dealers and arrange for contractors of
their choice. Competition is satisfactory for the goods and services to be
financed under the project as farm equipment, including tractors and tractor
drawn equipment have placed on the open import list early 1979. Farmers'
choice procurement would total about US$233 M.
5.05      Vehicles and equipment required by ADBP and AETI would be purchased
following international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. For bidding
purposes, goods would be grouped to the extent possible in procurement packages
with estimated values exceeding the equivalent of $50,000 each. Goods manufac-
tured in Pakistan would be granted a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f.
bid price or the customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts for vehicles and
equipment which cannot be grouped would be awarded in accordance with GOP's
competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory. Certain miscellaneous
equipment and vehicles with values not exceeding the equivalent of $10,000
for each contract, may be purchase through normal commercial channels after
obtaining at least three price quotations, provided the aggregate expenditure
for items so purchased does not exceed the equivalent of $250,000. Appropriate
assurances were obtained at negotiations.
5.06      Construction of buildings at the AETI, would be carried out either
by force account or through contracts let by the Provincial Departments of
Agriculture under local competitive bidding procedures, which are satisfac-
tory. The work would be scattered throughout the country and be too low in
total value, at US$1 M, to be likely to attract international bidders. The
contracts would be let in a manner that would permit contractors to bid for
the work at one or more of the sites in each of the Provinces.
5.07      The agricultural engineering specialists, costiIng about US$0.7,
would be recruited internationally through procedures in line with IDA guide-
lines. Overseas training would be arranged directly with suitable institutions.
D. Disbursement
5.08      To encourage ADBP lending to smaller farmers and for diversified
lending, differential rates would be employed to disburse the IDA and IFAD
credits against loans made for various investment purposes and differing
categories of farmers, viz:

5.09      Disbursement of the IDA and IFAD credits for development loans would
be in the ratio of about 60% to 40%. Disbursements in each of the fiscal
years have been estimated as follows:
($ M)
1979/80      1980/81    1981/82

IFAD             8.5         11.5        10.0
Disbursements against the costs of development and seasonal loans would be
based on ADBP certified statements of expenditure. 1/ Supporting documentation
for individual loans would not be submitted for inspection by IDA and IFAD but
would be retained by ADBP and be made available for inspection by IDA/IFAD
supervision missions. The ADBP and Punjab and NWFP Governments auditors would
be required to examine the validity of disbursement claims submitted to IDA
and IFAD in connection with the AETI and to report specifically on this topic
in each annual audit report. Appropriate assurances were obtained during
negotiations.
1/   Including a certification that the reimbursement claim does not include
expenditures related to goods originating from non-member countries.



- 37 -
E. Accounting and Audits
5.10      ADBP accounting and auditinLg procedures are satisfactory.  However,
during negotiations assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP that:
-    ADBP accounts would contintue to be audited annually by inde-
pendent auditors and in accordance with procedures satisfactory
to both IDA and IFAD;
-    GOP/ADBP would send IDA ancL IFAD copies of the audit reports,
and audited annual accounts of ADBP within six months of the
end of each financial year; and
-    Punjab and NWFP Provincial Governments would maintain separate
accounts for project financed activities and that these would
be inspected and audited al: least annually by the Provincial
Auditor-General concerned.
VI.  PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES
A. Production
6.01      As a result of investments in minor irrigation, mechanization, and
on-farm development farmers would be able to increase cropping intensities
and yields and bring more land under cultivation (see Appendix Tables 20 to
30).  However, irrigation requirements per acre would, owing to farm mechani-
zation decrease because (a) much less water would be required for softening
the land before primary tillage operations and (b) better seed-bed preparation
would improve root development and thereby enable the crop to utilize soil
moisture more efficiently. It is estimated that at full production (1986) the
project would induce an annual incremental production of the principal crops
of the project area as shown in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1: ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL PRODUCTION BY 1986

- 38 -
6.02      Total value of annual incremental production of the four principal
crops grown by project participants is estimated to be Rs 1,245 M (US$126 M)
at 1979 farmgate prices. It is expected that all wheat and sugarcane would be
consumed internally, and that about 25% of the rice and 10% of the cotton lint
produced would be exported. Irrigation, mechanization, and on-farm development
would also increase the production of minor crops and grains - vegetables,
pulses, oil seeds, maize and sorghum; and loans for livestock and both tem-
perate and tropical fruits would increase supplies of meat, milk, eggs and
fruits. Most, if not all, minor crops, livestock products and fruit would be
consumed locally. Lending for these latter activities would comprise only
about 5% of ADBP's lending in the period 1979 through 1982. No attempt has
been made to quantify the impact of this lending on production as this
would be highly conjectural.
B. Marketing and Commodity Prices
6.03      Incremental production of wheat would be handled through existing
channels with farmers able to sell their surpluses privately or through the
official procurement channels. The current official procurement price is
satisfactory, Rs 45 per maund, and the marketing system satisfactory. Pakistan
wheat imports have averaged 1.2 M tons annually over the last five years;
consequently, project induced production should be absorbed readily by the
domestic market. High quality basmati rice is a strong export although
growers supplying the domestic market favor the higher yielding IRRI varieties.
No problems are foreseen in marketing either type of rice and prices are
attractive particularly since a substantial increase in the official minimum
price for basmati, from Rs 95 to Rs 110 per maund, was promulgated for the
1978/79 season. Domestic cotton production has been erratic in recent years
with production in 1978 falling to levels inadequate to supply domestic demand
and traditional exports. A consequence was an explosion in 1978 of domestic
prices for lint and a resulting ban on lint exports. Project induced produc-
tion should find a ready market.
6.04      Pakistan is a net importer of fats and oils and generally pulses,
animal products and fruit are all in short supply with demand steadily increas-
ing under pressure from a strong total, and in particular very high urban,
population growth rate. Consequently no problems are foreseen in marketing
project induced production at incentive prices.
6.05      Financial prices for commodities used in this report are based on
1978 farmgate prices expressed in 1979 constant currency values. Economic
prices used are derived from the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections
Department (EPD) projections of 1985 world prices expressed in 1979 currency
values. These prices are adjusted to reflect the historical relationship
between world market prices and actual CIF or FOB prices for Pakistan as well
as transport, processing and handling costs. Border prices are converted
into Pakistan Rs at the official exchange rate and domestic cost components
adjusted by a Standard Correction Factor (SCF) of 0.85. Economic prices
for non-traded commodities were developed by adjusting local financial prices
by the ratio of economic prices to financial prices for traded commodities.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The project would respond to the demand for sustained flows of
medium- and long-term investment credit from the agricultural sector. Some
25,000 farm families are expected to be directly benefitted from the project.
In addition about 135,000 farm families would benefit through services pro-
vided by the direct beneficiaries of the project. Incremental agricultural
production induced by the project is valued in 1985 economic prices at an
estimated Rs 1966 M (US$199) annually by 1986 (see para 6.01). These would
be the project's principal benefits. Secondary, but unquantifiable, bene-
fits would stem from the project's beneficial impact on AD]BP as an institu-
tion, principally through strengthening it administratively and financially,
but also from a shift in the direction of its lending towards smaller farmers
and a wider range of productive activities than it finances at present.
A. Financial Analysis
7.02      The nature of individual investments financed under the project
would vary greatly with circumstances such as the location, size, and tenure-
ship of the farm on which they are to be made. The wide range of individual
investment situations makes demonstation of the financial benefits of different
investment possible only through the use of illustrative models. Eleven
illustrative models have been prepared covering investments in irrigation,
mechanization, and on-farm development. During the three year project period,
loans for such purposes are expected, to account for an estimated 95% of total
ADBP lending. In practice, of course, loans would be made only for invest-
ments with financial rates of return adequate to service the loans supporting
them. Table 7.1 summarizes the financial rates of return expected to accrue
from typical investments financed by ADBP under the project. These rates are
lower than those estimated by OED and Bank Development Policy Staff in their
evaluation of past ADBP investments. In the early '70s tractor imports were
subsidized whereas at present they are subject to a 15% C.I.F. tax. Details
of the models are in Appendix Tables 20 through 30 and financial analysis in
Appendix Tables 33 through 36.
7.03      The above models illustrate the returns expected to accrue to
the owners of investments financed under the project - an estimated 25,000
farmers. The models for farm operators purchasing tractors assume that their
owners will be able to hire out a h:igh proportion of the capacity of their
tractors and equipment at profitable rates. Since the use of tractors smaller
than 45 hp will increase only slowly in the project period (types have to
be identified, tested, and arrangements made for import or manufacture and
distribution), the existence of a market for these services is critical if
smaller farmers are to engage in this type of activity. Fortunately, the
demand for tractor and equipment hire services is very strong with rates
ranging from Rs 40 per hour for a 45 hp tractor and cultivator to Rs 55 per
hour for a larger tractor and chisel plow. Further, the 1L975 farm mechani-
zation census showed that tractor owners hired out their machines for an



- 40 -
average of 600 hours out of an average 1,300 hours used annually. The demand
for hire services is expected to increase as there is no foreseeable signi-
ficant growth in the work oxen population to keep pace with the expected
growth in the agriculture sector. Appendix, Table 31 illustrates the financial
viability of hiring-in tractors on a 12.5 acre farm model. By permitting
expansion in cultivated area, higher cropping intensities, and increased
wheat yields hiring remains profitable even at rates 50% higher than those
now prevailing. A similar test shows that buying water at rates 100% higher
than those now prevailing is still profitable.

B.   Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.04      Two independent ex-post evaluations of past ADBP project, carried
out by DPS and OED, suggest that the realized financial and economic rates
of return were higher than those projected at appraisal. The DPs ex-post
analysis of the IDA-financed mechanization projects in Pakistan estimates
the financial and economic rates of return for a tractor/tubewell package
at 57% and 24%, respectively. A similar conclusion was reached in the OED
report, though it analyzed only the tractor farm, not the tractor/tubewell
package. OED computed returns at 50% (financial) and 40% (economic).
7.05      The overall ERR of the proposed project based on ADBP projections
of lending activity in the three-year project period, is etl:imated above 50%.
This rate is somewhat higher than the ex-post estimates of past ADBP projects
financed by IDA. This reflects lessons learnt from past projects i.e. (i)
introduction of proper loan appraisal (see para 4.18); (ii) improved support-
ing services (see paras 4.16 and 4.22); and (iii) increased emphasis on pro-
vision of appropriate machinery and farm implements (see paras 3.19 and 4.10).
7.06      Sensitivity tests shown in Table 7.2 illustrate that even under most
severe conditions the rates of returns for different investments financed by
ADBP would not fall below 28%.

/a   Tractors are expected to work for an average of 750 hours/year in agri-

C. Project Risks
7.07      From 1972 to 1976 the administrative performance of ADBP declined
seriously, and the beginning of any movement of reform began only in 1977.
Since then, many improvements have been made, others are underway, and yet
others are conditions of the IFAD and the proposed IDA credit. Given the
experience and attitudes of ADBP's current management there seems little doubt
that on its part ADBP will do all in its power to continue to improve its
operations and to adhere to the objectives of the project. Ultimate success
will depend, however, on a full commitment from GOP. Under the present
administration support for ADBP reforms has been good, but ADBP's general
relaxation of appraisal procedures and collection efforts in earlier periods
reflected political considerations as did its emergency lending programs.
Additionally GOP failed to take steps to assist promptly when ADBP requested



- 4J -
action to write off investments in East Pakistan and other imeasures needed
to clean up its financial situation. With the assurances obtained from GOP
at negotiations, ADBP should be in a position to complete its administrative
reforms and bring its financial affairs into order. Successful completion
of the project will require, however, continuing support from GOP for a firm
policy on recoveries.
7.08       The introduction of tractors to Pakistan has been claimed to have
had adverse social effects in terms of tenant and labor displacement by
enabling land owners to cultivate more land directly and thLus to evict tenant
sharecroppers, and to displace work oxen drivers. The view that tractors are
instrumental in displacing tenants is not valid in Pakistan today, where,
whatever the deficiencies of existing land reform legislation, tenant eviction
appears not to be a serious phenomenon. This situation is different to that
obtaining prior to the land reforms of 1972 when, according to official census
records about 700,000 tenants lost their land between 1960 and 1972.  This was
a consequence principally of the GOP decision to introduce land reform and the
attendant uncertainties. Given the farm power constraint and, in certain areas
and at certain times, the shortage of labor, it is unlikely that the history
of the sixties will repeat itself. 1/ In sum, the risk of appreciable tenant
displacement as a direct consequence of project activities is not significant
particularly since more than half of beneficiaries of mechanization loans
would be relatively small landowners.
7.09       The mechanization models (models 1 through 6), show a reduction in
on-farm labor requirements equivalent to about 10% of current labor use. Since
the small landholder uses very little hired labor, most of the reduction in
requirements would take the form of reduced family labor inputs. For this
group, the notional loss of labor income is handsomely compensated through
increased farm income overall. For hired landless labor, the project taken
as a whole, including minor irrigation and on-farm development, is expected
to result in an increase in hired labor requirements, since the small decrease
due to mechanization should be more than offset by increases due to these other
activities. Furthermore, it is likely that the project would substantially
increase local demand for labor through off-farm activities, including ancil-
lary services used by project farmers and the potentially very large impact
of increased purchasing power due to increased incomes. In conclusion, the
project is expected to increase overall hired labor requirements above the
without-project situation (see Appendix, Table 40).
1/   Court records show 6,200 cases of tenancy disputes in 1973; 4,500 in
1974; 1,000 in 1975; 300 in 1976; 5,300 in 1977 and 250 in 1978. There
is no correlation between the number of court cases and the number of
tractors. However, there is a distinct correlation between the number
of court cases and the introduction of Land Reform measures. In parti-
cular, most of the tenancy disputes in 1977 occurred within three
months of the announcement of the 1977 Land Reform.

VIII. ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOP/ADBP that:
(a) GOP would cause ADBP to employ management and training
consultants to assist ADBP until at least December 1980
and that a loan appraisal specialist be employed by
December 31, 1979 (2.04 and 4.24).
(b) GOP would not require the ADBP to undertake emergency lending
except in the event of a major natural calamity and only on
an agency basis (2.16).
(c) ADBP would submit to IDA for its concurrence by December 31,
1979, a phased program to be completed by December 31, 1980
for the examination on a branch-by-branch basis, of all
overdue loans including those extended in the course of
emergency lending (2.25).
(d) ADBP would reach minimum loan recovery rates of at least
60% by July 1980, at least 70% by July 1981, and of at least
85% by July 1, 1982, and require its branches to achieve
such levels to qualify for future lending (2.25).
(e) ADBP would (i) by December 31, 1979 furnish to IDA for its
concurrence proposals for reaching by July 1, 1981, adequate
levels of provision against bad and doubtful loans and general
reserves; and (ii) by July 1, 1980, as an interim measure,
establish a provision against bad and doubtful loans of at
least Rs 170 M. GOP shall ensure that funds required to
reach the levels of provision against bad and doubtful loans
and of general reserve are available within ADBP (2.27).
(f) ADBP's lending rate will not be less than 11% throughout the
life of the project; and as soon as it is determined that these
rates are not at positive levels in real terms, GOP shall take
measures to achieve levels satisfactory to IDA (2.28).
(g) GOP will assure a 7% spread to ADBP by supplying all SBP funds
at a 4% rate during the project period. GOP would cause ADBP
to review the spread and furnish the results to IDA for its
consideration by July 1, 1982 (2.28 and 5.02).
(h) GOP shall cause its ARC to furnish to IDA for its review by
December 31, 1979, proposals for carrying out basic trials
comparing different mechanized cultivation techniques and
for the importation and testing of different farm equipment
including the use of smaller traction; and to implement such
program by July 1, 1980 (3.19).



- 45 -
(i) ADBP shall extend at least 50% of the amount of its medium-
and long-term loans to farmers of less than 25 ac during its
FY 1979/80, at least 65% during FY 1980/81, and at least 75%
during FY1981/82 and thereafter; and at least one-third of
the amount extended to farmers of less than 25 ac in each
FY would be to farmers operating less than 12.5 ac (3.21).
(j)  GOP shall take all necessary measures to facilitate the impor-
tation of small high speed diesel engines (4.06).
(k) ADBP should act as an authorized agent of federal. and provin-
cial Government schemes for groundwater development, as well
as for other agricultural investment incentive schemes (4.09).
(1) ADBP would pay particular attention to the promotion of small
tractors properly tested in Pakistan and would not finance
equipment likely to have excessive labor displaciing charac-
teristics, such as combine harvesters (4.10).
(m)  ADBP would take all necessary measures to limit lthe level of
seasonal loans to 10% and special project lending to 10% of
its total project lending; and restrict seasonal lending to
recipients of medium- and long-term loans (4.15).
(n) ADBP take all necessary measures to appraise at least 45%
of the loans to be sanctioned during FY 1979/80, at least
80% during FY1980/81 and 1.00% during FY 1981/82 and there-
after (4.17).
(o)  ADBP would follow appraisal procedures and on lending terms
and conditions agreed with IDA (4.18 and 4.19).
(p) ADBP would abandon its policy of requiring first mortgage
on land as principal security for its loans and would replace
it by liens on equipment purchased with its loans, chattel
mortgages, guarantees, discretionary mortgage on. land and
other acceptable securities (4.20).
(q) GOP would cause ADBP, in cooperation with the Provinces
and together with the appropriate agencies and institutions,
to promote lending in areas with high development potential
(4.22).
(r) ADBP would by December 31, 1979, agree with IDA on, and
by March 31, 1980 implement procedures for the provision
of data on the cost, benefits, viability and impact of
ADBP's lending operation, and for monitoring and evaluat-
ing the Project (4.27 and 4.28).
(s)  ADBP would send quarterly and annual progress reports to
IDA and would prepare a Project Completion Report no later
than six months after the Closing Date (4.29 and 4.30).



- 46 -
(t) ADBP accounts would continue to be audited annually by inde-
pendent auditors and in accordance with procedures satisfac-
torily to both IDA and IFAD: GOP/ADBP would send IDA and
IFAD copies of the audit reports, and audited annual accounts
of ADBP within six months of the end of each financial year;
and Punjab and NWFP Provincial Governments would maintain
separate accounts for project financed activities and these
would be inspected and audited at least annually by the
Provincial Auditor-General concerned (5.10).
8.02      Conditions of credit effectiveness are that:
(a) The conditions for the IFAD loan agreement have been duly
fulfilled (para 4.14); and
(b) The subsidiary loan agreement between the GOP and ADBP has
been executed (para 5.02).
8.03      With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$30 M on standard IDA terms. The
Borrower would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

3/  From Pakistan Agricultural Census 1972.  Average cropping intensity for
perennial irrigated farms.
4/  Cropping intensity increases following mechanization due to levelling and
cultivating land, hitherto uncultivable by bullock power. World Bank Staff
'orking Paper No. 210 shows that following mechanization, mechanized farms
increased their cultivable land by about 20,.
Farms are assumed to use family labor for all operations and only hired labor
when demand for farm labor exceeds the suvplv of family labor.

- Yield increases ranging from 5% to 20% due to a better land preparation.
2/  Cropping intensity increases following mechanization due to a more timely on-farm
operations. World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 210 shows that following mecha-
nization, mechanized farms increased their cultivable land by about 20% due to
reclamation and land improvement.  Simulation on linear prograning oa preliminary
data for the Indus Basin Study suggests that given present availability of
water and farm animal power       introduction of tractors would cause a significant
increase in cropping intensity.
/  Tractor operations with disc harrow, fertilizer and thresher were estimated
at Rs A5/hr:  other tractor operations were estimated at Rs 40/hr.  The former
igure is conservative as present races varies from Rs 45 to Rs 55/hr.
