RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. The Transport Sector
A.    Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      Ghana, with a 800 km coastline on the Gulf of Guinea and bordered
by Togo to the east, the Ivory Coast to the west and Upper Volta to the
north, has an area of 238,000 km2 . The terrain presents no major obstacles
to transport. The population, 11.3 million, is growing at about 3.0% p.a.
Basic Structural Characteristics
1.02      Agriculture is the largest sector of the economy accounting for
50.5% of GDP in 1979. Industrial production and services account for 17.5%
and 32.0% respectively. Although Ghana had traditionally enjoyed a fairly
high standard of living compared with most other West African nations, the
growth performance of the economy in recent years has been poor. Real GDP per
capita declined between 1975 and and 1979 by at least 4.0% annually. The per
capita GNP is estimated at US$400 in 1979.
Recent Economic Developments
1.03      During the last decade the country's economic performance has been
characterized by a high rate of inflation, widening budget deficits and a
persistent foreign exchange shortage. This deterioration took place notwith-
standing a relatively good natural resource endowment and a significant
improvement in the country s terms of trade and has to be ascribed essentially
to poor economic management.
1.04      In June 1978, in face of an increasingly critical economic situa--
tion, the authorities commenced a program of stabilization. This included a
58% devaluation of the Cedi, a tough budget for 1978/79 which aimed at dras-
tically reducing the overall budget deficit, a doubling of cocoa producer
price to stimulate production, limiting the increase in money supply in
1978/79 and tightening of credit.
1.05      The civilian Government which took over in September 1979 has,
however, been slow to come to grips with the country's economic problems.
As a result of this and the unfavorable external environment the economy
deteriorated sharply in FY81. Discussions are now in progress between the
Government and IMF on the stabilization program as a basis for an IMF
Standby Arrangement.



-2-
Prospects
1.06      Ghana is relatively well endowed in terms of natural resources and
has the potential to achieve a rate of growth considerably in excess of its
performance of the last decade. The basic thrust of the Government-s policy,
e.g. emphasis on rehabilitation of the export sector and infrastructure,
emphasis on small-scale farming and the policy of fiscal restraint are all in
the right direction.
1.07      Ghana's growth prospects over the next few years will depend to a
considerable extent on the introduction and follow-up actions in support
of the objectives of the stabilization program. On the basis of the most
recent policy indications, and economic potential, growth in GDP of 3% per
annum should be feasible. With sustained improvement in economic management
the economy is capable of significantly higher rates of growth.
B.   The Transport System
1.08      Compared with other countries in West Africa, Ghana has a rela-
tively well developed transport system comprising an extensive road network,
a railway, lake transport, two ocean ports and three major airports, all of
these concentrated in the south where the bulk of the population is situated.
Until recently, the system has adequately served the country-s needs. In
recent years, however, the country's macro-economic difficulties, especially
the shortage of foreign exchange, have severely constrained the capacity of
Government to maintain the existing transport infrastructure. The supply of
imported spare parts and supplies to maintain the existing transport facili-
ties and to keep its vehicles and equipment operating has been severely
restricted. As a consequence, the whole system has deteriorated sharply, and
it has now become a serious obstacle to the country's transport services.
Railway
1.09      The railway comprises three lines totalling 947 km.  In FY1980 it
carried about 690,000 tons of freight and about 6.0 million passengers.
Details of the system and its operations are given in Chapter II.
Roads and Trucking
1.10      Ghana has about 25,400 km of classified roads, of which 3,700 km
are primary roads. About 4,700 km are paved, and the remainder are gravel or
earth surfaced. Traffic is estimated to have grown at about 6% p.a. from 1970
to 1977, but appears to have declined since then, because the shortage of
spare parts has largely immobilized the country-s vehicle fleet.
1.11      The roads constructed during the late 1950-s and early 1960's,
have deteriorated because of unexpected increases of heavy vehicles, and
also because of failures in the maintenance program. The problem is being
addressed under the Bank's Second and Third (Emergency Maintenance) Highway
Projects.



-3-
Road Transport Industry
1.12      The motor vehicle fleet totalled about 96,000 vehicles in 1978,
including about 12,000 heavy trucks, and 28,000 light trucks or buses.
The fleet grew at 6% p.a. from 1975 to 1978.  The road transport industry
comprises government-owned firms, including the State Transport Corporation
(intercity buses and trucking) and the Omnibus Services Authority (urban
buses), in competition with a well developed private sector. The private
sector operates in a generally market-oriented framework, although it is
constrained by the inability to obtain spare parts for vehicles.
1.13       It appears that more than 40% of the road vehicle fleet is presently
out of service, due to the unavailability of tires and spare parts.
River Transport
1.14      The construction of the Akosombo Dam in the 1960's created the
8,000 km2 Volta Lake severing several road links including the main north-
south Kumasi-Tamale road and isolating some communities near the lake. This
has led to diversion of traffic round the northwestern end of the lake, over
a road which is in poor condition. A ferry boat service is available for
transport across the Volta Lake but its operations have deteriorated recently
due to equipment failure. The best means of improving north-south transport
has not yet been determined though German financing of improved lake transport
is underway.
Modal Competition
1.15      Rail/road competition for cocoa and timber traffic has been strong
in the past but there are indications that as a result of lack of capacity in
both modes, competition has lessened recently. Railway capacity shortage has
prevented it handling even the limited amount of non-mineral traffic on offer,
and has restricted the volume of captive mineral traffic transported. Railway
freight traffic is concentrated on the Western line, between Kumasi/Awaso and
Takoradi and comprises mainly bulk manganese and bauxite, timber from the four
state owned timber companies (two of which have no road access) and cocoa.
Increasing shortage of road transport capacity has recently led the Government
to direct that cocoa should be rail carried wherever possible but GRC has as
yet been unable to supply the necessary capacity.  GRC carries a substantial
volume of passenger traffic, which falls into two broad categories, long
distance passengers who prefer the luggage space advantage of rail travel to
the relative speed of road, and short-distance passengers between villages
inadequately linked to the road system.  Rail and river/lake transport does
not compete, and road and river/lake only marginally.
Air Transport
1.16       Ghana has four operational airports--Accra, Kumasi, Sunyani and
Tamale. Takoradi airport is no longer operational. There may be a case for
reopening Takoradi airport, and for another airport at Bolgatanga in the
north. A study of airport and airline service requirements would be warranted,
particularly if the economic situation improves.



-4-
Ports
1.17      The commercial port system comprises two ports, Takoradi on the
southwest coast, and Tema about 30 km east of Accra. Takoradi is the main
export port with specialized berths to handle all of Ghana-s bauxite and
manganese exports, virtually all timber exports, and about half of Ghana-s
cocoa exports. Cocoa is also lightered, and, while this is not the most
efficient loading method, the location of the cocoa sheds some distance away
from the general cargo berths prevents a cost-effective change in operations.
There are also berths for the discharge of bulk oil and clinker which are its
chief imports. The port-s capacity is adequate to meet traffic demand, which
has declined in recent years. There are, however, shortages of spare parts
for shore handling equipment and a recovery in timber exports could put a
strain on capacity. This problem is being addressed under a proposed forestry
project. Dredging is believed to be inadequate due to dredger failure.
Tema is the main import and fishing port and possesses substantial dry dock
facilities. The commercial port comprises twelve general cargo berths, a
petroleum berth and a specialized alumina import berth (for the Valco alumi-
nium plant). Traffic is mainly general cargo, crude petroleum, cement clinker
and alumina. About half of Ghana-s cocoa is exported through Tema together
with other agricultural and fishing products, petroleum products and alumi-
nium. Total dry cargo traffic is about 1.8 million tons, of which general
cargo imports account for two-thirds, and bulk traffic over specialized
facilities accounts for the other third. Port facilities are basically
adequate to handle this traffic. However, poor cargo handling operations due
partly to inadequate maintenance of equipment and the usual spare parts
problem restrict capacity to less than optimum. The fairly clear-cut distinc-
tion between the roles of the two ports is economically logical. Most exports
originate in the west, but Takoradi itself is a small urban area, while the
main commercial areas are Accra/Tema and Kumasi. Kumasi is as readily served
from Tema as from Takoradi and shipping economics favor concentration of
operations at as few ports as possible. Thus Tema has developed as the main
import port, and ships calling at Tema rarely make a call at Takoradi on the
same voyage, and vice versa.
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
1.18      Several Government agencies are involved in transport.  The Ministry
of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) is responsible for overall investment
planning; the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) is responsible
for transport policy and regulation and for control over the railway, ports,
civil aviation and the state-owned transport corporations; GHA is responsible
for all public roads and operates short distance transport on Volta Lake; and
the Volta River Authority (VRA) runs long-distance navigation of the Volta
Lake. After substantial expansion of the transport system during the 1960s,
transport investments in the 1970s have concentrated on rehabilitation. Over
the 1964-74 period investments in transport totalled about US$70 million of
which 80% was for road improvement and rehabilitation, and the remainder mostly
for civil aviation. The current objectives of the Government for this sector
are to: (a) continue rehabilitating the transport network and institute more
efficient maintenance, (b) improve the operational and financial performance
of public transport entities, (c) improve planning and management at the



sub-sector levels, (d) ensure that investments along major corridors are
coordinated and based on sound economic criteria, and (e) develop the local
road construction industry. These latter objectives have, however, been put
in abeyance by the recent critical shortage of foreign exchange and rapid
domestic inflation.
1.19       The current shortage of effective capacity across all transport
subsectors has led to attention being focussed on obtaining a rapid improve-
ment in the situation. The Third Highway (Emergency Maintenance) Project
approved in May 1980, and the proposed Railway Project are both focussed
physically on short-term rehabilitation, but in addition the latter will
afford the opportunity to strengthen transport sector planning. The basic
problem is that the complexity of the Ghanaian transport system requires a
strong transport planning mechanism. However, the body responsible for
this--the Transport Planning Unit (TPU) in MTC--is poorly organized and
understaffed and consequently contributes little. Further aggravating the
problem is the fact that other transport sector organizations function inde-
pendently. Again, GHA is an independent body, and in practice the various
ministries which were involved with highways before the formation of GHA, in
particular the Ministries of Local Government and Youth and Rural Development,
city, municipal, regional and local authorities still exert a strong influence
on highway development. The net effect is that investment planning and
coordination are still weak and there is little effort to systematically
establish sub-sector priorities.
1.20      An attempt was made under Bank guidance, to coordinate road/rail
investment in the important Kumasi-Takoradi "corridor" through an inter-
ministerial working group comprised of personnel from TPU, GHA and MFEP,
which is theoretically still working on a two part study of investment
requirements and appropriate subsectoral distribution. Progress became
slow, due partly to difficulties in obtaining effective participation by all
concerned, and latterly to their feeling that in a situation where funds for
even routine maintenance were severely limited, an investment allocation
exercise was increasingly academic. The one useful result, however, is that
the work has demonstrated to the Government the need in the longer term for
a strengthened central transport planning mechanism, and agreement was
reached in principle with MTC during appraisal of the proposed project on
the broad terms of reference and staffing requirements for a strengthened
TPU. About 100 man-months of technical assistance is envisaged. Agreement
was reached at negotiations concerning the terms of reference and staffing of
TPU as well as the scope and terms of reference of the technical assistance
which will commence not later than December 31, 1981.
II. THE GHANA RAILWAY CORPORATION
A.   General
2.01       The Ghana railway system (947 km) is in the form of a letter A,
with the apex at Kumasi and the two "feet" at Takoradi and Accra/Tema (see



-6-
Map).  Except for completion of the Central line, only minor developments
have taken place since 1944. The system lies entirely in the most heavily
populated southern half of the country and distances are short, about 320 km
maximum, constraining the railway's ability to compete with road transport.
The terrain through which the railway passes is generally hilly, particularly
between Kumasi and Takoradi (the Western line) and thus high average speeds
are not possible.
B.   Railway Administration
2.02      The railway and ports operated as a government department until
1971, when a statutory corporation, the Ghana Railway and Ports Authority
(GRPA), was created.  The railway element operated at a loss while the ports
were profitable. As railway losses increased pressure mounted, particularly
from the ports element, for a separation of the two activities, thus abolish-
ing the cross-subsidization. This pressure resulted in a Government decree in
1977 creating separate entities: the Ghana Railway Corporation (GRC) and
Ghana Ports Authority (GPA).
2.03      GRC's administrative structure is similar to that of the former GRPA.
It comprises a board responsible to the MTC with a general manager as chief
executive. The GRC Board has seven Government nominated members, comprising
a chairman, the general manager, representatives of MTC and GPA, and three
other members with relevant experience. The responsibilities of the board and
general manager are imprecisely defined and a senior management organizational
structure outlining the duties and inter-relationships of the corporation's
officers has never been established. This situation has led to serious
coordination problems and rendered decision-making slow and difficult.
2.04      The weak financial situation of the railway has added to the
management problems. In the absence of well-defined financial objectives
and targets, the railway incurs large deficits which GRC management expects
the Government to cover. The Government, in turn, is unable to make realistic
yearly assessments of the assistance required. A result of this is that GRC
management is unwilling to systematically set and impose operational standards.
Thus trains do not run on schedule, accidents are only perfunctorily investi-
gated, and staff recruitment is not related to operational needs. In brief,
GRC management does not manage. Realization of these problems led to a UNDP-
financed study 1/, the final report of which was issued in May 1978. The
report proposed:  (i)  amendment of the decree governing GRC to define more
precisely the powers and responsibilities of the board and general manager;
(ii) revision of organizational structure, with two deputy general managers
(Annex 1); (iii) appointment by the Government of a screening committee to
review the qualifications required for senior positions in the new managerial
structure and the suitability of the existing senior personnel; and (iv)
relating staff norms to GRC traffic expectations, establishment of which would
1/   "GRC Staffing and Management Study" by RITES (India) for GRC and the
Ghana Government.



-7-
lead to a significant reduction in staff over a five-year period through
attrition and redeployment of surplus staff in other fields after suitable
training (para. 2.07).
2.05      In compliance with the report-s recommendations, GRC and the
Government have in consultation with the Association (i) revised GRC's
organizational structure to, among other things, provide for two Deputy
General Managers; (ii) screened senior staff for suitability; (iii) agreed
in principle to amend the GRC Decree (Government agreed at negotiations to
submit to Parliament by December 31, 1981, a draft amendment to the Decree)
and (iv) produced, a draft manpower rationalization and reduction plan for
discussion at negotiations.
2.06      Senior staff screening resulted in the replacement of three Depart-
ment heads, and the appointment of an expatriate engineer (from consultants
RITES, India) as Chief Mechanical Engineer with effect from July 1980. In
addition, GRC identified three consultative posts which needed filling ur-
gently and has negotiated a contract with CANAC (Canada) to fill them. These
experts took up their positions in December 1980/January 1981. Provision has
been made in the project for retroactive financing of US$400,000 for these
three CANAC experts and the acting CME from RITES. Details of the technical
assistance program contained in the Project are in paras. 3.04 to 3.09.
2.07      Between April 1980 and negotiations in February 1981 GRC's staff
strength unexpectedly dropped from 11,200 to 9,800. GRC identified the reason
as staff leaving for Nigeria and the private sector because of poor career
prospects in GRC. GRC's ban on fresh recruitment has also contributed to this
reduction. However if this trend continues without appropriate regulatory
measures, GRC would be running the risk of losing its qualified and talented
staff. Consequently, the whole question of staff reduction and development was
reviewed and it was agreed with GRC and the Government that by December 31,
1981, GRC would furnish to the Association:
(i) a man-power reduction plan for progressively reaching a staff
strength of 6,000 by June 30, 1986, and that this plan would
elaborate the means of achieving the target, notably through special
retraining schemes and redeployment within and outside GRC, in
addition to quantifying, in more precise terms, the annual attrition
rate and identifying the areas in which the reductions will take
place; and
(ii) a man-power development and staff compensation plan which would
spell out concrete measures to be taken to attract and retain
qualified Ghanaian staff to avoid depletion of skills in critical
areas.
It was agreed that these plans would be discussed and finalized with the
Association and the recommendations would be implemented by GRC according
to an agreed time table. The Government will assist GRC in the implementation
of the recommendations, as these recommendations have national implications in
labor and wage policies.



C.   Railway Property
2.08      The Ghana Railway is a 1,069 mm (3'6") gauge single line system
with the exception of 30 km of double track between Takoradi and Manso. The
three main lines are the Western (Takoradi/Sekondi-Kumasi), the Eastern
(Accra-Kumasi) and the Central (Huni Valley-Kotoku Junction) lines. There
are four branch lines (to Prestea, Awaso, Kade and Tema). The axle load is
12.5 tons on the Prestea and Kade Branch, 13.5 tons on the Eastern line and
16 tons on all other lines. The track conditions on the Western and Eastern
lines and on the Awaso Branch are acceptable for present traffic volumes.
However, worn out wooden sleepers and switches on the Western line must be
renewed, and rails in sharp curves should be replaced. The lightly trafficked
Central line is in adequate condition. Before using modern track maintenance
equipment already owned by GRC, the volume of ballast must be increased,
commencing with the Western line and subsequently extended to the rest of the
system. Project-related details of these corrective measures are in para.
3.11. It is significant that the project consists of investments only on the
Western Line; during the project execution period, GRC will make no investments
on the Eastern and Central Lines.
2.09      All telecommunications are owned by the Postal and Telegraph
authorities (PTT) and carried by open wires. The equipment is outdated and
worn-out. Interruptions of telephone communications between small, inter-
mediate stations and the traffic control centers in Takoradi and Kumasi are
very frequent. Only 20 out of 111 stations are equipped with signalling and
interlocking equipment, practically all of which is currently non-functional.
The single-line electric token system (tablet and staff) is mostly out of order
as is the double line coded block systems. While two-thirds of the former are
repairable, all of the latter are beyond repair. These deficiencies will be
dealt with under the proposed project (para. 3.14).
2.10      The motive power fleet (see Table 2.1) consists of 29 steam mainline
locomotives, 68 diesel locomotives and 31 diesel shunters. GRC has 237
coaches (see Table 2.1) of which about 65% (153) are more than 25 years old.
The wagon fleet consists of 3,308 wagons; of these about 20% (675) are more
than 25 years old, while another 1,833 wagons are equipped only with plain
bearings. The main workshop in Sekondi is too small to handle maintenance of
rolling stock and steam and diesel locomotives. In addition, the machinery
is old and not adapted to modern maintenance techniques. Locomotives are
serviced at eight depots--five of them specialize in steam locomotive service,
while three service steam as well as diesel locomotives. The measures intended
to reactivate the motive power and wagon fleet and associated workshop and
maintenance facilities under the proposed project are described in paras. 3.12
and 3.13.
2.11      To train its staff, GRC uses World War II military barracks which
are in poor condition, and only a small amount of teaching material is
available. The training system will be substantially modernized under the
project (para. 3.15).

D.   Operations
2.12      Table 2.2 summarizes available traffic and operating statistics for
FY1972 through FY1979. Although the statistical information is not compre-
hensive and much of the data provided by GRC is questionable, the trend is
quite obvious: operational performance substantially declined during this
period. This was due mainly to inefficient management, lack of staff motiva-
tion and discipline, low training standards, and lack of spare parts for
maintenance of locomotives, rolling stock, telecommunication and block working
equipment which resulted from a lack of foreign currency. The local market
conditions have further deteriorated during FY1979-80 and even common user
hardware like bolts, nuts, screws, paints, etc. are not available. This
factor has led to further decline in the availability of locomotives and roll-
ing stock, thus seriously affecting the railway's ability to carry traffic.
2.13      From FY1972 through FY1978, total train-km declined by 52%, passenger
train-km also by 52% and freight train-km by 51%. Locomotive-km declined over
the same period by 50% and freight car-km by 42%. Reliable figures for those
two parameters for FY1979 are not available. Utilization of available locomo-
tives was consistently low (about 131 km/day in FY1979), while freight car use
was only 21 kms per day. Figures on wagon turnaround time are not available.
2.14      In FY1979, 29 oil-burning, steam main-line locomotives were still
in service. Availability was 52% but utilization was low due to a shortage
of fuel oil. Out of 26 steam shunters, only 22% (about 6) were available
for service. All of the steam locomotives will be phased out as soon as the
diesel locomotives rehabilitated under the proposed project are back in
service. The availability of diesel main line locomotives dropped from 77%
in FY1972 to 54% of the locomotives in service during the 3 months from
January to March 1980 (36% of the total fleet). Out of a fleet of 68 main
line diesel locomotives only 46, including 10 new ones, were in working order;
10 were awaiting rehabilitation and 12 fully depreciated locomotives have been
out of service for over 6 years and are to be written off. In addition, 29
main line working locomotives are in need of major overhauls/repairs. The
availability of all diesel shunters was about 52% out of the total fleet
during the first 3 months of 1980. Out of 31 diesel shunters in stock, 6 are
awaiting rehabilitation and 7 are to be written off.
2.15      The locomotive reliability as reflected in diesel loco-km per
failure deteriorated from 16,522 in FY1972 to 8,477 in FY1977. However a
slight but definite improvement was visible in FY1978 and FY1979, due to the
impact of the improved maintenance procedures instituted by a workshop
consultancy team provided by Consultants RITES (India) financed by the
Government. In the case of steam locomotives too, the situation is similar.
However within the past year, eleven of the old and unreliable steam locomo-
tives have deteriorated considerably and have stopped working, though the
loco-km of steam locomotives per failure has increased from 15,738 in FY1975
to 24,964 in FY1978.  This slight improvement in steam locomotive perfor-
mance was also the result of quick repairs carried out on these locomotives
as GRC's workshops and staff are at present geared to handle steam better
than diesel locomotives.



10 -
2.16      Figures on rolling stock availability are not obtainable, but it
seems to be extremely low, mainly due to the large number of fully depreciated
cars still on the books. Wagon availability is now becoming a limiting factor
on GRC's freight capacity, but some of these defects are of a minor nature and
about 30 to 40% of the defective wagons in each of these freight traffic
streams can be restored to service with relatively small inputs.
2.17      GRC's plan of action, submitted at negotiations, was aimed at
improving the quality and efficiency of GRC's operations. It was reviewed in
detail and specific targets for traffic operations, staff productivity and
locomotive maintenance schedules were agreed upon and incorporated therein
(Annex 2). The targets were graded in proportion to the inputs of equipment,
spare parts and technical assistance, which GRC will receive during the
project. The plan also includes management actions required to be taken by
GRC with relevant target dates. GRC would have to scrap 12 diesel mainline
and 7 diesel shunting locomotives in addition to 29 steam mainliners and 26
steam shunters. The existing fleet of another 14 low power locomotives would
be phased out in 5 years, as they are uneconomical to rehabilitate. This
would be compensated for by the rehabilitation and overhaul of 20 diesel
mainliners, the partial overhaul of 17 diesel mainliners and addition of 4 new
shunters. This would provide GRC with adequate capacity for carrying the best
estimate traffic and some reserve to pursue traffic which might be available
under the optimistic traffic assumption. Final agreements reached on the plan
of action, including timing and targets (Annex 2) have been incorporated in
the Credit Agreement as covenants. The achievement of these targets will be
subjected to an annual review with the Association in or about the month of
March every year commencing FY1983, to determine whether GRC's performance is
achieving the project's principal goals of rehabilitating GRC's financial
status and improving its operational performance. This review will focus on,
but will not be limited to the loan covenants dealing with Action Plan targets,
the level and cost of staffing, tariff increases and GRC's working ratio.
This review and its consequences should in no way be construed as limiting the
Association's right to invoke the remedies available under the General Condi-
tions pertaining to the Credit. The Government, at loan negotiations, agreed
to assist GRC as necessary in the implementation of all the above measures.
E.   Tariffs
2.18      Few significant changes were made in the basic railway tariffs of
January 1958 until July 1971, when a 25% general increase was effected. Sub-
sequently, appreciable revisions and rationalization were made in September
1977 and January 1979 on the recommendation of the former ODA costing advisor
based on his ad-hoc studies of railway costs and truck tariffs. The net
effect of the revisions till 1979 has been to increase tariffs approximately
in line with inflation. However, since January 1979, tariff revisions have
not offset inflation. The Government and GRC were accordingly asked to pro-
duce for discussion and agreement at negotiations proposals for an adequate
general tariff revision, Their proposals, reviewed at negotiations, envisaged
substantial increases in the freight and passenger tariffs as detailed in
the table below under the year 1981. It was agreed that these would be
implemented as soon as possible, and, in any case, before Board presentation.

2.19      Tariffs are not properly cost related in the absence of analytical
accounting and trained staff. Consequently, GRC agreed at negotiations
to carry out a specific study of costing methods and tariff structures and
levels with the help of consultant advisors and other consultants as provided
under the project (paras. 3.04, 3.06 and 3.10). GRC has further agreed to
prepare, by June 30, 1982, a Rationalization Program based on the recommenda-
tions of such studies for inter alia a new tariff structure and tariff revi-
sion procedures to be implemented according to a timetable satisfactory to the
Association.
F.   Accounting, Budgeting, Audit, and Insurance
2.20      GRC's accounting broadly follows conventional commercial principles.
Revenues are classified according to type of traffic (i.e., freight, passen-
gers, luggage and miscellaneous), and expenses are categorized according to
departmental services (way and works, locomotive, carriage and wagon, signal
and telecommunication, traffic and administration) and subcategorized accord-
ing to the nature of expenses (staff, materials, water, electricity, fuel,
etc.). Hence, the accounts do not readily disclose costs of carrying the main
types of traffic and their principal components and information on the finan-
cial viability of lines and sublines.
2.21      In the absence of a costing cell, a systematic analysis of account-
ing and operational data to determine costs is not being undertaken. The



- 12 -
establishment of such a cell is vital, and in order to facilitate general as
well as detailed costing by line and by commodity, the format of the accounts
should also be improved. Moreover, the financial accounts are over a year out
of date due mainly to a lack of qualified staff, use of old data-processing
machines and resort to some manual procedures despite the existence of a
computer, which has ample spare capacity. Furthermore, proper accounting and
valuation of assets are lacking, and consequently the financial accounts and
any costing done are somewhat unrealistic.
2.22      The proposed project addresses the above problems by providing
consultant services to simplify procedures, computerize most accounting
(including revenue, inventory and assets), revalue renewable assets, set up a
costing cell and train staff (para. 3.06). GRC agreed at negotiations,
to introduce the accounting reforms, including establishment of a special
costing section, and to effect a revaluation of the renewable fixed assets by
December 31, 1982, as part of the Rationalization Program. In view of the
importance of revaluation of assets, agreement on the procedures for this was
also reached at negotiations (para. 5.05).
Budgeting
2.23      The budget format conforms to that of the accounts and does not
permit functional budgeting and control. Improvement in the accounts format
with corresponding revision of the budget forms, introduction of analytical
accounting, and reorganization of the management structure should enable more
realistic budgeting, long-term forecasting and better financial monitoring.
GRC would have statutory responsibility for timely preparation and submission
of the annual accounts and budget to its Board and the Government, when the
GRC Decree is amended as proposed (para. 2.04).
Audit
2.24      Internal audit of revenues and expenses is done by a separate
department, which conducts test checks; these checks have revealed some
serious irregularities. Consultants RITES have made reasonable suggestions
for curtailing some checks and enlarging others which GRC will implement.
In the restructured organization, the functions of accounting and internal
audit are coordinated under a new Director of Finance. External audit is
statutorily entrusted to the Auditor-General, who maintains a special small
unit in GRC. The unit, which receives some support from the regional and
district offices, exercises continuous checks on the main and subsidiary
accounts and related records and prepares quarterly programs and progress
reports. The audit has hitherto been of a financial nature, but the Auditor-
General has issued guidelines for conducting performance audit in five stages
(planning, preliminary survey, audit program, field work and report) and for
exercising inventory control checks, purchases included. These external audit
arrangements are considered sastisfactory.
Insurance
2.25      GRC does not have outside insurance coverage, and the cost of
derailments and compensation for rail accidents (about q 500,000 a year) is



- 13 -
met by appropriation from net operating revenue. A heavy liability may result
in the event of a serious accident, and this, apart from the revaluation of
assets, is an additional reason for GRC to strengthen its finances and to
consider establishing a special fund or reserve based upon analysis with the
help of technical assistance provided under the project. The Government is
aware of the problem and would in addition endeavour to insure vital railway
equipment with foreign exchange cover for eventual replacement.
G.   Traffic Analysis
2.26      GRC freight traffic is largely exports, and about 90% of tonnage is
accounted for by four commodities (Table 2.3). Two of these, manganese and
bauxite can be economically handled only by rail; while for timber, cocoa and
other traffic GRC competes with truckers. Competition has been strong and the
railway's share of non-captive traffic has declined. The main factor determin-
ing the total volume of GRC freight traffic, however, has been a decline in
Ghanaian exports. Even if in FY1979 GRC had maintained its percentage of
cocoa and timber traffic at the FY1972 level (when total GRC freight traffic
was about double that carried in FY1979), the total volume would still be 40%
below FY1972 tonnage, at under one million tons. Consequently the analysis of
these four major traffic elements and the forecasts which follow necessitate
consideration of sectoral and macro-economic circumstances to an unusual
degree.
2.27      Ghana cocoa exports have declined both as a percentage of world
exports and in absolute terms during the last decade. Export volume was
371,000 tons in FY1973; by FY1977 it had declined to 272,000 tons and by
FY1978 to 161,000 tons. The principal causes of the steady decline in cocoa
production have been inadequate producer prices, overaged trees, lack of farm
maintenance, and disease (lack of spraying). In addition there has been
smuggling, in turn a function of the high shadow (black market) cedi/foreign
exchange rate, then prevailing. Cocoa is transported by road and rail to the
ports. However, the railway's share of the total traffic declined from 77% in
the late 1960s to 48% in FY1972 and 30% from FY1976 through FY1978. At the
same time the distribution of rail traffic has changed. In FY1967 50% of
rail traffic originated at Kumasi; by FY1978 Kumasi accounted for about 10%.
Approximately the same shares and distribution are believed to have been
obtained in FY1979 though precise information is not available. Relative
transport costs which still favor rail, cannot explain the decline, but the
Ghana Cocoa Council has complained   that GRC provides inadequate service in
terms of availability and cleanliness of wagons and punctuality of movements.
2.28      Ghanaian timber exports declined from a peak of about 840,000 tons
in 1972 to 370,000 tons in 1977. The main reason has been a substitution of
domestic consumption for exports, though smuggling has also been a factor. In
1972, 30% of logs were exported, but by 1977 only 17%. Additionally, total
recorded production has declined by about 8%. The main source of the increased
domestic demand has been in construction of public sector building, the
construction of new commercial buildings and speculative private housing. At
the same time, the sawmilling industry, in common with others, has experienced
reduced capacity due to lack of spare parts, and at least one major timber



- 14 -
company producer operating in an area served only by rail has had output
restricted by a shortage of transport capacity. The effect on rail timber
traffic has been marked. In FY1973 GRC carried 514,000 tons of timber, most
of which was exported; the rest, mainly logs, was locally consumed. By FY1978
total rail traffic had declined to 115,000 tons with the non-export propor-
tion increasing to 28% from 18%. Thus the railway had two adverse factors
to contend with: the relative growth of log traffic to sawmills which is
inherently more suitable for trucks, and increased competition from truckers
in movement of export logs (which resulted in a decline in rail carriage of
export timber from 45% to 30% of the total over the period). Additionally,
the Government in 1979 introduced restrictions on the export of some species
in log form and this further affected the railway's traffic which declined to
100,000 tons in FY1979and further to 64,000 tons in FY1980.
2.29      Manganese is produced in Nsuta and carried 61 km in block trains
to the stacking area and ship-loading facilities at Takoradi. The quality
and chemical characteristics of the manganese are not uniform and the richer
deposits are close to exhaustion. The production target, has been reduced by
mine authorities to about 325,000 tons p.a. since 1973 to prolong the mine
life. However the company has recently commenced an ore enrichment project
which is expected to maintain total shipments at about the 300,000 tons p.a.
level. Geological exploration is being undertaken in the surrounding hills
but the Ghana Manganese Corporation (GMC) is not very hopeful.
2.30      Bauxite is mined at Awaso, 266 km from Takoradi, and production
has been severely restricted by lack of railway capacity. In the past the
objective of the Ghana Bauxite Company (GBC) has been to export a minimum
of 400,000 tons p.a. This has not been achieved and during the last three
years the volume averaged only 260,000 tons annually. The sole reason for
this is a lack of railway capacity. The mining company, although Ghanaian,
has strong technical and marketing links with the former owner (British.
Aluminium Co.) and has an assured market for its production.

2.31      Other freight traffic is mainly bulk imports of petroleum carried
from the Tema refinery to Kumasi in block trains and cement from the Takoradi
plant to Kumasi. Petroleum has been given priority by GRC, acting on Gov-
ernment instructions, while cement has been constrained by effective plant
capacity, in turn restricted by shortages of imported clinker. In total,
these and other miscellaneous traffic have fluctuated from 41,000 tons to
187,000 tons annually with no apparent correlation with the general level of
economic activity.



- 15 -
2.32      In recent years, passenger traffic has declined in numbers but
increased in passenger kilometers (pass-km). A substantial tariff increase
in early 1979 appears to have been the major factor in the FY1979 decline
in traffic. However, the number of passengers carried has since recovered,
and hence stabilization at the FY1978 level is assumed. As the rail and
road economic costs of passenger services are broadly comparable, no project
benefits are assumed from passenger traffic (para. 4.07).

Freight Traffic Forecasts
2.33      Traffic forecasts by commodity group are presented in Table 2.3.
These can be considered in two groups, those traffic elements (manganese and
bauxite) the volumes of which are a function only of mining company production
intentions and GRC transport capacity, and other traffic (notably cocoa and
timber) which are, above all, sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.
2.34      Manganese.  The best forecast of manganese traffic assumes a recov-
ery over a three-year period to 300,000 tons p.a. and stabilization at this
level. It is possible, however, that with improved GRC capacity and the
discovery of new reserves traffic will increase to 350,000 tons p.a., the
approximate upper limit of GMC extraction capacity.
2.35      Bauxite.  The bauxite forecast is based upon estimates made by
GBC to the effect that if capacity permitted, it would increase production
to 500,000 tons p.a. (by selective investment in extraction and crushing
machinery), that even with existing plant 400,000 tons p.a. is achievable,
and that the likely outcome is between these two extremes at about 450,000
tons p.a. sustainable output.
2.36      Cocoa.  In forecasting cocoa traffic, the basic assumption is that
Ghana-s macroeconomic performance will improve over the coming years and that
in particular, action will be taken by the Government to rehabilitate the
cocoa sector. Comprehensive studies are already under way jointly by the
Government and the Bank to examine the problems of the sector and recommend a
program of rehabilitation. The new Government appears to appreciate the
critical importance of restoring cocoa production and has already taken action
to increase the price, although many other measures will be required. The
total volume transported should increase from the 265,000 tons in FY1979 to at
least 280,000 tons in FY1983 and 310,000 tons in FY1985. GCC has expressed
its preference for using rail transport whenever possible, and the Government
has ordained that this policy should be followed. Thus a recovery in the
railway's share should materialize. GRC produced at negotiations a signed
letter of intent from GCC that it would guarantee rail shipment of at least
80% of cocoa traffic, if GRC could provide effective capacity. Government



- 16 -
further assured at negotiations that it would closely monitor the situation to
ensure its compliance. For the economic analysis, it has been assumed that
GRC's cocoa traffic would increase to about 150,000 tons p.a. by FY1985,
although this could increase to about 240,000 tons p.a. (subject to cocoa
production).
2.37      Timber.  The Bank-s 1973 West Africa forestry sector survey (WAFSS)
made projections of Ghanaian timber production, domestic consumption and
exports. No subsequent systematic projections of these variables exists, and
accordingly the WAFSS projections are used as a basis for the following
forecasts. Alternative assumptions are: (a) total production will recover
to the minimum level forecast by FY1985, about 10% above the 1973, or (b)
stagnate at the current level; and either (c) the export percentage will
recover to the 1973 level (the WAFSS assumption) or (d) it will remain at the
1977 level. A forestry project has been identified for possible Bank Group
lending which would have as its main element rehabilitation of sawmilling
capacity, which suggests that the more optimistic forecasts for GRC timber
traffic could be justified. The results of the various assumptions are shown
below.
1973   1977    1984/5   1984/5
(a)      (b)
Production ('000 tons)        2,010   1,845   2,190    1,845
Exports (logs) (c)                               762       642
(d)             700     315      374       315
Domestic Consump-
tion (logs)  (c)                             1,428    1,203
(d)           1,310   1,520   1,816    1,530
2.38      To translate these alternative forecasts into GRC traffic, two
further assumptions were introduced: (e) GRC would maintain its share of
exports at the recent 32%, and of non-export log movements at 2% to 3%;
(f) GRC would improve its export share to the 38% level experienced as
recently as FY1976, with non-exports again at 2% to 3%. These two alter-
native assumptions, together with those for total timber movements give
a range of GRC timber traffic from 325,000 tons to 138,000 tons in FY1985.
The best estimate is of a recovery in total production to 2.2 million tons
combined with a constant export percentage and GRC traffic shares recovering
to 38% giving a GRC traffic forecast of 185,000 tons in FY1985.
2.39      Other traffic is forecast to recover slowly to the FY1978 level
after a sharp decline in FY1980 due to the low level of economic activity.
This may be a conservative assumption if the general level of economic
activity recovers but is the best estimate in the absence of either signifi-
cant correlation of this traffic volume with GDP or specific projections of
individual component commodities.

Minimum and Maximum Traffic Forecasts
Minimum
2.40      As a basis for the sensitivity analysis, both economic and finan-
cial, the following modifications are made to the best traffic projections:
(i) GRC cocoa traffic will remain at the forecast FY1980 level; (ii) the GRC
share of export timber will remain at 32%; (iii) manganese traffic will
stagnate at 250,000 tons p.a.; (iv) bauxite exports will stabilize at 400,000
tons p.a., this would extend the mine life and, in theory, the forecasting
period by about five years; the effect on the economic rate of return of such
an extension would be insignificant and no adjustment is thus made; and (v)
other traffic will recover only to about 80,000 tons p.a.
Maximum
2.41      GRC's traffic could be substantially higher than the best estimate
if the economy recovered, specific traffic items increased more rapidly than
expected or if GRC's share of non-captive traffic improved to higher but still
historically acceptable levels. In assembling an optimistic traffic forecast
which forms the basis for the plan of action, the following assumptions are
made:
(i) GRC-s share of cocoa traffic will increase to about 80%;
(ii) timber exports will increase relatively to domestic consumption to
reach the distribution predicted in the WAFSS for FY1985;
(iii) manganese exploration will be successful and output will expand to
the 350,000 tons p.a. level considered feasible by GMC;
(iv) bauxite traffic will be 500,000 tons p.a. (as best estimate); and
(v) other traffic will increase in line with GDP growth (assumed at
2-1/2 to 3% p.a.).

Future of GRC
2.42      The deterioration of GRC's management, operations and equipment are
reflected in various unsatisfactory parameters like high working ratio, low
staff productivity, high expenditures and low revenues. This persisting
decline evokes misgivings about the long-term prospects of GRC. This question
is addressed in the proposed project through a traffic study (para. 3.10(i)),
which aims to look at the three main lines and their traffic separately, so
that the viability of each line could be individually assessed and separate
financial and operating targets could be fixed. GRC has agreed that this
study will be carried out simultaneously with the study of costing methods
and tariff structures and levels with the help of consultant advisors and
other experts by June 30, 1982 (para. 2.19). Stemming from the recommenda-
tions of these studies, a new strategy for streamlining GRC will be worked
out as part of a Rationalization Program, with a fresh set of operating and
financial indicators separately for each line for monitoring the efficiency of
operations. As a follow-up, GRC will be so restructured by December 31, 1982,
that the unremunerative Eastern and Central Lines do not become a charge on
the profitable freight operations on the Western Line. The terms of reference
for the traffic and accounts studies were agreed at negotiations.

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Background
3.01      In 1972, consultants Transmark (UK) were commissioned to produce
an investment plan for Ghana Railways. This was ready in July 1973 and
generally formed the basis for the railway's FY1976-81 investment plan. The
plan was not systematically implemented and thus became out of date. In April
1976, a Bank sub-sector review mission visited Ghana and, as a result of its
findings, the Government formally requested Bank assistance later that year.
It was realized that the Government should concentrate on investments essential
to revitalizing the railway. Accordingly, a short-term rehabilitation program
incorporating the priority items of the plan was identified and forms the
basis for the proposed project which was pre-appraised in early 1978 and
appraised in July 1978 after review of a UNDP financed Management and Staffing
study completed in May 1978. The institution-building elements of the project,
upon which considerable emphasis is placed, generally follow the recommenda-
tions of the study, while the physical components have been determined as a
result of discussion between GRC and Bank staff, and of a consultant's evalu-
ation of telecommunications requirements.
B.   Objectives
3.02      The project has two main objectives.  The first is to improve
managerial efficiency by instituting modern methods of operations, mainte-
nance and financial management. The second is to provide this revitalized
management with improved equipment to enable GRC to function as a viable
transport enterprise, in particular for export traffic.  The first objective
will be addressed through substantial technical assistance concentrated in the
operational and financial fields, studies for better traffic management, cost
accounting, telecommunications and modern training facilities. The second
objective will be attained through improvement to the track and telecommuni-
cation equipment on the Western line, major overhaul of the defective loco-
motives and rolling stock and improvements to the maintenance facilities in
the workshops. It is expected that these measures will enable GRC to optimize
the use of its existing resources, recapture some of the freight traffic lost
to road, provide passenger services only where economically justified and in
short, function as a well managed and soundly equipped railway primarily
engaged in export-oriented freight movements. In formulating the project, the
lessons learned from previous Bank Group-financed railway projects have been
kept in view, namely, the need for (a) advance project preparation, particu-
larly procurement planning, (b) wider spread of project elements to cover all
areas of weakness to a reasonable extent rather than leaving some for a future
project, (c) cautious approach in framing traffic and financial forecasts, (d)
adequate project monitoring and (e) reasonably extensive periods for technical
assistance and reasonable freedom of actions for consultants.

C.   Main Project Items
3.03      The proposed Project (Table 3.1) covers GRC-s FY 1981-85 investment
plan. It includes the following components for GRC: (a) technical assistance
and studies; (b) track maintenance; (c) locomotive and rolling stock rehabili-
tation and maintenance; (d) workshop and depot modernization; (e) telecommuni-
cations and block instruments; (f) training school and equipment; in addition,
it includes technical assistance to the TPU, MTC.
Technical Assistance and Studies
(a) Management
3.04      The technical assistance for management was identified in two parts,
(i) a core-team to be in place at least six months before the commencement of
the project to prevent a further management and operational decline even
before the project started, (ii) the back-up technical assistance needed dur-
ing the project for execution of the project, conducting the studies included
in the project, and strengthening weak areas of operation and maintenance and
assisting the core team to implement the study recommendations. The Govern-
ment has met its commitment in respect of the core-team consisting of four
technical assistants--(l) Advisor to the General Manager, (2) Advisor to the
Director of Finance, (3) Advisor to the Traffic Manager and (4) Chief Mechni-
cal Engineer (in-line), the first three of whom are from CANAC Consultants
(Canada) and the last from RITES (India). The last-named expert was posted
in July 1980 the first three in December 1980 and January 1981; it is recom-
mended that the estimated cost of US$400,000 be retroactively financed
from the Credit proceeds. The project covers the core-team for the entire
project period, i.e., till the physical completion of the project. In addi-
tion to project preparation and implementation activities the core team will
assist GRC prepare by December 31, 1981 (i) a five year transportation plan
(ii) a management information system (iii) plans for reducing staff overtime
and by October 31, 1983, (iv) a long-term development plan covering FYsl985-
89, all of them satisfactory to the Association.
3.05      The second part of the technical assistance provided in the project
consists of the following experts (Annex 4): (1) Project Coordinator and
Procurement Expert, (2) Accounting Experts including Railway Cost Accountant,
(3) Traffic Control Expert, (4) Senior Mechanical and Electrical Engineers;
(5) Diesel Technicians and Workshop Pace-setters. The overall project
management will be carried out by the Advisor to the General Manager assisted
by the Project Coordinator. The Project Coordinator will be a procurement
expert who will be able to advise and monitor the procurement work of the
project in addition to exercising his coordination functions.
(b) Accounting
3.06      About 72 man-months of technical assistance will be required.
The technical assistants will be responsible for reorganizing the accounting
and budgeting systems, introducing analytical accounting (costing), assess-
ment of and recommendations for improvement of the GRC accounting department,



- 24 -
strengthening the internal audit, asset revaluation and rationalizing and
revising tariffs and staff training. The accounting experts will also dis-
charge a dual role of consultants and tariff study for (i) carrying out the
accounting, costing and tariff study envisaged under the project, asset
revaluation and strengthening of inter audit both in collaboration with as
well as for (ii) implementing the recommendations of the study. In other
words, they will not only fulfill the role of short-term consultants generally
engaged for carrying out studies, but will continue as consultants to assist
in implementing the measures needed to improve the accounting and tariff
systems in GRC and to impart the necessary extensive training to operate the
revised systems. This approach has two advantages: (a) the consultants
stay will be long enough for achieving the ultimate objectives, (b) they work
as a cohesive in-house team bringing in expertise to bear upon all aspects
of GRC's accounting, and (c) they function as a task force for the Advisor
to the Director of Finance to hammer out a comprehensive accounts and tariffs
reform scheme.
(c) Overhauling of Locomotives and Workshop and Depot Modernization
3.07      The mechanical engineering department, which is responsible for
overhauling the locomotives under the project and for maintaining the locomo-
tive fleet at peak efficiency has in the last one year been weakened by the
loss of some engineers and skilled technicians in the workshop and depots.
Even though GRC and the Government have agreed to implement a man-power
development and staff compensation plan acceptable to the Association by
December 31, 1981, the results will not accrue for some time. In the meantime,
there is an urgent need to strengthen the middle technical management and the
skilled levels for successful project implementation. Therefore, it is
proposed to finance for the project duration senior expatriate engineers and
workshop technicians with special skills to provide the technical know-how
needed in the workshops for the overhauling of the diesel locomotives and
supervise the modernization of the depots. GRC is expected to recruit and
provide counterparts early in the project execution period to gain expertise
from these specialists.
(d) Traffic Control Expert
3.08      This expert will focus attention on safety drills, organization
of wagon sorting in marshalling yards, monitoring of wagon chasing systems,
elimination of operating delays etc. He will additionally be in charge of
data collection, data analysis and field work associated with the traffic
study to be carried out in collaboration with the Adivsor to the Traffic
Manager.
(e)  Training
3.09      The project provides for a Training Manager who will advise on the
establishment of the training school, installation of training equipment,
organization of courses and supervision of instructors. As locomotive
and rolling stock training will receive special emphasis, this Training
Manager will be a mechnical engineer, so that he can coordinate the training



- 25 -
programs with the activities in the workshop and depots and organize special
courses to suit the modernized workshops and maintenance techniques. He will
be assisted by a team of specialist instructors, who will train Ghanaian
instructors and also engage themselves in the preparation of departmental
manuals, training manuals etc. This team of instructors will cover: (i)
Track and bridges, (ii) Telecommunications, (iii) Traffic, and (iv) Mill-
wright (for the machine shop).
(f) Studies
3.10      The project includes the following studies:
(i) Traffic Study. Most of GRC's freight and half its passenger traf-
fic are carried on the Western line. The Eastern and Central lines
and the various branch lines carry much less traffic and it is
doubtful if they are economically or financially viable. The
project includes a study to analyze and.assess the operational
and financial consequences of discontinuing certain unremunerative
services on these lines. This will cover examination of all traffic
on the Eastern and Central Lines and passenger traffic on the
Western Line, their economic costs and benefits and, inter alia, the
cost of alternative services, and the possibility of coordination of
road and rail services. The question of a reduction in the number
of freight booking points will also be addressed. The study will be
timed to take advantage of costing data generated by the work of the
accounting experts (paragraphs 3.04 to 3.06) and the manpower plan
(paragraph 2.07). This study will be carried out by the traffic
expert con-jointly with the accounts team, in collaboration with the
Advisor to the Traffic Manager and Director of Finance.
(ii) A study of GRC-s accounting and costing methods and tariff structure
and tariff revision procedures. This study will be carried out
by the accounting experts in collaboration with the Advisor to the
Director of Finance (paras. 2.22 and 3.06).
(iii) Telecommunications Study. The Ghanaian microwave communications
system between Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi is in the process of
development. Funds are provided for (a) a feasibility study to
determine whether GRC communications could be improved at a low cost
by integration with this system and (b) final engineering of any
resultant project. Total study time is estimated at about 8 man-
months.
Track Renewal and Maintenance Equipment
3.11      In general, the track condition on the Western line is adequate,
but with several patches of badly worn-out rails and sleepers and about 9 km
of sharp curves, where track renewal is urgently required.  The project
provides for: (i) materials needed for renewal of weak sections of the
Western Line (excluding rails, which GRC has recently acquired under an OPEC
loan), (ii) establishment of facilities for producing their own sleepers and



- 26 -
ballast, and (iii) maintenance equipment. The project does not include
routinely recurrent maintenance items. Turnouts in stations with frequent
train crossings are worn out; 22 turnouts on the Western line will be replaced
under the project. The track on the Western line is laid on hard wood and
steel sleepers.  The steel sleepers are 20-25 years old and very corroded.
The wooden sleepers are in poor condition, causing speed to be reduced to 8 to
16 km per hour over a total of about 15 km. The project provides for rehabil-
itation of GRC's sawmill which produces wooden sleepers. In view of GRC's
difficulties in the past, in obtaining timber, GRC has asked for and received
an assurance from the Government that sufficient timber will be allotted to
GRC's sawmill. Adequate track fastening for 85 km of track will be provided.
The Western line and the Awaso branch line lack sufficient ballast for effi-
cient track maintenance and the project includes equipment for two existing
quarries which GRC will lease from the gold mines to provide ample, good
quality ballast. GRC has already negotiated with the gold mines for the use
of these quarries. For track maintenance, GRC urgently needs railcars,
trollies, spare parts for existing machinery and tools, all of which are
included in the project. Some tipper trucks and vehicles needed to transport
ballast from the quarry and along the line have also been included.
Locomotive and Rolling Stock Rehabilitation
3.12      To cope with forecast traffic the project provides for procurement
of 4 new shunters and spare parts for the rehabilitation and overhaul of 37
mainline diesel locomotives. GRC obtained 10 new locomotives in 1978 but could
get only a portion of the spare parts required for their maintenance due to
foreign exchange constraints. These spare parts are now included in the
project, as the new locomotives will certainly deteriorate rapidly if the
additional spare parts are not made available. Four shunters, nearly 20 years
old, were initially proposed to be rehabilitated. It has been found that the
cost of their spare parts has gone up, due to obsolescence. It is now more
economical to replace them with new shunters, the spare parts for which would
be easily available. The spare parts for all these operations are included
in the project. The total number of freight cars available with GRC is
sufficient but many of them are in need of repairs. Under the project about
200 cars will be equipped with roller bearings and an additional 40 cars,
recently converted from wooden boxes to steel boxes, supplied with new bogies.
Moreover, in Ghana, there is a total lack of ordinary tools and hardware
items, without which the locomotive and rolling stock rehabilitation pro-
grammes cannot advance. Hence a lump-sum provision for these items has been
included. However, GRC is expected to obtain spare parts for current mainte-
nance from its own resources.
Workshop and Depot Modernization
3.13      The capacity of the workshop and the facilities available at the
depots are inadequate and ill-adapted for diesel locomotive maintenance.
With the gradual phasing out of steam locomotives, more space will become
available in the workshops but additional space will be required in Takoradi
and Kumasi depots for the new facilities required for diesel maintenance. The
project includes conversion of these workshops and addition of new machines



- 27 -
specially needed for diesel maintenance. For reprofiling the wagon axles to
enable roller bearings to be mounted, an axle turning lathe has been added.
Telecommunications
3.14      Telecommunications equipment, and block instruments are in extremely
run-down condition. Based on the consultant's recommendations, the project
will finance an over-head insulated cable connection on the Western Line,
replacing the old uninsulated conductors which were subject to frequent line
faults caused by various external factors, like inclement weather, theft of
copper wire, etc., and hence were difficult to maintain. The existing poles
along the line will be retained, after GRC takes over the whole alignment.
The capacity of the cable will be sufficient for (a) station-to-station
telephone connections; (b) administrative trunk connections between the
Central Traffic Control unit in Takoradi and Kumasi; (c) connections between
the Railway headquarters in Takoradi and major Western Line junctions; (d) the
block/token instruments. A carrier telephone system will be provided to
derive essential administrative trunk circuits mentioned above. The control
office and way-station equipment are proposed to be replaced. The project
also caters for new double line block instruments between Takoradi and Huni
Valley and single line token instruments for the rest of the Western line.
This is an important step towards improving the safety of train operations
on the Western line. GRC has finalized an agreement with the Ghana Post and
Telecommunication Corporation for taking over of the ownership and maintenance
of the overhead alignment, according to which the first section has already
been taken over. In addition, Government at negotiations has assured that it
would assist GRC in working out a joint program with Ghana Post and Telecom-
munications Corporation for the implementation of the recommendations resulting
from the telecommunication study. (para 3.10 (iii)).
Training School and Equipment
3.15      GRC personnel are trained in converted army barracks with prac-
tically no equipment. The project provides for a new training school and
hostel campus for which plans have been drawn up by local architects. Equip-
ment requirements have been assessed by training specialists of the RITES
workshop team; their recommendations are acceptable to the Bank. The Training
Centre will be equipped with: (a) a diesel training laboratory (b) a tele-
communication laboratory and a signalling model room; (c) a track maintenance
yard, consisting of typical track layouts on which simulation of actual field
track work could be organized. The Centre and its equipment will provide
induction, refresher and promotion courses and, more importantly, conversion
courses for retraining surplus and redundant labor categories.
Transport Planning Unit Technical Assistance
3.16      Technical assistance to the TPU, MTC will comprise a senior trans-
port planner and a management advisor/financial analyst for three years
each, who will be responsible for assisting in the establishment of the TPU as
the main Government transport planning body as well as specialists to carry
out for TPU a study of the road transport industry and a review of the public
transport corporations in Ghana. A total of about 100 man-months of technical
assistance will thus be provided to TPU (para. 1.20).

D.   Cost Estimates
3.17      The total cost of the proposed project including contir.gencies is
estimated at US$64.00 million equivalent net of taxes. The Government has
confirmed materials and services related to the project are free of duties and
taxes. GRC estimates for local track maintenance materials and construction
of additions to the locomotive workshops and depots and the training school
have been updated from 1976 to 1981 prices. The cost of locomotive spare
parts and of materials and machinery for workshops have been estimated by the
RITES workshop consulting team, and updated to 1981 prices and based on actual
quotations wherever possible. Similarly rolling stock equipment costs have
been updated. Cost calculations for advisor-consultant have been based on an
average of $9,200 per man month including travel and contingencies, based on
recent costs for similar services in the region but appropriately lower rates
have been taken for executive type assistants and technicians; as these
services are needed over a span of 2 to 3 years, 15% of the costs are provided
for in local currency.
E.   Contingency Provision
3.18      Physical contingencies are generally assessed at 8% except for spot
track renewals (15%) and the training school (10%). Price contingencies for
foreign costs are according to the Bank's guidelines (average 11%). Local
cost estimates are on the basis of price contingencies derived from recent
indices and trends for local materials and labor as reflected in price escal-
ation formulae, usually adopted in civil contracts in Ghana and generally
average 25% for materials and 30% for labor per year.
F.   Financing
3.19      When the project was first being appraised, ODA had promised a
program loan of about US$4.30 million equivalent to the Government for GRC's
benefit. This loan has since been made and utilized for various spare part
needs not only for locomotives but also for rolling stock, track and signal-
ling. This left uncovered a part of the locomotive repair program, which
as a consequence, was included in this project.
3.20      The project cost of US$64.0 million consists of a foreign cost of
US$42.0 million and local cost of US$22.0 million. The foreign cost is
covered by the IDA credit of US$29.0 million and parallel financing by AfDB of
US$13.0 million. The Government has agreed to re-lend US$27.7 million equiva-
lent from IDA Credit, representing the foreign cost of the project bearable by
GRC, out of the proceeds of the IDA Credit on standard Bank Loan terms under
subsidiary loan agreement. The AfDB Loan of US$13.0 million equivalent to the
Government, intended as parallel financing of the foreign cost of certain
well-identified lots of locomotive spare parts and workshop equipment, will
also be re-lent to GRC at 10% p.a. (para. 5.13). The IDA Credit includes a
provision of US$0.40 million as retroactive financing of the core-team of four
experts for their services during the period ending June 1981. Local costs
have increased to US$22.0 million equivalent, with some sharp increases
in the past year due to inflation. However the Government agreed at negotia-
tions that all local project costs, and foreign exchange needed by GRC for its



- 29 -
normal maintenance requirements during the currency of this project, will be
made available promptly, the former as a capital contribution. The financing
plan is outlined below:

G.   Project Planning
3.21      GRC has prepared most of the detailed specifications for materials
and equipment to be procured under the project with the help of the consultants
who are already in position. Similarly the detailed plans for track renewal,
construction of the training school, remodelling of the workshop and depots
have been prepared so as to avoid the usual delays in the commencement of the
procurement phase of the project. GRC has also begun a reorganization of its
store depots so that the large quantities of materials procured in the project
could be stocked and issued efficiently.



- 30 -
H.   Implementation
3.22      Track rehabilitation on the Western line will be carried out
on force account by GRC track maintenance staff, the first year being devoted
to procurement of materials and equipment. Sawmill rehabilitation and re-
establishment of two existing quarries owned by GGM will be implemented by GRC
engineers and staff under the supervision of erection specialists provided by
equipment suppliers. Expatriate technicians will help rehabilitate/overhaul
locomotives and install the workshop machines. Modernization of rolling stock
will be executed by GRC staff with the guidance of the expatriate Mechanical
Engineers. The improvements on workshops and depot maintenance facilities
will be handled in the same manner. Installation of the new telecommunication
and block instruments, and erection of overhead cables will be executed by the
supplier with as large a contingent of GRC-s staff as possible, so that the
installation expertise will not be lost to GRC. The construction of the
training school building as well as civil works in workshops and depots will
be executed by local contractors but under the technical supervision of GRC's
civil engineers. The overall project management will be exercised by the
Advisor to the General Manager assisted by an expatriate Project Coordinator.
The latter will also guide the procurement work and assist in the reorganiza-
tion of stores. The project implementation is expected to follow the time
sequence shown in the bar chart at Annex 4.
I.   Procurement
3.23      Track materials, tools and equipment, sawmill and quarrying machin-
ery, workshop machines and telecommunication equipment will be procured
following international competitive bidding procedures under the Association-s
guidelines. It is estimated that approximately US$21.6 million of the Credit
amount (75%) will be covered by ICB procedures for equipment and materials.
Locomotive spare parts and spare parts for track maintenance machinery will be
purchased through. direct negotiations with the original suppliers. GRC s
in-house staff will be used as much as possible for all works, which will be
carried out under force account, so that the skills and experience gained are
retained within GRC. Civil works for the construction of the training school
and the structural alterations in the workshops and depots are too small to
attract foreign firms and will therefore be awarded through local competitive
bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association. Small
items like common tools, general hardware and audio-visual equipment not
exceeding US$250,000 in value, subject to a ceiling of US$2.0 million in the
aggregate will be procured through local procurement procedures satisfactory
to the Association. Consultants for technical assistance and studies will be
selected according to procedures and on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association. A list of major items to be procured from abroad is given in
Annex 3. The Government has agreed during negotiation that by December 31,
1981 responsibility for procurement of materials and equipment and contracting
for civil works would be entirely entrusted to GRC's Board of Directors and
General Manager during the currency of the project. The Government has further
agreed that import licenses, letters of credit, banker-s guarantees would be
issued promptly by the various governmental organizations and the Bank of
Ghana. The import licenses once issued would remain valid for the entire
period of the project or till they are fully utilized, whichever is earlier.

J.   Disbursements
3.24      Disbursements from the IDA credit account will be made on receipt
of full documentation on the following basis:
(a)  100% of the foreign cost of materials, spare parts, equipment
and tools for (i) track renewals, sawmill and quarry equipment,
(ii) rehabilitation of diesel locomotives, (iii) freight car moderni-
zation, (iv) modernization of workshops and diesel locomotive depots
and (v) training school facilities;
(b)  100% of the foreign cost of design, supply and installation of block
token and telecommunication systems; and
(c)  85% of the total cost, representing the estimated foreign expendi-
ture component in the case of (i) technical assistance and studies
and (ii) technical assistance for transport planning.
No disbursements will be made against local costs incurred in respect of
project items included in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above. The IDA Credit
includes retroactive financing of US$400,000 for covering the consultancy
charges for the core-team of four experts retained by GRC from July 1, 1980.
3.25      The estimated schedule of disbursements from the IDA credit based
on the assumption of effectiveness by September 30, 1981 is given below.
While preparing this disbursement schedule, the following profiles were taken
into consideration: (a) IDA sectoral (transportation), (b) IDA region-wide
sectoral (transportation), (c) IDA region-wide sub-sectoral (railways),
(d) IDA country-wide (Ghana), and (e) IDA and IBRD country-wide sub-sectoral
(Ghana highways). In view of the long project preparation period during
which GRC has gained in motivation for speedy and efficient procurement, the
streamlining efforts of the team of consultants already in place and the
interest of the Government in expediting this project, it is expected that
this project would be completed in four years. The disbursement profile
retains the basic configuration of the region-wide railway sub-sectoral
profile but is projected for four years instead of five years.
3.26      The estimate schedule of disbursements from the IDA credit based
on the assumption of effectiveness by September 30, 1981, is as follows:

K.   Reporting
3.27      GRC agreed at negotiations to furnish to the Association (a) Monthly
reports on the progress of execution of the project, (b) Quarterly reports
on the traffic, financial and operational performance and (c) Annual review
report, all in forms agreed with the Association.
L.   Environmental Aspects
3.28      The project will have no adverse effect on the environment.  The
quarries to be used have already been worked by GGM. The sleeper plant
is already built, and the insulated cable will be carried on existing poles.
The depot modernization will relate to existing facilities, and the rehabili-
tation of locomotives will have a beneficial effect through the consequential
phasing out of atmosphere polluting steam locomotives.

IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   General
4.01      The proposed project, an updated component of Ghana FYs 1976-81
Economic Development Plan, is accorded considerable importance by the Govern-
ment. It has been designed to revitalize the railway, the declining opera-
tional efficiency of which in recent years contributed to the stagnation
of Ghanaian exports and of the lack of economic growth. In view of the
widespread shortage of transport in Ghana, the additional capacity the
project should produce is expected to complement rather than compete with
that of the trucking industry.
B.   Project Benefits
4.02      The project is expected to generate benefits from both capacity
increase and cost reduction. The former will enable GRC to provide addi-
tional freight capacity for traffics, such as cocoa and timber, in which
rail is a lower transport cost medium than road, and more importantly, for
bulk ore traffic for which road is not a serious competitor. Cost savings
will be derived mainly through improved locomotive efficiency, reduction
in delays and increased staff productivity.
4.03      Assessment of the above mentioned benefits requires prior determi-
nation of GRC operating costs; road vehicle operating costs; the shadow wage
and the shadow foreign exchange rate; factors influencing GRC passenger
operations. The methodology employed to make these assessments is described
below together with the results. The data base is contained in the project
file.
4.04      GRC costing procedures are as yet poorly developed.  However, the
RITES Staffing and Management Study gives a detailed analysis of staff
requirements for varying volumes of traffic and from this, together with
data on fuel and materials consumption, it is possible to make an estimate
of the average and marginal costs of GRC operations. These are shown
below:
GRC UNIT COSTS - FY1979
(pesawas/unit/km)
Average                                        Marginal

4.05      Truck operating costs in Ghana have been compiled for FY1979 by
consultants.  Adjusted to compare with GRC operating costs give the following
typical results.

4.06      There is reportedly substantial over-employment in many public
sector corporations in Ghana suggesting that the shadow wage rate is well
below unity. However, operational railway staff, who are those likely to
be dismissed, are also likely to possess basic mechanical skills in demand in
the private sector, notably construction. With retraining, their economic
value to the community should be significantly above zero. As a conservative
estimate a shadow wage of the one-third of the average level paid in GRC is
employed. The official exchange rate is Cedi 2.75/$1. However, the foreign
exchange shortage is still acute and a shadow exchange rate of Z 5.9 to $1
is employed in the basic economic calculations.
4.07      Passenger traffic, which has been relatively stable in recent years,
is widely distributed between lines and stations. Overall, railway marginal
costs and road passenger transport operating costs do not significantly differ
and thus a continuation of the distribution of passenger services between road
and rail at the present level is probably economically acceptable. However,
while both road and rail traffics are based on approximately uniform rates per
kilometer, the costs of different services probably vary substantially about
the mean. There is probably a variation also in the incidence of the resul-
tant cross-subsidization of one service by another between road and rail.
Thus there will probably be scope for rationalization of both rail and road
passenger services, and the project provides funds for the study of this
aspect (para. 3.10 (i)). On the basis of existing data, the best forecast is
that passenger traffic will remain constant, an assessment which is supported
by the fact that the Ghana Government has made clear to GRC its reluctance to
accept substantial reductions in the provision of passenger services. The
project is accordingly considered neutral with respect to passenger services,
and neither costs nor benefits are attributed to their continued provision.
4.08      The data shown in paras. 4.04 and 4.05 indicate that GRC can
presently carry freight traffic at a lower economic cost than by road. To
meet the increased freight and static passenger demand requires additional
effective capacity which the locomotive rehabilitation program together with
the workshop investment will provide. In addition to the capacity increasing
function in the project, its components will produce separately identifiable
cost reductions, described below.
4.09      Track investment including block instruments will enable the
incidence of derailments and collisions to be reduced, and additional improve-
ment in the track condition will reduce maintenance and minor repair costs.
Reduced damage to track and rolling stock comprise the cost reducing benefits
of this project component.



- 37 -
4.10      As well as providing additional capacity, the workshop investment
will enable steam locomotive operations to be phased out, substituting diesel
traction and thus reducing fuel and material costs.
4.11      Poor communications cause delays and lead to lack of control which
in turn causes accidents. The provision of block instruments will reduce the
incidence of collisions. Also to the extent that poor communications add to
GRC difficulties in supplying capacity in a timely and efficient fashion, they
contribute to the overall deterioration of the organization. The benefits of
the proposed telecommunications are thus twofold, a reduction in accidents and
increased efficiency translated through the improvement of GRC-s punctuality
record. The official timetable is not ambitious in terms of average speed but
it is rarely adhered to. Improved communications should enable it to be met,
and the effect will be a time saving which is equivalent to reduced locomotive
requirements.
4.12      The RITES report, assessed that GRC were excessively labor inten-
sive, and that with suitable capital investment, provided under the project,
staff could be reduced through redeployment, retraining and other means (para.
2.07). Technical assistance and studies will benefit all GRC operations; the
cost employed in the calculation of project economic rate of return is propor-
tionate to project related traffic.
C.   Economic Return and Distribution
4.13      The project elements has been analyzed in three main groups:  track,
workshop/locomotive rehabilitation, and telecommunications. Additionally,
costs of the training school and technical assistance, to which separate
benefits are not attributed, have been identified. Track maintenance produces
cost saving benefits through reduced risk of derailments and collisions, and
reduced staff costs through increased mechanization-of maintenance. The
workshops/locomotive rehabilitation increases capacity, eliminates excessive
costs of steam locomotive operations, and also benefits from staff reducing
mechanization. Telecommunications will provide benefits through increased
efficiency of operations, which will be translated into capacity increase
and cost reduction.
4.14      The project benefit and cost streams, l/ in constant 1979 prices,
are summarized below for the best traffic assumptions. Total quantified
benefit streams are shown in Table 4.1.

4.15      The three elements yield ERR of track 43%, locomotive rehabilita-
tion/workshop 35%, telecommunications 37%; and the project as a whole, includ-
ing the training school and attributable technical assistance, yields an ERR
of 32% on the best traffic forecast. The economic benefits from all streams
except that relating to bauxite should accrue to Ghana alone. Some of the
bauxite benefits will accrue to the British Aluminium Company. In aggregate,
about 85% of project benefits should go to Ghana.
D.   Project Risks
4.16      Most project expenditure is for equipment, and implementation
is expected over a comparatively short period of three years; thus capital
cost estimates are unlikely to be exceeded. For sensitivity analysis
increases of 10% are employed. The project is also sensitive to variations in
traffic from the best forecast; both minimum (-20%) and maximum (+30%) fore-
casts are employed. Additionally, the sensitivity to a low value added for
bauxite and thus a maximum economic return from rail transport which is less
than the road-rail economic cost differential is tested. The effect of
diverting 50% of rail passenger traffic, for which rail has a low comparative



- 39 -
advantage, to road is also tested. Finally, the sensitivity of the results to
shadow exchange rates above and below the best shadow estimate of 05.9/$l
is assessed.
4.17      The results show that with maximum costs and minimum traffic, the
project ERR would be 25% using the best estimate shadow exchange rate.
Employing ¢ 8.0/US$1 shadow exchange rates gives ERR of 34%. The effect of
50% passenger diversion reduces the best estimate ERR from 32% to 28% while
the lower bauxite value added assumption reduces the best estimate ERR to 29%.
Allowing for the estimated increase in project cost due to inflation in 1980
but without any increase in benefits and slipping the benefit stream one year,
conservative assumptions, give an ERR of 27X. The above sensitivity ERRs are
considered acceptable.

V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      When the railway functioned under the previous combined Ghana
Railway and Ports Authority, the recurring railway deficits were met from
port surpluses. In FY1977, the year preceding the separation of the railway
and port entities, a government subsidy was sought to cover the significant
railway deficit. There is no indication since then of any serious attempt to
make the railway self-supporting through adequate generation of funds from its
operation. Amendment to the GRC decree (para. 2.04 and 2.05) should require
GRC to pursue a long-term objective of achieving financial equilibrium phasing
out the need for government subsidies. The present financial evaluation
assesses the impact that implementation of the proposed project and fulfill-
ment of the prescribed operating and other targets will have upon GRC's
financial situation.
B.   Past and Present Financial Position of the Railway
5.02      GRPA income accounts (in current terms) pertaining to the railway
for fiscal years 1973 to 1977 and GRC income account for FY1978 are detailed
in Table 5.1 and summarized below:

5.03      The contribution of freight to the total operating revenue declined
during the period from 70% to 43%, while that of passengers and luggage, etc.,
rose from 26% to 52%. The share of freight is estimated to further decrease
in 1980/81 to 39% and that of passengers and luggage, etc., to increase to
58%, reflecting principally decreased freight operations, stable passenger
traffic and increased passenger tariffs. Freight mainly involves four commo-
dities--bauxite, manganese, cocoa, and timber, and tariffs in these were
increased by varying percentages following appraisal recommendations in
January 1979. Passenger tariffs were also raised substantially then. Cocoa
and bauxite tariffs were further increased by 30% and 25% in April and
May 1980, respectively (para. 2.18).
5.04      Staff strength, while reduced somewhat during the period by natural
attrition, is still excessive. This combined with substantial wage increases
resulting from Government wage policy, and extensive and probably unnecessary
overtime work (now costing over ¢ 7 million p.a.), has increased the propor-
tion of working expenses accounted for by staff costs from about 65% in FY1973
to 86% in FY1979.
5.05      Depreciation shown represents the annual contribution to the
Renewals Fund on the basis of a revaluation of fixed assets by a consulting
firm in 1971 and the book costs of assets since acquired or constructed. The
a 3 million p.a. provision is now unrealistic and inadequate and has been
increased to ¢ 5 million in 1979/80. The Government and GRC agreed at
negotiations on procedures to revalue GRC's renewable fixed assets at replace-
ment costs on the basis of a physical inventory to be completed by December
31, 1982. Proposed consultant services under the project will be utilized for
this purpose. Subsequent revaluations would be done by suitable indexation at
yearly intervals, and a physical inventory taken whenever necessary. Since
the separation of GRC and GPA on July 1, 1977, the question of settling out-
standing accounts between GRC and GPA for services rendered by one party to
the other has remained unresolved. The Government and GRC agreed at negotia-
tions to establish by June 30, 1982 a procedure for determining and settling
such payments due for FY1978 and subsequent years. It is estimated that GRC
would derive a net annual benefit of about ¢ 2 million from such a proce-
dure.
5.06      GRPA-s consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years 1975 to
1977, are detailed in Table 5.2 and GRC's balance sheet for FY1978, in Table

5.07      The underestimation of the railway assets and depreciation has been
referred to in para. 5.05 above. Of the total net value of the railway fixed
assets as of June 30, 1978, infrastructure and rolling stock account for about
40% and 45% respectively. The railway share of the investments is ¢7.4
million. The railway current assets are valued at 038 million, including
receivables of freight earnings of 04.8 million. GRC agreed at negotiations,
to reduce the outstanding freight earnings by June 30, 1982 to not more than
20% of the gross freight revenue and maintain this thereafter; such reduction
will be in the following steps: by September 30, 1981 to 40%, by December 31,
1981 to 30%; by March 31, 1982 to 25%; and by June 30, 1982 and thereafter to
20%. The Government's initial capital investment (non-interest bearing) in
the railway stands at ¢50 million and the railway-s long-term debt is 04.0
million.   The debt/equity ratio of 5/95 is satisfactory.
C. Future Financial Performance
5.08      GRC agreed, during negotiations, to effect tariff increases as soon
as possible and in any case before Board presentation. It has been assumed
for the purpose of operating revenue forecasts that the revision will be imple-
mented from the fourth quarter of FY1981. The increases will reflect the fact
that, with the exception of cocoa and bauxite, tariffs will by then have been
unaltered for nearly two years and will boost the annual revenue by 85%.



- 44 -
5.09      Four major factors will affect GRC-s longer term financial situa-
tion. Firstly, the Government and GRC have agreed at negotiations to maintain
railway tariffs in real terms by, inter alia, increasing them at least in
proportion to any general increase in GRCGs expenditure on salaries and wages
not later than three months following the incidence of any such increase.
Moreover, the proposed project includes technical assistance for a study of
GRC's accounting and costing methods and tariff structure (para. 2.19). The
terms of reference for this study will provide that the basic general tariff
policy or financial objective will be that tariffs should at least cover
variable costs with an overall aim of achieving acceptable financial results.
In the light of experience and the Government's attempts to curb inflation,
an inflation rate of 30% per annum is assumed for projecting working expenses.
The forecasts of staff costs take into account savings resulting from attri-
tion and reassignment after retraining. The 1978 devaluation of the Cedi
and oil price increases have increased material and fuel costs by over 100%
and 200% respectively between FY1978 and FY1980 and any savings through more
efficient use are likely to be offset by increased requirements resulting from
higher traffic.
5.10      Secondly, the agreed staff reduction over five years will reduce
staff costs, in real terms, both in the aggregate and as a proportion of total
costs. Thirdly, the project will enable GRC to handle a higher volume of
freight traffic, resulting in the revenue from this source, without allowing
for the impact of tariff revisions, increasing by about 65% between FY1982 and
FY1986. Finally, the above-mentioned longer term financial objective should
make freight services viable, and identify the losses on passenger services
which are a result of social objectives.  Studies on passenger services
included in the project (para. 3.10) should enable these deficit operations to
be clearly identified and appropriate Government subsidies to GRC to be
determined.
5.11      Depreciation has been calculated on the estimated cost of the
project fixed assets by the straight-line method and according to their
estimated lives based on broad categories. The existing renewable assets have
been approximately revalued for FY1983 and depreciation computed accordingly.
Subsequent revaluations and the additional provision for depreciation would
depend on the rate of inflation and any exchange rate adjustment. Expendi-
tures on technical assistance including training are capitalized and amortized
over ten years.
5.12      The combination of increased freight traffic, reduced staff numbers
and tariffs at least maintained in real terms (the revenue forecasts from 1981
are based on the assumption that tariffs would be increased at the beginning
of each fiscal year by rates ranging from 21% to 36% allowing for traffic
growth under the best traffic forecast) should effect a significant improve-
ment in the financial situation by FY1986. This is reflected in a forecast
decline in the working and operating ratios from 247% and 260% respectively
in FY1981 to 100% and 113% in FY1986. The Government and GRC agreed at nego-
tiations that GRC will take necessary measures, including but not limited to



- 45 -
tariff increases, to achieve overall working ratios of not more than 175% in
FY1982, 145% in FY1983, 125% in FY1984, 110% in FY1985, and 100% in FY1986 and
thereafter. They have further agreed that these overall working ratios will
be revised and separate working ratios for the Western Line, the Central Line
and the Eastern Line will be fixed for FY1983 and succeeding fiscal years
following the results of the aforesaid traffic and costing and tariff studies.
However, GRC is unlikely to cover operating costs for some years, and the
Government has agreed to continue subsidy payments towards operating losses
excluding depreciation until the above-cited studies are completed by June 30,
1982 and revised arrangements and targets for GRC-s financial performance and
the Government's future subsidies are agreed with the Association. The
forecast income accounts in current terms (detailed in Table 5.3 are sum-
marized as follows:

As it is envisaged that GRC would not be in a position to make any appreciable
contribution to the financing of the project, the entire local cost of 459.95
million allocable to GRC will be met by a Government capital contribution. The
Government is also expected to finance GRC-s non-project capital expenditure
till the completion of the project. The Government's agreement to meet these
obligations has been obtained at negotiations. GRC could be made liable to
pay a dividend on the Government capital contribution or the contribution
could be converted into a loan if GRC's finances improve sufficiently in the
long run. The probable terms of the proposed loans to help finance the
project are as follows: Government Loan of the equivalent of US$27.70 million
to GRC out of the proceeds of the IDA Credit--20 years including 5 years of
grace with interest at 9.60% p.a. and a commitment charge of 0.75%; Government
Loan of the equivalent of US$13.00 million, representing the proceeds of the

1/   Subject to audit
5.15      The value of the net fixed assets in use increases substantially in
1983 due to the initial revaluation and subsequently due to capitalization
of the project assets. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities
remains feeble and just satisfactory due mainly to the impact of freight
receivables, which though expected to be maintained at 20% of the related
gross revenue, will continue to mount with annual increases in such revenues.
The debt-equity structure remains reasonable even after project financing as
indicated by the relative ratios. At negotiations, the Government and GRC
agreed to the following conditions:
(i)  GRC will not incur any long-term debt, except in prior agreement
with the Association, unless its net revenues are at least 1.5 times
its maximum future debt service requirement; and
(ii)  GRC will not until December 31, 1985, undertake any investment or
group of investments other than the Project exceeding in the
aggregate cost an amount equivalent to US$1 million p.a., except
in consultation with the Association.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.16      A significant increase in project cost is not expected.  Even if
such an increase amounts to 10%, the resulting higher annual debt charges,
ranging up to ¢1.0 million can be met by GRC through a tariff revision
or from the increased depreciation provision. However, if the minimum or



- 48 -
pesimistic instead of the best freight traffic forecast materializes, the net
annual shortfall in revenue, at revised tariffs assumed to be effective from
April 1, 1981, after allowing for some saving in expenditure, will range from
¢ 6.7 million to ¢ 11.1 million during FYs1982-86. Should both adverse
factors operate during this period, the total maximum financial gap would be
about ¢ 12.0 million in FY1985. Since the minimum additional revenue GRC
is expected to raise in a year ranges from ¢ 15 million to ¢ 80 million
during this period, the further tariff adjustments needed to meet the higher
deficit would probably be feasible. However, if such adjustments do not prove
practicable, allowing for the generation of additional revenue through tariff
increases proportionate to the minimum traffic forecast, the maximum GRC work-
ing ratios would be as follows: FY1982-196%, FY1983-169%, FY1984-146%,
FY1985-131% and FY1986-119%.
5.17      Should freight traffic reach the maximum or optimistic forecast
levels, the extra annual freight revenue at revised tariffs assumed to be
effective from April 1, 1981 will range from ¢18.1 million to 026.4
million during FYs1982-1986. This could absorb higher debt charges resulting
from any increase in project cost and necessitate lesser tariff increases than
anticipated under the best traffic forecast. Allowing for the generation of
additional revenue through tariff increases proportionate to the maximum
traffic forecast, the working ratios would be as follows: FY1982-141%,
FY1983-119%, FY1984-101%, FY1985-88% and FY1986-80%.
