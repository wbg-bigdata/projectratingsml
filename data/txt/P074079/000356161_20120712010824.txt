F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (PDO)
The development objective of the Road Development Program, Phase 3 (RDPP3) project
is to improve access to rural and economically productive areas and to progressively

                                                ii
continue to build up sustainable road sector planning, design, and program management
capability, including road safety management.

The project comprises: (i) upgrading and strengthening of three high priority national
roads: Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe-Wobulenzi; Soroti-Dokolo-Lira; and Busega-Mityana;
(ii) designing the upgrade of about 300 km of district roads reclassified as national roads,
which therefore are required to meet the National Road Standard; (iii) studying, through
the use of consultancies, the feasibility of upgrading to bitumen standard about 600 km of
priority national roads (iv) rehabilitation/re- graveling of the Atiak-Moyo road; (v)
constructing a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; (vi) developing
institutional support for the establishment of the Road Authority, and (vii) provisioning
of external auditing services.

 These project objectives complement the objectives of the Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) Phase I and II projects in meeting the overall objectives of the Road Development
Program.

Revised Project Development Objectives

Although some project sub-components were dropped, following the mid-term review,
and the scope of some components were revised, the project development objectives
remain unchanged. Due to the high bids received on the first three civil works contracts,
the target for upgrading of gravel roads was revised from 178 km to 152 km. Similarly,
the target for rehabilitation of paved roads was revised from 72 km to 15 km, with the
GoU agreeing to finance the rehabilitation of the other 57 km of the Busega-Mityana road.
At the request of the GoU the Atiak-Moyo road was left to be financed by the
government, with the understanding that the road would be upgraded to paved standard.
GoU has now financed seven bridges on this road and ferry landings where the Atiak-
Moyo crosses the river Nile. The actual achieved achievement, including the GoU funded
roads, were the upgrading of 152 km of gravel roads and the rehabilitation of 72 km of
paved roads.

At appraisal, baselines for the PDO indicators had not been established. Accordingly, the
PDO baseline indicators were established in May 2005, with these targets being used
during the entire credit period.

H. Restructuring

The project was restructured on April 25, 2007, November 11, 2009 and on January 12, 2011.
The April 2007 restructuring was to amend the Credit to 100 percent financing by IDA.
During the restructuring of November 2009, some of the components were dropped,
primarily due to the high bids received on the civil works contracts. The restructuring
involved dropping of some of the components of the project, the reallocation of credit
proceeds and extension of the closing date. The restructured project dropped the civil works
for: (i) the upgrading of the Zirobwe-Wobulenzi road (23 km); (ii) the re-graveling of the
Atiak-Moyo road (91 km); (iii) the reconstruction and upgrading of the Busega-Mityana road
(57 km); and (iv) construction of the UNRA/MOWT Headquarter building. The funds
allocated to these dropped activities were reallocated to meet the shortfall of funds for the
upgrading of the Soroti-Lira road (125 km) and Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road (44 km) of
the project. The Credit was then amended to allow for 20 percent of GoU financing of the
civil works. The January 2011 restructuring was to allocate the unallocated funds to
Categories 1 and 2 (works and services).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design
1.1    Context at Appraisal
1.     In 2000, The World Bank’s (WB) Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uganda
had the primary objective of reduction of poverty through a medium-term strategy
focused on private-investment-led growth and export diversification. Lowering transport
costs and improving reliability of access to infrastructure were considered in the CAS as
key elements to facilitate business development and to support poverty reduction.
Regionally targeted public investment—mainly in northern Uganda, which has lagged
behind due to two decades of insurgency—was also considered as a key element of the
CAS.

2.      At project appraisal in 2004, the transport infrastructure in Uganda was comprised
of: (i) a road network of about 34,000 km, out of which 10,000 km were national roads,
21,000 km district roads, and 3,000 km urban roads; (ii) a railway system of about 1,350
km; (iii) wagon ferry services on Lake Victoria; and (iv) air transport facilities including
one international airport and eleven domestic air fields. Road transport was by far the
most dominant mode of transport and played a pivotal role in supporting the economic
and social development programs. The roads carried over 90 percent of the country’s
passenger and freight transport and provided the only form of access to most rural
communities. The classified roads, which make up only 30 percent of the network,
carried 80 percent of the total road traffic. Uganda's road network has also served as a
transit corridor linking the landlocked neighboring countries of Rwanda, Burundi, parts
of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and southern Sudan to the sea.

3.     Centrally located in the East African region, the road network is of national and
regional strategic importance, as it helps Uganda play a crucial role in the region's
economy and regional cooperation. Prior to 1974, Uganda had one of the best road
networks in sub-Saharan Africa. The whole road network deteriorated sharply between
1974-1985 due to neglect, mismanagement, and lack of adequate maintenance: a
consequence of civil strife and disruption of civil administration. The neglect of road
maintenance resulted in increased transport costs, reduced transport fleets, and an
approximate 75 percent loss in road network investment due to deterioration. During that
period, Uganda registered negative economic growth, and declining agricultural and
industrial production, while population growth continued to increase at over three percent
per annum.

4.     Since 1986, government policy has focused on improved transport and
communication infrastructure for accelerated development and to revamp the economy,
as well as to consolidate national unity and regional cooperation. The 1986-1995
rehabilitation and maintenance efforts improved the condition of the road network from
less than 10 percent in a good state of repair in 1986 to approximately 70 percent of main
roads and about 40 percent of district feeder roads by 1995. This duly impacted the
development of the national economy, such that Uganda registered average annual
growth rates of six percent in the 10 years from 1985 to 1995, with the economy 70
percent larger than it was in 1985.


                                             1
    5.     The World Bank’s Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was an International
    Development Association (IDA) contribution to the Government of Uganda’s (GoU)
    Road Sector Development Program (RSDP); which was developed in 1995 and endorsed
    by the participating development partners at a Donor’s Conference held in Paris on
    November 30, 1996. The primary purpose of the RSDP was to improve access to rural
    and economically productive areas by removing major constraints to transport services on
    the country's road network. The RSDP also aimed to support actions related to further
    strengthening of the road sector management.

    6.     The projected total expenditure under the RSDP, over the first ten years, was
    estimated at about US$1.5 billion in constant prices at the end of 1998. The initial RSDP
    was updated to a rolling RSDP and was endorsed by stakeholders, including Donor
    Partners, at a road conference held in Kampala in April 2002. The RSDP originally
    focused on the national road network, but the review of 2002 took on board the district,
    urban and community access roads (DUCAR). The projected expenditure for the updated
    RSDP for the 10 years from 2001/02 to 2010/11 was estimated at US$2.28 billion and
    had three major components: (i) the national road sub-sector (69.5 percent), the DUCAR
    sub-sector (25.3 percent) and road sector institutional development and capacity building
    (5.2 percent) of the program cost.

    7.    Out of the RSDP cost, around US$1.4 billion had been secured in 2004, leaving a
    funding gap of about US$0.88 billion. The Bank provided funding to the RSDP through
    an APL instrument in the total amount of US$289.35 million. The APL 1 and 2 were in
    the amount of US$90.98 million and US$64.52 million respectively. The Road
    Development Program Phase III (RDPP3), the third phase of a four-phased APL
    program, provided US$107.6 million.

    1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
    8.    The development objective of the Road Development Program, Phase 3 project
    was to improve access to rural and economically productive areas and to progressively
    continue to build up sustainable road sector planning, design and program management
    capability including road safety management. The project components are: (i) upgrading
    and strengthening three high priority national roads: Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe-


                                                                  2
Wobulenzi; Soroti- Dokolo-Lira; and Busega-Mityana roads; (ii) designing the upgrade
of about 300 km of district roads reclassified as national roads, which therefore are
required to meet the National Road Standard; (iii) studying, through the use of
consultancies the feasibility of upgrading to bitumen standard of about 600 km of priority
national roads; (iv) rehabilitation/re-graveling of the Atiak-Moyo road (91 km); (v)
constructing a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; and (vi) developing
institutional support for the establishment of the Road Authority; and provisioning of
external auditing services. These project objectives complement the objectives of the
Phase I and II projects in meeting the overall objectives of the Roads Development
Program. The core indicators, included: (i) increase in the share of rural population with
all-season access; (ii) increase in the proportion of the road network in good condition;
and (iii) direct project beneficiaries (number), of which the percentage of female.
1.3    Revised PDO and Key Indicators
9.     Following the mid-term review, the Credit was restructured and the scope of work
revised for some components. The project development objective remained unchanged as
agreement was reached with GoU that they would finance the components that were
dropped. As a result, it was not necessary to make any changes in the key indicators.
1.4    Main Beneficiaries
10. The primary target group or main beneficiaries of the project were the road users,
who were to gain from travel time savings and vehicle operating cost (VOC) reduction as
a result of improvements on the main roads. The roads under the program serve areas of
good agricultural potential in central, eastern, and northern Uganda and the road
investments benefited agricultural producers and consumers as demonstrated by the
increase in traffic. Furthermore, the privately provided commercial bus services were
capable of competitively extending coverage and improving service frequencies to more
remote and less developed areas of the project after responding to the road improvements.
To this extent, VOC savings also benefited low-income road users leading to
improvements in their accessibility to markets and social services.

11. The communities living along the roads benefited from growth in trade, economic
activities, and the introduction of awareness creation of cross cutting issues of road safety
matters such as speed controls, sealed verges, road signs etc. In addition, the project also
benefitted the Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT), the former Road Agency
Formation Unit (RAFU), now the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), and local
governments. RDPP3 also contributed support of the preparation and launching of the
National Transport Master Plan (NTMP). The NTMP is being used as a guiding principle
for making decisions relating to planning and development of transport projects in the
country and in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area. As the improved road projects
were part of a comprehensive countrywide road investment strategy, the overall RDPP3
project contributed a great deal to fostering economic growth and poverty alleviation
through improvement in accessibility and market integration. RDPP3 is succeeded by the
on-going Transport Sector Development Program (TSDP); which is a three years Specific
Investment Loan (SIL).

1.5    Original Components
12.   The original project was comprised of the following parts:

Component 1: Civil works for upgrading, rehabilitation and reconstruction of national
roads including: (i) upgrading of about 125 km of the Soroti-Lira road to paved (bitumen)
standards; (ii) upgrading of about 68 km of the Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe-Wobulenzi
road; (iii) rehabilitation and re-graveling of about 91 km on Atiak-Moyo road; and (iv)
reconstruction and upgrading of the 57 km Busega-Mityana road.

Component 2: Civil works for construction of headquarters building for MOWT and the
Road Authority
Component 3: Roads construction supervision services for construction of roads referred
to in Component.1
Component 4: Review and update of detailed engineering design and preparation of
tender documents, verification of economic feasibility for reconstruction of the paved
roads and completion of environmental and social assessments for Busega-Mityana road,
all through the provision of technical advisory services.
Component 5: Roads feasibility and detailed engineering design for: (i) upgrading of
about 300 km of district gravel roads to national roads at paved (bitumen) standard; and
(ii) upgrading of about 600 km of national roads from gravel to paved (bitumen) standard
and detailed design of selected roads thereof, all through the provision of technical
advisory services.
Component 6: Institutional support and establishment of the Road Authority, comprising:
(i) provision of training and technical advisory services to consolidate the institutional
reform process, including establishment and commencing operations of the Road
Authority; (ii) strengthening institutional support for implementation of Components 1
through 5 of the project; and (iii) provision of external audit services.
1.6    Revised Components
13.   The scope of the revised project components include:

Component 1:
     i) Upgrading from gravel to paved (bitumen) standard of the Kampala-Gayaza-
          Zirobwe-Wobulenzi road dropped the Zirobwe-Wobulenzi (23km) section of
          the road.
     ii) The reconstruction of the Busega-Mityana road (57km) dropped from the
          credit, but funded by the Government.
     iii) The rehabilitation and re-graveling of Atiak-Moyo road (91km) scope of work
          reduced only to design works for upgrading the road to paved (bitumen)
          standard and the Government agreed to finance the civil works part.

Component 2: Civil works for construction of UNRA headquarter building dropped.




                                            4
Component 3: The supervision works of the components under Component 1 dropped
and Government financed the corresponding consultant’s services. The GoU agreed to
undertake the project financing.

Component 4: Detailed designs on total length of roads slightly increased to 312km
from the planned 300km.

Component 5: Feasibility studies and engineering designs reduced to 300km from
600km of high traffic national roads only to include: Gulu-Atiak-Bibia-Nimule (104km);
Vurra-Arua-Koboko-Oraba (92km); Atiak-Moyo-Sudan border (104km).

Other significant changes

14. The project was restructured on April 25, 2007 to allow for 100 percent financing
by IDA because of a lack of counterpart funding from GoU. The amended Development
Financing Agreement (DFA) provided for the Credit to pay for taxes levied by, or in the
territory of the Borrower, on the goods or services to be financed under the Financing, or
on their importation, manufacture, procurement, or supply.

15. A second restructuring on November 11, 2009 was prompted by a shortfall
resulting from higher than anticipated bids received on three works contracts tendered,
out of the seven contracts originally planned for implementation under the Credit. Thus,
the DFA was amended to: (i) drop the components that could not be financed under the
Credit; (ii) reallocate the amounts in Category 1(b) of SDR 16.53 million to meet the
shortfall in Category 1(a); to allow for 20 percent GoU financing of civil works under
Category 1 of the Credit; (iv) extend the closing date by 22 months from December 31,
2009 to October 31, 2011; and (v) change the name of the implementing agency from
RAFU to UNRA.

16. A third and final restructuring was carried out on January 12, 2011 to reallocate the
amounts in Category 3 (unallocated) of SDR 5.451 million to Categories 1 and 2 so as to
complete the remaining civil works contract for upgrading Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe
road and the related supervision consultancy services; and to drop the requirement for
completion of environmental and social assessment of the Busega-Mityana road that was
dropped from Component 3 of the project.

17. Project Design, Scope and Scale: When the RDPP3 project faced large cost
overruns it was intended for a while that the RDPP4 would be reshaped to finance such
overruns. However, during a bi-lateral meeting between MOWT and the IDA in October
2008, it was decided that the cost overruns, which could not be financed by the RDPP3
project, could be financed by GoU from its increased road sector allocation. Accordingly,
the Busega-Mityana road and bridges on the Atiak-Moyo road were financed by the GoU.
Apart from the amendments mentioned above, no other changes were made to the project
design scope and scale.

18. Implementation Schedule: The original project closing date was December 31, 2009.
On June 19, 2009, the government requested IDA to amend the DFA and extend the


                                            5
closing date by two years. On November 11, 2009, IDA issued a letter to GoU to amend
the Development Finance Agreement (DFA) and extended the closing date by 22 months
from December 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011.

19. Funding Reallocation: The final project cost at completion is US$239.34 million
(US$116.40 million IDA credit/grant; US$122.94 million government contribution)
against the commitment of US$133 million. This indicates that there was an overall
increase of 80 percent at completion as compared to the original commitment of US$133
at appraisal. As a result, the GoU contribution increased from 20 percent to 51 percent at
completion, inclusive of the dropped project components.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry
20. The Four Phased Roads APL was envisaged in the Bank Group's CAS discussed
by the Executive Directors on November 16, 2000. The APL was an appropriate choice
of lending instrument for the long-term development of Uganda's road sector. The
program was simple in design, limiting itself to civil works for national roads and some
district roads, plus institutional support for creating an autonomous road authority and a
road fund. Suitable measures were included to transform the Road Agency Formation
Unit (RAFU) to a full-fledged autonomous Uganda National Road Authority (UNRA)
and to allow for continued dialogue with the borrower on the establishment of a Road
Fund. The borrower fully participated in the preparation of the project and remained
committed to the project objectives, in particular the road upgrading. On the institutional
front there was strong ownership, as evidenced by the creation of UNRA and a Road
Fund.

21. The project supported the government’s RSDP which is a critical element of its
overarching strategy for poverty reduction. The RSDP nonetheless required regular and
substantial infusions of capital support for infrastructure improvement and maintenance.
The RDPP3 project was designed to provide a blend of grant and credit to ensure that the
government’s financing requirements would be met, commensurate with its borrowing
capacity and with acceptable progress towards debt sustainability. At the introduction of
IDA grants in September 2002, the RDPP3 project was selected to receive IDA grant
financing in view of the complementarily of the RSDP goals with those of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Credit (PRSC) and the specific contribution of infrastructure
improvements targeted to increased mobility and access to services and markets of the
rural poor.

22. The project design was relevant, appropriate and responsive to the client’s needs as
it was part and parcel of the Road Development Program, in line with the GoU National
Development Plan (NDP) and the RSDP. The Bank also shared knowledge and
experience gained from the Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) in Africa to help support
the GoU and donor community efforts in the preparation of the RSDP. In addition, a
series of information-sharing and consultation meetings took place with the donor
community during project preparation about the RDPP3 project. As a result, the overall
risk at project appraisal was assessed as “moderate.? The project had inbuilt price and


                                            6
physical contingencies as well as the unallocated amounts to cater for any cost overruns.
However, due to the long period of time that elapsed from appraisal to implementation,
the contingencies were found to be inadequate to respond to the cost overruns and
changing circumstances at project implementation.

23. Quality of Procurement in Project Design: At project appraisal, procurement
aspects at design were straight-forward since this project was the third phase of the APL.
All procurement arrangements, including a procurement plan, a project implementation
plan, and procurement methods consistent with the World Bank guidelines, were
discussed and agreed upon. The project primarily included procurement of large civil
works contracts, requiring pre-qualification, for upgrading/strengthening of major roads.
Other contracts were for consulting services for the supervision of the civil works
contracts, carrying out design and feasibility studies on reclassified national and district
roads, and data collection on the national roads network. RAFU was responsible for
managing mainly donor-funded projects. Many donors were involved and appropriate
coordination and control mechanisms were put in place. As such, Phases 1 and 2 of the
program were implemented with some comfort with respect to GAC and no specific
provisions were included in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD). However, during the
implementation of the project, governance issues were noted and appropriate measures
were taken to address them. This included the carrying out of independent procurement
and technical audits and the overall restructuring of the procurement functions of UNRA.

24. Value for Money Assessment of the Procurement of the Civil Works Contracts: The
procurement of each of the three civil works contracts were assessed by the Operations
and Procurement Review Committee to determine that each one returned good value for
money. The prequalification documents and confidential cost estimates were prepared in
2004 and revised estimates were prepared in 2006 prior to the invitation of bids to give an
indication of the possible changes in price escalation. The bids opened between
December 2006 and March 2007, were on average 36 per cent above the updated
Engineer’s estimates. A value for money cost analysis was carried out based on: (i) the
local market cost analysis for fluctuation in prices of petroleum products, power, and
materials from quarries which came out in the bids as high cost items; (ii) road
construction unit costs for similar projects in the region which seemed to be on the rise;
(iii) the effect of insecurity, specifically for the Soroti-Lira road which was affected by
insurgency at the time of bidding; (iv) pre-financing cost of guarantees, insurance
premiums, delayed payments to contractors in previous contracts, and the implications on
the prices of bids received. The conclusion was that the engineer’s estimates did not
adequately address these issues. The analysis, based on sample contracts from elsewhere
confirmed that the region had experienced massive price escalations in the cost of road
construction contracts within the two years preceding the time of preparation and
submission of the bids. A highway design and maintenance model (HDM) was re-run,
with the lowest evaluated bid price, showed that the projects were still viable, with an
economic internal rate of return (EIRR) above 15 percent for each road project.

25. Quality of Financial Management Aspects in Project Design: There was a
dedicated Finance and Administration Division, in RAFU/UNRA, that was responsible
for all aspects of financial management. A well-documented Financial Management


                                             7
Manual was developed. The manual outlines internal control procedures as well as
financial reporting arrangements for the funding received from the GoU budget, IDA, and
other donors. Prior to appraisal, the accounting system was fully computerized based on a
double entry accounting system. The financial management (FM) system was well
established with experienced and knowledgeable staff, modified financial manual, and
appropriate technology requirement to support the FM system. At appraisal, the FM
system was performing satisfactorily. However, the project was subject to statutory audit
regulations through which the internal audit function was provided by the Ministry of
Works and Transport. This service was limited to the pre-audit inspection of the project’s
transactions. The project envisaged a transition from RAFU to UNRA, which would have
an internal audit function in accordance with the UNRA Act.

26. Quality of Environmental Aspects in Project Design: The project was classified as
a Category B project with no potential impact on wildlife or national parks.
Environmental aspects were integrated into project design to a large extent. Key
stakeholders included in the project were: the National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA), the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), the RAFU, the Ministry of
Works and Transport (MOWT), concerned groups, NGOs, and local communities who
were to participate through public consultations, field visits, and surveys for the project.
The steps undertaken for environmental assessment and the environmental management
plan (EMP) preparation included the following: determination of the scope of the
environmental impact assessment (EIA); preparation of the terms of reference (TOR) for
the EIA that captured the importance of preparing and implementing a comprehensive
EMP; review of the coverage of the TOR; approval of the TOR by NEMA; information
retrieval and consultation with the affected people and local non-governmental
organizations (NGOs); comparison of alternatives; assessment of impacts; and proposal
of mitigation and monitoring measures.

27. The EIA was carried out for each road project as part of the detailed feasibility
studies for the following purposes: (i) to prepare a comprehensive investigation
delineating any environmental impacts of the proposed road works; (ii) to describe and
quantify these impacts; (iii) to draw up feasible mitigation measures for minimizing,
eliminating or offsetting any adverse effects; and (iv) to recommend the most appropriate
mitigation and/or enhancement measures. Mitigation measures were incorporated in the
final road designs and contract documentation, and those with appropriate expertise were
included in the supervision consultants’ staff to carry out such measures. An
environmental and social monitoring plan was developed for each project road outlining
the nature, location, and methodology of monitoring that should take place during the
construction of each road.

28. Quality of Social Safeguards in Project Design: The social agenda was adequately
outlined in the original project documentation. The key issues that were identified as
relevant to the project objectives included: the likely impacts on road safety due to an
increase in the number of accidents; impacts on public health resulting from dust and the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and Human Immunodeficiency
Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS); and degradation of air and
water quality caused by dust, soil erosion, and siltation of water bodies/sources. Road


                                             8
safety audits out under the Roads Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance
project (RSISTAP) provided the basis for safety considerations in road design,
construction and maintenance. Each of the physical components included in the Phase III
Project included provisions for qualified on-site clinic screening and counseling for
HIV/AIDS and STD, and awareness and training programs for workers and local people,
with associated costs included in the construction contracts. A social impact assessment
(SIA) for the physical components was conducted prior to appraisal in conjunction with
EIA for the roads selected for upgrading and strengthening. For each road project, the
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) team included a social scientist.
Socioeconomic data were collected and analyzed from each of the areas where the road
improvements were planned. The ESIA included analysis of the temporary and localized
social and microeconomic impacts resulting from construction activities. Further separate
site specific resettlement action plans (RAP) for the roads were undertaken to determine
the need for land take, prepare compensation for assets that would be lost and
rehabilitation of the facilities for the project-affected persons.

29. Risk Assessment: A risk analysis was carried out and mitigation measures were
identified. The identified key risks include: (i) total annual development and recurrent
budget estimates are not made available in accordance with projections; (ii) GoU
counterpart funds are neither budgeted nor released on time; (iii) annual road network
maintenance program is not implemented as scheduled; (iv) government does not prepare
legislation and support proclamation for the establishment of a Road Authority by end of
2005 and subsequently no transfer of agreed management functions for national roads
from MOWT to the road authority; (v) an adequate social plan for redundant MOWT
staff is neither developed nor funded; (vi) security problems in some project areas inhibit
surveys, detailed engineering, and construction; (vii) detailed studies of individual roads
do not conform to the economic viability of selected roads and do not address social and
environmental aspects; and (viii) internal audits limited to pre-audit of expenditures with
no review of internal control system.

30. The risk mitigation measures mainly relied on the experiences from the outcomes
and the prevailing conditions of the parallel and ongoing APL components of RDPP1 and
RDPP2. These comprised: (i) a rolling three-year Transport Sector Investment Recurrent
Expenditure Program (TSIREP) produced every year in consultation with the Bank and in
consistency with the Medium Expenditure Framework (MTEF); (ii) funding targets for
the life of the program confirmed in letter of development policy; (iii) a maintenance
program updated in line with the updating of the TSIREP by March 31, each year; (iv)
Cabinet approval sought before end 2004 so that legislation for establishment of a roads
authority can be tabled in Parliament in a timely fashion; (v) creation of the legal
framework for the establishment of a roads authority to provide for a properly constituted
internal audit function; and (vi) transfer of maintenance function to the roads authority,
when established.
31. The risk due to the unforeseen procurement delay that led to costs escalations was
not adequately addressed by the price/physical contingencies and the unallocated amount
in the financing agreement. Overall the project risk mitigation measure rating was
assessed as “Modest.?


                                            9
32. The project was not subjected to a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review at
entry.
2.2    Implementation
33. The Bank approved the project on September 2, 2004, the DFA was signed on
February 23, 2005, and the credit became effective on June 23, 2005 after a delay of five
months. At the request of government, the financing agreement was amended on April 25,
2007 to allow for 100 percent IDA financing of consultancy services and civil works. A
mid-term review (MTR) took place in May 2008 and identified the need to drop the
components that could not be financed as a result of high bids received on the first three
civil works contracts and to extend the closing date of the credit due to delays
experienced in procuring the civil works contracts. It was therefore recommended that the
credit be amended to: (i) drop some of the project sub-components; (ii) extend the closing
date by 22 months; and (iii) change the name of the implementing agency from RAFU to
UNRA which was to become effective on July 1, 2008. Accordingly, on November 11,
2009, the DFA was amended to drop the components that could not be financed. Further,
due to initial delays in procurement of the civil works contracts, the Closing Date was
extended by 22 months from December 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011. On January 12,
2011 a final amendment to the DFA was effected to reallocate the “unallocated? amount
on the credit to enable completion of the remaining civil works contract for upgrading
Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road and the related supervision consultancy services. Overall,
there was a further increase in costs of the three civil works contracts due to: (i)
additional works that were not envisaged at the design stage, and (ii) price escalation for
which the provision in the price contingencies was not adequate.
2.2.1 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
Factors outside the Control of the GoU or Implementing Agencies

34. Limited Construction Sector Capacity: It was evident that there was a low
construction industry capacity in Uganda, with very few contractors who had the capacity
to handle ICB projects at the time of appraisal. Further, there were contractors with
limited financial and technical capacities, leading to limited competition and lengthy
verification processes on the performance of previous projects.

35. Insecurity: Some of the project roads fell in areas that were experiencing
insurgency at the time of appraisal and commencement of the works. As a result, the
response to the invitation for bids was poor.

36. Shortage in the Supply of Fuel: The temporary closure of the refinery at Mombasa,
followed by an intermittent break down of operations of the oil pipeline from Mombasa
to Eldoret, as well as the political crisis in Kenya at the of end 2007 to early 2008 created
a fuel supply shortage. This contributed to the overall slow project progress and affected
the civil works contracts both in completion delays and cost overruns.

37. Global Economic Crisis: The global economic situation affected the prices of
inputs. This is a fact that was acknowledged by the QAG Report of November 2008. For



                                             10
example, while the price of a barrel of oil was US$43.03 at appraisal in August 2004, the
registered price in November 2006, 28 days prior to opening of bids was US$58.48, a 26
percent increase from the cost at appraisal. During the implementation of the civil works
contracts, the price of a barrel of oil continued to fluctuate, generally with an upward
trend and with a peak of US$133.90 in July 2008. The average price during the execution
of the civil works contracts was US$77.35, which is 32.3 percent above the price 28 days
prior to bid opening or 80 percent above the price at appraisal. In terms of contracts
management, this resulted in higher than expected values of price adjustment for which a
price contingency of five percent was provided in the project. In real terms, price
adjustments followed the percentage increase of the price of a barrel of oil as the
production and transportation of all other inputs were affected by the price of oil.

Factors Generally Subject to Government Control

38. Counterpart Funding: The project was designed to provide for 20 percent
counterpart funding on the civil works component and 10 percent on the consultants’
services. At the request of government, the Credit was amended to provide for 100
percent financing of the civil works and consultants’ services. However, when bids were
opened for the first three civil works contracts, the total sum of the contracts was 43
percent over and above the available funds for this category of expenditure on the
Credit/Grant. Hence, the GoU had to commit additional financing to meet the shortfall
for the three contracts that were signed. Accordingly, the DFA was amended to provide
for 20 percent financing of the civil works by government, leaving the consultants’
services to be financed 100 percent by IDA. However, at closure, there were still
outstanding payments on completed works, including retention, which the government
committed to finance as the Credit is fully disbursed. Generally, the government has
demonstrated a good performance by meeting the financing shortfall, over and above the
planned 20 percent borrower commitment of counterpart funding for the creation of the
Uganda National Roads Authority and a Road Fund.

Factors Generally Subject to the Implementing Agency’s Control

39. The Transition from RAFU to UNRA: RAFU has been the executing agency for
Phase I and II of the program. While not always showing an outstanding performance, its
managerial and technical skills were adequate. RAFU was the agency responsible for
implementing the first half of Phase III of the program, but starting July 1, 2008, the
newly created autonomous Road Authority (UNRA) became the responsible entity. With
the transfer of responsibilities from RAFU to UNRA, some of the mechanisms and
fiduciary controls were temporarily affected due to delays in transition to UNRA from
RAFU and the resultant weakness reflected on transitional accountability.

40. Lack of Comprehensive Progress Reporting: RAFU/UNRA prepared progress
reports on individual project activities, but paid little attention to the production of more
comprehensive and consolidated progress reports on implementation of the project.
However, with time, UNRA improved on their method of reporting.




                                             11
2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization
41. M&E Design and Implementation: At project appraisal, the key performance
indicators were: (i) reduction in travel time compared to baseline, (ii) reduction in vehicle
operating costs on national roads compared to baseline; and (iii) industrial and
agricultural product flows. The last one is reflected by growth in traffic. Due to lack of
information on the entire national roads network, given that the previous phases of the
program did not include data collection on the national roads network, it was not possible
to get baseline data for these indicators. Instead, the RDPP3 project provided for full data
collection on the entire national roads network. During project implementation, the
performance indicators were not modified to take into account the project restructuring
and extension.

42. A QAG review carried out on October 8, 2008 acknowledged that in terms of the
institutional framework for the project, the transition from RAFU to UNRA was the main
policy element in the project, and reasonable measures were put in place to achieve this during
RDPP3 project. The QAG noted that the good progress on the institutional setup was in the
right direction for achievement of the development objectives. Further, they noted that the
pace of project implementation and disbursement had started to pick up as an indication that
the remaining project elements would be implemented successfully. The report also pointed
out some of the strengths and weaknesses, which, as captured in Section 6 – Lessons
Learned, were to be addressed under the project and follow-on projects. The overall QAG
assessment of the likelihood to achieve the development objectives was “Moderately
Likely.?
2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
43. Procurement: The procurement process remained the primary factor delaying the
project implementation, and required putting in place a realistic procurement plan in
order to avoid such delays. The organization structure of UNRA placed the functions of
procurement at a very low level in the directorate of Finance and Administration. At
commissioning, UNRA did not have a qualified Procurement Specialist. After a long
dialogue the Directorate of Procurement was created and the procurement functions were
split into: (i) works and services and (ii) goods. Other weaknesses were noted in the area
of contracts management and specifically on the application of contract price adjustment
(CPA) formulae. Because of the absence of a proper procurement function, several
complaints were registered, including an allegation of improper contract management
against UNRA for some of the roads financed by the project.

44. An independent procurement review (IPR) on the project was conducted in
October and November 2010. The consultants reviewed the procurement, contract
management, internal control mechanisms, and implementation processes, as well as the
timeliness and appropriateness of no-objections issued by the Bank to confirm their
consistency with the Legal Agreements and associated documents. Major factors, subject
to the control of the implementing agency UNRA, indicated in the IPR summary include:

       (i)   UNRA has insufficient skills in the evaluation and application of CPA



                                              12
       (ii)  UNRA does not have adequate procurement and technical staff leading to
             long procurement cycles of up to 32 and 42 months between prequalification
             and contract signature, and inadequate attention to contract management.
       (iii) UNRA did not handle, in a timely manner, cases of delayed compensation
             of project-affected persons, leading to delayed site handover, which resulted
             in delays in completion of the civil works contracts.
45.     Because of the above factors, the IPR gave the recommendations: (i) build the
capacity of UNRA by establishing a quality assurance system to help reduce the long
procurement cycle; (ii) train UNRA staff in the application of the CPA formula; (iii)
review the current organization structure and increase the number of staff in the
procurement and technical departments; (iv) prepare a customized procurement manual
and ensure procurement based on updated designs/bidding documents and invite bids
after the design reviews; and (v) enhance contract management and administration. It
concluded that the benefits of investing in adequate staffing would, in the long run,
outstrip the cost of the extra staff.

46.     In order to enhance the skill of UNRA and their consultants, the Bank organized a
special training, in Kampala in July 2011, on the application of CPA formulae. With the
support of the governance team and financing from the Governance Partnership Facility
Window 1 project, the bank engaged an independent consultant to review the
procurement processes in UNRA and to recommend ways of combating corruption. The
consultant recommended the establishment of an independent and parallel bid evaluation
for large contracts and a random sample of smaller contracts to benchmark the results of
UNRA’s bid/proposal evaluation reports. These actions are now undertaken by the DFID
financed project part of the ongoing follow-up actions of the Transport Sector
Development Project (TSDP).

47. Financial Management: The quality of the financial management reports was
generally acceptable. Satisfactory audit reports were received on a timely basis, which
were reviewed by the Bank and the comments sent to the borrower. The project was first
implemented by RAFU, which did not have an internal audit unit within its structure as it
was not a statutory body but an organ of the MOWT. An internal audit unit was
established as part of the UNRA structure. Consistent with the DFA, the following
financial covenants were complied with: (i) carrying out audits of the special account in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles by independent auditors; (ii)
implementing a time-bound action plan for strengthening financial management system;
and (iii) furnishing quarterly project management reports. Given that the project closed
on October 31, 2011, the Credit is not able to finance the audit for the period from July 1,
2011 to closure of the accounts on February 29, 2012. The government has pledged to
finance the audit and the report will be provided at the end of FY12/13.

48. Environment: At project implementation, the supervising consultants responsible
for construction-related mitigation as part of the routine inspection of contractor's work
provided information on environmental mitigation measures in the monthly progress
reports. A full time environmentalist within RAFU/UNRA continued to monitor the




                                            13
activities on the road projects in liaison with NEMA. No adverse environmental
degradation matters were reported and the performance was rated “Satisfactory.?

49. Social Assessment: During the project implementation, RAFU/UNRA had a
sociologist and two land acquisition officers who were instrumental in monitoring the
implementation of the RAPs, and the HIV/AIDS mitigation programs. Treatment of the
STD cases was also provided by the on-site clinics, with the HIV/AIDS treatment
coordinated through the national program. UNRA have provided the RAP
Implementation Completion Reports for all the upgraded roads and the reports are
satisfactory. However, reporting on the progress of RAPs implementation was a
challenge. This challenge was addressed through the training of UNRA staff and their
consultants in management of land acquisition and through on-the-spot guidance during
supervision missions to enhance their skills. The performance was rated “Moderately
Satisfactory.?
2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
50.     Originally it was planned to continue the Roads Development Program with a
fourth phase (RDPP4). RDPP4 was intended to finance the rehabilitation of district roads
identified by the Ten Year District Road Investment Program (TYDRIP) with a credit
amount of US$26 million. However, in the course of the implementation of the APL
program, it was decided that the financing of district roads should be mainstreamed in the
government’s recurrent and development budgets, and that development programs (DPs)
should rather focus on capacity building (including capacity for the management of local
roads) and on large investments on the national roads network.

51.    The next lending program was chosen to be a SIL. This instrument was chosen
rather than continuation with the APL for RDPP4 because the reforms that were
promoted under the three phases of the previous APL (RDPP) had largely been achieved,
although with some delays. It was therefore agreed that the proposed RDPP4 would be
dropped and that IDA would support a new proposed series of projects named the
Transport Sector Development Project (TSDP) that would, jointly with other DPs,
support government’s implementation of its National Transport Master Plan (NTMP).
3.     Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation
52. The project objectives were clear, relevant, and important to improve sector policy
and strengthening road management. The program components had a good linkage with
the project objectives. The project also contributed to the Bank’s CAS strategic outcomes
of improving reliability of access to infrastructure services and poverty reduction through
medium-term strategy focused on private-investment-led growth. The project objectives
were also in line with the country’s 2000 CAS objectives of facilitating the efficient and
reliable provision of transport services, increasing agricultural production, stimulating
economic growth, promoting security in the country, and enhancing linkages with
neighboring countries.




                                            14
53. The RDPP3 was the third phase of the APL, follow-on project from the RDP
Phases I & II (RDPP1 & RDPP2). Originally it was planned to continue the Roads
Development Program with a fourth phase (RDPP4) which was intended to finance the
rehabilitation of district roads identified by the Ten Year District Road Investment
Program (TYDRIP) with a credit amount of US$26 million. In the course of
implementing the APL program, it was decided that the financing of district roads should
be “mainstreamed? in the government’s recurrent and development budgets, and that
Development Partners should rather focus on capacity building (including capacity for
the management of local roads) and on large investments on the national road network.

54. Further, since the RDPP3 was a phased APL program, for continuity of the APL,
the PDO relied on RDPP1 and RDPP2 objectives, and implemented them as a rolling
program with overlaps in the different phases of the program. The combined output of the
APL has substantially contributed to achieving the objective of the RDP as a total of 935
km of roads were upgraded/rehabilitated.

55. In terms of linkage to the PDO, the project components of the RDPP3 project
focused on the national roads network. Project areas are rural part of the country with
high yield of agricultural productivity. Thus, the anticipated benefit lay with reducing
high transport costs that form a large portion of the cost of agricultural produce and
therefore make it uncompetitive in the market. However, due to the fact that some of the
projects components were dropped, the outcome achievements were not at desired level
as anticipated at appraisal. Overall, since the GoU agreed to finance the components that
were dropped, there was no requirement to consider the review of the PDO and outcome
indicators in line with project restructuring and new developments in the sector.

56. Given the long time period elapsed at initial stages—the time of preparation, and
the unprecedented procurement delays on actual implementation—it would have been
better to consider a review of the PDO indicators, so as to realistically reflect the changes
and new developments. In addition, dropping of some components while keeping the
original PDO indicators intact, lead to gross reductions in project benefits. A lack of
detailed information makes quantifying the foregone benefits a difficult and complex
exercise, rendering measured values nearly impossible. However, it can be noted that
delay caused lost benefits that would have been generated from savings on transport costs
and travel time.
3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
57. The project’s overriding objective of improving accesses to rural and economically
productive areas through upgrading of selected priority road links and further
strengthening road sector management was substantially achieved through the following
accomplishments: (i) the Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road (44 km) was
strengthened/upgraded from gravel to paved (bituminous) standard; (ii) the Soroti-
Dokolo-Lira road (123 km) was upgraded from gravel to paved (bituminous) standard;
(iii) a detailed design for upgrading of 300 km of district roads reclassified to national
(bitumen) standard was prepared; (iv) data collection on 10,000 km of national roads was
completed; (v) a feasibility study and detailed design for upgrading of 300 km of national
gravel roads to paved (bituminous) standard was completed; (vi) provision was made for


                                             15
training and technical advisory services to consolidate the institutional reform process,
including establishment and commencing operations of the Road Authority, through,
inter alia, developing a performance agreement and a business plan, (vii) a financial
management system and internal audit function was established, including the restructure
of internal office organization and staffing, and development of management information
systems; and (viii) provision was made for external audit services. As noted above it was
the Busega-Mityana road and bridges on the Atiak-Moyo road that were financed by the
government. As a result, the outcomes of the project were achieved with this financing of
the Government that supported key pillars of the CAS.

58. The PDO relates the project roads to classified national roads, which are considered
to be important instruments for the improvement of the linkage of rural economic activity
to the market. The PDO reflects the importance of the project components with regards to
their contribution to rural access improvement and increase in agricultural productivity as
a result of the expected reductions in transport cost. However, use of crude traffic growth
measures as a proxy indicator for agricultural productivity cannot adequately or fully
reflect the project zone of influence on agriculture productivity growth and economic
activity. Detailed data on the project area freight traffic generation by traffic mode and
commodity type were not availed either as baseline or for the project at completion. This
limits the assessment capacity on the sub-indicator elements of the project. However,
from the appraisal and reappraisal reports, an overall economic assessment is provided on
Annex 3 of the report, summarizing the economic parameters and traffic information for
the two road projects.

3.3    Efficiency
59. At project appraisal, an economic analysis for investment on each of the project
roads was carried out using the HDM. The consolidated EIRR was observed to be above
12 percent. The project also carried out a sensitivity analysis based on economic costs
(+20 percent) and average daily traffic (-20 percent). At project completion, the net
present value (NPV) and the EIRR were re-evaluated for the two roads that were
upgraded—the Soroti-Lira and Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe roads. The NPV and EIRR for
the two roads at completion are much higher than at appraisal. Details of the economic
and financial analysis, economic indicators and assessment on the reappraisal report are
shown in Annex 3 with input parameters in Tables 3.1, 3.2 and traffic count for the two
roads in Tables 3.3 and 3.4.

60.    Results of traffic studies on Soroti Lira road revealed an increase in traffic from
appraisal forecast. The number of heavy goods vehicles more than doubled in volume,
the number of cars increased by 200 percent while passenger buses did not grow as
forecasted. The economic indicators for the completed road (Soroti-Dokolo) showed
positive NPV of US$30.6 million, which is about 50 percent more than that obtained at
appraisal, and an EIRR of 15.6 percent despite the increase in cost from US$47.0 million
at appraisal to US$115.0 million at completion (more than double). It must be noted that
the scope of work of the completed project was substantially different from the scope at
appraisal. Specifically for the Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road, additions to the original
scope of work included dualization of the carriageway, relocations of utilities, and


                                            16
provision of pedestrian walkway. These additions were, however, necessary since the
completion of the northern by-pass, which was designed after completion of the design of
this road, attracted a high volume of traffic, calling for improvement of the capacity and
road safety features on the first 1.3 km of the road that now feeds traffic from the central
business district to the by-pass. Results of the current study show that some of the
predictions made at appraisal were achieved soon after completion of the project.
3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61. The development objective of the project was to improve access to rural and
economically productive areas and to progressively continue to build up road sector
planning, design, and program management capability including road safety management.
However, the road safety aspect was not properly addressed as part of the indicators nor
captured as one component of the project. The outcome indicators relate to reduction in
average travel time, vehicle operating costs, and traffic growth as a proxy measure to
agricultural productivity and increase in economic activity on the project roads. As
discussed in paragraph 54, the corresponding baseline values for each indicator were not
properly developed during preparation. In addition, the inadequacy and absence of
detailed data and information on agricultural productivity and economic activity makes
the justification on the overall rating difficult.
62. However, there are tangible results attained from the other indicators defined
during the implementation process. The project achieved the targets of upgrading and
rehabilitating a total of 152 km of roads, and rehabilitating 15 km of an existing paved
road. In addition, the GoU financed the rehabilitation of another 57 km of road that was
dropped when the project was restructured. The change in average roughness on these
roads brings about benefits to all groups of road users resulting from reduction in vehicle
operating costs and travel time.
63. Considering the time lose on actual implementation, and zero disbursement levels
over the project period from 09/09/2004 (1st ISR date) to 06/28/2007 (6th ISR date), the
ISR “Satisfactory? ratings were too generous. The project in 2007/08 was one of the
flagged problem projects and the ISR rating was downgraded to “Moderately
Unsatisfactory.? From 2008 onward, with the advent of UNRA and proactive measures
on project management, the project started to progress very well and started to pick up
“Satisfactory? ratings and continued thusly up to end of the project. Based on an
assessment of the overall performance, considering the above mentioned factors and
weaknesses as an impetus for rating, the ICR assessed the overall performance outcome
rating to be “Moderately Satisfactory,? differing from the ISR “Satisfactory? inclined
ratings as indicated in Section G of the Data sheet.
3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

(i) Poverty Impact: The project influence area in which the roads were improved are
known for agriculture production, dairy and poultry farming, fish production, and tourism



                                            17
for the provision of easy access to national parks. The development of all these activities
enhanced the local economy and reduced rural poverty through creating job opportunities,
increasing agricultural production and promoting tourism.

(ii) Gender Impacts: The policy and strategy of the roads sector provided overall equal
opportunities of employment for male and female workers on road rehabilitation works.

(iii) Social Development: The project provided improved access to schools, health centers,
village markets, social services, and facilitated business development activities. Since the
roads were improved on existing alignments, the project did not have any negative impact
on human settlements.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

64.   During the implementation phase the following institutional changes were made:

(i) RAFU, which was a nucleus for the establishment of UNRA, was phased out and the
UNRA,(created by an act of Parliament in May 2006) took over on its effective
operational date of July 1, 2008. RAFU was instrumental under the MOWT for effective
development of the RDP from concept level to implementation of the RDPP1 and RDPP2
phases. It also commenced the implementation of the RDPP3 up to the time UNRA
became effective. The experience gained from the works of RAFU was the basis for the
newly formed institution to start its business from firm ground as an independent and
autonomous body. This is demonstrated by the fact that RAFU/UNRA’s capacity to
deliver increased from US$120 million per annum at appraisal to about US$400 million
per annum at closure of the project.
(ii) In April 2001, with financing provided under the RSISTAP, an environmental
management/liaison unit was established within the MOWT. Its objective was to provide
the needed capacity to coordinate environmental and social policies under the RSDP and
to facilitate coordination between all affected stakeholders —RAFU/UNRA, MOWT,
NEMA, the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), the engineer, the contractor, local
administrations, and members of the local communities—on the implementation and
monitoring of the mitigation measures.
(iii) Parliament passed the UNRA Bill in May 2006. UNRA Board was appointed in
January 2007. UNRA was formally established on November 1, 2007 and it became fully

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

65. Every year, a joint transport sector review meeting was held in Kampala to review
the performance of the sector. The assessment reports included a paragraph or two on the
project and were provided to both development partners and the political leadership of
the country.
4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

66. Given that UNRA and the Road Fund are now fully operational; the risks to the
development outcomes are considered moderate. UNRA has taken over the maintenance
function on national roads from MOWT and the well-tested management systems of
RAFU. Even though, as has been experienced in many other countries, policy reversals
are possible, UNRA and the RF have continued to build their capacities. However,
UNRA has not been able to retain high quality staff as many of them have joined large
organizations (Regional Economic Communities, African Development Bank (AfDB),
European Union (EU), and others). UNRA has not yet adopted new ways of managing
road networks based on the principles of life cycle costs, for example output based
approaches. The RF has yet to implement the principles of the second generation Road
Fund. However, this has been hampered by the fact that Uganda Revenue Authority Act
does not provide for direct transfer of funds to the Road Fund. Instead, the funds are
channeled through the consolidated fund of the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and
Economic Development (MoFPED) and passed to the Road Fund through the budget
cycle. The end result is that the funds received are insufficient to meet the maintenance
requirements of approximately 60,000 km of national, district and urban roads and are
unable to arrest the buildup of backlog maintenance. In order to address the situation, it
has been agreed with the rest of the Development Partners to handle backlog maintenance
through the use of Output and Performance Based Road Contracting (OPRC) approach.
In this regard, there is ongoing dialogue with government to ensure sustainable funding
for road maintenance.
5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67. The project design was relevant, appropriate, and responsive to the client’s needs
as it supported the government’s 10-year (1997-2006) RSDP and the updated RSDP
(2001- 2012). The key triggers for preparation of the third phase of the Road
Development program were: (i) RAFU strategy for recruitment of technical staff
implemented; (ii) PIP prepared; (iii) detailed design and bidding documents accepted;
and (iv) pre-qualification of contractors commenced. During project preparation,
information sharing and consultation took place with the donor community; the Bank


                                           19
provided experience gained from application of principles of the Road Maintenance
Initiative (RMI) in Africa. The GoU and donor community acknowledged the Bank's
leadership role during preparation of the RSDP.

68. The overall risk at project appraisal was assessed to be Moderate as mitigation
measures were adequate at entry. However, it is noted that a comprehensive risk
mitigation plan to be followed during project implementation was not designed and
discussed with the borrower at entry. The capacity built under the RSISTAP, apart from
contributing a lot for implementation of the previous projects (RDPP1 and RDPP2), laid
the base foundation to help reduce the quality-at-entry risk for project implementation.
The team proactively addressed the project risks and problems faced and came up with
mitigation measures agreed with the GoU.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was prepared, which provided a good basis
for the project supervision. The skills mix of the Bank supervision team was well
balanced. The team maintained a strategic vision not only on institutional development,
but provided a good advice on other cross cutting issues such as road safety, HIV/AIDS
awareness and mitigation measures and governance. There was significant involvement
of the Bank’s team to resolve day-to-day problems. The quality of the financial
management reviews was found to be satisfactory and consistent with the Bank
guidelines. The supervision aide-memoires for the implementation phase provided
highlights on the key issues thus providing prompt information to the client and Bank
management.

70. The contracts were substantially delayed due to procurement delays. As such, the
project implementation was rated Unsatisfactory and Moderately Unsatisfactory in the
ISR No 8, dated December 12, 2007 and ISR No. 9, dated June 24, 2008, respectively.
From a strategic standpoint, the Bank was responsive in recognizing the problems that
arose and in providing space and time for their resolution. The actions taken by the Bank
to resolve implementation bottlenecks were adequate. With enhanced supervision and
independent technical audits carried out by consultants outsourced under the project,
implementation and subsequent ratings of the project improved. Under the RDPP3, in
2005, the Bank provided training for a critical mass of RAFU staff in the application of
road planning tools, specifically the Roads Economic Decision (RED) model and the
HDM4, to enable the staff to analyze data and use it for planning. Software licenses were
also provided for the HDM4.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                           20
71. Taking into account the role that was played by the Bank at entry and at
supervision, the overall rating for Bank’s performance is assessed as “Moderately
Satisfactory.?
5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72. The government showed commitment in implementing institutional reforms;
UNRA became fully operational in July 2008 though it took ten years. As recommended
by the sector financing and management study and after a consistent dialogue with the
Bank, the government finally decided to set up a Road Fund to enhance financial
sustainability of road maintenance. The Road Fund Bill was passed by the Cabinet on
May 17, 2007 and was approved by the Parliament on June 19, 2008 and the RF became
operational on July 1, 2009. When high bids were received for the first three civil works
contracts, the total sum of the contracts was 43 percent over and above the available funds
for this category of expenditure on the credit/grant. The GoU came in promptly to meet
the shortfall. At closure, there were still outstanding payments resulting from variations
in the scope of work that were needed to address changes not envisaged at the design
stage. Based on the commitments, and because the ultimate goal of the second generation
Road Fund have not been met, the government’s performance is rated as “Moderately
Satisfactory.?

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73. RAFU was the executing agency for Phase I and II of the program. While not
always showing a stellar performance, its managerial and technical skills were adequate.
RAFU was also the agency responsible for implementing the first half of Phase III of the
program, but starting July 1, 2008, the newly created autonomous Road Authority
(UNRA) is the responsible entity. With the transfer of responsibilities from RAFU to
UNRA, some of the accountability mechanisms and fiduciary controls may have been
temporarily impaired.

74. Due to pre-qualification issues, the project has suffered a delay of about two years.
On the institutional side, there was a weakness in UNRA’s procurement capacity.
However, at closure of the project, UNRA had made most of the required improvements.
It has also responded well to calls for training to improve the skills of its staff. Based on
the above, UNRA’s performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75.   The government’s overall performance is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.


                                             21
6.     Lessons Learned
76. APL Instrument: The APL instrument cut down on the demand for rigorous project
preparations for every SIL. It also cut down on the approval processes from the
government’s side as evidenced by the fact that each phase was able to start and run for
some time in parallel with the previous phase.
77. Policy and Institutional Reforms: Institutional reform conducted parallel to project
implementation causes delays in program implementation. An important lesson learned is
that establishment of new institutions require longer time than anticipated for transition,
which may impact on project progress, and needs policy consultations and commitment
as part of the preparatory work.
78. Human Resource Capacity Development: Restructuring an agency at the same time
as implementing a project is challenging and may cause project implementation delays.
The development of human capital to an acceptable and stable stage is a continuous
process. It is therefore essential to continue providing support to build UNRA’s capacity
to enable them to establish sustainable management systems to help reduce the turn-
around time for implementing of projects. It is also essential to keep in mind the
dynamics of human resource development, including of recruiting and training staff in
various disciplines. For sustainability on the provision of policy and institutional reform
and technical assistance, the process needs continuation and pick up by the follow-on
TSDP.
79. Counterpart Funding: Due to delays caused by the long procurement process that
resulted in cost overruns, the project was restructured and DFA amended to drop
components that could not be financed. However, the GoU committed to finance the cost
overruns and works that, as a consequence of these overruns, could not be financed by
RDPP3 with its increased road sector allocation.
80.    Sustainability of the Road Network: With the establishment of the Road Fund, it
was anticipated that the important aspect of sustainable financing of maintenance would
be addressed. However, Government has yet to implement the RF on the principles of the
second generation Road Fund, without which the sustainability of road management will
be doubtful.
81. Escalation of Costs: Cost of the civil works component both at appraisal and
feasibility/detailed design varied substantially due to the sudden sharp rise of the cost of
fuel, construction materials and other inputs at the time of bidding. The eventual bid
prices could therefore not enable the project to be implemented as appraised and
consequently some components had to be dropped. In future, design reviews and updates
of the cost estimates will be necessary just before calling for bids.
82. Land Acquisition and Right-of-way: Payment of compensation for properties has
continued to cause project implementation problems thus should be resolved before the
works contracts commence. All efforts should be made to ensure that contractors always
receive encumbrance free sites.




                                            22
83. Procurement Delays: Cost of the civil works component at the time of bidding
varied substantially from that at the feasibility and detailed design stage due to delays in
the procurement process of about four years. The eventual bid prices could therefore not
enable the project to be implemented as appraised and consequently some components
had to be dropped. In future, design reviews and updates of the cost estimates will be
necessary just before calling for bids. It would also be advisable to avoid a long
prequalification period. It is also worthwhile to explore the possibility of commencing
procurement prior to credit effectiveness in order to provide for procurement lead-time.
84. Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators of the Projects: At appraisal, the baseline
data for the outcome indicators were not provided. These were provided in the ISR4 in
August 2005. As a proxy for increased industrial and agricultural activity, the traffic
increase on the project roads was used to reflect the agricultural productivity benefits to
the rural population. The lesson learned is that baseline data should be provided at the
appraisal stage for appropriate reading of the PDO indicators.

Annex 1. Project Costs and Financing
Financial Status
1. The financial status presented in the Table below shows that there was a final total
commitment of US$239.34 million against the appraisal estimate amount of US$133
million. As this by far exceeded the available funds on the credit, the GoU agreed to
finance the shortfall. The GoU also financed one road that was dropped from the Credit
along with bridges on the Atiak-Moyo road that were re-designed for upgrading. The
bridges are commensurate with the Class II bitumen standard road. The Table 1.1 shows
costs including dropped projects financed by the GoU.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       The credit had six components: (i) upgrading and strengthening of three high priority
national roads; (ii) designing the upgrade of about 300 km of district roads as national roads,
which therefore are required to meet the National Road Standard; (iii) studying, through the
use of consultancies, the feasibility of upgrading to bitumen standard about 600 km of
priority national roads; (iv) rehabilitation/re-graveling of the Atiak-Moyo road (91 km); (v)
constructing a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; and (vi) developing
institutional support for the establishment of the National Road Authority, and (vii)
provisioning of external auditing services.

2.      The outcome indicator related to the civil works for upgrading, rehabilitation and
reconstruction component is “reduction in average travel time on national roads compared to
baseline? and “reduction in vehicle operating costs on national roads compared to baseline.?
At closure of the RDPP3, the three APLs together upgraded and rehabilitated a total of 877
kilometers of roads, close to the original target of 886 kilometers appraised for upgrading
rehabilitation and re-graveling under the program. This has resulted in reduction of travel
time and vehicle operating costs from Kampala-Gayaza and Soroti-Lira to far off towns, as
well as cross-border traffic as high as 40 percent. With completion of the projects, travel time
and vehicle operating costs from the Kenya border for traffic originating from Mombasa to
northeastern DRC and southern Sudan were reduced by equivalent amounts.

3.      Further, under institutional support to the sector, creation of a roads authority, transfer
of maintenance functions from the Ministry of Works to UNRA and the creation of a road
fund are major milestones. With the above background, it can be concluded that the outcome
indicator related to the civil works for upgrading and rehabilitation/reconstruction under the
program was achieved. However, it has to be noted that sub-components dropped from the
original plan during the restructuring of the program would have brought additional output
gains. The three civil works dropped are: (i) upgrading Zirobwe-Wobulenzi road (23 km); (ii)
rehabilitation of the paved Busega-Mityana road (57 km) and re-graveling of Atiak-Moyo
road (91 km), and the building contract for the proposed UNRA and MOWT offices, all of
which the government embarked on financing.

4.      RDPP3 was originally planned to finance the paving and reconstruction of 249
kilometers of national roads and to re-gravel 91 kilometers of (national) gravel roads.
However, due to higher than anticipated bids, the paving and reconstruction of 57 kilometers
of roads out of the 82 kilometers appraised could not be financed by the project. GoU
committed itself to avail financing for the balance of dropped projects from its own budget.
The project was also supposed to finance the re-graveling of a 91 km road that was planned
to be financed by the IDA-supported Northern Uganda Reconstruction Project (1994-1996).
but was abandoned due to insurgency in the area. While the road was appraised for re-
graveling, the government decided that with the increased traffic, it would be best to upgrade
the design to enable upgrading to a paved (bituminous) standard road. In that light, the
US$8.7 million allocated for the road was about 10 percent of the engineer’s estimate for
upgrading the road. Hence, the government’s proposal was to finance it at a later stage
through other means.

    Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

    Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe Road

    1. The Economic reappraisal report was prepared to update the appraisal report that
    was conducted long before the commencement of civil work contracts. The reappraisal
    provided updates on results, and verified and validated the previous economic appraisal
    of the Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe Road Upgrading Project at completion. There was a
    significant project cost escalation that could have changed the indicators of the study. It is
    noted that, mainly due to additional scope of work, the overall project cost at completion
    increased significantly to the projected final cost of UGX 96.05 billion (US$40.261
    million at an exchange rate of UGX 2,385.79 as at 29 April, 2011), including a Contract
    Price Adjustment (CPA) and additional improvement works. The Engineer’s cost
    estimate at appraisal was UGX 38.46 billion while the tender price was UGX 67.80
    billion.

    2. As part of the assessment, the consultant carried out classified traffic counts and
    origin and destination surveys at designated locations. Three alternative assumptions
    were considered for the economic and sensitivity analysis of the completed road. The
    alternatives scenarios considered were:

           Alternative 1: to consider only normal traffic and no maintenance after
            improvement.
           Alternative 2: to include generated traffic with no maintenance after completion.
           Alternative 3: to include both generated traffic and maintenance after
            improvement.

    3. A summary of the results obtained in the appraisal and reappraisal reports are shown
    in the Table 3.1 for the economic indicators based on actual work completed.

    4. Overall, the scenario option of Alternative 3 recorded better results for the economic
    indicators. With regards to traffic, the base year traffic ranged from 200 to 600 vehicles a
    day with higher traffic volumes found towards the Kampala end of the road. At
    completion the traffic on all sections ranged from 584 to 16,176 vehicles per day. The
    highest traffic count was recorded for the Kampala-Mpererwe section, and overall
    measured annual daily traffic (ADT) at reappraisal far exceeded the projected traffic at
    appraisal. The average traffic growth rate estimate is 8.16 percent for the reappraisal and
    the projected traffic growth rate was 5.5 percent at appraisal. The long project delays


                                                        32
between project appraisal and project implementation can invalidate the estimates and
may have an effect on the results of the project benefit.

5. The NPV for the completed project was higher than that obtained when the road was
appraised though costs have increased by about 50 percent from original levels. Hence,
the positive results of the reappraised road can be attributed to increases in benefits due to
increased traffic on the completed road. Baseline for economic analysis and input
parameters for economic analysis and traffic volume are shown in Tables 3.3. Results of
the traffic analysis revealed that there is an overall increase in traffic compared to
appraisal forecasts. For some categories of vehicles such as heavy trucks, vehicle traffic,
which was not expected to increase, more than doubled in volume. On the contrary, some
passenger vehicles, for which traffic was expected to grow, did not perform well;
specifically small bus traffic grew negatively while car traffic increased by over 200
percent.

6. The economic indicators for the completed road recorded positive NPV of US$30.13
million, which is 65 percent more than that obtained at appraisal. An EIRR of 55.4
percent was recorded despite the fact that there was an over 100 percent increase in costs;
against EIRR appraisal values of 27 percent for Alternative 3. However, it must be noted
that the scope of work of the completed project was substantially different from the scope
work at appraisal. Among others, factors resulting from dualizations of the carriageway,
relocations of utilities, and provision of pedestrian walkways are some of the additions to
the original scope of work. In general, results of the current study show that some of the
predictions made at appraisal were achieved soon after completion of the project.

7. With regards to costs, the Kampala Gayaza Zirobwe Wobulenzi civil works cost at
appraisal was estimated at US$31.38 million, which was only US$458,529 per km. This
is for the appraised project segment including the dropped Zirobwe-Woblonzi (23km)
segment of the road. At completion of the credit, after dropping the Zirobwe-Woblonzi
road segment, for the remaining 53 km of the Kampala Gayaza Zirobwe the actual cost
was US$54.61 million. The corresponding unit cost sharply increased to US$1,030,377
from US$458,529 per km. The increment from the appraisal cost is by about 75 percent
and by-unit cost is 125 percent. Assuming a delay of five years, and other factors being
constant, the unit cost increment per year on average was 25 percent. This reduced the
high level of expected benefit that was expected to be gained by road users over the time
period.

8. The unit cost per KM increment varied from the project cost increment as the project
road length reduced from 68 km to 53 km at completion (see Table 3.2). It can be argued
that the anticipated benefits are partial due to segment dropping from the original
appraised project. The comparative analysis on increments of the Kampala Gayaza and
the Soroti Lira indicating the estimates at appraisal are devalued due to long delays over
the project time period. At appraisal, an incremental project cost provision of US$15.82
million was given, for an increment of 55 km over Soroti Lira compared to Kampala
Gayaza. The actual comparative increment at completion ended up at US$60.59 million.

    9. It should be noted that traffic counts were not conducted just before the
    commencement of construction and soon after completion of the project. In addition, the
    long project delays between project appraisal and project implementation have an effect
    on project benefit. In general, it is noted that planning, monitoring, and evaluation of
    projects during the appraisal stage, and re-evaluating projects in situations where there is
    a long delay, did not adequately take in to account the long term effect resulting from
    delays. It is important to read the results in light of the actual time gap between appraisal
    and commencement of construction to ascertain the validity of results obtained at
    appraisal. For a realistic comparative assessment, the traffic counts should also be
    conducted just before the commencement of construction and soon after completion of a
    project life cycle.

11. The Economic reappraisal report updated the appraisal report conducted by the
consultant in 2002, which was conducted long before the commencement of civil works.
The reappraisal study provided updates on indicators, and verified and validated the
economic appraisal of results the Soroti-Dokolo-Lira Road Upgrading Project at
completion. The overall project cost at completion had increased, mainly due to
additional scope of work. The actual cost is UGX 116,466,319,888 as against the
projected contract cost of UGX 82,068,227,664, including Contract Price Adjustment
(CPA) and additional improvement works.

12. As part of the assessment, the consultant carried out classified traffic counts and
origin and destination surveys at designated locations. Three alternative assumptions
were considered for the economic analysis of the completed road. The alternatives
scenarios considered were:

       Alternative 1: to consider only normal traffic and no maintenance after
        improvement.
       Alternative 2: to include generated traffic with no maintenance after completion.
       Alternative 3: to include both generated traffic and maintenance after
        improvement.

13. A summary of the results obtained in the appraisal and reappraisal reports are shown
in Table 3.5 for the economic indicators based on actual work completed.

   14. Overall, the scenario option of Alternative 3 recorded better results for the economic
   indicators. With regards to traffic, the base year traffic in 2003 ranged from 219 to 644
   for the four sections of the project road, whereas the 2010 traffic count ranges from 584
   to 1505. The traffic increment level for the four segments of the Dokolo-Lira road is

   15. Measured ADT at reappraisal exceeded the projected traffic forecast of the appraisal.
   The average traffic growth for overall annual traffic for the four sections of the road
   ranged from 11 percent to 16 percent and for the generated and diverted traffic between
   five percent and 11 percent against a projected growth rate of 5.5 percent at appraisal.
   Despite the unit cost increases on the project, the NPV values for the completed project
   remain higher than the results obtained when the designed road was appraised. The
   positive results achieved on the reappraised road can, therefore, be attributed to increases
   in benefits due to increased traffic on the completed road.

   16. Upon reappraisal, results of traffic analysis revealed an overall growth of traffic
   above the appraised forecast levels. For some categories of vehicles such as heavy trucks,
   vehicle traffic, which was not expected to increase, more than doubled in volume. On the
   contrary, some passenger vehicles, for which traffic was expected to grow, did not
   perform well; specifically small bus traffic grew negatively while car traffic increased by
   over 200 percent. The economic indicators for the completed road showed positive NPV
   of US$30.6 million, which is about 50 percent more than that obtained at appraisal, and
   an EIRR of 15.6 percent despite the over 100 percent increase in costs. The EIRR at
   appraisal was about five percent more than of the re-appraisal. The reappraisal showed
   that some of the predictions made at appraisal were achieved soon after completion of the
   project.




                                                                37
17. The Soroti Dokolo Lira civil works construction estimated cost was US$47 million;
which is only about US$382,000 per km for the whole project segment at appraisal. At
project completion the actual construction cost was US$115.2 million and the
corresponding unit cost sharply increasing to US$936,585 from US$382,000 per km. The
increment in cost, in terms of both project cost and unit costs, from appraisal to
completion is 145 percent. This is so significant that on taking a delay of five years, and
other factors being constant, the unit cost increment per year was 29 percent. This
indicates that the huge level of benefit missed which could otherwise was supposed to be
gained over the time period.


18. The comparative analysis on increments of the Kampala Gayaza and the Soroti Lira
indicates that the estimates at appraisal are devalued due to delays over the time period
(see Table 3.2). At appraisal, an incremental project cost provision of US$15.82 million
provided on the estimates for the increment of 55 km of Soroti Lira from Kampala
Gayaza. Whereas the actual comparative increment at completion ended up to be
US$60.59 million. The variance is justified from the point of variances in the
competitively offered tender prices for the two projects and dropping of segments of the
project. It is noted that the completion cost for the increment at completion is four fold
higher than the project cost estimates at appraisal.


19. It should be noted that traffic counts were not conducted just before the
commencement of construction and soon after completion of the project. In addition, the
long project delays between project appraisal and project implementation have an effect
on project benefit. In general, it is noted that planning, monitoring, and evaluation of
projects during the appraisal stage, and re-evaluating projects in situations where there is
a long delay, did not adequately take in to account the long-term effect resulting from
delays. It is important to read the results in light of the actual time gap between appraisal
and commencement of construction to ascertain the validity of results obtained at
appraisal. For a realistic comparative assessment, the traffic counts should also be
conducted just before the commencement of construction and soon after completion of a
project life cycle

5.3 Introduction

1. A key element in the implementation of the Government’s Roads Sector strategy is the Road
   Sector Development Program (RSDP), which was endorsed at the Donor’s Conference held
   in Paris on November 10, 1996. The primary objectives of the RSDP were: (i) to provide an
   efficient, safe and sustainable road network in support of market integration and poverty
   alleviation; (ii) to improve the managerial and operational efficiency of road administration;
   and (iii) to develop the domestic construction industry. The projected total expenditure level
   under the RSDP was estimated at US$1.5 billion for the national roads network for the period
   1996 to 2007 and US$380 million for the district roads over the same period.

2. In order to achieve the RSDP’s intended development objectives, the Government of Uganda
   (GoU) in 1999 approached the International Development Association (IDA) for funding
   support. The IDA, in cooperation with other development partners, agreed to support the 10-
   year program. Of the projected total financing, GoU planned to contribute US$700 million;
   EU US$223 million; IDA US$356 million and bilateral donors to finance the remainder, The
   IDA contribution was to include US$282 million under the Adaptable Program Lending and
   the rest to be provided under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP - Cr. 2587-UG), the
   Roads Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance project (RSISTAP Cr. 2987-UG),
   and El Nino Emergency Project (ENERP).

3. The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) for Road Development Program Phase 1
   (RDPP1) in the amount of SDR 67.2 million (US$ 90.98 million equivalent) was signed on
   November 22, 1999. The closing date for the credit was June 30, 2004 but was later revised to
   June 30, 2008. The DCA for RDPP2 in the amount of SDR 50.9 million (US$ 6452 million
   equivalent) was signed on April 11, 2002 and the scheduled closing date was June 30, 2006
   but was later reviewed to June 30, 2008. The Development Financing Agreement (DFA) for
   RDPP3 in the credit amount of SDR 45.970 (US$67.70 equivalent) and grant amount of SDR
   27.201 (US$40.00 million equivalent) was signed on September 30, 2004. The closing date
   was scheduled for December 31, 2009 but was later revised to October 31, 2011.

4. When the tenders for the key components of the RDPP3—the upgrading and strengthening of
   three high priority national roads—were received the bid amounts were found to be much
   higher than the funds available for the component. Coupled with the delays during the
   prequalification of contractors, the lengthy evaluation process, and the long time to decide
   whether the contracts should proceed, the implementation fell behind schedule by more than
   two years. The credit was then extended to October 31, 2011.

 5.2 Project Objectives

6. The development objective of the Project was to improve access to rural areas and
   economically productive areas and to progressively continue to build-up sustainable road
   sector planning, design and program management capability including road safety
   management. It was envisaged that the project would contribute to the following:-
       i)     Increased industrial and agricultural activity
       ii)    Increased traffic growth
       iii)   Reduced travel time and
       iv)    Reduced transport rates and vehicle operating costs over the national roads
              network.

5.3 Project Components

5.3.1   Original Project Scope as approved

7. The project comprised of the following components:

Component 1. Civil works for upgrading, rehabilitation and reconstruction of priority
              national roads:
  i) Reconstruction / upgrading from gravel to paved (bitumen) standards of Kampala-
       Gayaza-Zirobwe-Wobulenzi road (68km);
  ii) Upgrading from gravel to paved (bitumen) standards of Soroti-Dokolo-Lira road (125
       km);

  iv) Rehabilitation and re-graveling of Atiak-Moyo road (91km).

Component 2. Civil works for construction of buildings
  This component comprised the reconstruction of the proposed new headquarters building for
  the Roads Authority.

Component 3. Roads construction services – Construction supervision
  This component comprised provision of consultancy services for supervision of the civil
  works contracts in component 1.

Component 4. Detailed design of about 300km of upgrading of district gravel roads and
             reclassifying to national road standard.
  This component comprised carrying out designs for the following district roads.

                   Luwero-Zirobwe            36.7 km
                   Luwero- Wakyato           34.2 km
                   Mityana-Kanoni            37.2 km
                   Nebbi-Goli                14.4 km
                   Ocoko-Inde                32.8 km
                   Muzizi-Rwemiyaga          77.3 km
                   Katine-Ochero             69.2 km
                   Total:                    302km

Component 5. Feasibility Studies and Selected Design of about 600 km for Upgrading of
             Priority National Roads:




                                              44
    This component comprised carrying out feasibility studies and engineering designs of about
    600km of roads. Initially, the following roads, with a length totaling to 788 km were
    considered:

                    Muyembe-Moroto-Kotido               290 km
                    Mpigi-Maddu-Sembabule               135 km
                    Kyenjojo-Hoima-Masindi-Kigumba      285 km
                    Arua-Koboko-Oraba                   78 km

Component 6. Institutional Support and Establishment of the Road Authority
  This component comprised activities that would enable the establishment and strengthening
  of an autonomous Roads Authority to improve national roads administration.

5.3.2   Changes in the Project Scope

8. Revised Project Components
Component 1

    A revision and restructuring of this component was prompted by the shortfall in funds
    resulting from higher than anticipated bids received on the first three works contracts out of
    the seven originally planned for implementation under this credit.
    The following components / subcomponents were reviewed or dropped:
    iv) Upgrading from gravel to paved (bitumen) standard of the Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe-
        Wobulenzi road had been planned to be implemented through two contracts: Kampala-
        Gayaza-Zirobwe, 44 km and Zirobwe-Wobulenzi, 23 km. Due to inadequacy of funds,
        procurement for the contract for the Zirobwe-Wobulenzi, 23 km section of the road was
        not commenced and this part of the sub-component was dropped.
    v) Reconstruction of Busega-Mityana road, 57 km. This sub component was funded by the
        Government of Uganda.
    vi) Rehabilitation and re-graveling of Atiak-Moyo road, 91 km. The scope of work for this
        sub-component was reviewed. Drawing from previous experience where investments in
        rehabilitation and re-graveling of heavily trafficked roads lasted a few months,
        government adopted a policy not to contract any more future loans for this type of
        investment. Instead, it was agreed with the Bank that a full design for upgrading the road
        to paved (bitumen) standard be undertaken under the RDDP3. Government is now
        financing the construction of bridges, box culverts, and ferry landings for crossing the
        River Nile on this road.

Component 2

    Civil works for construction of buildings: The sub-component for the construction of the
    proposed headquarters of the Roads Authority was also dropped due to the shortfall arising
    from the higher prices for contracts in Component 1.

Component 3

    The road construction services - supervision of the construction works: the sub-component
    for the construction supervision of Busega–Mityana road was funded by the GoU and
    rehabilitation and re- graveling of Moyo–Atiak road was dropped. GoU is financing
    consultant’s services for supervision of the bridges and ferry landings.


                                               45
Component 4

    Detailed designs were carried out on the roads as per Appraisal Document excepting Muzizi–
    Rwemiyaga road: 77.3 km which was replaced by Kyegegwa–Kazo road: 87 km. The total
    length of the roads subsequently increased slightly from the initially 300 km planned to 312
    km.

Component 5

    This component comprised carrying out feasibility studies and engineering designs of about
    600km of national roads. It had been envisaged that the priority national roads that would be
    considered under this component would be as follows.

             Muyembe-Moroto-Kotido                    290 km
             Mpigi-Maddu-Sembabule                    135 km
             Kyenjojo-Hoima-Masindi-Kigumba           285 km
             Vurra-Arua-Koboko –Oraba                 92 km
             Gulu-Atiak-Bibia-Nimule                  104 km
             The total length of the roads            859 km

    A traffic count was carried out on various road links of the national roads network and it was
    established that there were some that were carrying higher traffic volumes than some of the
    above roads. Coupled with other economic considerations, the list of the roads to be studied
    was reviewed and it was agreed that only the following roads totaling to 300 km in length be
    designed to bitumen standard.

             Gulu -Atiak-Bibia-Nimule                 104 km
             Vurra-Arua- Koboko-Oraba                 92 km
             Atiak-Moyo-Sudan border                  104 km
             The total length of the roads designed   300 km

Component 6

    All the sub–components of this component were accomplished as appraised

11. Schedule 7 of the DFA was also amended to allow for the proceeds of the credit to be utilized
    to pay for some taxes. The second amendment was made in January 2011 following the
    Government’s request to the Bank in October 2010 to reallocate the Category of the credit for
    Unallocated Funds to Categories 1 and 2. The Bank accepted the request and Schedule 1 of
    the DFA was amended as shown in Table 5.2.

12. Further, amendments were also made to the scope and description of works to be executed
    under Category i) Parts A and B of the Project. The credit closing date was also extended by
    22 months from December 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011; and the name of the implementing
    agency was changed from RAFU to UNRA. In component 6, it was agreed with the Bank that
    the sub-component for consultancies to assist with RAFU transformation be funded by
    another development partner, EU. The amendments to the original allocations are as shown in
    Table 5.3.

13. When bids for Soroti-Dokolo road were received, it became clear that costs for civil works
    would outstrip the funds available. A decision was taken to advertise tenders for Kampala-
    Gayaza-Zirobwe road and Dokolo-Lira road and hold back on tendering the Zirobwe-
    Wobulenzi road for the time being. For Kampala-Gayaza-Zirobwe road, the lowest bid was
    US$ 8millon above the funds available for the road. For the Dokolo-Lira road, the lowest bid
    was US$20million above the budget. It was agreed with the Bank that Government would
    avail the balance of US$25 million to cover the shortfall in the two contracts before a “no–
    objection? to sign the contracts would be granted. Following the undertaking, the Bank gave
    its “no objection? for the contracts to be signed. There were several reallocations between the
    components to cover the shortfalls in the budgets for the civil works. Allocation of the credit
    and grant proceeds between the components and financial performance during the
    implementation of the project are as shown in Table 5.4.

14. The credit became effective on June 23, 2005 with an original project closing date of
    December 31, 2009. Due to delays occasioned by the late commencement of the key
    components of the project i.e. upgrading and strengthening of three priority national roads, an
    extension was sought on November 2009, and the credit was extended to October 31, 2011.
    Implementation of the main component of the project, the civil works, was delayed by more
    than two years. Project implementation of the key activities is as shown in Table 5.5.

 5.5.1 Financial Performance

A summary of the financial performance of the individual components at project closure is shown
in Table 5.6. From the table the percentage utilization of the credit and grant is 108 percent. This
difference arises from the depreciation of the dollar against the SDR over the years.

         5.6.1   Overall Assessment

         15. The overall development objective of RDPP3 was to improve access to rural and
             economically productive areas and to progressively continue to build up sustainable road
             sector planning, design and program management capability, as well as road safety
             management. This was to be achieved by: (i) upgrading/reconstruction of three high priority
             national roads; (ii) carrying out detailed design of about 300km of district roads reclassified


                                                         51
                to the national roads standard; (iii) carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering
                design for about 600km of priority national roads; (iv) rehabilitation/re-graveling of the
                Atiak-Moyo road; (v) construction of the proposed new Roads Authority headquarters
                building and (vi) institutional support to the establishment of the Roads Authority.

           16. Implementation of the civil works commenced more than two years behind schedule. During
               the Bank’s mission of October 22-November 2, 2007, the project rating had been down-
               graded to “moderately unsatisfactory.? However, once the civil works contracts commenced,
               performance improved significantly. The rating with respect to achievement of the project
               and implementation objectives is as follows:

 5.7 Bank and Borrower Performance

5.7.1   Bank’ s Performance:

a) Project Preparation:

17. Components of the project had been identified earlier in 1999 when the RDP was being
    formulated. The Bank worked very closely with the Government officials during the
    implementation of Phase I and II. Phase III was as per earlier plan but some modifications to
    scope and timing to take into account Government’s emerging priorities and policies at that
    later time were introduced.

b) Project Appraisal:

18. The project was reviewed and appraised in August 2004. The appraisal took into
    consideration the country’s RSDP review of 2001.

c) Project Monitoring:

19. The Bank’s monitoring was satisfactory. This is reflected in the regular quarterly project
    implementation supervision missions, midterm review, an independent procurement review
    and several other project visits all of which provided invaluable guidance for improving the
    project implementation.

20. Throughout the life of the project, the Bank endeavored to ensure that the Client achieved the
    project outcomes. This was particularly evident with regard to the Bank’s keen interest in
    trying to resolve the issue to achieve the original project objectives despite the higher than
    anticipated costs of the road projects. Regular project implementation missions were
    conducted throughout the project life. In this regard, the Bank’s performance is rated as
    SATISFACTORY.

5.7.2   Borrower’s Performance

a) Government:
21. Although it experienced problems in meeting its counterpart funding obligations during the
    earlier stages of the project implementation, Government was later able to contribute
    additional funding to enable some of the components that had been dropped from the
    program due inadequate funds, e.g., the reconstruction of Busega-Mityana road. There were
    long initial delays to commence the civil works contracts, but once the problems were
    overcome, contract execution was smooth. The proportion of GoU’s contribution ended up
    being higher than at project appraisal. In this regard, Government’s performance is rated as
    SATISFACTORY.

b) Implementing Agencies

22. With the establishment of the National Roads Authority (UNRA), the borrower was able after
    resolving problems that caused the initial delays, to ensure timely and smooth implementation
    of the project.




                                               55
23. The implementing agency endeavored to ensure that the contracts were completed within the
    scheduled time, cost and quality. The agency was able to ensure success of most of the
    project components as conceived. The agency supported the Bank missions whenever need
    arose to ensure that the Bank accomplished its objectives. Overall, the Implementing
    Agency’s performance is rated as SATISFACTORY.

 5.8 Lessons Learned

24. The cost of the civil works component both at appraisal and feasibility/detailed design varied
    substantially. This was due to the sudden sharp rise of the cost of fuel, construction materials
    and other inputs at the time of bidding. The eventual bid prices could therefore not enable the
    project to be implemented as appraised; consequently some components had to be dropped.
    In future, it may be prudent to undertake design reviews and updates of cost estimates just
    before calling for bids.

25. Land acquisition for right-of-way and payment of compensation for properties has continued
    to cause project implementation problems, and thus should be resolved before the works
    contracts commence. All efforts should be made to ensure that contractors should always
    receive encumbrance free sites.

26. Procurement continues to be a major delaying factor for IDA and other donor funded projects.
    It is vital that realistic procurement plans are put in place to avoid such delays. It is
    worthwhile to explore the possibility that commencement of procurements could also be de-
    linked from the credit effectiveness date in order to reduce procurement lead-time.

27. Clauses in the standard bidding document relating to variation of price, the price adjustment
    formula, and indices and factors affecting prices of project inputs need to be reviewed and
    streamlined. The complex implementing agency’s staff need to receive specialized training to
    enable them handle this subject more confidently.


 5.9 Project Benefits

28. The major benefits of the project are:-
i)     The upgrading / reconstruction of 170 km of national roads;
ii)    Reduction of travel times on the improved roads;
iii)   Increased agricultural activities along and in the neighborhood of the improved roads;
iv)    Increased values of land and properties along and in the neighborhood of the improved
       roads;
v)     The design and subsequent improvement of 312 km of district roads that have been
       reclassified to national roads standard;
vi)    The design of some 306km of national roads for upgrading from gravel to bitumen
       standard; and
vii)   The establishment of an autonomous Roads Authority for more effective of national
       roads management.
