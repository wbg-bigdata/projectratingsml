A.   Project Development Objective
1.   Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1)
1.1 The Development Objective of the Second Transport Sector Project (PST2) in Senegal is to
obtain a sustainable improvement in the supply and performance of transport infrastructure
(including services), in order to create an environment for improved economic growth through
exanded access and reduced transport costs. This objective will be pursued by supporting further
institutional reforms and policy enhancements in the sector and by removing major physical
constraints, allowing for the consolidation and further development of those achievements
realized under the Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Program (PAST--IDA Cr. 2266-SE).
The proposed project has the following specific objectives:
* stabilize and improve the condition of the priority road network, reducing the long-run
economic costs for road maintenance and rehabilitation in order to enhance regional
competitiveness and attain sectoral financial sustainability;
* increase the number of district capitals with access to all-weather roads;
* strengthen institutional capacity, financial viability and operational efficiency of the
agencies of the sector;
* encourage more direct private sector involvement in investment and management of
the sector; and
* reduce transport cost for the poor.
1.2 Key performance indicators are: (i) reduction in freight rates and vehicle operating costs;
(ii) reduction in goods delivery time; (iii) improvement in the overall condition of the roads
network as reflected by the IRI (international roughness index); (iv) increase in the number of
district capitals with access to all-weather roads; (v) mainstreaming of better planning and
programming tools for road maintenance and rehabilitation works (e.g. three-year rolling plan);
(vi) creation of a Road Works Management Agency; (vii) operation of a Road Fund Mechanism
under a new structure and procedures; (viii) further improvements in financial performance and
efficiency gains (e.g. reduction in work force, declining ratio of wage bill to revenues) and
management capacity of parastatals; (ix) improved competitiveness vis-A vis other ports and
airports of the region; (x) adoption of a new Maritime Code in line with intemational standards;
(xi) increased traffic to the secondary ports of Ziguinchor and Kaolack, as well as reduced
transport cost and travel time savings from the Dakar region to Ziguinchor; and (xii) successful
privatization of the operation of international rail services on the Dakar-Bamako corridor, Air
Senegal, and airport management.
B. Strategic Context
1.   Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
CAS document number: 17269 - SE             Date of latest CAS discussion: 1/29/98
Goal Supported by the Project (see Annex 1)
1.1  The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed
by the Board on January 29, 1998. The overarching objective of the CAS is to reduce the
incidence of poverty and to create gainful employment opportunities based on a two-pronged
2



approach: (i) support for policies and programs aimed at more rapid and sustained growth; and
(ii) ensuring social sustainability of programs. Within the investment portfolio the majority of
operations focus on alleviating key infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in the transport, energy
and water sectors as well as in the rural areas. The project will support the CAS in two ways. It
will increase Senegal's competitiveness in foreign trade and promote linkages in domestic
markets - crucial factors for rapid and sustained growth. It will also improve the degree and
decrease the cost of access by the poor to social services, markets and economic opportunities,
thereby contributing to social sustainability.
2.   Government Strategies and Main Sector Issues
2.1 The transport sector plays a strategic role in the economy of Senegal. It accounts for
approximately 10% of GDP and generates a significant share of the total budgetary revenues of
the State.  As a center of French colonial administration in the 1950's and following
independence in 1960, Senegal, and in particular its capital Dakar, acquired a relatively good
infiastructure base. However, economic crisis and decline during the 1970's and early 1980's,
and weak institutional capacity, led to a deterioration in the infrastructure network and its
operations and left it with the inability to expand services to a larger segment of the population.
2.2  Presently the transport infrastructure network consists of the following: 14,500 km in the
classified road network (4,200 km paved, 10,300 km unpaved), of which about 5,500 km are rural
earth roads. The rail network consists of 1,058 km of track. (906 km main track, 152 km branch
lines). The Port of Dakar is the country's main international seaport with the capability of
handling container as well as other cargoes. There are also three secondary and several tertiary
ports and harbors. In addition, Senegal has one main international airport (Leopold Sedar
Senghor, Dakar), 16 regional airports (the large 3 of which also handle international traffic related
to neighboring countries, tourism and agricultural exports) and one wholly-owned national
airline. It participates as a shareholder in the multinational carrier Air Afrique, which Senegal has
designated as its flag carrier in international matters. Annex 11 provides highlights on the
transport sector.
2.3 Since 1992 the Government has deployed, within the framework of the PAST and
supported by twelve donors/international financial institutions, major efforts to remedy sectoral
imbalances. Policy, institutional and physical shortcomings were or are being addressed. Much
has been achieved under the PAST, notably in policy and institutional reform, in particular since
the devaluation of the CFA Franc in January 1994. One of the key underlying factors for these
achievements has been the Government's commitment to reform and development of the sector.
The Government's approach as outlined in its Ninth Economic and Social Development Plan,
Medium Term Strategy Paper for the Transport Sector (MTSTS--June 1997), and Letter of Sector
Policy (LSP2-January 1998) aims to consolidate and build on earlier achievements, while
continuing to address shortcomings and emerging issues. This, it is expected, will contribute to
rapid and sustained economic development in a socially sensitive manner. This approach will
require the GOS to deal with several critical issues, the key ones of which are identified below.
3.   Government Strategy
3.1  In the late 1980s the GOS initiated a wide range of new approaches to develop and
improve the infrastructure network and services. Private participation was considered for service
contracting, road maintenance and the concessioning of infrastructure management. In 1991 the
Government adopted a Policy Letter for the Transport Sector (LSP1). The overriding objectives
included the improvement of the state and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services,
3



reducing operating costs and making the sector more competitive. The LSP1 also called for the
restructuring of sector parastatals (railways, port and air transport) to enhance their performance,
provide them with full autonomy and effectively transform them into commercially viable
companies. The Public Works Department's (DTP) role was transformed to focus on planning,
programming, contract management, supervision of works and the establishment of regulations.
To assist the GOS in translating its sector policies into operational reality, the PAST was prepared
with the support of the Bank and several donors (EEC, ADB, CIDA, BOAD, etc.).
3.2  Under the PAST project most of the government's sector policy objectives were addressed,
with varying degrees of success. Specific issues and achievements are detailed in the Board
Document "Senegal: Transport Sector Adjustment/Investment Credit - Release of the Second and
Third Tranches (Waiver of Conditions)" dated June 11, 1996 (summary presented in matrix on
pages 5-9). In the Ninth Economic and Social Development Plan, the GOS reiterated that efficient
management, maintenance, and development of the infrastructure sectors, including the transport
sector, are critical to Senegal's future economic development, poverty alleviation objectives,
domestic competitiveness, and regional integration. In line with this a joint Government-Bank
MTSTS was issued in June 1997. The MTSTS, molded by the lessons from the PAST project
(see Section D.3) and with the active participation of a wide spectrum of sector stakeholders, has
recommended a strategy and agenda for further reform and improvements in the sector. The
proposed project (PST2), supported by a new Letter of Sector Policy (LSP2), will pursue reforms
and consolidate past and ongoing efforts.
3.3  The principles underlying the Government's policies and proposed reforms and regulatory
interventions in the sector uider the LSP2 include: (i) adapting transport infrastructure to the
needs of economic growth and of regional integration; (ii) further strengthening sector institutions
and the Administration to improve capacity to perform the essential functions of planning,
coordination, regulation, and supervision; (iii) extensive stakeholder involvement in the decision-
making process regarding the management and development of the sector; (iv) adoption of
regulatory and fiscal frameworks designed to induce competition and promote private sector
participation in the development and management of the sector; (v) continued promotion of local
private contractors to develop technical and management capacity to efficiently carry out
increased shares of maintenance works for road, rail and port infrastructure; (vi) continued
emphasis on maintenance and rehabilitation, while pursuing selective infrastructure expansion
(encompassing all transport modes); (vii) development of rural transport including the definition
of a coherent policy, preparation of an appropriate strategy and definition of an action plan for the
provision and maintenance of rural roads (including a pilot priority program of rural roads
rehabilitation); and (viii) ensuring environmental and social sustainability in the sector.
Consistent with the above, a detailed list of objectives and plans of action back up LSP2 with the
proposed PST2 supporting efforts to further the principles outlined, as well as the objectives and
implementation of the plans of action. GOS commitment to the principles of LSP2 is one of the
key elements for attainment of the PST2's development objective. (see Section D.4).
4.   Main Sector Issues, Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
4.1  The project is designed to support a five and a half year time slice of the GOS' sector
maintenance and investment program (SMIP) including institutional and policy development
support. A number of important sector issues have been identified during the supervision of the
on-going PAST project with more than 21 studies conducted by both national and international
consultants on key transport areas during the PST2 preparation. These studies have also identified
a number of key issues that need to be addressed.

4.2  Donors and other multilateral and bilateral institutions will finance about 51% of the
project, with the Government (including public enterprises) financing about 27% of total project
costs; the private sector 7%; and the Bank covering the remainder, about 15%. Annex 3B outlines
the financing plan for the project. The following matrix summarizes the main sector issues
identified both through PAST supervision and PST2 preparation. In addition it presents the main
PAST project accomplishments in these areas, and outlines proposed project solutions, both in
terms of institutional and policy reforms as well as physical improvements.

C. Project Description Summary
1.   A detailed list of the preparatory studies undertaken for the PST2 to further strengthen the quality of project
design as well as contribute to the definition of appropriate strategic choices is found in the Project File (Annex 8).
As noted in Section 2 (b), more than 21 studies were conducted to identify those institutional and policy issues upon
which the proposed project would need to focus to ensure that physical improvements are sustainable and GOS
objectives for the transport sector met. For illustration purposes, the following briefly summarizes some of the main
conclusions reached by one of the studies - on the Dakar-Ziguinchor maritime-river route - which was instrumental
in designing part of the port/maritime component.
(i)  road transport between Dakar and the Casamance is a poor alternative because of the bad state of the
roads which result in high transport costs, the poor state of the vehicles, harassment from customs and police
officials, the lack of safety and security, and the physical territorial incontinuity caused by the Gambia's
geographical situation;
(ii)  the demand for low-cost transport of both passengers and goods between Dakar and the Casamance by
ship far outstrips existing supply, however, basic on-land infrastructure to support the operations of ships is
grossly inadequate; the draft in key portions of the routes used by boats is shallow and a major restrictive
factor; and the only boat used for low-fare transport needs basic repair and maintenance that has been
consistently neglected;
9



(iii) the fares set by the Government, regardless of their social justification, are leading to increased
operational losses while still not making it possible to meet demand either in terms of quantity or quality;
and
(iv) overall, no incentives are being provided to allow the private sector to assist in making up for the
supply-demand imbalance.
1.1   As shown elsewhere, the project will address most of the problems/issues identified above through support
for institutional development, policy definition and design/refinement of regulatory frameworks to promote private
sector involvement and the financing of essential physical investments in works (limited dredging) and
infrastructure.
1.2   On a broader front, the project has been divided into 11 components which cover all of the main transport
sectors in Senegal. The first 5 concern mainly institutional and policy strengthening, with the remaining 6 consisting
of a combination of technical assistance and physical works. Each of the components is further divided into sub-
components with a specific development focus. The following table presents the project components in a summary
form with Annex 2 providing a more detailed description and cost breakdown.

1.   Project components
2.   Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
2.1  As discussed above, the project will support several policy and institutional reforms to
address current issues and will include policy and regulatory reform measures, technical
assistance and training. Key reforms are outlined above, some of which are: (i) the reform of
Road Fund; (ii) introduction of a three-year rolling RMRP system as a key planning and
programming tool; (iii) the restructuring of the road management system through the
establishment of an autonomous road works entity; (iv) the privatization of the operation of
international rail service on the Dakar-Bamako corridor; (v) the privatization of Air Sen6gal; (vi)
the privatization of airport management; (vii) the restructuring of the debt of sector companies;
and (viii) the development of a rural transport policy. In addition, program coordination will be
improved with the adoption of CELCO's revised terms of reference and reporting arrangements
as well as the preparation of a Procedures Manual.
3. Benefits and target population
3.1  The programmed investments are expected to yield substantial benefits by improving the
productivity and competitiveness of the Senegalese economy and improving access to markets
and service for the poor. All 10 regions will benefit. The roads component is itself focused on the
regional road network and hence will directly benefit the poorer segments of the rural populations
they serve, both in terms of improved rural as well as intra-rural mobility, increasing access to
centers of employment, education and social services. The target population is around 2 million
spread through the various regions. In addition, the rail component, which crosses 6 regions will
reinforce the benefits to the rural poor (See 5. Social and Poverty Impact). Other global benefits
which will be realized through the various investments include:
*  The project supports restructuring and streamlining measures for the Road Maintenance Fund
to induce greater accountability and sustainability in public financing of the road subsector.
Specific stakeholder organizations will be represented on the Road Fund Advisory and
Review Board and will have a critical input into decisions related to fund use. The Road Fund
will be refocused to expend most of its resources on the maintenance of roads, resulting in
better overall maintenance of roads outside of the main urban areas. Improved and more
efficient road rehabilitation and maintenance will result in improved conditions for a larger
proportion of the road network. Due to improved all-weather market access, agricultural
products and other essential goods will be more traded and access to all products for the rural
poor will be improved.
*  Reduced transport costs, fresher produce and more on time deliveries will make Senegal's
products and services more competitive in local, regional and international markets.
*  The project will have a substantial impact on local private sector development and
employment. The project will help to strengthen the management capacity of local firms
while local consultants will be able to offer their services for studies, auditing, and other
activities. In addition to using local contractors and consultants, an estimated total of 13,000
skilled and unskilled locals will be directly employed, per annum, during the construction
period for road works and maintenance, track replacement and rehabilitation, as well as port
and airport construction and maintenance.

* Quality of rail transport services will be improved through private operation of international
services, and transport costs will also be reduced as a result of efficiency enhancement
investments. Improved quality of freight rail service will result in an increased use of the
facilities at the Port of Dakar (which is in direct competition with Abidjan) for Malian
imports and exports.
* Institutional strengthening and reform measures under the project will result in a more
efficient sector administration.
* A marked improvement in road safety on the national network will have a quantifiable
benefit in terms of the costs of avoided accidents, Presently there are an estimated 2200 road
fatalities annually. Project features include a focus on accident safety and prevention, through
improved road design, elimination of black spots and increased driver training. Although the
benefits will be translated to the whole population it is the poor who, as pedestrians and users
of unsafe private mass transport means in both urban and rural areas, suffer
disproportionately from road accidents, will benefit most.
* Development of national maritime transport activities will help reduce transport costs within
the country and increase trade making it possible to bring agricultural produce to populated
centers where demand is high. This will be reflected in increased GNP growth.
* Investments in the civil aviation sector will improve security and safety of airport operations,
extend the economic life of many existing assets, reduce plane taxiing time and therefore
costs, increase airport passenger and cargo handling capacity while improving overall
conditions, promote tourism and reduce the export cost and increase the export volume of
perishable high value agricultural and fisheries products, through a reduction of current high
losses.
4.   Institutional and implementation arrangements
4.1  Implementation Period: July 1999-December 2004
4.2  Implementing Agencies
4.3  The project will be coordinated by the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Planning
(MEFP) through a Project Coordination Unit (CELCO) similar in part to the arrangement under
the on-going Transport Sector Adjustment Project (CELCO-PAST which is under the METT).
The repositioning of CELCO-PAST to MEFP has taken place and its key personnel has been
recruited. MEFP will work in collaboration with MTTA, MPTM, METT and the PM's Office.
Each government agency (DTT, DTP, DMM, MTTA/DAC/DMA, AANS (ASECNA-Senegal),
SONATRA-Air Senegal, SNCS, SONAPAD, CELCO (rural transport and environment
components), and State Portfolio Management Unit-CGCPE-MEFP (privatizations) participating
in the project will be responsible for the implementation of each of their own component
activities. Implementation will be based on an Annual Work Program and Budget (WPB)
prepared by each agency with the assistance of CELCO. A draft project execution manual (PEM)
has been prepared to provide the necessary guidelines for all implementing agencies. The PEM
incorporates the financial and accounting systems procedures manual prepared for the PAST
project, amended as needed and carried over into the PST2. CELCO will act as the coordinating
body and secretariat for the WPB process. The Road Fund Advisory Board (RFAB) already
established will review the functions of the Road Fund, advise the Ministers of Finance and Land
Transport, and ensure that the Road Fund is run along well defined technical, accounting and
financial management lines. It will include a separate Secretariat with well remunerated technical
15



staff having specific relevant expertise in financial and accounting management, road works and
procurement. The Road Fund Board has representation from both the private and public sectors.
Project Coordination
4.4 As stated above, MEFP will, in collaboration with METT, MITA, and MPTM, provide
oversight and guidance for the program. Day-to-day coordination and follow-up of the entire
project will be the responsibility of CELCO which was set up under the PAST program. Revised
terms of reference have been prepared for CELCO so that it may better respond to a changed
context, and agreement has been reached on its new positioning within MEFP. Administrative
texts have been prepared (and are in the approval process) to put the new measures into effect
before negotiations. The recruitment of key staff will begin as soon as possible after the new
measures are adopted. Concerning the Road Fund, the Advisory and Review Board comRplete with
a Secretariat including accountinn and management staff reporting to the MEFP and METT will
be set up before negotiation. It key functions will be to monitor, review and advise on the
management and execution of the Road Fund. The Road Fund will have clear operating and
disbursement procedures. IDA will provide support for Board set-up and for its operations during
the early years. The Unit for the Management and Control of the State Portfolio at MEFP
(CGCPE-MEFP) will be closely consulted and would take the lead in privatization matters.
Project implementation will take place in accordance with the provisions of the PEM.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements
4.5  CELCO will be responsible for overall project administrative and financial management
and reporting, including arrangements for audits, in accordance with systems and procedures
acceptable to IDA. Accounting and financial management systems and procedures including
detailed and clear reporting procedures have been prepared and put in place under the on-going
PAST. A computerized accounting and financial management system is in place and has been
tested and found satisfactory although some adjustments are needed and currently being
undertaken. Financial planning and management will be done on the basis of the WPB process. A
new Special Account for the proposed IDA credit will be opened and maintained in a commercial
Bank acceptable to IDA, managed by CELCO. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA will audit
the use of all IDA funds available under the credit, including the IDA special account and the
statements of expenditures. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after
the end of the fiscal year. The format and the frequency of periodic reporting will be defined in
the PEM. An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared within six months after
Credit closing. All financial and accounting activities will take into consideration the Year 2000
computer concerns, which are being coordinated internally by the Bank. (see Annex 6).
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
4.6  Continuous monitoring, annual reviews and a mid-term evaluation will be based on
predetermined indicators which will measure inputs, process, outputs and outcomes. Performance
and monitoring indicators are defined in Annex 1. The overall project monitoring and evaluation
system will be guided by the Project Design Summary (Annex 1) and the PEM (see Annex 6).
Mid-Term Review
4.7  An in-depth, rnid-term review will be carried out at the end of the second full year of
project implementation (not later than January 31, 2002). The review would be organized by
CELCO in collaboration with all stakeholders. The purpose would be to review project progress
16



in meeting its objectives, overall performance against established and agreed key performance
indicators, and would include a mid-term evaluation of economic, financial and social impacts
(including investment and financing plans, quantified and non-quantified benefits), as well as
environmental impacts and mitigation actions. The review would provide the opportunity for IDA
to assess the Government's continued commitment to the project's objectives, reform of the
transport sector, and level of private sector participation. The review will also allow for
modification, if necessary, of project features to improve effectiveness. During negotiations,
agreement on the timing and objectives of the Mid-Term Review was obtained.
D.   Project Rationale
1.   Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
1.1 Four project alternatives were considered. The first alternative contemplated was a project
which included a comprehensive rural transport component. Due to the absence of even a
rudimentary government strategy in this sector it was agreed that a more sensible approach would
be to first define a strategy and policy for rural transport (and test some alternatives through pilot
rural road works) after which a stand alone project would be processed. Preparation of the stand
alone project would be undertaken under the preferred altemative. This altemative was therefore
rejected.
1.2  The second altenative included an urban transport component in the project. This was
rejected because of the need for focus and because the subsector is presently covered by a stand
alone Urban Transport and Technical Assistance project where a self-standing Urban Transport
Project would be a logical follow-up. Such a project has now been included in the Senegal
lending program.
1.3  The third altemative was to design and process two separate operations because of the
great scope, spread and breadth of the proposed undertakings, splitting the proposed PST2
program as follows: (i) a project covering road maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading, land
transport modemization and the creation of a rural transport strategy to be called Transport 2
(PT2 - IDA Credit $43 million); and (ii) an operation covering ports/maritime transport, railways,
civil aviation, promotion of private sector initiatives and environmental mitigation to be named
Transport 3 (PT3 - IDA Credit $42 million). Both operations would have been prepared as SSIPs
(subsector investment programs). Co-financing would have been at the same level, as co-financier
interest is very sub-sector specific. Benefiting from the coherence and synergies that have been
established under the PAST, the alternative of two separate but closely sequenced operations
could have been a logical "second generation" arrangement for ensuring focused and effective
monitoring and attention to implementation of improvements in the sector. In addition, the two
project approach would have provided more explicit supervision resources.
1.4 This alternative was actively considered. EIowever, in view of the acknowledged
advantages of a sector-wide approach, at least during preparation, which includes the design of
consistent approaches to cross-sectoral issues, it was agreed that the final decision regarding the
above option, if still considered appropriate, would be made following appraisal.
1.5  The option finally adopted, the fourth alternative, is a variance of the third one. Factors in
favor of this option included: (i) implementation and monitoring of complex and inter-related
project reforms as well as inter-modal issues are often best addressed under a single umbrella; (ii)
phasing of projects, or splitting components into numerous parts can be difficult to implement
when there are a number of stakeholders participating in various components. Also, monitoring of
17



stakeholders' progress and covering shortfalls in the event of financing pull-outs becomes
particularly difficult; (iii) successes under the PAST program indicate that the country is capable
of implementing a complex, multi-faceted project. In addition, a single large credit provides
greater leverage in policy implementation. In support of this alternative it was understood that: (i)
Bank supervision would be funded sustainably at a level of about $150,000 - $160,000 per
annum, which is roughly 50% higher than the standard total allocation for supervision of a single
project; (ii) other donors would be asked for more direct involvement in the supervision of their
specific components thus reducing the Bank's burden; and (iii) as was the case with project
preparation, supervision would be delegated over time to the Senegalese through increased
"projectization" of costs.

3.   Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
3.1  Prior to the PAST, the Bank had financed eleven transport operations in Senegal including
five road, three port and three railway projects, in addition to financing rural roads components
under agricultural projects. These projects had all attempted, with disappointing results in many
cases, to introduce reforms in the transport subsectors.
3.2  The more recent of these completed projects (Third Railway Project, Credit 1518-SE,
Third Port Project, Credit 1459-SE and the PAST, Credit 2266-SE) have provided an opportunity
for the Bank to establish an open and frank dialogue with the government on the major
shortcomings of the transport sector. Agreement was reached on the need to define and adopt
18



policy and institutional reform measures. A detailed reform action plan by subsector (road,
railway, port and civil aviation) was prepared. Implementation of specific reforms was a
condition of the adjustment component of the PAST allowing for the monitoring and
implementation of the remaining policy reform measures through tranche disbursement
conditionalities.
3.3  Other donors have been active in the transport sector, and more specifically in the PAST.
However, during implementation, coordination was sometimes inadequate with some donors
taking unilateral action based on their own interests, without considering the impact of their
actions on the overall program implementation. This sometimes led to a disruption of balanced
implementation between the subsectors and the different transport modes. The most pertinent
lessons learned from past projects are outlined below with action plans presented on how the
proposed project will deal with the issues identified.
Information base
3.4  Transport infrastructure databases, including those available in the road subsector are
neither regularly maintained nor updated. Decisions on planning and programming of
maintenance works and budget allocations are therefore often made without reliable information.
3.5 Proposed Project Action - Priority will be given to computerizing, modernizing and
updating of databases on the state of roads and road transport infrastructure to ensure the timely
availability of information needed to make a realistic estimate of the maintenance, rehabilitation
and new investment needs. As part of preparation of this project, a number of specific studies
were undertaken with a view to updating the information base (see Annex 8). In addition, it is
proposed to introduce a GIS-Transport component as well as improved survey, collection and
analysis capability.
Human Resource Development
3.6 Measures aimed at human resource development under the PAST project have improved
the implementation capacities of the various agencies, but planning and programming remain
weak, particularly in the road sub-sector.
3.7 Proposed Project Action - The human resource aspects of the project have been carefully
assessed and include: (i) an evaluation of training needs; (ii) introduction of adequate training
plans; and (iii) proper targeting of technical assistance to include information transfer targets and
the design of a follow-up mechanism. The organizational and institutional diagnostic assessment
of the DTP carried out as part of project preparation work includes this assessment and
reconmmendations.
Implementation Procedures
3.8  Past projects in the transport sector have been implemented without a procedural
fiamework. This has had a negative impact on implementation and has hamnpered effective
coordination among implementation agencies.
3.9 Proposed Project Action - A draft project execution/procedures manual (including
reporting format and requirements, and coordination mechanisms) has been prepared and was
circulated at Negotiations. A manual of financial and accounting procedures has also been
19



completed and will be integrated into the overall procedures manual. The finalization of the PEM
is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
Resource allocation criteria
3.10 The allocation of resources between new investments and maintenance, and rehabilitation
of existing infrastructure, especially in the road sub-sector, has not always been based on clearly
defined criteria. Factors that need to be taken into account include the additional costs to the
economy in vehicle repairs and maintenance resulting from neglected maintenance, the higher
costs of postponed maintenance, future maintenance recurrent cost requirements of new
investments undertaken in the sector, and criteria for providing access to high potential
agriculture regions.
3.11 Proposed Project Action - The project will support an investment split of  75%
maintenance and 25% new works program. In addition, a 3-year rolling maintenance program
will ensure that maintenance remains a priority.
Weak absorptive capacity of some agencies
3.12 The absorptive capacity of certain agencies remains weak. This has been compounded by
the procedural void mentioned above, and the inefficiency of the technical assistance provided.
Planning and programming performance have been inadequate and execution below par in many
cases.
3.13 Proposed Project Action - Project design includes provisions for implementation based on
an Annual Work Program and Budget (WPB), a strengthened coordination mechanism, and well
targeted technical assistance, training and other institutional building measures. A capacity
building program has also been included for the public works companies which deal with road
maintenance but have displayed technical and managerial shortcomings.
Financial mobilization capacity of public sector companies
3.14 The debt burden of public sector companies was dramatically increased following the 1994
devaluation of the CFA Franc, leading to an unhealthy financial structure. Although in practice
much of the debt on-lent by the GOS is not being serviced by the transport entities, non-
provision of relief has meant a high level of indebtedness on the balance sheets and high debt
service requirements. This has in turn reduced the ability of these companies, despite increased
profitability, to mobilize new funding from private sources.
3.15 Proposed Project Action - An in-depth review of the companies' debt burden is being
undertaken with a view to reaching agreement on a restructuring framework and action plans.
4.   Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
4.1  The Borrower has shown its commitment and project ownership through the following: (i)
it has prepared its own retrospective evaluation of the on-going project to identify key constraints,
single out major weaknesses, and draw lessons for the future; (ii) it has produced a sector strategy
paper with the assistance of national consultants; (iii) it has prepared a draft LSP2; (iv) it has
participated actively in efforts to assess the existing Road Fund mechanism and restructure it; (v)
it has participated actively in the redefinition of the terms of reference of CELCO; (vi) it has
20



proposed, on its own initiative, the creation of a Road Works Management Agency; and (vii) it is
playing a leading role in defining the privatization strategies.
5.   Value added of Bank support in this project
5.1  The Bank has been a leading supporter of the transport sector in Senegal since the 1970s.
It's value added may be summed up as follows: (i) the Bank has played a key leadership and
coordinating role with other donors to ensure policy reform; (ii) it has provided critical advice
and created a favorable climate for capacity building by encouraging the Government to assume
an increasing role in all aspects of project activities; (iii) it has provided valuable advice on
combining country specifics with best practice, as is contemplated in the restructuring of the
Road Fund and the creation of the Road Works Agency; and (iv) staff have specialized skills and
the possibility to draw on world-wide experience to advise the GOS on all elements related to the
transport sector including "frontier" areas such as private management of airports in the region.
Continued Bank involvement in the sector ensures more effective coordination between transport
sector reform and the overall economic management program.
E.   Summary Project Analysis
The project analysis was based on: experience and information accumulated through the
PAST project; lessons learned in other related Bank projects in the country; cross-information
from similar Bank projects globally; consultant studies prepared under the PPF to determine
feasibility of each proposed component, and design and develop implementation strategies; GOS
input; advise and information from the Bank's Resident Mission; Bank missions and internal
advisory support. (Detailed information concerning project background and preparation are
available in the project file, see Annex 8).

1.1    A detailed quantified economic analysis has been carried out for each of the project's
main sectoral sub-components. In addition, an economic analysis for the whole program was
completed as well as a limited distributional analysis which includes the program's employment
and fiscal impact. This program evaluation takes into account all of the quantifiable costs and
benefits identified by the separate analyses. The program viability, at a base economic internal
rate of return (EIRR) of 35% remains robust under the sensitivity analyses. The break-even
analysis for the program demonstrates that costs would have to increase by almost 50%, in
parallel with a benefit decrease of 50%, for the project EIRR to equate the 12% discount rate. In
terms of the distributional analysis, as noted in Section C-3, it is estimated that about 13,000
unskilled locals will be directly employed through the project works annually during the
construction phase. In addition the project will have a positive fiscal impact as a more efficient
transport system is likely to increase usage and thereby generate more fiscal revenues both
through increased usage as well as increased employment. It is currently estimated that the road
21



sector alone will generate more than CFAF 60 billion (over US$ 100 million) in tax revenues per
year. Annex 4 details the program evaluation, with Annexes 4A-4F presenting the detailed
analyses. A summary of the individual economic analyses conducted is presented below:
(a)    Road Component - The HDM-III model was used for the road analysis, as defined by
the DTP and based on a network-wide survey of road characteristics and traffic. Financial costs
were adjusted for economic factors and a discount rate of 12% was employed. Economic rates of
return (EIRR) for each proposed road link range from 17-100+% for unpaved roads, 19-100+%
for paved roads, and 12-24% for the proposed new roads. Sensitivity analyses for each sub-
component indicate a strong robustness, depending on the different maintenance strategies
adopted. Details of the evaluation are found in Annex 4A. In addition a roads program analysis
was conducted. A base case EIRR of 52% has been calculated. The sensitivity analyses for the
program indicate that the EIRR remains robust. This program economic analysis is also further
detailed in Annex 4A. As specified in the LSP2, the economic criteria for financing under the
road component is a minimum 12% EIRR. Subprojects below this rate could only be financed
following discussions with IDA providing evidence of significant unquantifiable benefits which
could not be factored into the IRR calculations (such as furthering regional integration objectives,
impact on poverty, regional balance and women, etc.). The standards for construction used must
also be the least cost solution.
(b) Rail Component - The economic returns for the railway component are also solid at
between 17-28% for each of the main rail investments considered. The base case EIRR for the
rail program as a whole is 18%. A break-even analysis of the rail program indicates that costs
would have to increase by 23% and benefits decrease by 23% for the EIRR to drop to 12%.
Because of the special tax exempt status of the investments, the economic costs are similar to the
financial ones. Details of the analysis are provided in Annex 4B, including the main assumptions.
The main quantifiable benefits identified consist of: (i) savings in operation and maintenance of
rolling stock; (ii) savings in staff costs; (iii) savings in reduced derailments; (iv) incremental
increase in rail revenue due to increased freight movements; and (v) traffic diversion benefits. In
addition, due to the discrepancy between project life and actual asset life of the investments made
under the program, a salvage value for these investments has also been included in the analysis.
(c) Port Component - The port component, which consists of an evaluation of both public and
private sector investments for the Port of Dakar, indicates a base case economic internal rate of
return of 16%. To ensure that the proposed investments reflect needs resulting from increased
traffic volumes these investments have been phased. The first phase consists of public financing
and the second private financing. Because the full extent of benefits resulting from private sector
participation have not been identified, the EIRR calculated is considered to be conservative. A
break-even analysis indicates that costs would have to increase by 11% and benefits decrease by
11% for the EIRR to drop to 12%. Further benefits, risks, impact and qualitative assessments for
the ports/maritime as well as transport modernization components are found in Annex 4C. As in
the case of the railways, the tax exempt status of the port means that the financial and economic
costs are similar. The main quantifiable benefits identified consist of: (i) voc savings due to
improved road access; (ii) savings in container ship waiting time due to improved ship
positioning; (iii) savings in cargo handling costs; and (iv) GNP value-added resulting from
increased exports. As with the railways, due to the discrepancy between project life and actual
asset life of the program investments, a salvage value for these investments has also been
calculated and included in the analysis.
(d) Aviation Component - The aviation component, which consists mainly of investments in
the International Airport at Dakar (L.S.Senghor), indicates a base case EIRR of 19%. A break-
even analysis indicates that costs would have to increase by 25% and benefits decrease by 25%
22



for the EIRR to drop to 12%. Details of the analysis are provided in Annex 4D, including the
main assumptions. The main quantifiable benefits identified consist of: (i) incremental increase in
passenger revenues; (ii) increase in tourist spending; (iii) savings in terminal and runway
maintenance; (iv) savings in staff costs; and (v) cargo handling cost savings. As with both the rail
and ports components, due to the discrepancy between project life and actual asset life of the
program investments, a salvage value for these investments has been included in the analysis.
2.   Financial (refer to Annex 5)
2.1 Financial analyses were conducted for each of the project parastatals (revenue-earning
agencies) separately. The results of the pertinent analyses are summarized below and further
detailed in Annex 5.
(a) SNCS (National Railroad Company) - The financial statements of the National Railroad
Company (SNCS) have shown a steady improvement under the PAST. Sales have increased
about 10% p.a. from 1993 to 1997 while Earnings Before Depreciation, Interest and Taxes
(EBMI) have gone from a negative 13% to 13% of sales revenues. Net results have gone from a
net loss representing 5% of sales in 1993 to a net profit representing 5% of sales in 1997. The
liquidity position has not on the whole improved with the current ratio remaining stable at about I
during the period. However, the financial structure has worsened as a result of the 1994 CFA
Franc devaluation. SNCS is in arrears in its debt repayment so that the numbers in the balance
sheets do not represent the real situation. The debt-equity ratio is unsatisfactory being at more
than 65% during most of the period.
The rail component shows an internal financial rate of return of 20% and a NPV of CFAF 21
billion at 12%. The main benefits are derived from savings in operating costs and some increases
in revenue from more quantities of goods transported at the national level than would have been
the case without the project investments. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the
impact of adverse developments on the key parameters including: investment costs, savings and
additional revenues on the overall project performance. The results show that the investments
would still have satisfactory results under the assumptions made: costs would have to increase by
170% for the NPV to come to 0 and the IRR to drop to 8%.
(b) Port of Dakar - As with the railroad company, the financial statements indicate that there
has been a steady improvement under the PAST program. Sales have increased 25% p.a. from
1993 to 1997 while EBIT have gone from 27 tO 34% of sales revenues. Net income increased
from 4 to 9% of sales and the current ratio improved from 1.1 to 2.1. The financial projections
show that, based on the assumptions used, the proposed investments under the project would
yield satisfactory results: (i) EBIT would increase from 34% in 1997 to more than 40% in 1999
and beyond after a brief dip to 32% in 1998; (ii) net income would stabilize at around 6%; and
(iii) the overall liquidity situation would be acceptable. The additional debt incurred under the
project would decrease the debt service coverage ratios from the high levels of 1995 and 1996.
However, they would still be adequate at more than 3. Meanwhile, the debt-equity ratio would
reach its highest level of 57% when all the project-related loans are drawn down in 2002.
The port component shows an internal financial rate of return of 9%. The main benefits are
derived from savings in operating costs and an increase in revenues from more quantities of
goods handled than would have been the case without the project investments. A sensitivity
analysis was carried out to determine the impact of adverse developments on the key parameters
including: investment costs, savings and additional revenues on the overall project performance.
Results indicate that the investments would still have satisfactory results under a 25% increase in
23



investment costs, a 25% decrease in the projected savings and projected additional revenues.
(c) AANS: Airport Management - The financial statements of AANS indicate significant
swings over the past few years, from a break-even situation in 1993 and 1994 to a huge loss in
1995 and then again a large net profit in 1996. Although internal statements showed a near-break-
even in 1997, a Bank-financed accounting and financial study has shown a huge loss (CFA
Francs 1.6 billion) in 1997. EBlTs have reflected the swings in reported earnings, going from
28% to 9% and then a record 30% of sales in 1990, 1996 and 1997 respectively. Nonetheless, the
financial projections show that, based on the assumptions used, the proposed investments under
the project along with the proposed reform measures would yield satisfactory results for the new
airport management setup: (i) the level of profitability, even under the very conservative
assumptions made regarding the level of fees, would be adequate; (ii) the overall liquidity
situation would be good with the current ratio consistently above or near 2 except for the first
year of principal repayment; (iii) the debt-equity ratio would be highest (73%) when all the loan
funds have been disbursed. It should be pointed out, however, that equity, quasi-equity or internal
cash flow financing has been put at 20% because of the uncertainties still surrounding the terms
and conditions under which privatization of airport management will take place. The level of
equity financing and/or financing from internal cash flow has the potential of being significantly
increased.
The civil aviation component shows a internal financial rate of return of 9%. The main benefits
are derived from savings in operating costs (most specifically personnel costs) and an increase in
revenues from more passenger and freight traffic than would have been the case without the
project investments and/or the implementation of the reform program. A sensitivity analysis was
carried out to determine the impact of adverse developments on the key parameters including:
investment costs, savings and additional revenues, on the overall project performance. The results
indicate that the investments would still have satisfactory results under the assumptions made: a
25% increase in investment costs, a 25% decrease in the projected savings and a 25% decrease in
the projected additional revenues.
(d) CEREEQ (Experimental Center for Research and Study of Equipment) - Financial
results have steadily improved since 1993. However, this is tempered somewhat by the fact that
the agency continued to receive investment subsidies that reached 28% of sales in 1996. The
financial projections indicate that as a result of the project investments for CEREEQ, and
efficiency improvement measures, EBIT would improve from an average of about 20% over the
last five years to more than 30% of sales. At the same time, the liquidity situation would improve.
Finally, even after the investments are financed through a combination 75% from a loan and 25%
from internationally generated cash flow, the financial structure of CEREEQ would show a debt-
equity ratio of 42%, at its highest level, and a debt service coverage ratio of at least close to 3.
The IRR for the CEREEQ component is 31 %. The sensitivity analysis shows that investments
will still retain satisfactory results with an operational cost increase of 25%.
3.   Technical
3.1    The three-year rolling RMRP has been prepared in detail using available road planning
tools, specifically the HDM-III model. All road works, including new construction, rehabilitation,
periodic and routine maintenance are contracted to the private sector and although the technical
capability of small local firms involved in road works has improved in recent years, it needs to
be further strengthened. Knowledge transfer from larger to small and medium-sized companies
24



will continue to be encouraged. In addition to the training program designed for these companies,
a system for monitoring capacity and quality assurance will be developed (see below). The
technical capabilities of the ports and railway companies on the other hand are high with most
works subcontracted to private sector firms.
4.   Institutional
Project Coordination
4.1   The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning (MEFP) will be responsible for the
overall coordination of project activities carried out by the various implementing agencies. Day to
day coordination will be carried out by a Project Coordinating Unit (CELCO). (see section C-4,
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements).
Project Management
4.2   Each component will be implemented by the agency responsible for the sub-sector
concemed, a system that has generally been satisfactory in the past, with one exception, the
Public Works Department (DTP). As a result the planning, programming, and implementation of
sector activities, 'especially in the road sub-sector, will be an area of continued focus. A recent
review of the operations and management of DTP, undertaken as part of project preparation
recommended significant organizational change. However, in light of the improbability of the
cumulative effects of such adjustments leading to acceptable levels of efficiency and
effectiveness over the long-term, the Government has opted, with the support and encouragement
of all the donors, to create an autonomous Road Works Agency (AAGTR) with clear procedures,
accountability and performance benchmarks, and operating resource levels commensurate with
staffing requirements. During the transition period (between DTP and AAGTR) the following are
being instituted in line with the organizational improvements recommended: (i) preparation of a
3-year rolling road maintenance program using HDM III; (ii) preparation of a detailed first year
road maintenance program as part of the 3-year rolling program; (iii) staff training in the use of
BDM III; and (iv) reform of the Road Fund to ensure more efficiency and transparency. This will
be facilitated through the creation of a Road Fund Advisory Board whose main tasks will be to:
(i) set appropriate procedures for planning, programming, implementation and control of
maintenance works; (ii) report to the Ministers on how effectively these procedures are followed;
(iii) provide technical advice to the Ministers on the Annual Road Maintenance Programs to be
approved; and (iv) provide meaningful input to the MEFP on how effectively the conditions of
disbursements of funds are met. The AAGTR study will include an evaluation to determine the
fate of the Road Fund Board in relation to the agency. The TORs for this study have been
prepared and a timetable for implementation agreed upon.
4.3    Monitoring of project activities in a systematic fashion will be reinforced. As noted in
Section C4, Institutional and Implementation Arrangements, CELCO will be located in MEFP,
with its work supported and guided by a procedures and execution manual. Technical audits will
be carried out on an annual basis. This will be reinforced by annual reviews of all project aspects.
In addition a Mid-Term Review will be carried out not later than January 31, 2002 (noted in
Section C-4 (f)).
5.   Social and Poverty Impact (See Annex 4F)
5.1  Senegal, a country of almost 8.5 million, has a high incidence of poverty, illiteracy and
unemployment. Thirty-three percent of the population is considered to be below the poverty line
25



with 45% estimated poor in relative terms. The proportion is higher in the rural areas (66%) than
in the urban areas (14%). These socio-economic income groups have two key determinants of
poverty in common: (i) low level of capital endowment (including human capital), and (ii) limited
or no access to social services and economic opportunities, including schools. As a result
illiteracy is high, about 67%, and affects women more than men. A poverty assessment conducted
by the World Bank in 1995 listed transport cost as one of the factors constraining the supply and
demand of education to the poor. The following regions are considered the poorest: (i) Kolda, (ii)
Fatick, (iii) Kaolack, (iv) Ziguinchor, and (v) Diourbel.
5.2 In terms of employment, approximately 45% of the population participates in the labor
force, with an estimated 75% under-employed. The overall unemployment rate is estimated at
30%, and even with urban unemployment increasing, in Senegal it remains essentially a rural
phenomenon. In terms ofjob distribution it is estimated that the majority of jobs (more than 80%)
are located in the Dakar area. The project will positively impact the living standard of both urban
and rural dwellers. During the construction period alone it is estimated that a total of about 13,000
unskilled workers will be employed per annum on the various project works, with three of the
five above-listed poorest regions (Fatick, Kaolack, and Diourbel) accounting for over 30% of this
employment. In addition it is estimated that those employed will support a total of almost 30,000,
including spouse, children and other relatives. This does not take into account any indirect
employment that may arise as a result of the project or project works. The roads in particular will
increase access and mobility for the rural poor in all regions, and reduce both travel time and
transport costs associated with daily activities (see 7 (a) below), further increasing employment
opportunities for low-income households through improved access to employment centers. The
project's rural roads component is also expected to have a direct impact on the low-income
population in the project's targeted areas through reduced transaction costs, increased agricultural
production, increased access to markets and improved access to social services, including
education and health centers.
6.   Environmental assessment
6.1  The project falls under Category B. A thorough sector-wide environmental assessment has
been conducted to determine the likely impacts of the project and to develop concrete action
plans to mitigate negative project effects on the environment. Furthermore, a number of actions
are programnmed into the project through specific environmental and social sustainable
components, to ensure environmental sustainability both for the project itself and for the transport
sector in general. At the institutional level the project will reinforce environmental capabilities
within the various implementing agencies through training and technical assistance. Within the
project coordination unit (CELCO) an environmental position has been created to specifically
focus on environmental issues and to coordinate environmental assessments for the project
components as necessary. Legislative and regulatory issues as they relate to the project will also
be addressed. In terms of specific project environmental impacts, mitigation measures covering
deforestation, construction refuse, and various environmental nuisances related to construction, as
well as water and habitats have been identified and are included in Annex 2C. Total
enviromnental costs being financed by the project are estimated at US$ 4.6 million. An
environmental Action Plan for each transport sub-sector has been prepared (Annex 2C).
7.   Participatory approach
7.1   A national workshop was organized in March 1997 to initiate the retrospective evaluation
of the PAST, explore medium-term strategies and examine prospects regarding the PST 2. The
26



Medium-Term Transport Strategy was prepared with major input from all stakeholders. A
Senegalese mission to Washington in October 1997 reviewed specific components of the
proposed project and presented a first draft LSP2. A draft of the Project Concept Document
(PCD) was discussed at a national workshop with all stakeholders (including donors) in March
1998 in Dakar. A similar workshop was held on October 24 (during appraisal), where the draft
PAD, the Government's draft Consolidated Project Document (CPD), and the overall direction
and pace of implementation of both the government's transport strategy and project direction,
were discussed.
7.2  The preparation of the rural transport strategy will make extensive use of national, regional
and local workshops and will pay particular attention to the inclusion of marginalized groups. The
process of project preparation has been very interactive. Pre-appraisal and appraisal were
conducted concurrently and in close coordination by IDA and four of the co-financiers of the
project (AFD, BOAD, EU, and the Nordic Fund).
7.3 Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups: Given the overall poverty reduction
objective of the Government and the CAS, and the aim to reach this objective effectively and
efficiently, the assessment of beneficiaries in PST2 is based on its impact on policy-relevant
socio-economic groups (the poor). As conceived, the project's impact on the poor is mainly in
increased access to markets and services, reduced travel times and transport costs, improved
safety and employment through network expansion, infrastructure rehabilitation, and increased
tourism. This is particularly true with respect to the roads component which should particularly
benefit unskilled workers. In terms of the rural transport component, both men and women are
expected to be equal beneficiaries. For men, their access to employment and income-generating
activities is expected to be significant. With respect to women, the benefit will be more subtle.
Women play an important role in the household to the extent that their social obligations include
tasks such as fetching water and firewood. As a result they tend to carry a greater share of the
transport burden, where it is estimated that women contribute over 60% of their time and effort
on travel and the transport of basic needs. An improved rural network is expected to significantly
reduce the time spent on these tasks (recent UNEF study has suggested that time reductions could
be decreased by more than half and transport costs reduced by as much as 50% in monetary
terms).
7.4   Other key stakeholders: Almost 40% of project costs are to be financed by donors and
multilateral institutions other than the World Bank. In total there are 10 potential co-financiers for
PST2. These include: the Economic Union (EU), BID, AFD and FAC (of France), Nordic Fund,
West-African Development Bank (BOAD), African Development Bank (ADB), Saudi Fund,
Kuwaiti Fund, ASECNA (Article 2), and others. Discussions are well under way concerning the
interest and level of commitment of each co-financier. Confirmation of donor co-financing
interest covering specific portions of the project cost was obtained at a donors' meeting held on
February 1-2. 1999. with the assistance of the Bank.
F.   Sustainability and Risks
1.   Sustainability
1.1  Sustainability is enhanced by demonstrated Government commitment to the sector. This is
evidenced by its allocation of about 20% of its overall investment budget to the road sector in the
past several years and by the reforms already undertaken for the parastatals (railways, port,
27



airline) under the PAST. The need and justification for adequate investments in infrastructure is
well understood.
1.2  To further strengthen transport sustainability, the following actions have been taken or are
needed: (i) transparency, and a predictable supply and timely disbursement of funds for road
maintenance. Reform of the Road Fund is underway and will be operationalized through this
Credit (see Section G); (ii) effective capacity building; (iii) introduction of an efficient system for
road maintenance planning, programming and supervision and introduction of the three-year
rolling RMRP; and (iv) enhancement of regulatory capacity in the administration.

H.  Readiness for Implementation
1.   The engineering design documents for the first year's activities are complete and ready for
the start of project implementation as are the procurement documents. Advance procurement for
civil works and goods will be made in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. With the
current processing schedule, retroactive financing for certain project components may be
necessary given the present rate of project preparation. However, it is well understood that all
IDA guidelines will be observed prior to the release of any such funds. During project
implementation, CELCO will benefit from the assistance of a procurement specialist for the
handling/coordination and supervision of works as well as quality control on the procurement
actions of other units of the project.
1.1  The Project Implementation Plan has been appraised and found to be realistic and of
satisfactory quality. Details are found in the Project Execution Manual and the Project File (see
Annex 8). The Plan and the procurement documents for the first year's activities are complete and
ready for the start of project implementation.

Annex 2B: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2)
Annual Work Program and Budget Planning/Review Process
1.   PST2 will be implemented on the basis of Annual Work Programs and Budgets (AWP)
prepared in conformity with the Government's budget calendar. CELCO is responsible for
coordinating the budget. The AWP is submitted to the prescribed decision making bodies
(MPTM, MTTA, National Assembly and the respective boards of directors of the national
companies for instance). Before the start of each fiscal year and following the Government
budget calendar, all the agencies involved in the project including CELCO will prepare a program
of the activities they intend to have financed under the PST2 and called the AWP. This should
include: (i) a definition of the objectives for the coming year; (ii) a presentation of the proposed
strategy and a detailed description of the program of activities to achieve these objectives; (iii) an
estimate of the costs and expenditures to be incurred; and (iv) the financing plan proposed to meet
those costs on the basis of the financing sources available.
2.  In the case of the road component, the annual program will be made in part of the update of
the first year of the three-year rolling investment program already prepared.
3.   CELCO's budget includes investment costs (to be clearly defined but to include
equipment, office equipment and materials, works, construction, vehicles, training and studies)
and operating costs. The budget of other agencies is made mostly of investment costs and, in
some cases, operating costs. Both investment and operating budgets are prepared based on the
respective work programs proposed for the relevant year by agency, department or company.
4.   As soon as possible and well before the budget circular has been issued, CELCO should
contact all the agencies and/or companies to start discussions on the program of activities to be
financed under PST2 for the coming year. CELCO should thereafter request in writing that the
programs be communicated to it along with the corresponding budgets and financing plans. It
then consolidates these programs and budgets. The production of a single AWP reflecting all the
inputs received is the responsibility of the financial expert who will be assistant by all CELCO
staff as appropriate.
5.   The costs and expenditures should be presented according to the main categories financed
by each lender. The budget blueprint should then be transmitted to the lenders for review and
comments before the respective programs and budgets are approved by the decision making
bodies as appropriate. Once these bodies have approved the programs and budgets, they become
the main management tool for the coming year and the basis on which disbursements are to be
made.
6.   The following timetable is proposed for the AWP (subject to its conformity with the
Government actual budget calendar for any given year).
7.   June/July: In line with the Government budget timetable, CELCO contacts the PST2
agencies to discuss the AWP and request in writing that they submit AWP proposals. The draft
AWPs are produced and sent to CELCO which consolidates them. Budget meetings take place
between the Ministry of Finance and technical ministries.
11



8.   August/September: The AWP are sent to the lenders for review and comments. The
Government budget is sent to the Prime Minister for review and subsequent approval by the
council of ministers. It is later sent to the National Assembly for debate and adoption.
9.   November/December: Budget is adopted by the Assembly, the budget law is voted and
sent to the President to be signed. The lenders are again sent the most up-to-date version of the
AWP reflecting the budget at this stage to provide further comments on those parts which are not
part of the Government budget. Their views and comments are communicated to the Government
and the ffnal AWP is adopted for the following year.

Annex 2C : Second Transport Sector Program (PST2)
Summary Environmental Evaluation/Action Plan
1.   Previous projects undertaken in the transport sector did not give priority to environmental
concerns. The PST2 takes into account the environmental impact of project activities. A comprehensive
environmental assessment study has been carried out by a team of national consultants who limited
assistance from an international consultant. The study closely followed World Bank guidelines.
Specific proposals include:
* From an institutional and capacity building point:
(i)    the establishment of an environmental management unit within the Project Coordination
Unit (CELCO) responsible for the follow-up of the implementation the proposed action plan
and to coordinate the activities of the agencies in the project in the field of environment;
(ii)   the design and implementation of a large program to create awareness educate and
dissemination information on environmental management in all the agencies and involving
all the stakeholders and population concerned with the project;
(iii)   the use of national consultants, the well targeted assistance from international ones when
needed, to conduct specific environmental studies;
(iv)   institutional strengthening of all the agencies involved with the project in environmental
management;
From a regulatory and legislative point:
(i)    the promotion of the environment law to be applied to the whole transport sector;
(ii)   the updating of the different environment codes (for road, maritime, aviation and rail
operations);
(iii)   the preparation of the decree on the implementation of the systematic carrying out of
Environmental Impact Assessment studies to the whole sector (EIA).
*  At the level of studies and assessments:
(i)    the preparation of an environmental framework and road map for project activities;
(ii)   the definition of performance indicators.
2.   The environmental assessment of PST2 covers the following subsectors:
(i)   the road transport;
(ii)   river maritime transport;
(iii)  railway transport; and
(iv)   air transport.
13



It includes all the project components. The environmental management priority program (EMP)
developed came to the following conclusions:
* The overall impact of project activities on the environment could present major risks.
* However, the negative impact that had been identified and the measures proposed to mitigate them
are well known (Table 1).
3.   The project will take into account the recommendations of the EMP in order to mitigate these
impacts. It will be implemented according to the deadlines indicated and will finance all the costs related
to environmental management (Table 2).
4.   Some of the key impacts identified can be summarized as below:
* Reforestation: Construction and rehabilitation works (roads, rail, routes, airports) are likely to have
an impact on natural resources through the destruction of the forest and plants, which would lead a
warming of the atmosphere, the lowering of humidity and the disappearance or displacement of
animal species. The building of bridges, fences, the initiation of reforestation programs, the careful
planning of road maps and the creation and management of green spaces and access roads are some of
the measures to be undertaken.
*  Refuse: Important refuse and garbage production could result from the project activities . These
would invade both urban and rural areas. A refuse management plan has been proposed, starting with
a meticulous identification of the principal sources of production in each sub-sector. Revenue
generating activities that could or should be created to dispose of the garbage and refuse have also
been identified and would be promoted.
3  Nuisances: The project includes measures to eliminate or mitigate various other negative impacts:
sounds, smells, landscape) in order to improve the quality of life and the living environment of the
project beneficiaries. The reinforcement of technical controls, the relocation of markets which invade
the port areas, and the establishment of specific domains or areas are some of the measures
considered.
*  Eau: The impact on water systems will be dealt with when needed through the establishment of used
water treatment and the creation of mechanisms to protect underground water as well as lakes and
rivers. A better planning of the road system, especially for new roads will be one of the tools used as
well as well designed drainage systems and garbage collection and disposal.
Habitat: The bulk of the project deals with the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure. When new constructions pose a threat to habitat or leads to the need for resettlement,
the issues will be carefully investigated by involving all the stakeholders before a decision is taken
and, if necessary, adequate compensation measures will be taken.

Program IRk:                  35%
1.    Senegal is a country with a population of 8.5 million, which is growing at a rate of 2.6% per annum.
Over 40% of this population lives in urban areas where growth is estimated at about 5% per annum. Illiteracy
remains high (about 80%), as does unemployment (about 30% of the labor force), and under-employment
(approximately 76%). The incidence of poverty is also significant, with 54% earning less than US$1 per day.
Trhe per capita income is estimated at US$5 60 per annum.
2.    In terms of economic development historical growth has been slow. However, since 1994, after the
devaluation of the cfa, there has been significant economic activity, with GNP growth at about 5% per annum
since 1995. This is forecast to continue for the next 5 years. The composition of the GNP is as follows: services
account for 54%  of GNP, followed by agriculture at 19%  and industry at 17%. ODA remains an important
element accounting for almost 12% of GNP, with transport registering 10%. Balance of payments remains
negative with imports slightly higher at 54%.
3.    Injected into this scenario is renewed interest in overall economic growth within the region - led by
ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). Established in 1975 a revised treaty was signed by
16 West African States, including Senegal, in 1993. The principal objective of the Treaty, to be achieved in
stages, is the creation of an economic and monetary union. To this end a regional trade liberalization scheme
has been adopted for the creation of a free trade zone by 1999 and a study is under way for the adoption of a
common external tariff. The Community has been pursuing the physical integration of its member states
through the development and modernization of regional highways and telecommunication networks. A further
emphasis has been placed on promoting the involvement and integration of the private sector and the general
public in the development and integration of the economies of the region. Senegal, as one of the members, is
striving to become a focal point for regional economic activity, not only linking it with its neighbors but also
providing key infrastructure for linkage to other parts of the world, notably Europe as well as North and South
America.
4.    Alongside these developments is improved economic activity in Mali, a land-locked country bordering
Senegal to the East. With a projected GNP growth of 5% per annum and increased import/export activity Mali
is looking to its neighbors for its window on the world. Senegal is the natural choice to transport goods for
shipment to their foreign destinations. In competition with Senegal, however, are the countries of Cote d'Ivoire
and Guinea, which both border Mali, and which both have international ports.
2 If the difference between the present value of financial and economic flows is large and cannot be explained by taxes and
subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is warranted, e.g., "The value of financial benefits is less than that of
economic benefits because of controls on electricity tariffs."
20



5.   Transport infrastructure in Senegal is extensive with: (a) 14,500 km of classified road, of which 4200 is
paved; (b) 1058 km of rail network consisting of 906 km of main track and 152 km of secondary track; (c) an
international port at Dakar which is able to handle all types of cargo including containers, as well as three
secondary ports located at Kaolack, Saint-Louis and Ziguinchor; and (d) an international airport at Dakar which
serves as a major hub for traffic in West Africa, as well as three secondary airports at Ziguinchor, Saint-Louis
and Cap Skiring. All of this infrastructure is, however, in a serious state of deterioration, having suffered years
of neglect and overal poor management and maintenance.
Project Area
6.   The proposed project will directly benefit all 10 regions of the country. This is particularly true with
respect to the roads component which on average will repair/rehabilitate a total of about 90 km of paved road
and 220 km of unpaved roads per region. The rail component will also directly benefit the populations of six
regions, including Dakar, Diourbel, Tambacounda, Kaolack, Thies and Fatick. The port and aviation
components, although centered in Dakar, will have far-reaching effects domestically and regionally.
The Project
7.   The PST2 project has been prepared to assist Senegal to realize its potential for economic growth, and
take advantage not only of the growth of its neighbors and regionalization of the area, but also foreign interest
in Western Africa. To this end the PST2 is a sector program which consists of investments in each of the key
transport sub-sectors. Total program costs have been estimated at US$581.0 million with the following
investment breakdown: (a) road component at US$330.6 million (57% of total program costs); (b) port
component at US$ 72.6 million (12% of total); (c) rail component at US$76.9 million (13% million); (d)
aviation component at US$ 71.9 million (12% of total); and (e) other activities including institutional
strengthening, land transport modernization, promotion of private sector involvement, social and environmental
sustainability, rural transport and project coordination at US$29.0 million (6% of total).
Economic Evaluation
8.   Investments in each of the main transport sectors has been analyzed separately to ensure that each sub-
component is economically viable. Both non-quantifiable and quantifiable benefits were identified for each of
the main project activities. Details of these analyses are found in the project files, with summary analyses
presented in the following Annexes: 4A,B,C,D.E.F. The results of the cost-benefit and sensitivity analyses of
each component are presented below:

Methodologv
9.   The methodology employed for the program evaluation is a traditional cost-benefit analysis conducted
under a with and without project scenario. It is based on traffic projections estimated in the project feasibility
studies conducted in 1997 and 1998. The projections in key areas indicate a traffic growth rate in keeping with
21



GNP growth, and are between 5% and 6% during the first five years, depending on the sub-sector, followed by
2%-4% growth rates as follows:

10.   Costs have been adjusted to reflect revised estimates and benefits also adjusted to reflect increases in
base year traffic. Financial costs have been used as economic costs in the analyses for the port and railway as
these entities have a tax-free agreement with the government. The financial costs for the road and aviation
component have, however, been adjusted to exclude taxes and duties (about 15%). There are no shadow prices
available for Senegal. Both non-quantifiable and quantifiable benefits have been identified. In addition a
limited distributional analysis has been performed, specifically with respect to employment generated by each
sub-component, as well as the estimated budgetary impact of the income generated. A 12% discount rate was
applied to determine the NPV, although it is noted that the opportunity cost of capital in Senegal in 1998 is
closer to 9%. The project implementation period is 5.5 years with a project life thereafter taken as being 20
years.
Benefits
11.   A series of non-quantifiable benefits have been identified for each transport sub-component noted.
These are detailed in the project files and summarized in the following annexes. However, there are three
specific benefits which are common across the board and are noted herein as follows:
(a) Improvements in Service and Efficiency: Institutional restructuring and the development of tools
to adapt to the demands of globalization will significantly improve service and efficiency in the
transport sector. Paramount in this assessment is the role which the private sector will play to ensure
competitiveness and cost effectiveness of the various transport systems.
(b)   Positioning Senegal as a Transport Hub for the Region: Geographically Senegal is in an excellent
position to take advantage of economic growth not only domestically but also regionally. With
improvements in all of the key transport systems, Senegal is poised to become a significant transport
hub.
(c)   Accident Savings: Senegal has a history of road, rail and air accidents which bear examination.
With serious congestion at the Port of Dakar, accidents in that sub-sector are waiting to happen. The
project will contribute significantly to the aversion of future fatalities as well as injuries both in the
workplace and for system users.
12.  In terms of quantifiable benefits, these were identified individually for each sub-component and are
likewise detailed in the project files. Summaries of these benefits are presented in the following annexes.
However, there are a number of key benefits which are common to each of the transport systems. These
include:
(a)   VOC Savings: The HDM III model was used to evaluate and define road maintenance strategies
over several years based on economic viability criteria, specifically vehicle operating cost (VOC)
savings for the road component. It was used to define a three-year road maintenance program for both
22



the paved and unpaved sub-components. In addition VOC savings were calculated for the proposed new
roads under the roads component as well as the proposed access road for the North Zone of the Port of
Dakar.
(b) Costs Savings: These are among the main benefits which have been quantified and valued for each
of the transport sub-sectors. This assumption is based upon the fact that with improved infrastructure and
facilities, costs will decrease in both operations and maintenance. Furthermore, with private sector
participation, all costs will come under significant scrutiny as will operational efficiency, with further
adjustments made to ensure improved cost recovery. Maintenance cost savings for each of the transport
sub-sectors have been quanitified and valued. In addition, for both the port and aviation components,
handling cost savings have also been included. Finally, with proposed staff reductions in both the
railway and aviation components, it has been estimated that there will also be staff cost savings even
with projected increases in salary structures.
(c) Incremental Increase in Revenue: In line with increased traffic generated as a result of
improvements in the transport systems and networks, revenues are assumed to also increase. The benefit
which has been included consists of the incremental increase in revenues calculated as a result of
increased traffic in the "with" project situation compared to the "without" project situation.
(d) GNP Value-Added - Container Exports, Tourism: The project is assumed to realize increased
container traffic handled in the Port of Dakar and increased tourist traffic, moving through the Airport of
Dakar as a result of project implementation. This increase will be reflected specifically by increased
exports by container through the port, and increased tourist spending in Senegal in general. The resultant
benefits have been quantified and valued and are included in the cost-benefit analyses detailed in the
project files.
Distributional Benefits
13.  Employment Benefit - The project is estimated to directly employ about 13,000 unskilled workers each
year during the 5.5 years project implementation period as follows: 4500 through the road component; 2500
through the rail component; 3,200 through the port component; and 3,500 through the aviation component.
With an average household of 8 (including children, spouse and extended family members) it is estimated that
this income will directly support almost 100,000 Senegalese annually during project execution. Furthermore,
using 2.5 as a regional employment multiplier, a further 30,000 indirect jobs will also be created, supporting
another 200,000 plus. Estimates for employment generation after project completion were not calculated.
14.  Fiscal Benefits: These have been estimated for each of the transport components separately and concern
the income tax generated as a result of project employment during construction. It is assumed that a 15% with-
holding (or income tax) on earnings during this period will be equivalent to a total annual fiscal impact in the
range of 10 million cfa during project execution alone. This does not take into consideration benefits derived
from indirect employment.
Propram EIRR
14.  The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for the program as a whole has been calculated to be
35%. The high rate is due for the most part to the significant benefits which are derived from the largest
component, roads rehabilitation and reconstruction. This component accounts for 62% of the economic costs
with a resultant 52% EIRR. Applying a discount rate of 12% the NPV for the program is estimated at almost
US$550 million.
23



Proiram Sensitivitv
15.   As with each of the sub-components, a series of sensitivity analyses were carried out for the program as
a whole. The individual results are presented in the annexes and indicate a strong viability. Program-wise the
results are also positive, as is indicated in the table below:

Critical Risks
16.   There are two main critical risks associated with the program which have been identified. Both are inter-
related. The first risk concerns traffic volumes and the second private sector investment. In a situation where
the private sector is unwilling or unable to invest, the level of traffic forecast for each of the networks,
excepting the roads component, would be reduced because the efficiencies garnered from private sector
participation would not be realized. Under this scenario the benefits could decrease. However, it is the
government which has shown itself to be committed to the privatization process. The extent of privatization
will in part be dependent on the terms which both sides are able to negotiate to ensure minimal financial, social
and economic risk.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
Methodology
17.   The HDM model was used to evaluate and define basic road maintenance strategies by: (i) simulating
road deterioration and the frequency of maintenance operations for each fundamental alternative; (ii)
simulating vehicle operating costs; and (iii) making comparisons between different strategies of road
maintenance or construction and defining the optimal solution for the maintenance programs over several years
based on economic viability criteria such as the economic rate of return (TRE), the Net Present Value (NPV),
the benefit-cost ratio, etc.. The use of the HDM model was based on technical and economic parameters that
include road geometry, the natural of the soil and road degradations, driving conditions, road maintenance
cpsts, vehicle operating costs, traffic counts, existing road maintenance strategy, etc. A three-year road
maintenance program was prepared as follows:
(a)   the selection of the road sections to be evaluated was done based on the Relative Degradation
Index (DRI)4, itself a function of the International Road Degradation Index (IRI). Only those sections
with an DRI of more than 1000 were selected;
(b)   the breaking down of the selected road network into homogeneous sections on the basis of
traffic, soil nature, the level of deterioration of the sections; and
(c)   the conducting of detailed studies on a given number of Homogeneous and Representative
Deteriorated Sections (HRDS) of the sections defined above.
3If the difference between the present value of financial and economic flows is large and cannot be explained by taxes and
subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is warranted, e.g., "The value of financial benefits is less than that of
economic benefits because of controls on electricity tariffs."
4The Relative Degradation Index (RDI)= traffic times (IlI-3)y
26



18.  The HDM  model was used to make an economic evaluation of the arrived-at three year road
maintenance program. For each proposed maintenance strategy, the model computed the evolution of road
deteioration, vehicle running costs, road maintenance costs, economic indicators (ERR, NPV, benefit/cost
rations). The results for different maintenance strategies were compared with the base case of what would
happen to the network if investments under the project were not undertaken using discounted streams of
differential benefits and costs.
Paved Roads
19.  A total of 139 homogeneous sections were identified on the basis of network-wide road characteristics
and traffic data that were updated by specific studies. Thirteen strategies were defined for the paved roads
taking into account past and current experience in Senegal and the technical and financial capability of the
enterprises performing road maintenance work. Three types of maintenance works will be normally undertaken
for paved roads: (i) rehabilitation, double layer paving with various materials; (ii) periodic maintenance,
single-layer paving with various materials; and (iii) routine maintenance: (a) resealing; (b) pothole patching;
(c) maintenance of shoulders. All strategies include basic routine maintenance on selected road sections
consisting of patching at least 50% of potholes.
20.  The paved roads represent about 4,300 km or 29% of the priority road network About 57% of the paved
roads are reportedly in good shape, 14% in average condition and 29% in bad shape. The main objective of
the project is to minimize road transport costs by limiting further deterioration of the road infrastructure. The
main savings are to come from road user costs in the form of VOC, time savings and savings on the future
maintenance costs.
21.  The 13 strategies mentioned above were applied to each of the 139 homogeneous sections. Maintenance
and rehabilitation costs were estimated in financial and economic terms. Vehicle characteristics and unit costs
were defined for typical vehicle classes. The traffic growth rates were defined based on recent traffic trends.
The HDM evaluation helped define the best maintenance strategy acceptable from both an engineering and and
economic perspective.
22.  The simulation was made over a twenty-year period yielded an NPV of CFAF 33,569 million at a
discount rate of 12%. The ERR varied between 19 and 453% depending on the strategy adopted. The main
benefits considered are a reduction in vehicles operating costs (VOC) and road maintenance costs. Time saved
due to better road conditions was not taken into account.
Sensitivity Analysis
23.  The robustness of the returns and NPVs shown can be judged by looking at their changes for different
strategies, which can reduce the ERR from 225% to 31%.
Unpaved Roads
24.  The network of unpaved roads is 10,311 km long of which about 82% are estimated to be in a bad state,
2% in an average state and only 16% in a good state. With the HDM, a first selection of sections was made on
the basis of the driving conditions of the roads, traffic levels, the extent of road degradation and topography.
Next, indication from field division managers were integrated to enlarge the section base. This yielded a total
of 99 homogeneous sections retained for the three-year maintenance program.
25:  The HDM economic evaluation defined four maintenance strategies: (i) basic maintenance of specific
roads; (ii) grading without regravelling; (iii) grading and 50% spot regravelling; and (iv) grading and 100%
regravelling per year, the last three options involving gravel resurfacing when the residual thickness of laterite
is less than 50mm.
27



26.  Using the HDM program finally defined an optimum program with an NPV of CFAF 152,074 million at
a discount rate of 12% over 20 years. The ERR estimated vary between 17 to 406%.
Sensitivity Analysis
27.  The robustness of the returns and NPVs shown can be judged by looking at their changes for different
strategies. For instance, for section 3 1B above, a switch from the first strategy to the second would raise costs
by about 20% and reduce the ERR from 19% to 13%. The same analysis can be applied to the other sets of
numbers and strategies.
New Roads
28.  Preliminary studies, some dating back to over three years, have been done for three new roads linking
Senegal to the neighboring countries. The main justification of these projects outlined in the studies are
regional integration, provision of better access to markets for agricultural production in the areas involved and
promotion of cross-border trade. More work will be undertaken to better identify and quantify the underlying
assumptions, more fully identify the potential benefits and quantify them.
Program Analysis
29.  In addition a program analysis was conducted to determine program viability. The results indicate a
52% EIRR with the break-even analysis indicating that costs would have to decrease by 62% in parallel with
project benefit decrease by 62% for the EIRR to reach the opportunity cost of capital (12%). Details on the
economic evaluation conducted may be found in the project files.

Summary of Benefits and Costs
1.    The investment program for the railroads consist of a core program with four specific projects valued at
a total of 31,218 million. This represents 73% of the total program costs. The core program's main objective is
the rehabilitation, maintenance and restructuring of key physical infrastructure and assets, with non-core
activities including the purchase of mobile equipment, signaling and communications equipment.
2.    The main quantifiable benefits expected from the investment program are: (i) savings in operation and
maintenance of rolling stock due to improved facilities. Total first year savings system savings are estimated at
162.5 m CFA; (ii) savings in staff costs due to a reduction of 800 personnel 300 of which have been identified
but not yet released under the PAST program. Even with salary and benefit restructuring and a higher level of
trained personnel, first year savings are estimated at 142 m CFA; (iii) savings from reduced derailments due to
improvements in signalization and telecommunication as well as rehabilitation and reconstruction of both track
and equipment. First year savings are estimated at 14.36 m CFA for the entire system; (iv) incremental
increase in rail revenue due to increased freight movements. First year system wide benefits are estimated at
290 m CFA; and (v) trafflic diversion benefits due mainly to the recapture of lost to Mali. First year benefits are
estimated at 48 m CFA. In addition, due to the discrepancy between project life (20 years) and actual asset life
of the investments made under the program (30 - 60 years), a salvage value for these investments has also been
calculated and included in the analysis.
3.    The main non-quantifiable benefits identified included: (i) improvements in rail service and efficiency,
(ii) improvements in turn-around time and availability of locomotives; and (iii) reduced track and work related
accidents.
4.    In addition the following social and fiscal benefits have been identified: (i) employment impact - the
program will directly employ about 3000 unskilled workers annually, translating to 1440 m CFA/annum of
income. A regional multiplier of 2.5 indicates that approximately 7,500 indirect jobs will also be created; (ii)
fiscal impact - assuming an average 15% with-holding or income tax on estimated earnings resulting from
direct employment created by this component, the fiscal impact is estimated at about 800 m CFA during
project execution alone.

Main Assumptions
5.   The main assumptions made are: (i) traffic will grow at an average annual rate of between 2%-5.5%
depending on the traffic type; (ii) the rail company enjoys fiscal incentives that exempts it from taxes and
duties, with the result that the economic and financial costs are equivalent; (iii) project construction period is 4
years; (iv) project life is 20 years; (vi) estimated that traffic will grow as follows: international cargo at 5.5%,
national cargo at 3%, international and national passengers at 2%, and PTB passengers at 3%.
Sensitivity analysis
6.   The proposed investments appear sound. The EIRR for the Rail Program has been calculated at 18%
with the break-even analysis indicating that costs would have to increase by 23% and benefits decrease in
parallel by 23% for the NPV to reach the 12% discount rate (opportunity cost of capital). The main risks facing
the project are inadequate management, uncertainties related to the restructuring of the rail company as a result
of the privatization of the international rail services on Dakar-Bamako corridor, and inappropriate government
policies, regulatory environment and support. The project includes appropriate institutional strengthening,
policy and reform measures to mitigate these risks.

Summary of Benefits and Costs
1.    A  cost-benefit analysis was carried out for the main investment component which consists of
rehabilitation, reconstruction and expansion of the Port of Dakar, with a total value of 48,100 mcfa which
represents 77% of program costs.
2.    In addition to readily quantifiable ones, other economic benefits expected are: (I) institutional
strengthening of the maritime sector; (ii) improvements to the River Port of Kaolack; and (iii) improvements in
wvater transport between Dakar and Ziguinchor.
3.    The main quantifiable benefits consist of: (I) voc savings due to improved road access. First year
savings have been estimated at 119 m CFA; (ii) savings in container ship waiting time due to improved ship
positioning where first year savings have been estimated at 120 m CFA; (iii) savings in cargo handling costs
leading to first year savings of 1327 m CFA, and (iv) GNP value-added resulting from increased exports, with
a first year benefit of 390 m CFA. In addition, due to the discrepancy between project life (20 years) and actual
asset life of the program investments (30 - 60 years), a salvage value for these investments has also been
c alculated and included in the analysis.
Mahn assumptions
4.    The made assumptions made are: (i) traffic will grow at an average annual rate of between 2% and 6%,
depending on the traffic type; (ii) the port continues to enjoy fiscal incentives that exempts it from taxes. As
such the economic and financial costs are equivalent; (iii) project construction period has been divided into
two phases which will follow each other in terms of timing. The first concerns works to be -financed by the
public sector and the second those to be financed by the private sector; (iv) project construction period for the
first phase is 4 years and the second phase 5 years; (v) project life is 20 years.
S.    The expansion of the container terminal, including the building of a third wharf post, in line with posts
62 and 63, was the subject of an economic analysis based on updated costs-benefits. A comparison of the
situation with and without the project, indicates that the implementation of the project is economically feasible
if the project is divided into two phases, with the first phase brought into service in 2002. Taking into account
S If the difference between the present value of financial and economnic flows is large and cannot be explained by taxes and
subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is warranted, e.g., "The value of financial benefits is less thian that of
economic benefits because of controls on electricity tariffs. "
33



traffic growth, the time required for detailed technical design studies, mobilization of financing and execution
of the works, the second phase would not commence before the year 2004 and take 4 years to complete.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.   The proposed project is sound, with a base case EIRR of 16%. It is considered that with private sector
involvement more program efficiencies and benefits will occur than have been quantified and valued. For this
reason the EIRR calculated is considered to reflect the most conservative project scenario. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted on the proposed program with the break-even point identified as being one where project costs
would have to increase by 11% and benefits decrease in parallel by 11% for the EIRR to decrease to the
opportunity cost of capital (identified as 12%)
7.   In addition to the sensitivity analyses undertaken, two main risks associated with the improvement
program for the port of Dakar have been identified. The first concerns traffic volumes and the second private
sector investments. In a situation where the private sector does not invest, the level of traffic forecast would be
reduced because the efficiencies garnered from privatization would not be realized. Under this scenario the
second phase of the port program will either have to be postponed to a time when traffic would justify the
expenditure estimated, or a more modest investment would need to be detailed to ensure economic feasibility.
Details of the economic analysis may be found in the project files.

Summary of Benefits and Costs:
1.   TIn  investinent program for the aviation sector  conducted w   care program for the Airporyeatim Dakar
which is estimated at a total value of 16,970.3 million cfa. This represents 72% ofthe total program. The core
program's main objective is the rehabilitation, maintenance and restructuring of key physical infrastructure and
assets, with non-core ac5ivifies including infrastructure strengthening, aid to navigation and safety, and the
purchase of mobile equipment.
2.    The main quantifiable benefits identified consist of: (i) incremental increase in passenger revenues with
npt yenar benefits of 24 m CFA; (ii) increase in tourist spending with es;imated first year benefits of 105 m
CqFA; (iii) savings in terminal and runway maintenance, amounting to 80 m CFA in the first year alone; (iv)
savings in staff costs of 750 m CFA in the first year; and (v) cargo handling cost savings of an esbimated 28 m
C>FA in the first year. As with both the rail and ports components, due to the discrepancy between project life
and actual asset life of the program investments, a salvag. "The value or   finvestments has been calculated and
included in the analysis.
3.       The  main non-quantifiable benefits include: (i) improvements in  service and efficiency; (ii)
improvements in traffic management; (iii) positive linkage the proposed World Bank Pilot Project for the
promofion of Agricultural Exports; and (iv) increased private sector activity within the airport.
4.   In addition a limited distibufional analysis was conducted which indicates that: (i) employment impact -
during the project. construcfion period a total of about 3000 unskilled workers are expected to be directly
employed annually, which translates to a total worker income of about 360 m CFA; (ii) fiscal impact -
assuming an average 15% with-holding or income tax project employment is esfimated to generate about 17
million CFA for the governiment.
Main Assumptions
S.   The main assumpfions made are: (i) traffic will grow at an average annual rate of between 3%-5%
depending on the traffic type; (ii) project construction period is 4 years; (iii) project life is 20 years.
6 If the difference between the present value of financial and economic flows is large and cannot be explained by taxes and
subsidies, a brief explanation of the difference is waffanted, e.g., "The value of financial benefits is less than that of
economic benefits because of controls on electricity taniffs."

Sensitivity analysis
6.   The proposed investments appear sound. The base case EIRR for the component has been estimated at
19%, with the break-even analysis indicating that costs would have to increase by 25% and benefits to
decrease by an equivalent 25% for the EIRR to reach the opportunity cost of capital 12%.
7.   The main risks facing the project are inadequate management, uncertainties related to privatization of
Air Senegal, and inappropriate government policies, regulatory environment and support. The project includes
appropriate institutional strengthening, policy and reform measures to mitigate these risks. The following
pages detail the economic evaluation.
Details of the project economic analysis may be found in the project files.

Annex 4E: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2)
Land Transport Modernization/Planning Component
Economic Impact/Risk Assessment
1.   The main objectives of this component consist of: (i) institutional reform; (ii) promotion of private
sector activity; and (iii) establishment of a favorable environment for economic and social development.
The reorganization of the Department of Land Transport (DTT) began in 1992 under the auspices of the
PAST project. Institutional issues were addressed but not fully resolved. The proposed program is
therefore a continuation of the efforts begun under the PAST project, with particular emphasis on: (i)
reform in the issuance of driver's permits (specifically examination and candidate evaluation); (ii)
computerization of DTT and the development of information technologies (databases, etc.); (iii) civil
works and equipment purchase; and (iv) transport studies.
2.   The specific objective of the program is to enable DTT to fulfill its public obligations more
efficiently and in a timely manner through : (i) an improved knowledge concerning the supply and
demand of transport through the development of a comprehensive national transport sector database; (ii)
improved evaluation system for drivers permits; and (iii) improved methods of following and controlling
the number of road vehicles.
Benefits
3.   These are multiple and varied and generally fall under four distinct categories, as follows:
(a)  reform of the examinations for driver's permits and evaluation of candidates will:
* improve the system for written and oral exams;
* introduce transparency and homogeneity in exams;
* improve the success rate of oral candidates; and
* reduce the number of traffic accidents.
(b)  computerization and information database upgrade of DTT will:
* permit the development of genuine client/user interfaces and guarantee with much more
reliability the integrity and security of information;
* more easily consolidate all information emanating from the regions;
- more easily consolidate all information emanating from the regions;
* allow the regions to have more timely access to information; and
* enable seamless inter-connectivity between the police, military and customs with respect to
information concerning the road network.
In the case of driver's permits, automation of procedures will lighten the workload of both administrative
staff and examiners, enabling more time to be spent with clients and candidates. Furthermore, the
processing of drivers permits in Dakar and the regions will be quicker, with less errors and better quality
of service to the public. The new information technology introduced will also allow for future linkage to
the internet.
(c)  civil works improvements will:
* improve working conditions and the quality of service to clients; and
* improve the success rate of practical exams.
39



(d)  transport studies will:
*  improve overall knowledge of Senegal's transport sector (i.e. function, capacity, limits, roles,
etc.);
* decrease traffic accidents, notably those involving children;
*  introduce more reliable information and allow for the improvements in the system to be more
closely monitored.
Costs and Justification of Investments
3.   Program costs are estimated at 2,700.5 m CFA: (i) 60.5 m CFA for driver permit reform; (ii) 137.5
m CFA for computerization and information technology upgrade; (iii) 495 m CFA for civil works; (iv)
1,045 m CFA for equipment purchase; and (v) 962.5 m CFA for studies, training and accident prevention.
4.   The DIT presently generates about 617 m CFA/year in revenue for the GOS. This includes, regular
transport taxes, vehicle registration, drivers permits, technical inspections and licenses. With program
improvements it is estimated that the total contribution of DTT's activities to the economy in 2001 alone
will be about 900 m CFA. This would indicate that with the program DTT will mobilize more than
sufficient resources over the program life (of about 10 years) to warrant the recommended investments.
Project Risks
5.   One of the main risks is that insufficient manpower and financial resources will be allocated to
DT7 so that it will not benefit from a consistent budget or training program for its personnel. Another risk
is that, as a result of present high import duties and local domestic taxes, particularly on fuel and car
usage generally, any increases in taxes associated with vehicle use, to finance the DTT component, will
be negatively viewed by the general public.
6.   Considering the Government's interest in maintaining inflation at 3% and support productive
sectors, taxes will most likely be kept at present levels. As to the other risks, the realization of the
program allows the DTI to overcome the inefficiencies of its qualified personnel under the present
scenario.
Performance Indicators
7.   In order to follow the progress of the component the following performance indicators have been
established to monitor DlT's progress:
*  updating transport data every two years;
*  reduction of traffic accidents;
*  increase in the number of technical inspections for vehicles;
*  increase in DTT's revenue;
*  complete computerization of the production of transport licenses; and
*  reduction in fraud related to the attainment of transport licenses
Poverty Impact
8.   This component will have a positive impact on poverty through improved mobility, reduction in
transport costs, creation of both direct and indirect employment, and in improved conditions for obtaining
drivers pennits, which will allow for a larger segment of the population, specifically young Senegalese, to
be quickly inserted into the economy.

Annex 4E: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2)
Summary - Social and Poverty Impact
The Urban Sector
1.   A profde of urban poverty. More than 40% of the population of Senegal live in urban areas. It is
estimated that by the year 2000, about 45% of the population will live in urban areas. Dakar alone accounts for
more 56% of the urban population and about 21% of the total population. The urban population is growing at
an average rate close to 4% per annum. On aggregate, the urban population is richer than the rural population.
Given that the majority of urban poor live out of the city, it is clear that they tend to incur high costs in time,
money and effort in connection with various market activities (labor and product markets) and in gaining
access to education, health and other social activities.
2.   Both urban and rural households spent a significant share of their annual budgets on transport. The
share of total household expenditure going to transport is consistently higher that the share of health and that of
education. A desegregation of this budget item reveals that on average 67% of household expenditures on
transport correspond to transport services, the rest is accounted for by investment (buying an vehicle) and
maintenance costs. A more efficient transport system is therefore likely to have a significant impact on the
poor.
3.   Project inpact. As conceived, the project will impact on the poor in terms of increased access to
markets and services, improved safety and employment through network expansion and infrastructure
rehabilitation. As far as the civil aviation and maritime components of the project are concerned, it is
reasonable to expect increased employment at least in tourism. Expansion of this sector can create jobs for
low income individuals in hotels and restaurants, and in urban and interurban transportation.
4.   The safety dimension. Safety considerations are an important factor to account for in this context. The
standard of living is an multidimensional concept that goes beyond income. Given the risk associated with
mobility in a motorized environment, and that most of the accidents involve public transport users (mostly
Cars Rapides and pedestrians, it is noteworthy that the project includes safety measures appropriately targeted
to public transport drivers and pedestrians.
5.   Employment generation. It is likely that the increase system efficiency, its expansion and overall
economic growth will make it possible for the owners of the Car Rapides to renew and increase their fleet on a
sustainable basis. This will create additional employment opportunities for low-income households.
Furthermore, all minor civil works, maintenance and rehabilitation will be executed by small size local
contractors using labor intensive methods.
The Rural Sector
6.   The project includes three components that deal specifically with transport issues in the rural areas:(l)
Support the design of a Rural Transport Strategy; (2) Establish a Rural Coordination Unit; and (3) Perform
Emergency Rehabilitation works. A project is supposed to be a policy instrument that translating a coherent
strategy. There is no such strategy yet for Senegal, hence the necessity of the first component. As far as the
benefits of the emergency works are concerned, the project will ensure that the criterion for selection be
consistent with both efficiency and equity considerations.
7.   It is expected that after completion, the following will be achieved: (i) reduced transaction costs; (ii)
increased agricultural production; and (iii) increased access to markets; and (iv) improved access to social
services. The savings in transaction costs would be reflected in the reduction of travel time and transportation
41



costs. The increase in transport efficiency would be reflected in the reduction of transport costs for
merchandises., with significant impact on rural production and trade.

Background
8.     The financial results of the port of Dakar have shown a steady improvement under the PAST. Sales
have increased about 25% p.a. from 1993 to 1997 while earnings before depreciation, interest and taxes (EBIT)
have gone from 27/o to 34% of sales revenues. Net income improved from 4%  of sales in 1993 to 9%  in 1997.
The liquidity position has also improved with the current ratio increasing from  1.1 to 2.1 over the same period.
The debt-equity ratio rose changed from 30% in 1993 to a low of 23% in 1994 before climbing again to 29%
in 1997.
9.     The main reasons of this overall improvements are a lower increase in operating costs (about 10% p.a..)
than the increase in revenues, dwindling amounts of interest payments and a good amount of non-operating
revenues.
11.   The project aims to realize investments in equipment, human resource development, environmental
protection, extension of port facilities to increase throughput capacity especially for container and cereals
43



handling, and civil works to either to reconfigure existing physical layout to obtain more efficient operations or
for rehabilitation purposes.
12.  The investments would be financed through mixture of traditional on-lending of IDA funds from the
Government to the port company, private sector type financing from the French Agency for Development and
innovative Build-Own-Transfer (BOT) schemes. The bulk of investments (about more than 70% of total
projected investments) would be realized through the BOT scheme.
13.  The financial projections show that, based on the assumptions described below, the proposed
investments under the project would yield satisfactory results: (i) EBIT would increase from 34% in 1997 to
more than 40% in 1999 and beyond after a brief dip to 32% in 1998; (ii) net income would stabilize at around
6%; and (iii) the overall liquidity situation would be good. The additional debt incurred under the project
would however decrease the debt service coverage ratios from the high levels of 1995 and 1996. however, they
would still be adequate at more than 3. Meanwhile, the debt-equity ratio would reach its highest level of 57%
when all the project-related loans are drawn down in 2002.
Basic Assumptions:
Income Statements:
Only modest increases in the level of the fees charged in an effort to keep the port competitive.
* An increase in revenues coming mainly from a higher volume of business;
* A reduction in operating costs resulting from a more efficient management put in place; and
*  Assets depreciated over 20 years for civil works and construction and 10 years for equipment.
Balance sheets:
*  Investments would be carried out in two phases: the first phase would be in 1999-2002 and thesecond
phase, mainly under the BOT system, would be in 2004-2007.
*  Investments would be 80% financed by debt and 20% internally-generated cash flow. The loan would be
over 15 years at 8% with a five year grace period. It has been assumed that any foreign exchange
movements that would threaten the financial stability of the Port or make it unable to meet its debt
servicing requirements would be reviewed with the objective of transferring the excess foreign exchange
risk on the Government
* Accounts receivable and payable have been taken at 45 days
Financial Analysis
14. The port component shows a internal financial rate of return of 9%. The main benefits are derived from
savings in operating costs and an increase in revenues from more quantities of goods handled than would have
been the case without the project investments.
15.  A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the impact of adverse developments of the key
parameters, investment costs, savings and additional revenues on the overall project performance. The results
summaized below show that the investments would still have satisfactory results under the assumptions made.
The assumptions are considered as probably the worst that could happen: a 25% increase in investment costs, a
25% decrease in the projected savings and a 25% in the projected additional revenues.

Background
I1.    The financial results of AANS, the entity responsible for airport man,agement, have shown big swings
over the last five or six years: from a break-even results in 1993, AANS showed a net loss of CFAF million 57
in 1994 that widened dramatically to CFAF 1.3 billion in 1995. Then there was a reported huge turnaround in
1996 with a net profit of CFAF 1.8 billion in 1996. These results have to be viewed within the context of an
unsatisfactory accounting and financial management system as reported by successive audit reports.
2.     In 1998, at the request of the World Bank, the financial accounts of AANS were restated after an
exhaustive inventory by two different accounting firms to correct all the anomalies underlined by the reports of
the auditors. The result is a net loss of CFAF 1.6 billion instead of the CFAF 134 million previously reported
for 1997. The status of AANS as a public entity receiving subsidies when and as needed and with no debt in its
45



books and no net worth to speak hide any possible inadequacy in its financial structure and its real cash
generation potential in terms of being able to meet debt servicing obligations.
3.   In the years from 1990 to 1997, earnings before interest, depreciation taxes have gone from 28% of
sales in 1990 to a low of 9% in 1996 before climbing to a record 30% in 1997. These movements appear
chiefly explained by major decreases in revenues and a substantial increase in personnel costs in 1996. Other
costs have also shown important increases. In general, costs seem to have been higher than those experienced
by similar entities elsewhere, a result of both inadequate cost controls and the financing of government
services such as the civil aviation and the meteorology  departments. Personnel costs have shown huge
increases of 25% between 1994 and 1995 and 63% between 1995 and 1996 before decreasing by 32% in 1997.
On the other hand, fees charged per unit by the Dakar airport, which generates at least 95% of all AANS's
revenues, are only about 75% of those collected at similar airports such as Abidjan and Nairobi. This
underlines the upward potential for an eventual increase in fees.
4.   The financial projections show that, based on the assumptions described below, the proposed
investments under the project along with the proposed reform measures would yield satisfactory results for the
new airport management setup: (i) the level of profitability, even under the very conservative assumptions
made regarding the level of fees, would be adequate; (ii) the overall liquidity situation would be good with the
current ratio consistently above or near 2 except for the first year of principal repayment; (iii) the debt-equity
ratio would be highest (73%) when all the loan funds have been disbursed. It should be pointed out, however,
that non-loan financing have been put at 20% because of the uncertainties still surrounding the terms and
conditions under which privatization of airport management will take place. The level of equity financing
and/or financing from internal cash flow has the potential of being significantly increased.
Basic Assumptions
5.     For the income statements:
* no increase in the level of the fees charged despite the fact that the fees charged by Dakar are
currently lower than those of similar airports. The increase in revenues shown are the result of a
modest increase of 3% p.a. in the number of passengers and the shipments going through the
airports. It is currently estimated that current passenger traffic at Dakar Airport is only 62% of the
overall airport throughput capacity; . a reduction in operating costs resulting from a more
efficient management put in place with the privatization and a marked reduction of personnel
costs to better reflect actual needs (reductions of CFAF 750 million p.a. have been assumed in
personnel costs in 2000-2001 and CFAF 1 million thereafter, consistent with the proposed reform
program to take civil aviation and meteorological services out of AANS budget);
* assets depreciated over 20 years for civil works and construction and 10 years for equipment;
* After privatization in 2000-2001, the new entity would pay taxes at the normal rate of 35%.
* For the balance Sheets:
* investments would start in 1999-2000;
*  investments for the Ziguinchor airport have not been included;
*  investments would be 80% financed by debt and 20% with internally-generated cash flow. The
loan would be over 15 years at 8% with a five-year grace period; and
*  accounts receivable and payable have been taken at 45 days.
6.   In the Reform Area:
*  airport management would be privatized in 2000 for Dakar and the four secondary airports of Cap
Skirring, Ziguinchor, St-Louis and Tambacounda would be privatized; and
*  the new airport management would contribute about CFAF 1 billion to fund used to finance the
operations of the four secondary airports and the recurrent costs and other needs of the civil aviation
department and the meteorology department.

Financial Analysis.
6.   The civil aviation component shows a internal financial rate of return of 9%. The main benefits are
derived from savings in operating costs (most specifically personnel costs) and an increase in revenues from
more passenger and freight traffic. than would have been the case without the project investments and/or the
implementation of the reform program.
7.   A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the impact of adverse developments of the key
parameters, investment costs, savings and additional revenues on the overall project performance. The results
summarized below show that the investments would still have satisfactory results under the assumptions made.
The assumptions are considered as probably the worst that could happen: a 25% increase in investment costs, a
25% decrease in the projected savings and a 25% in the projected additional revenues.

(') Companyto be privatized by December 1999
(1) Conversion of Govemement Loan to Equity
(2) Subsidies
Background
1.    The financial results of Air Senegal have been poor over the PAST implementation period, despite
moderate profits shown in 1994 and 1995. Net losses have represented 20% of sales in 1993, 5% in 1996 and
94% in 1997 after the accounts were restated by an accounting firm. The main causes of this unsatisfactory
performance include a week asset base in terms of the number of planes in operations, poor and inadequate
management and a costly and fatal accident that not already reduced the company's own fleet from two to one
place but also affected its image.
52



2.   As of December 31 1997, cumulative losses amount to 2.6 times its capital share, meaning a negative
net worth of about US$ 2 million equivalent if Government loans are considered as quasi-equity and US$ 4
million otherwise.
3.   A decision has been taken to privatize the company which has continued to be a drain on public
finances with no visible signs of improvements and no clear contribution to the tourism sector. In agreement
with the World Bank and the IMF and within the context of the PFP, the deadline set to complete privatization
is December31 1999.
4.   The project has no specific investments for the company except in terms of privatization assistance and
limited personnel training. The only sure asset that the company stands to offer any potential suitor is its routes
to regional destinations following the liberalization of air transport that is taking place.
Main Assumptions
5.   No financial projections have been prepared. It has been however estimated however that based on
recent performance, the results for 1998 and 1999 the last full year before privatization, would show
significant losses amounting to more than 70% of total revenues in both years.

Background
1.     CEREEQ (Centre Experimental de Recherches et d'Etudes pour I 'Equipement) is a public entity created
in 1975 with of an industrial and commercial nature to undertake research and promote use of adapted and
locally-made materials for the road construction and public works sector. The specific services offered by
CEREEQ are: the geo-technical control of road works (about 40%  of revenues), research and studies (388%),
and laboratory testing (22%). CEREEQ  is currently being restructured as a national company with majority
government ownership.
2.     CEREEQ's work has been seriously hampered by the inadequacy of its equipment which is very old,
fully depreciated and a source of high maintenance and operating costs. Its staff is however generally
recognized as having a       good potential although they need training. Financial results have varied for the last
few years. Net results have improved from losses in 1993 and 1994 to a net profit thereafter reaching a high of
56



about 20%/o of sales in 1996. Likewise, cash flow  improved from a negative 15% of sales in 1994 to a
high of 33% in 1996. However, CEREEQ continued to receive investment subsidies that reached as high as
28% of sales in 1996. At the same time, the carryover of past losses made the net worth highly negative while
the loans received from the Government have never been serviced and no interest accounted for.
3.   A key objective of the proposed project is to improve the quality and efficiency of the road sector
through, among other things, a better control of the works, the use of more adapted construction or road-
building materials, adequate testing and sustainable and efficient institutions. Because CEREEQ will be called
on to play a vital role in this process, the project will assist it by financing minor office rehabilitation works,
equipment training and limited technical assistance.
4.   The attached financial projections indicate that as a result of the project investments for CEREEQ, and
efficiency improvement measures, Earnings Before Depreciation, Interest and Taxes (EBIT) would improve
from an average   of about 20% over the last five years to more than 30% of sales. At the same time, the
liquidity situation would improve.  Finally, even after the investments are financed through a
combination 75% from a loan and 25% from internationally generated cash flow, the financial structure of
CEREEQ would show a debt-equity ratio of 42% at its highest level and a debt service coverage ratio of at
least close to 3.
Main Assumptions:
*  an increase in the level of activity of between 5 and 10% on average as a result of CEREEQ's ability
to satisfy a higher level of demand than has been the case so far because of the inadequacy of its
equipment;
*  lower equipment maintenance costs;
* financing of the investments with 75% of credit on-lent by the Government at 5% over 12 years with a
three-year grace period;
*  he restructuring of the current unserviced debt to the Government as part of the overall reform of the
debt of national companies;
*  receivables of 45 days and payables of 45 days;
*  depreciation schedules over 10 years for equipment, 20 years for civil works, and 4 years for
capitalized expenses;
*  CEREEQ is restructured as a national company with majority government ownership and private
sector investors as a first step towards full privatization.

Background
1.    The financial results of SNCS have shown a steady improvement under the PAST. Sales have increased
about 10% p.a. from 1993 to 1997 while earnings before depreciation, interest and taxes (EBIT) have gone
from a negative 13% to 13% of sales revenues. Net results have gone from a net loss representing 5% of sales
in 1993 to a net profit representing 5% of sales in 1997. The liquidity position has not on the whole improved
with the current ration staying stable at about 1 during the period. However, the financial structure has
worsened as a result of the 1994 CFAF Franc devaluation. SNCS is in arrears in its debt repayment so that the
numbers in the balance sheets do not represent the real situation. The debt-equity ratio is unsatisfactory at
more than 65% during most of the period.
2.      The project aims to realize investments in  equipment, human  resource development, environmental
protection, and mainly track rehabilitation to improve efficiency and reduce the frequency of derailments.
During the course of project implementation, the international operations between Dakar and Bamako would
be privatized.The financial projections show  that, based on the assumptions described below, the proposed
58



investments under the project would yield satisfactory results in terms of earnings before depreciation, interest
and taxes (EBIT) which would grow from 13% in 1997 to more than 20% in 2000 and thereafter. However, if
SNCS debt is not restructured, the additional debt incurred under the project would constitute a heavy burden
on the company, leading to significant losses for a few years and to a weak financial structure. The debt-equity
ratio would be a high 85% in 2000, current ratio less than one for a few years and the debt service coverage
ration would be much below 1 for many years.
Main Assumptions
For the income statements:
3.   International services on Dakar-Bamako corridor would be operated by SETI, the company set up to
that effect starting in FY 2000. At that time, the fees paid to SNCS would be about CFAF 8.2 to 8.5 billion p.a.
These would be in addition to the fees paid by SEFICS and the operation of suburban services in the Dakar
area:
*  a reduction in operating costs resulting from a the decrease in the costs of materials and supplies and
personnel because of the transfer of activities to SETI;
*  assets depreciated over 25 years for track investments, 20 years for civil works and construction and
10 years for equipment;
For the balance sheets:
* investments would be 85% financed by debt and 15% with internally-generated cash flow. The loan
would be over 25 years at 8% with a 10-year grace period. It has been assumed that any foreign
exchange movements that would threaten the financial stability of the SNCS or make it unable to meet
its debt servicing requirements would be reviewed with the objective of transferring the excess foreign
exchange risk on the Government; and
* accounts receivable and payable have been taken at 45 days.
Financial Analysis
4.   The rail component shows a internal financial rate of return of 20% and a NPV of CFAF 21 billion at
12%. The main benefits are derived from savings in operating costs and some increases in revenue from more
quantities of goods transported at the national level than would have been the case without the project
investments.
6.   A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the impact of adverse developments of the key
parameters, investment costs, savings and additional revenues on the overall project performance. The results
summarized below show that the investments would still have satisfactory results under the assumptions made.
It shows that costs would have to increase by 170% for the NPV to come to 0 and the IRR to drop to 8%.

Annex 6: Second Transport Sector Program (PST2)
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
A.  Procurement
1.   A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was completed in July 1994. For the
program, findings of the CPAR remain valid. In general, Senegal's procurement laws and regulations do
not conflict with IDA Guidelines. No special exceptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the
Credit documents for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since Senegal's procurement practices
allow IDA procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.
2.  IDA-financed Works and Goods will be procured in accordance with Bank's Guidelines under
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995 revised in January, August 1996 and January 1999). IDA's
standard bidding documents will be used for all procurement under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB). National Competitive Bidding (NCB) advertised locally would be carried out in accordance with
Senegal's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA provided that: (i) any bidder is given
sufficient time to submit bids (four weeks); (ii) bid evaluation and bidder qualification are clearly
specified in bidding documents; (iii) no preference margin is granted to domestic manufacturers; (iv)
eligible firms are not precluded from participation; (v) award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder;
and (vi) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and
found acceptable. Consultant Services contracts financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrower published in January 1997,
revised in September 1997, and January 1999.
3.   Table A below summarizes the program elements by disbursement category, their estimated costs
and procurement methods. All IDA financed civil works, equipment, materials and other goods will be
procured in compliance with IDA Guidelines mentioned above. Bank funds financed under ICB are
forecast to be US$ 50.11 million (56% of total Bank financing). National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
will be carried out in accordance with Senegal's procurement laws and regulations, acceptable to IDA.
About US$10 million (or 11%) of Bank funds are expected to be utilized under this category. Bank funds
will amount to about US$16 million under the category for consultants services (or about 18%). Included
in other procurement method category of about US$31.3 million will be financed under other
procurement methods including prudent shopping, selection of consultants following IDA guidelines,
direct purchasing of goods, and expenditures following the Government's expenditure procedures
acceptable to IDA. This latter method will be applied in particular to the rail, and civil aviation
components where the executing agencies are PEs -- which have established commercial practices with
the government acceptable to IDA. Finally, more than 70% of the project is financed by donors, other
multilateral as well as the government, all of which use other procurement methods. This category of
financing has been identified as NBF (non Bank financed) in Table A.
4.   The appraisal departure took place prior to November 1, 1998. The project therefore does not fall
under the new Bank Guidelines which require a formal Procurement Assessment Review. Nonetheless,
the project team did carry out an informal review and assessment of procurement procedures, in particular
with respect to the on-going PAST project and its coordinating agency CELCO, to identify any issues or
capacity constraints. For improved quality control and compliance with IDA procedures, a procurement
specialist (acceptable to the Bank) has been recruited to work directly with CELCO, and a procurement
training program has been implemented for those government agencies which will be responsible for the
execution of the PST2 program. As noted above, Table A summarizes project costs by procurement
agency, Table B outlines the thresholds for procurement methods and prior review, and Table C presents
the Allocation of Loan Proceeds. Procurement procedures, along with other project elements will be
60



annually reviewed - see para. 4.section (c) -- with a more detailed review and assessment carried out at
the Mid-term Review, scheduled to be held no later than January 31, 2002.
Civil Works
5.   The main method of procurement civil works is ICB. This method accounts for almost 79% of
Bank financing under this category. The main component which utilizes ICB is the roads sector (75%/6),
followed by the ports/maritime (13%), the railway (8%) and the civil aviation (5%/O) sectors. Unless
otherwise indicated, procurement arrangements for the civil works contracts exceeding US$500,000 in
value will be subject to ICB. NCB procedures, acceptable to IDA, are expected to be used only for
contracts between US$50,000 and US$500,000, mainly for the roads component (6% of the Bank's total),
with other procurement methods used for the remainder (about 1% of the Bank's total). Other contracts
valued at less than US$50,000 will follow another procurement method as noted below for small works
contracts. Pre-qualification will be used for large - exceeding US$1.0 million and complex civil works
components.
Small Works Contracts
6.   Contracts for small works - mostly for road rehabilitation -- estimated to cost less than $50,000
each, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.42 million, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors
invited to bid by way of discounts either on the total price or on the unit prices. The invitation shall
include reference unit prices established by an engineer or an architect, a detailed description of the
works, including basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of agreement
described in the Manual of Procedures, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award would be
made to the contractor with the lowest price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates
he has the experience and resources to successfully execute the contract. These small contracts would be
for works relating to rehabilitation or repair of office buildings, rural roads, earth roads rehabilitation,
periodic paved road maintenance and rehabilitation works.
Goods
7.   Contracts for Goods financed by IDA during the three first years (totaling US$14.2 million) related
to furniture, office equipment, computers, vehicles and spare parts, would be procured through ICB in
agreement with the Bank's Guidelines mentioned above. The main procurement method for goods is ICB.
This method will be used primarily for the railways and civil aviation components and accounts for over
80% of all procurement under this method. Procurement arrangements for goods below US$200,000
would be subject to NCB procedures acceptable to IDA. Contracts for small equipment locally available
from the shelf at economical price, costing less than US$50,000 each would be subject to national
shopping, provided it does not exceed an aggregate amount of US$1.5 million -- or 9% of goods.
61



Prior Review for Works and Goods.
8.   Prior review thresholds which are in the high range ($100,000 for goods and $200,000 for works,
corresponding to the SOE threshold for goods and works) have been incorporated into the project, based
on the fact that:
i)    contracts involved in this project would be large contracts and at least 80% of their total
amount would be subject to prior review;
ii)    several Project personnel have been recently trained in World Bank procurement
procedures at the September 1998 seminar co-sponsored by the Bank and ISADE in
Dakar;
iii)    CELCO's procurement capacity has been recently strengthened through the hiring of a
procurement expert who happens to be a longtime lecturer at the above and other similar
procurement seminars co-sponsored by the Bank.
Consultant Services
9.   Consultant services financed by IDA will normally be selected through competition among
qualified short-listed firms in which the selection will be based on Quality and Cost Based Selection
(QCBS) by evaluating the quality of the proposal before weighting the quality and cost scores and adding
them. This includes: (a) advisory services and studies; (b) training and institutional development; (c)
engineering services and supervision; and (c) promotion of private sector participation. For contracts
above US$200,000, advertisement for receiving expressions of interest will be issued in the Business
Development Edition. For contracts above US$100,000, technical evaluations must receive IDA non-
objection before financial proposals are opened. For audits of a standard nature the Least Cost Selection
(LCS) will be used - the firm with the lowest cost will be selected provided its technical proposal receives
the minimum mark. Services for small studies which can be delivered by Individual Consultants will be
selected through comparisons of at least three CVs and qualifications. Short-lists for contracts under
US$100,000 may be comprised of national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least
three) are available at competitive costs. If foreign firms express interest, however, they will not be
excluded.
Prior Review for Consultant Services
10.  The total value of contracts requiring IDA prior review is US$ 16.2 million. It will be obligatory
for all TORs, sole source selection of individual consultants and firms, regardless of the contract amount,
and contracts of a critical nature as determined by IDA and contracts and amendments costing or resulting
in a total contract amount of US$ 100,000 equivalent or more for firms, and US$ 50,000 equivalent or
more for individuals.
11.  IDA will also review the procurement plan showing the selection process. The cost estimate, the
contract packaging, applicable procedures and timing of key steps.
Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts
12.  Before agreeing to any material extension, or any modification or waiver of the conditions of
contracts that would increase in aggregate its cost by more than 15 percent of the original price, the
Borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek IDA's prior no-objection for the proposed
modification.
62



Procurement Readiness, Schedule and Supervision Arrangements.
13.  Advance procurement for civil-works and goods would be made in accordance with Bank
procurement Guidelines. With the current project processing schedule, no retroactive financing will be
necessary for the project. Major contracts to be executed during the first project year are expected to be
signed by the time of credit Effectiveness. With the current project processing schedule, no retroactive
financing wifl be necessary for the project. During project implementation, the Coordinating Unit will
benefit from the assistance of a procurement specialist for the handling/coordination, and supervision of
works, as well as quality control on the procurement actions of other implementation entities of the
project. A detailed procurement plan for works, goods, and services to be procured under the project is
provided in the project files and noted in Annex 8. It will be updated by the coordination unit on a
regular basis. During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts
transmitted to IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan. During negotiations,
the Government will confirm it will furnish to IDA technical audit reports, in form and substance
acceptable to IDA, on implementation of the infrastructure work-program and the corresponding
equipment, and progress reports based on time-bound performance indicators and use of funds, three
months before each annual review.
B.  Disbursement
14.  The proposed IDA Credit will finance an investment program for the transport sector in Senegal. It
wili be disbursed over a period of five and one-half years, according to the categories presented in Table
C. The Credit will follow the standard disbursement profile for Senegal.
15. Disbursements of the credit will be fully documented at time of submission of withdrawal
applications, except for expenditures against contracts valued at less than the equivalent of (US$ 50,000)
for goods, (US$ 50,000) for civil works, US$ 50,000 for individual consultants and US$ 100,000 for
consulting firms which would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), and would be kept
available for examination by auditors, technical audits, and by IDA supervision missions. Applications
for direct payments can be submitted for amounts exceeding US$ 100,000 equivalent.
Counterparts Funds, Program Account, and IDA support for Operating Costs
16. Government's counterpart funds needed for twelve (12) months to cover the share of investment
not financed by IDA and other will be deposited by the government in a Program Account (PA).
17.  Operating costs consist of incremental operating costs incurred as a result of project
implementation, management and supervision including office equipment and materials, vehicles,
salaries, fuel, utilities, rent, communication costs and travel allowances of project staff, but excluding
salaries of Borrower's civil servants.
Special Account
18. To facilitate disbursements, the government would also open a Special Program Account (SPA) at
a commercial bank for IDA's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would be FCFA
2,500,000,000 representing about four months of disbursement. IDA would make an initial deposit of
FCFA 1,250,000,000 once the credit is declared effective and CELCO prepares and submits a withdrawal
application for the said amount to the Bank. The remaining balance will be made available as soon as
cumulative disbursements reach SDR 6,000,000. IDA would replenish the SPA upon receipt of
appropriate documentation satisfactory to IDA for incurred eligible expenditures. Each replenishment
63



request will be accompanied, as necessary, by an up-to-date bank statement and a reconciliation
statement.
Accounting/Auditing
19.  CELCO and the other implementing agencies will maintain each separate set of accounting records
for the portion of the program they are directly in charge of. In addition to maintaining the accounts at
the central level, CELCO will be responsible for the consolidation of the program accounts and the
production of the annual financial statements. An accounting and financial management system, based on
internationally acceptable accounting principles acceptable to the Bank, has been established. During
appraisal, an IDA Financial Management Specialist assessed and rated it as adequate. It was agreed,
however, not to proceed immediately with PMR-based disbursement method during the first 18 months of
implementation while the financial management system is reinforced further to ensure and orderly
transition to LACI. To that end, the Bank will carry out at the end of the first year of implementation, a
comprehensive and detailed assessment of the program financial management to determine its full
readiness for LACI. A second assessment will be carried out at the end of the third quarter of the second
year of implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of the transition to LACI.. During the first two years
of implementation, meanwhile, disbursements under the program will be made in accordance with the
SOE-based approach. The program will still be required to submit, in addition to its financial statements,
five quarterly reports, namely a Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds, a Contract Expenditure Report -
Goods & Works, a Contract Expenditure Report - Consultants, a Procurement Management Report -
Goods & Works, and a Procurement Management Report - Consultants. All procurement documents,
contracts, and invoices would be maintained separately by CELCO and be made accessible to supervision
missions and auditors.
20.  During negotiations, the government provided assurances that: (a) program accounts will be
audited in accordance with international audit standards by experienced and internationally recognized
audit firms acceptable to IDA. The audit reports and related project accounts will be submitted to IDA
within 6 months after the end of Government fiscal year; (b) in addition to their standard short form
report with the opinion, the auditors will be required to: (i) carry out a comprehensive review of all the
SQEs as well as the internal control procedures governing their preparation for the relevant period under
audit, and express a separate opinion thereon; (ii) review the management and utilization of the special
account and express a separate opinion thereon as well; (c) finally, the auditor will complete their in-
depth review, started at interim, of the internal control system of the program with a view to identify the
major weaknesses and shortcomings and proposing practical recommendations for improvement. The
results of this review would be documented in a Management Letter to be submitted along with the audit
reports; and (d) reports on the construction program and technical audits by an independent engineering
firm will be submitted within three months after the end of the government fiscal year.
21.  The financial auditors will also perform interim audits (9 months into the fiscal year) to review the
internal control system including management performance, and issue reports to that effect within one
month from the end of their work. The findings and recommendations of the interim reports will be
attended to by management right away before the return of the auditors for the final audit (mostly 3-4
months after closing of the fiscal year of the program). The contracting of auditors (financial and
technical), on multi-year contract, acceptable to IDA, and certification by the financial auditors that the
CELCO's accounting system is operational, is a condition of credit effectiveness.

Reporting
22.  CELCO will submit the following reports prepared jointly with the implementing agencies: (a)
semi-annual progress reports; (b) an annual report and a proposed financing plan, four weeks before the
joint annual review, and not later than September 30 each year; (c) a detailed progress report on
technical and financial program activities not later than four weeks before the date of mid-term review;
and (d) relevant sections of the implementation completion report (ICR) three months before the closing
date.
Supervision
23.  The program will require intensive supervision during the start-up phase when implementation
arrangements would be put to the test. In addition to the first annual review meeting, two supervision
missions will be scheduled during the fiscal year to monitor progress and coordinate with Government
and donors. The program will be supervised every four months for the first year, then every six months
thereafter. Supervision missions will consist of field trips, including work sites, to review financial and
management practices, bidding, and payments procedures. A mid-term review, including a full technical
and financial audit of the program, as well as beneficiary assessment, will be conducted no later than
January 31, 2002, and an end-of-program evaluation will be performed during the second semester of the
fifth year.

Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.
USA
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
RE: SENEGAL'S LETTER OF SECTOR POLICY
The transport sector plays a strategic role in the economy of Senegal, accounting for approximately 10% of the
GDP and generating a significant share of the total budgetary revenues of the State. The Government therefore
attaches high priority to the sector's role in promoting growth and reducing poverty.
The attached second letter of sector policy (LSP2) for the sector, which follows the first one published in 1991,
is consistent with this priority. The principles underlying the Govermment's policies and proposed reforms and
regulatory changes under the LSP2 include: (i) adapting transport infrastructure to the needs of economic
growth and of regional integration; (ii) further strengthening sector institutions and the Administration to
improve capacity to perform the essential functions of planning, co-ordination, regulation, and supervision; (iii)
extensive stakeholder involvement in the decision-making process regarding the management and development
of the sector, (iv) adoption of regulatory and fiscal frameworks designed to induce co petition and promote
private sector regulatory and fiscal frameworks designed to induce competition and promote private sector
participation in the development and management of the sector; (v) continued promotion of local private
contractors to develop technical and management capacity to efficiently carry out increased shares of
maintenance works for road, rail and port infrastructure; (iv) continued emphasis on maintenance and
rehabilitation, while pursuing selective infrastructure expansion (encompassing all transport modes); (vii)
development of rural transport including the definition of a coherent policy, preparation of an appropriate
strategy and definition of an action plan for the provision and maintenance of rural roads (including a pilot
priority program of rural roads rehabilitation); and (viii) ensuring environmental and social sustainability in the
sector.
1.            INTRODUCTION
In the aftermath of the oil shock, Senegal like many other countries especially in the developing world,
experienced a deep economic and financial crisis the forerunning signs of which appeared in the early 1980's.
Against this backdrop, various successive adjustment measures were taken most of which aimed primarily at
restoring macro-financial balance.
In the latter part of the 1980's and despite the combination of adjustment and sectoral policies, emphasis was
laid until the early 1990's on financial adjustment. This policy started to change after the implementation of the
emergency program in 1993 followed by the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994.
Regarding the particular case of the transport sector, the main objective of the Transport Sector Policy (DPS 1)
adopted in 1990 was to encourage the creation of an environment conducive to an upgrade of infrastructures
and services implying significantly increasing the support of this sector to the rest of the economy.
Within this framework, the Transport Sector Adjustment Program (PAST) was drawn up and implemented, a
far-reaching integrated program combining harmoniously institutional reforms for improved operational
1



effectiveness in the management of transport infrastructures, on the one hand, and the realization of massive
investments aiming at restoring or expanding network capacities, on the other.
Despite a difficult launching characterized by almost two years delay, PAST made it possible to carry out
important reforms allowing basic changes in the mode of managing the sector through notably easy
intervention of the private sector in infrastructure maintenance especially at the execution and service levels.
However, the investment program could not be carried out in due time both because of the delay in its
launching and in the mobilization of external funding and also due to the disturbances induced by the
devaluation of the CFA franc.
Nonetheless, following an evaluation seminar gathering all program participants, the impact of PAST was
deemed globally satisfactory on the sector itself and on the production activities, partly because the
infimastructures would have been at a more advanced stage of deterioration without PAST.
A follow-up program is, however, required to consolidate achievements and to support continuous
modernization of transport infrastructures in view of the exigencies of economic globalization.
This Sectoral Policy Directive (DPS2) underpins the follow-up program and the Second Transport Sector Policy
(PST2). It takes into consideration not only PAST achievements and shortcomings but also the new economic
environment made up of the orientations of the IX Orientation Plan for Economic and Social Development and
the Decentralization Policy, which has been reinforced since January, 1997.

In 1990, under DPS1 the government outlined, a medium term strategy for the transport sector based on a
number of principles inter-alia:
a)  to restructure sectoral institutions and to promote the private sector,
b) to recognize the priority nature of infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation;
c)  to improve on road, seaport, airport and railway security;
d)  to develop vocational training and retraining.
In order to concretize the strategy, a program of action was prepared and aimed at achieving the macro-
economic objectives of the transport sector by:
a)  reducing transport cost;
b)  strengthening the management of the sector and also expanding its investment and maintenance
programming capacity;
c)  privatizing as much as possible work execution or service provision in the sector;
d)  Restructuring parastatal transport bodies by changing them into national companies to be run along
commercial lines with substantially greater financial and administrative autonomy excluding any
operational subsidy from the government.
2.1.2.        Evaluation
In the railway, maritime and airline sub-sectors, the institutions restructuring program has almost been fully
completed with the change of parastatals into national companies. However, the skeleton contracts follow-up
mechanism signed between the government and the autonomous bodies proved to be inefficient and in most
cases, no evaluation was carried out.
In the road infrastructures sub-sector:
2



*  Public Works Directorate has been restructured in a normative concept and control sense;
* maintenance (periodic and regular) has since then been carried out 100% by the private sector;
* the infiastructumal projects that have been carried out recorded economic profitability rates of more than
12%;
* considerable efforts have been made to raise the level of the Road Fund.
This, notwithstanding some basic objectives, have not been achieved:
* with regard to road maintenance planning, the Road Database has not yet been fully operational, hence
there is not yet any medium term sliding programming of maintenance work;
* as far as the Road Fund is concerned, serious weaknesses are still apparent in terms of management
efficiency and transparency, planning, progranmiing, budget implementation and fund release;
*  management tools have been put in place with technical assistance though they are not completely
operational; furthermore, the local staff training program was not properly designed;
* The Public Works Vocational Training Center did not fully play its training and advisory role towards the
Small and Medium-size Enterprises and the Small and Medium-size Industries that intervene in regular
maintenance work.
2.2.          STATE OF THE SUB-SECTORS AND RECOMMENDED REFORMS
2.2.1.        General Issues
2.2.1.1.      Co-ordination Issues
The implementation of PAST revealed some co-ordination problems and weaknesses resulting from program
complexity and the diversity of program participants from both the donors and the government's sides,
transport networks being managed by three different ministerial departments. In connection with the latter
point, the fact that PAST Co-ordination Cell (PAST.COCELL) was positioned in the ministerial department
responsible for some component parts of the program with the same status as others constituted a major
constraint.
Consequently, in anticipation of TSP2, PAST. COCELL will be positioned in the office of the Minister of
Economy, Finance and Planning (MEFP), hence at a higher level of co-ordination so as to put it in a position to
further extend its action with all due authority and to be at the confluence of most of the information generated
by the program.
This reform will be followed by a redefinition of CO.CELL's mandates, an increase in its human and material
resources together with the establishment of adequate co-ordination and data-processing procedure and tools.
2.2.1.2.      Environmental Concerns
The review of transport infrastructure projects implemented in the past revealed that their impacts on the
environment were not fully taken into consideration in the absence of an adequate analytical framework. In
designing a medium term strategy for the transport sector, a diagnosis study was carried out in May, 1997
which allowed the definition and adoption of new orientations in this area.
In preparation of TSP2, a deeper study was carried out allowing the exhaustive assessment of the various
impacts that the transport sector has on the environment. It recommended a set of measures likely to mitigate
the potential impacts that had been identified. The corresponding directives will be printed in manual form and
will, henceforth, be systematically applied by transport infrastructure professionals.
Adequate management units and mechanisms will be put in place within the various TSP2 execution agencies
and also within PAST. COCELL in order to ensure that these environmental concerns are taken into
consideration. The same will apply to the required training programs and sensitization measures.
3



2.2.1.3.      Poverty Issues
The contribution of TSP2 to reducing poverty will attract special attention (which has not always been the case
under PAST) in view of the priority given to this issue by the government.
At the macro-economic level, the impact of the increased efficiency expected from the transport sector on
higher employment rate hence on income as well as on lower cost of living through reduced transaction cost
(contribution of transport costs) would be analyzed.
As far as the least favored groups are concerned, analysis will focus, in the urban area, on the impact that the
various Project components will have on the sectors employing unskilled labor. The regular road maintenance
work effected by the Small and Medium size Enterprises already contribute significantly to the fight against
poverty.
In the rural area, advantage would be taken of the involvement approach retained in designing the strategy for
rual transport by involving the least favored groups in the decisions affecting their lives as well as in the
implementation and assessment of such decisions.
2.2.2.        Road Infrastructures
2.2.21.       Institutions
a) Public Works Directorate (PWD)
PWD is responsible for building, equipping and maintaining road infrastructures. Under PAST, it was
restructured in 1992 in a normative concept and control sense with a view to adapting it to the progressive
reduction, then considered, in state control. Finally, while PAST was halfway through, state control was
completely dropped.
However, these reforms did not permit PWD to clearly achieve the objectives that had been assigned to it. The
only two elements of satisfaction were the privatization of road maintenance and the retraining of many senior
staff for the private sector. On the other hand, some essential functions including planning and programming,
the effective use of regional divisions, the financial and technical follow-up of road maintenance, staff
management, training and the setting up of road network management tools such as the Road Database (RDB),
have not always been fulfilled in a satisfactory manner.
This is due to many exogenous and endogenous factors linked, inter alia, to relatively heavy administrative
bidding and payment procedure, to the poorly qualified small and medium size enterprises entrusted with
regular road maintenance, to the absence of effective internal procedure and to the staffs lack of motivation.
In order to overcome these shortcomings, PWD will be further restructured with the creation of an autonomous
road works agency. The creation of such an agency is at the core of the governments strategy under TSP2, and
it is considered to be crucial to the success of the measures proposed to improve the management of the road
sub-sector. An insight study will be undertaken to assess the institutional, tax, adrministrative, financial and
operational consequences of the reform and to define a plan of action for its implementation. The approved
calendar should allow for the adoption of the texts that will govern the Agency and the establishment of its
governing bodies at the initiation of PST2 that is, at the beginning of the second half of 1999.
b) The Public Works Vocational Training Center (PWVTC)
LTD like PWD and LTD has also been restructured under PAST in order to redirect its action until then
devoted to the training of regular maintenance staff under state supervision towards a more central training
role and qualitative upgrading of both civil servants and staff of the SMEs involved in the implementation of
road programs and land transport.
LTD thus underwent a significant change from a monopoly position consisting in the routine training of
captive public customers with guaranteed operating resources to a situation where it has to go after the public
and private customers and to define training needs which will have to be borne by the customer.
4



LTD has not yet adapted to this new environment as it still faces problems including the fact that its activities
have not been really directed towards meeting training needs in road maintenance operations. Lastly, it does
not generate sufficient income even in its other areas of activities.
Necessary internal adjustments will be carried out in order for LTD to better adapt to the dynamics introduced
by the new context of the sub-sector. In this perspective, LTD's accounts have been reconstituted, an inventory
of its assets taken and a new accounting and financial system established.
An audit system will be put in place with the setting up of an accounting and financial system while the Road
Fund subsidies will be granted on the basis of performance criteria to be defined with the assistance of the Road
Fund Advisory Committee (RFAC). When TSP2 is midway through, the govermment will make a decision on
whether to maintain LTD on the basis of an overall assessment of its performance.
c)  The Road Research and Quality Control Laboratory (CEREEQ)
The mission of CEREEQ, which is currently a public establishment of an industrial and commercial nature, is
to define and promote technological research and rational utilization of building materials. In this connection,
it puts at the disposal of the govermment bodies and private persons from the building and public works circles,
testing techniques and results of experimental studies enabling to ensure the technical quality of the works
carried out. It intervenes both upstream (study phase) and downstream (follow-up of later behavior) of
construction works.
CEREEQ is confronted with a number of obstacles in carrying out its mission as a result of its obsolete
equipment, lack of personnel training and the relatively low level of the resources generated.
In the end, CEREEQ was changed into a company with majority public shareholding in a move to better adapt
it to the changing sub-sector. It will receive assistance under TSP2 to finance staff training, purchase
laboratory, communication and support equipment, sampling equipment and the construction of an equipment
storing warehouse.
The laboratory equipment is intended to equip laboratories with building materials, soils and foundations,
roads, chemistry as well as meteorological cells. The pieces of equipment consist of a boring machine, a
destructive drilling, a sampling core drill and data processing equipment.
2.2.2.2.      Road Network
Road infrastructure was classified according to the definition of law 74-20 dated January 24, 1974 and the
application decree n°74-718 of the same year establishing a distinction between classified network and
unclassified network.
a) The Classified Network
Classified road network is selected mainly on the basis of administrative criteria and consists of: (i) national
roads linking long distance administrative regions; (ii) regional roads linking various departmental chief
towns; (iii) departmental roads linking various district and rural community chief towns; (iv) listed earth roads
linking departmental roads to agricultural production centers; (v) urban public road network made up of major
urban roads (The Great Public Road Network) linking up national roads with the major centers of regional
capitals.
The most recent inventory (December, 1996) reported classified road network length at 14,576 km of which
4,258 km of paved roads (29.21%), 10,311 km of unpaved roads (70,74%) and 7 km of paved roads (0,05%).
Reviewing road network expansion, it appears that the latter has remained virtually stationary since 1992 and
that most of the expansion of paved roads took place between 1961 and 1981. However, the on-going
asphalting of the Tambacounda-Kidira-Bakel road will expand paved road network by 250 km.
5



In the fiamework of PAST, a top priority network of 925 kms (65% of the classified network) was retained, as the
Government lacks sufficient means to handle maintenance of the entire network This includes all the paved roads
and nealy one-half of unpaved roads.
The most recent inventories of detenorated roads (in 1998 for paved roads and in 1994 for unpaved roads), mention
that 28.5%/, or 8455 kms of the network of paved roads is in poor condition. This is explained by the priority granted
to the mainterance and restoration of paved roads in the framework of PAST (approx. 1500 knms), to the detriment of
most of the classified network (with actual refilling of earth roads involving only about 365 kms). Moreover, just as
for restoration and regular maintenance, current maintenance for the entire system has mainly focused on blacktopped
roads.
The Dept. of Public Works (DTP) is responsible for planning and programming construction, restoration and
maintenance activities, and also manages work and study contracts.
b) The Unclassified Network
This network is not well known because it was constructed without a global plan and by various contnbutors (DTP,
local groups, agricultural development projects, NGOs, etc.).
It conssts mainly of earth roads and feeder roads. No one knows the exact condition of these roads, because a global
maintenance management plan does not exist.
Hence, despite its importance in supporting activities in the nirl areas, the unclassified network has not yet been
integrated into an institutional framework permitting its actual management.
2.2.23.        Funding of Infrastructures and the Road Fund
For now, the State has exclusive responsibility for financing infrastructures and maintenance. New works and
reinfoivement are financed by development partners through grants or loans matched by counterpart funding by the
State.
Under PAST, there have been serious delays in raising outside funds and setting up counterpart funds by the State.
GenerA  speaking, this presents a problem in coordinating interventions; an improvement in that area will help avoid
drastic over-expnditures caused by these delays.
Current maintenance is financed chiefly with internal funds through the Road Fund, and a few donors help with
reglar naintenance.
The Road Fund's resource level, as well as the mechanisms and procedures governing it, have markedly improved as
PAST has been implemented over the years. In addition to an advance account opened for the DTP at a commewial
bank, the State has raised the credit alocated to the Fund regularly, reaching 13 billion CFA F in 1998, compared to
10 billion in 1997 and 4.5 billion in 1993, or 18.3%/o, 20 % and 16.7% respectively of total internal resources in the
Consolidated Inestments Budget (BCE). Starting in 1999, the State will set aside a minimum of 15 billion CFA F to
the Road Fund.
However, in order to better adapt Fund operations to the changes desired in the sector, including getting private
entities to share in the financing of investments and maintenance, the necessary legislative and regulatory actions will
be taken to ensure its continued funding and endow it with all the autonomy and transparency required within such a
oontext
Considering that the biggest constraint at this moment lies less in the level or availability of resources than in the
planning, programming and execution of maintenance work, a for the Road Fund Consultative and Follow-up
Committee (CCFR) will be set up, while awaiting the actual establishment of the Road Works Authority (Agence
Autonome de Travaux Routiers). The study to be conducted on the creation of that Agency wil evaluate the
appropriatenss of maintaining the CCFR in the form currently proposed, or whether it should be restructured so it can
be adapted accordingly.
6



Govemnment representatives will be seated on the CCFR, in addition to those from the private sector and road users,
with a view to contnbuting to greater transparency and a higher sense of responsibility in managing the Road Fund.
The Committee's main function will be to advise the authorities and provide all the support they may require in their
efforts to improve the decision-making process involving road maintenance work, As for the continuous management
of matters conceniung it, the CCFR will be backed by a secretariat composed of highly qualified professionals.
2.22.4.        Actions Planned for PST2
The physical objectives of the 5-year road maintenance programme are: i) restoration of the blacktopped network and
the unpaved network carying traffic over 40 vehicles per day, in order to ensure a proper service level and allow their
contimnous preventive maintenance; ii) elimination of critical points throughout the unpaved network and guarantee of
traffic circulation across the entire network of national, regional and departmental roadways carrying
more than 10 vehicles per day; and iii) the elimination of critical points in the rest of the network in order to cut
traffic interruptions down to brief amounts of time compatible with the service level required to ensure the economic
and social functions of the road system.
Priority will be given to current maintenance work (light reshaping, clean-up and clearing) on those parts of the
network already in good condition, while work for excessively dilapidated roads and those which must be restored in
the slort term will be kept to the strictest minimum. Hence, the current maintenance schedule will gradually evolve
depending on the network's overall improvement, increasing from approximately 5000 kms per year (including 3000
kms of blacktopped roads and 2000 kms of earth roads) at the beginning of PST2, to 11,200 kms (including 4200 kms
of blacopped roads and 7000 kms of earth roads) by the end of PST2.
At the same time, a catch-up programme for the network will be implemented through intensive maintenance of
bladktopped roads, repair of critical points along the earth roads and restoration or construction of strnctures.
Intensive maintenance of blacktopped roads wil involve catching up on the repair of points covering 0.50/o, 0.4% and
0.3% of the scheduled network in 1999, 2000 and 2000, respectively, and covering 0.2% starting in 2002. It will also
involve other operations (resealing [deflachage?] and maintenance of shoulders for the most degraded trunks). This
has all become necessary due to the delays in reinforcing the roads, which concerns 1% of the total network in poor
iepair.
The repair of cntical points along the earth roads will involve 5000 kms, or nearly all of the network in poor repair
(8500 kms), besides the 3000 kms carrying less than 10 vehicles a day.
A budget of 2 billion CFA F per year, or 10 billion F over 5 years will be alotted to restoration work and the
construction of structures.
The periodic maintenance programme provides for: i) the reinforcement of approximately 600 kms of blacktopped
mads presently in poor condition which could not be restored in the PAST programme, and the regular maintenance
of approximately 600 kms of roads presently in a medium state of degradation; and ii) pothole patching 2000 kms of
earth roads including 600 kms in 1999.
The other maintenance work wil involve renovating the road marking system over 600 kms of blacktopped roads per
year, and the renovation of 20% of the road signs along paved roads which will not be maintained regularly, and
building crossroads for an equivalent of 100 million CFA F per year.
The new works programme will first involve three tunks of roadway for a total of 130 kms. These roads are: Diana
Mlary - "Croisement (Crossroad) 22", Sedhiou - Tanaff - Guinea Bissau Border and Saraya - Mali Border.
Finaly, an institution-building programme wiU be implemented to accompany the investment programme. It wil
target the training of managers, setting up a database and programming tools, support for preparation of invitations to
tender and contract offers, providing support to construction supervision and strengthening the capacities of SMEs
intervening in road maintenance.
More specifically, in order to improve overaU road maintenance efficiency, PST will finance the following studies: 1)
research on materials (with the drafting of quany maps) and establishment of a road structures list; ii) review and
revision of the standard specifications manuals applicable to current maintenance work and periodic maintenance; iii)
7



review of the Special Technical Clauses Manuals (CCTP - Cahiers des Clauses Techniques Particulieres) customarily
used in contracts for restoration and new works, plus the preparation of standard CCTPs; iv) studies to bring the
Roadways Data Bank (BDR) up to par and the collection of nussing data on the status of the classified road network;
and finally, v) the elaboration of standard specifications manuals for technical and economic studies.
2.2.3.         Railroad Transport
This subsector is managed by a public firm, the National Railroad Company of Senegal (SNCS - Societe Nafionale de
Chemnns de Fer du S&nggal), and by a private company, the Chemical Industries of Senegal Company for Railroad
Operations (SEFICS - Societe d'Exploitation Ferroviaire desIndustries Chimiques du Senegal. Each company has its
own fleet of material. SEFICS is allowed to operate on public railways by paying a fee to SNCS.
Since 1996, railroad lines carrying passengers but losing money have been eliminated. Nonetheless, the SNCS
continues to run a subuib service between Dakar and Rufisque, which is steadily growing. This line, known as "The
Little Blue Train" (Le Petit Train Bleu- PTB), wil undergo some reforms as part of the Urban Transport Reform
Project
By December 1999 at the latest, international traffic operations (72% of SNCS profits) will be turned over to another
company, the International Traffic Operations Company (Societ d'Exploitation du Traffic International - SE77), of
which the majority shareholders will be private. SETI, created jointly by Mali and Senegal, will have exclusive
operation of international traffic (against payment of fees for using the infrastructure and rolling stock when the latter
belongs to SNCS), with the exception of the functions of traffic security and train dispatching, the maintenance of
infiastuctures and investments for causeway renewal.
The current state of the rails on the international line between Tambacounda and Kidira (approx. 155 kms), which is
over 80 years old, is a serious handicap to SNCS efficiency. In the framework of PAST, actions will be undertaken to
renovate approximately 60 kms of railway with help from the IDA. As part of the PST plan, special emphasis will be
placed on renewing the remaining line.
Due to changes taking place in the subsector, SNCS is obliged to readjust rapidly, this should be achieved by
strengthening the commercial function within the company, the development of new products and restructuring
corresponding to its new missions. A study is underway in preparation of PST and the necessary steps will be taken
following the schedule set by SETI, including financing the social plan which will arise from it. Of course, funding of
the SNCS Investment Programme by backers will be linked to these reorientations and setting up SETI.
In conclusion, the investment programme approved in the framework of PST2 comprises: i) renovation of the
railways and strengthening the platform and structures between Tambacounda and Kidira; ii) restoration of the
railways, the platform and structures between Dakar and Tambacounda; ui) construction of a third line between Hann
and Thiaroye; iv) renovating the line between Thies and Tivaouane; v) refitting the rail workshops in Thies vi)
restoration of the International Railroad Station in Kidira; vii) acquisition and overhaul of locomotives; viii)
acquisition of an 80-tonne lifting crane; ix) acquisition of container cars; x) fitting wagons in the international pool
with air brakes; xi) installation of line-up train weighing systemns at the Thies, Guinguineo and Kidira train stations;
xii) refitting of the signals network for the Dakar and Bel Air stations, thereby completing the signals system between
Dakar and Thies; xiii) acquisition of a computerized radio block for the Thies-Kidira line; xiv) construction of an
underground telephone network and changing the telephone exchanges of ThiMs and Dakar; and xv) financing the
resulting social plan set up by SETI and salvaging the social plan, which is in progress but not yet completed.
2.2.4.         Administration of Road Transport
The Land Transport Directorate (DTI) is in charge of the regulation, control and coordination of transport of people
and goods over land. Important measures have been taken in the framework of PAST in view of modernizing and
reinforcing its road security policy.
These measures have materialized in the setting-up of a new, more functional organizational chart and noticeable
advances in the computerization of transport papers (registration papers, drivers' licenses, technical inspections,
transport authorizations) and the establishment of a data bank.
8



These actions will be pursued and consolidated in the context of PST2 to allow the DTT to fulfill its missions more
effectively. The actions retained cover i) the reform of drivers' license exams, notably with the design of teaching
supports and the publication of a highway code manual, with its translation into the national languages; ii)
continuation of the computerization programme; iii) construction of infrastructures (three regional division offices,
road safety routes, routes for talkng driving license tests and construction of drnving practice areas; iv) procurement of
archive equipment and technical inspection equipment; v) studies to be conducted on transportation, including
updating the National Transport Plan; and vi) implementation of a training programme.
Finally, the consequences that the creation of theAgence A utonome de Travaux Routiers (Road Works Authority) will
have on the DIT missions will also be analysed in light of the study implemented to that effect and the necessary
reorganization measures will be taken.
2.2.5.         Maiitime and River Transport and Ports
This su-sector is predominated by the Port of Dakar (PAD), as compared to the country's other ports. More than 90/
of Senegal's external trade transits through this port On the other hand, Ziguinchor and Kaolack are the most active
secondary ports.
With PAST, important work has been achieved to rehabilitate the PAD infiastructures, whose state of repair has
greatly improved. However, these efforts must be pursued and consolidated in upcoming years. The implementation of
PAST has, moreover, allowed greater involvement by the private sector in the management of activities. However,
wide-ranging reform of certain procedures, particularly concerning handling and warehouse services, is still clearly
imperative to provide this port with all the operational efficiency it requires.
In the futur, it will be important to evaluate the appropriateness of investing in infrastructures which could encourage
container transport and optimize the potentials of transshipment traffic.
The posslilities involving the private sector in financing infrastructures will be studied, particularly through Build-
Own-Transfer (BO'I)4ype operations or public-private joint ventures.
From that perspective, the programme approved for PST2 concerns: i) continuing to develop the North Zone of
the PAD, for which funding is already secured through the ADF; ii) support and assistance to SONAPAD to
prepare three BOT files bearing on financing the extension of the container terminal and construction of the
distribution platform and the cereals terminal; iii) the technical studies and the petroleum wharf rehabilitation
work, iv) the technical studies and work in order to group together phosphate terminals ; v) the replacement of
the naval equipment of the PAD ; vi) the implementation of the environmental plan of action ; and vii) the
implementation of a five-year training plan.
Furthertnore, useful steps will be taken to update the studies relating to the establishment of an nineral port at
Bargny, a necessary investment to make some mining projects profitable.
In spite of the existence of waterways over appreciable distances and ports or ports of call with adequate
facilities in general along the various rivers, transport by inland waterway remains marginal in the transport
system as private carriers seem to give preference to road transport. Therefore, the Government has an
important role to play in promoting the development of this form of transport which may be a major support for
regionalization and contribute to opening up areas which are inaccessible by road as well as to sub-regional
integration.
Government's efforts should be mainly focused on navigation regulation and safety, on the improvement of
navigability, navigation assistance and human resources development in addition to the effort made by private
carriers who will be responsible for the purchase of transport equipment and the management of the
commercial departments.
In the medium tenn, the development of transport by inland watenvay is related to that of coastal navigation at
national level, especially between Dakar and the secondary ports. Significant savings could thus be made on the
costs of road and rail transport.
9



Secondary ports are still under state ownership and the Government entrusted chambers of commerce and
industry with the task of running them. However, considering the low level of activities carried out in these
ports, the cash-flow generation capacity is inadequate and does not make it possible for chambers of commerce
to have sufficient means to finance development investments. Within the framework of PST2, special attention
will be given to the Kaolack and Ziguinchor ports.
As regards the Kaolack port, a plan to boost the activities must be implemented in addition to the promotion of
the private sector to encourage its involvement in the management and improvement of the access to this port
by ships (beacons, hydrographic surveys and possibly dredging).
As regards the Ziguinchor port, intervention takes place within the general framework of the revitalization of
the sea link between Dakar and Ziguinchor and includes the improvement of access to the port as well as the
rehabilitation of wharfs and the creation of passenger terminals in Dakar and Ziguinchor.
Finally, at the institutional level, the necessary steps will be taken within the framework of PST2 to enhance the
intervention means of the Merchant Marine Department (DMM). Therefore, in addition to the updating of the
maritime legislation, the activities to be financed include the modernization of human resources management
through the implementation of a five-year training programme, computerization of tasks and technical
assistance in order to achieve private sector promotion and environmental protection.
2.2.6.        Air transport
Senegal has 14 national airports open to public air traffic out of which 4 receive international flights (Dakar,
Cap-Skirring, Saint-Louis and Ziguinchor for the sub-region).
Significant investments for repairing runways, but also for the acquisition of power generation equipment,
safety measures against fire and assistance in terms of navigation and landing were made within the framework
of PAST.
However, it would be better for air navigation safety to be enhanced on the one hand through strict
implementation of international standards and practices in this regard, which calls for real supervision by the
government and on the other hand through the improvement of meteorological assistance.
As regards LSS International Airport air traffic jam caused by a concentration of flights at certain periods of
the week still exists as well as the need to improve safety. It will also be necessary to rehabilitate spaces in order
to increase the capacity of check-in facilities, police control on arrival and baggage claim area. Finally, the
rationalization of ground assistance provided for airline companies, taking into account the security and safety
requirements, could make it possible to reduce landing fees considerably. Thus, the PST2 will finance the air
terminal extension and modernization work, the acquisition of handling equipment and the cargo plane parking
area and runways rehabilitation.
The study under way at ASECNA (Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar) on the
development of the LSS International Airport will make it possible to better define the necessary restructuring
measures and investments to enhance the international traffic function of the said Airport.
In fact, the study is aimed, inter alia, at: ) determining the repercussions of the national economy development
perspectives on the Airport traffic by the year 2015 ; ii) analysing the present facilities capacity and their
ability to face traffic growth and, if necessary, transferring some facilities to other places in the site ; and iii)
determining the date of a possible transfer of the Airport to another site.
With regard to other airports, the PST2 will mainly finance: i) navigation and safety support equipment to
continue and complete the programme started within the framework of PAST; ii) lengthening the Saint-Louis
Airport runway including the modification of the layout of the existing road which runs along the said Airport
and the extension of the fence; and iii) the construction of a new airport in Ziguinchor.
Finally, the promotion of the private sector involvement in the management of the sub-sector will be furiher
strengthened especially with:
10



*  the privatization of Air Sdndgal (Senegal Airline Company) which will come into effect in December 1999
at the latest. In addition to the recapitalization of the company, a series of actions aimed at ensuring the
success of the transaction were undertaken and involve the coverage, by the government, of the. liabilities
resulting from the plane crash in Kafountine and Tainbacounda and, the financing of a social plan with a
view to downsizing the staff. The PST2 will finance the actions required for the implementation of the
privatization including especially the updating of the market survey, considering the establishment of a
single operating area (ZOE), the designing of the strategy, the actions relating to the offer of sale
(developing information and DAO documents, marketing media, etc ...) and the support to the Committee
in charge of the privatization.
*  the privatization of airports management as well as the restructuring of the Civil Aviation and National
Meteorology before June 2000. To this effect, the ongoing thorough study initiated within the framework of
PST2 preparation will make it possible to clearly define the roles of the Civil Aviation Department (DAC)
and the National Meteorology Department (DMN) and the appropriate means to be made available to
them. The PST2 will finance various support actions relating to the restructuring of these departments
including the development of legal instruments, organization charts, manuals of procedures, budget
estimates as well as training. As regards the implementation of the privatization, in view of the fact that it
is a relatively new area in the sector, the Government will seek, as much as possible, to draw from the
experience gained by other countries where it was already achieved.
These various reforms in the sector will surely result in staff cuts which will require the implementation of
social plans to be financed by the PST2 as well as the related communication strategy.
2.2.7.         Rural transport
In Senegal, a clearly defined national strategy or policy is yet to be implemented regarding rural transport like
other sub-sectors. There is no appropriate institutional framework for covering the activities in this area and the
interventions in this field are not based on systematic planning.
The designing and construction of facilities are not carried out according to the rules and the latter are not
properly maintained.
Also, no special attention was given to the development of means of transport in rural areas, although an
appropriate strategy would have made it possible to obtain appreciable productivity gains in the transportation
of agricultural productions and to meet rural populations' social needs in a satisfactory way.
The solution to transport problems in rural areas will require the implementation of a real strategy taking into
account the improvement of the institutional framework on the one hand and the development of appropriate
means to facilitate the circulation of people and goods, on the other.
A real national policy will be defined on a participatory basis. In particular, the necessary reforms to involve
the decentralized structures will be examined as well as the sources of financing likely to be mobilized to meet
the needs in terms or rural transport.
As regards the definition of the strategy, three (3) themes were identified and are presently being studied within
the framework of PST2 preparation and should give preliminary insight into the rural transport situation in
Senegal. The studies are focused on the present institutional, financing and planning aspects, the technical
aspects and the development of the means of rural transport, which constitute the assessment phase. The studies
will be discussed within the framework of seminars on rural transport during which the necessary additional
studies will be identified in order to undertake reforms and implement a Rural Transport Project as of the last
quarter of the year 2000. Following the findings of the second study relating to the technical aspects, an
inventory of the road network will be undertaken with a view to establishing a data bank. The latter will be
used also to develop a priority programme for the gradual improvement of the rural track network. The
implementation of the priority programme will provide the opportunity to experiment a pilot phase which will
include awareness-raising and the involvement of the populations, NGOs and other stakeholders as well as the
review of the local tax system and the assessment of possible contributions from the Road Fund and the
communities. The experience gained during this pilot phase will provide an impetus for the development of a
large-scale project.

2.2.8.         Urban transport
Due to its importance, this sector received a separate sectoral policy atatement adopted in September 1996.
Within this framework, it benefits from an important institutional reform and expertise capacity strengthening
programme.
The basic objective of the advocated reforms is to reorganize the urban transport sector in Senegal in order to
improve its effectiveness on a long-term basis. This objective is in keeping with the Government's global policy
defined by the 9th Orientation Plan for Economic and Social Development and is aimed, inter alia, at:
a) making the regulation more likely to promote sound competition between the various actors and enhance
investments in the sector;
b) developing private initiative and supporting changes in the area of self-organization;
c) improving the quality of state intervention in the provision of services and basic infrastructure.
Permanent dialogue will be promoted between the PAST Coordination Committee (CELCO/ PAST) and the
Dakar Urban Transport Executive Board (CETUD) in order to create synergy of actions and programmes.
3.            GENERAL ORIENTATIONS
The Government transport policy is in line with the IXth Orientation Plan for Economic and Social
Development the main objective of which is the promotion of competitive economy in order to achieve
sustinable human development by laying special emphasis on the need to have infrastructure which is able to
support production activities efficiently. In the dynamic approach adopted by PAST, it is also aimed at
strengthening the achievements at the institutional, organizational and financial levels. Furthermore, it takes
into account the need to develop new capacities in areas which are not yet exploited sufficiently (rural roads,
coastal navigation, transport by inland waterway), to support sub-regional integration and promote greater
private sector involvement, especially as regards the financing of investments and the management of the
infrastructure.
The infrastructure must be seen in a context which enables it to provide more substantial support for the rest of
the economy (agriculture, industry, mining, trade, tourism) and meet populations' social needs more efficiently.
To this effect, a more trade-oriented approach will be adopted for the management of the sector, which involves
the application of the "user-has-to-pay" principle whenever possible in order to have a satisfactory level of
collection of resources required for adequate maintenance of the infrastructure.
In this perspective, a real partnership between the various actors will be sought for especially by involving the
latter in the decision-making process in terms of planning and management.
The Govermnent will continue to cafry out reforms in order to adapt laws, regulations and the tax system to the
desired changes (for example in the Civil Aviation sector). The institutional reforms already conducted in the
sector will be enhanced through further management transparency and more effectiveness. Finally,
competitiveness will be seen as a whole which depends on both the public and private sectors.
Special attention will be given to rural transport development. The objective being to bring the transport sector
to play its role fully in providing support for the development of rural areas. In accordance with the
decentralization policy spirit, real concertation will be carried out to this effect with the decentralized structures
as well as with the private sector and NGOs. Appropriate institutional measures will also be taken to promote
balanced development of rural transport.
Greater importance will be given to vocational training in all sectors to make it possible to better appropriate
the reforms to be undertaken, among others.
12



Finally, by banking on the development of links with bordering countries, the transport policy will materialize
the orientation of the Plan making of sub-regional integration one of the major focal points of the national
economic policy.
