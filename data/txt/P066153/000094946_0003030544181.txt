PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:                 Republic of Latvia
Amount:                   US$ 40.41 million
Terms:                    Standard Amortization terms, grace period and fixed spread for US Dollar
denominated loan
Commitment Fee:           0.85% on undisbursed loan balances for the first 4 years, 0.75% thereafter
Objectives and Description:  The Proposed loan of US$40.41 million is a Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Loan (PSAL) to support Latvia's reform program. It is envisaged
that over the three-year period of Latvia's reform program, there could be up
to three single or two tranche PSALs to support its implementation amounting
to an overall resource envelope of approximately US$100 million. Latvia's
reform program will help Latvia to return to a macroeconomic framework
conducive to growth and improve its public sector performance through:
* Correcting macro-imbalances;
* Strengthening credibility of the public sector;
* Improving institutional capacity to deliver public services;
* Rationalizing a transparent relationship with the private sector.
Latvia expects to achieve these objectives by implementing specific reforms
supported by the Bank in the areas of (i) pensions; (ii) public sector
management; (iii) human resources management; (iv) public expenditure
management; and (v) privatization and regulation (of public utilities and
private business).
Benefits:                 The actions under the PSAL will aid fiscal adjustment and will contribute to
the sustainability of the reform process by strengthening the institutional
infrastructure needed to improve the public sector's capacity to carry out its
role effectively and efficiently. At the same time the PSAL's actions will also
encourage private sector development by finalizing the privatization process
and defining a clear and transparent regulatory framework. The Operation
will also put in place measures to assist in the Government's anticorruption
effort and streamlining business regulation, which are essential steps not only
for an efficient Government but also for an efficient market economy. The
reforms will enhance Latvia's prospects for timely EU accession.  An
efficient market economy can allocate investments to those sectors that will
bring the highest returns to the country in the form of sustained and rapid
growth.  The PSAL measures will also provide a positive signal to
international institutions  and  investors  regarding  the  Government's
commitment to reform  and the transition towards a full-fledged market
economy.
Risks:                    An important risk would come from failure to maintain macroeconomic
stability, which could come from a sustained deterioration of the external

environment that Latvia faces or from domestic policy slippage. This could
decrease confidence in the current exchange rate arrangements and result in
capital flight, exchange rate instability and a return of high inflation. Lack of
political commitment could delay fiscal adjustment and the implementation of
structural reforms and could also impede the reform process of the pension
system, which in turn could severely undermine fiscal sustainability. Another
concern is that institutional and governance reform is inherently risky. Any
number of contingencies could divert attention from, and thereby sidetrack or
even derail, the process of building the institutional infrastructure necessary
for improved public sector performance. Such risks are heightened by the
frequent changes of Government, which have characterized Latvia in the past
few years. In addition, poor coordination among the ministries involved is a
further risk that could adversely affect the program's implementation.
Another important risk that could significantly slow down, if not derail, parts
of the reform program is possible threats coming from special interest groups.
For example: public sector agencies, of which some have solely been created
to escape from public sector standards and control mechanisms will resist the
measures aimed to return them to an appropriate legal framework.
To mitigate these risks, the IBRD will continue to assist the Government in
mobilizing technical assistance to adopt and implement the reforms and
would also deepen the ongoing dialogue with the Government on structural
reform, working closely with the other donors and the IFIs to provide this
technical assistance. This dialogue is actually facilitated by the Programmatic
approach. Moreover, future PSALs will be conditioned on satisfactory
implementation of the PSAL program. The programmatic approach allows a
sustained engagement between the Bank and the Government over an
extended period, as the reform program is implemented. The inter-ministerial
work group under the coordination of the Ministry of Finance, which helped
in the preparation of the PSAL, will continue its work during the
implementation phase of the Loan and to improve coordination among the
implementing agencies. Subsequent Bank group operations would seek to
sustain and deepen the reforms initiated under this operation. The recent
invitation to start accession negotiations with the EU is a clear signal that the
Government has been willing to undertake reforms to meet the requirements
of the EU's 'acquis communitaire' as well as underlines the need to keep the
market-oriented reforms on track as it would otherwise harm Latvia's
accession prospects.

Box 1: ACTIONS AGAINST CORRUPTION IN LATVIA
Recognizing the importance of tackling problems of corruption early in the transition, Latvia adopted the law on
the Prevention of Corruption in September 1995, which sets broad ethical standards for public officials and
provides a mechanism to monitor the compliance of public servants with these standards. In 1996 the President of
the World Bank offered to support member countries in the battle against corruption. Latvia was the first country
to accept this offer, and, in February 1997, the Government of Latvia inaugurated its Corruption Prevention
Program with a high-level workshop, at which it formulated an approach consisting of prevention, enforcement,
and public education. The program is being implemented and further elaborated by the Corruption Prevention
Council (CPC), an interministerial body chaired by the Minister of Justice.
To identify and prioritize the actions in the Corruption Prevention Program and to create benchmarks against
which to measure future progress in anticorruption, the CPC commissioned independent surveys of public
officials, enterprise managers, and members of households. These surveys were conducted by Latvia Facts, a non-
Government organization. The survey results indicated that:
>  37 percent of enterprise managers and 13 percent of household members reported having made unofficial
payments
>  enterprises and households in contact with state bodies reported that unofficial payments are required a third
to half of the time from some of these bodies
>  enterprises and households also report that politicians frequently accept bribes in exchange for influence over
policies, including privatization
> public officials reported that public-sector jobs can be purchased in exchange for bribes; this practice is most
common for jobs in which the public official can expect to earn significant income from bribes
>  the typical household spends 1.2 percent of monthly income on bribes; about one half of the bribes are paid to
the traffic police and for the provision of health services
>  while rich households are more likely to have paid bribes than poor households, poor households pay a larger
fraction of their income in bribes than do rich households
>  the typical enterprise spends 2.1 percent of monthly turnover on bribes; most of the bribes are paid to the
traffic police, fire or sanitary inspectors, customs officials, and for telephone installation and services
>  30 percent of enterprises would be willing to pay more taxes if all corruption would be eliminated; among
these enterprises, the typical enterprise reported a willingness to pay 15 percent of its revenues in additional
taxes to eliminate corruption
>  complex regulations and excessive discretion on the part of regulators were reported by enterprises as a
leading cause of corruption and a major obstacle to doing business; indeed the main reason for enterprises'
failure to realize planned investments was the high and uncertain cost of regulatory compliance
>  weakness in the judiciary and inadequate enforcement of rule of law were reported by households as the
single most important reason for corruption
These and other results of the survey were disseminated in a public workshop in January 1999, which was
attended by members of Government, the Judiciary, and civil society. During the workshop, the participants
formed working groups and used the survey results to help elaborate specific recommendations to the CPC.

Box 2: PUBLIC SECTOR AGENCIES: A CROSS CUTTING PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM ISSUE
The need for a comprehensive public sector reform program that deals simultaneously with corruption, transparency,
accountability and institutional capacity of the public sector to manage its financial and human resources, as well as with its
impact through regulation and service delivery on the private sector, can best be illustrated through the issues arising from the
proliferation of public sector agencies in Latvia.
Recent years have seen a rapid growth of such agencies (there are at least 150) as a form of organization, whereby selected
governmental functions entrusted to a Ministry are delegated to agencies under its jurisdiction. In Latvia, there are three kinds of
Government agencies: (i) subordinate, (ii) supervised and (iii) under ministerial management. They carry out a range of tasks
including service delivery, regulatory monitoring, and asset management without adequate provisions for assuring accountability
and transparency with respect to resources used and services provided.
The creation of agencies does not appear to be related to an objective assessment of their suitability for management or delivery
of services. Rather it appears to be motivated by incentives to escape centralized standards and controls. The only legal
framework for agencies is the private sector joint stock company legislation, together with supplementary regulations and the
creation of a management layer, sometimes including Government proxies, between the Ministry and the agency.
The current legislative framework is weak in specifying procedures for creating agencies, their financial and managerial
accountability, standards for recruitment, promotion and pay; procurement practice; measures of performance and performance
evaluation, as well as their treatment of fees and other revenues. The result has been ad hoc creation of governmental agencies
with inadequate regulation and insufficient budgetary controls. As an example of the latter, agencies do not have to keep their
accounts at the Treasury. The current legal structure under which agencies operate, is not appropriate for public sector
institutions responsible for implementing public policy and able to raise their own revenues. It represents an invitation to
corruption because of the opportunity for rent seeking, for interpreting with discretion its own charter and for loose accountability
procedures. It also creates serious problems for budget and expenditure management.
At the same time agencies can have been empowered to set, collect and keep their own fees and charges, and have in principle
the possibility under the joint stock company law to borrow without a Government guarantee creating a contingent liability to the
budget. Unless these practices are changed, the area of budgetary control will be further diminished and the Government will
increasingly lose the ability to manage its resources satisfactory. However, part of the reason why line ministries have created
agencies was to get away from the sometimes-invasive financial control exercised by the Ministry of Finance. To tackle these
issues a rationalization of public expenditure management is necessary and a redefinition of the relationship between the line
ministries and the Ministry of Finance is needed. The problems associated with agencies are compounded by the tendencies of
the Government during the last decade to earmark funds for particular purposes. These earmarked funds currently make up over
55 percent of fiscal revenues and have affected the fungibility of resources and the ability of the Ministry of Finance to propose
corrective measures when necessary. Most of the earmarked revenues find their way to an agency.
Another incentive for line ministries to create agencies is to get away from the current civil service pay system which is deemed
too flat and has a base pay that is too low. Creation of an agency allows its management to design its own pay structure and
reward its employees as it sees fit. To tackle this problem a comprehensive pay reform is needed that deals with the pay structure
of the public sector as a whole.
The solution to the agency problem is to have them operate under an appropriate legal framework accompanied with adequate
provisions for assuring accountability, but also with enough flexibility and freedom for managers to improve service delivery. In
some cases where the purpose of the agency is commercial rather than implementing public policy, privatization will be the
solution.

Box 3. THE FIVE LARGE ENTERPRISES.
LATTELEKOM
The planned privatization of the Government's 51 percent holding in Lattelekom has been blocked because of difficulties in
reaching agreement with its private sector owners on a reduction of the exclusivity period and other provisions in the original
umbrella agreement. When the company was privatized, the buyers were given a 20-year exclusivity period. Subsequently, the
Government's desire to enter the WTO obligated it to approach the owners of the company to negotiate a reduced exclusivity
period, i.e., to 2003. While the Bank would not want to be seen as intervening in a private dispute between the Government and
the current owners of Lattelekom, assistance is required in helping the Government meet WTO requirements and in preparing to
sell the balance of its shares in the Company. For these tasks, international lawyers and investment bank assistance is needed as
is financing to pay what will be substantial fees.  Under the PSAL program  the Government will present a new
telecommunications law to parliament and issue a mandate for LPA to negotiate an agreement with the private owners. An
international investment bank (and other appropriate specialists, e.g., lawyers) will be hired, using best international procurement
practice acceptable to the Bank, to assist in these negotiations and to sell all, or most, of the State's shareholding. By March
2001, all or substantially all of the state's shareholding would have been sold. At this point, the Government no longer would
have any significant ownership interest or control in or over Lattelekom.
LATVENERGO
Latvia's Governments and population have struggled with the idea of privatizing Latvenergo and are still not fully at ease with it.
The Government has made excellent progress in the technical and analytical areas associated with market liberalization. In
particular, the Government has opened the market to qualified customers, including the right to directly negotiate importation of
electricity. A grid code has been drafted that would form the basis for implementation of Third Party Access to the transmission
and distribution systems, consistent with the Government's Energy Policy approved November 30, 1999. The Government's
Energy Policy also supports the creation of an independent transmission operator, the details of which would be considered in the
context of a common Baltic electricity market. Much remains to be done to successfully implement full market liberalization
consistent with EU policies, but the policy initiatives clearly support this agenda. The Government's commitment to market
liberalization has been evidenced by the commitment to unbundling Latvenergo, drafting a grid code and establishing qualified
customers with access to imported power. The Government has recently taken a first step towards divesting its interest by
announcing its plans to divest 49% of Riga CHP plants I and 2 and privatize Latvenergo's non-core assets. At this time, the
Government has no plans to privatize hydroelectric generation, transmission and distribution. During the next two years of the
PSAL program, the Government is expected to complete the formulation of power sector policy in context of a future Baltic
Power market, to prepare secondary legislation acts and to develop regulations prior to divestiture of Government ownership in
the sector. A reputed international investment bank, engaged using best international procurement practice, will advise on the
basis for partial divestiture.
LATVIA SHIPPING
For Latvia Shipping, the LPA has elaborated and the LPA Board has approved new regulations for privatization, which envision
sales of 44 percent of shares. The Government has agreed that if the current tender for the privatization of Latvia shipping would
not be successful, it would hire a reputed international investment bank/advisor using best commercial practice to redefine the
privatization conditions and prepare a new tender. By March 2001 all or substantially all of the state's shareholding will have
been sold bringing to an end, any significant Government ownership interest or control in or over Latvian Shipping.
LATVIJAS GAZE
For Lalvijas Gaze, which has private sector ownership but a 39 percent holding of Government shares, a sales plan for these
shares has been developed. The Government and the Bank have agreed that if the current privatization process underway would
not be successful, the Bank would be willing to advise on how to proceed with the privatization. The Government has agreed to
use reputed international 'investment bank/advisors' to sell the majority of the State's shareholding in the Company. By March
2001 all or substantially all of the state's shareholding will have been sold. The Government will then no longer have any
significant ownership interest in the Company.
VENTSPILS NAFTA
As for Ventspils Nafta, LPA is considering how the Government's shares might be sold. Again, financial and legal advice is
required and therefore, the Government has agreed that it would be necessary to hire a reputed international 'investment
bank/advisor' to sell the State's shareholding in the Company. The Government will have sold all or substantially all of the
state's shareholding by Board presentation of the second PSAL and as a consequence will have no ownership interest in
Ventspils Nafta.

Letter of Development Policy
February 16, 2000
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Developmnent
1818 H StNW
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
Subject,: ProposedProgrammatic StructurWaAdjustmntLoaw
Letter of Development Policy
Since the declaration of the country's independence, Latvia's Govemment has embarked on a
major economic and social transformation process. A centrally planned model, where the state
was expected to be the engine of growth, was left behind and a market based private sector led
development strategy was adopted. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to raise the living
standards of our citizens through fast and sustainable as well as equitable growth. So far Latvia's
accomplishments have been enormous: we have liberalized prices, privatized basically all state
property, have become a member of the World Trade Organization, enhanced our social safety
net, reached macroeconomic stability and have been invited for negotiations for membership by
the European Union. Building a more efficient and effective public sector is a key pillar of
Latvia's strategy to modernize and strengthen Latvian institutions to facilitate the accession to the
European Union (EU) and to face the challenges of a modern democratic state and a market led
economy.
In spite of the remarkable accomplishments that Latvia has achieved up till now, thcre is a
need to continue and accelerate our reform efforts, especially in the areas that will facilitate EU
accession and that will make the Latvian economy more resilient against adverse shooks such the
Russian Crisis. Therefore, the goals of our reforn program (summarized in this Letter of
Development Policy and the attached Policy Reforms Program matrix) are to help the Latvian
economy to resume growth in a more stable macro-cconomic environment by undertaking
reforms that will not only help Latvia become a full fledge market economy through finalizing its
privatization program but also makc its public sector operate efficient and effective.
Latvia is clearly in the latter stages of transition and therefore our reform program focuses
for the larger part on improving governance of the public sector through a serics of institutional

reforms which are to be taken and implemented over the coming years. We request that the
medium term objectives of this institutional reformn program be supported by the World Bank
through a Programmatic Lending Program (PLP) of three years and financially through the
proposed (first) Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan (PSAL), both described in this letter,
and possible subsequent PSALs under the PLP program andlor other investment and sector loans.
We fully understand that subsequent PSALs as well as the World Bank's possible future lending
program will depend on adcquate progress on this overall reforn program.
A. Returning to a Macroeconomic Framework Conducive for Growth
The Russian Crisis has put our economy temporarily off track as growth has declined, the
fiscal deficit has widened and the current account situation worsened. This will require a macro
economic stabilization program that consists of measures to reduce imbalances in the economy in
the short and medium tcrm, In support of our macro economic stabilization program, we have
reached an agreement with the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 16-month precautionary
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) effective December 1999 for SDR 33 million.
A detailed account of our macro economic stabilization prograrn is provided in a Letter of
Intent and the Memorandum of Economic Policies submitted to the IMF in our request for the
SBA in December 1999. This program focuses on the following measures for 2000: reducing the
consolidatod deficit from about 3.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to about 1.9 percent in 2000; limiting
the growth of domestic assets and safe-guarding the level of net convertible international
reserves, It also puts limits on our ability to hold, contract directly or guarantee external debt of
diffcrent maturities.
To ensure that the economy will recover and from there on remain on a path of sustainable
growth we will update our macro economic program in close collaboration with the staff of the
World Bank and the IMF. We are committed to seeking a firther reduction in our fiscal deficit
while also striving to reduce the overall tax burden. An important factor contributing to the
success of our fiscal program will be the achievements wc will be able to accomplish in the area
of social insurance.
Social insurance expenditures still account for all most one third of the consolidated
gcneral government budget. These expenditures are funded by payroll taxes with high rates and
they significantly contribute to Latvia's high overall tax burden. In 1995, we undertook a
significant step forward by passing several laws that dealt specifically with social insurance. The
pension law, which introduced the first tier of the planned multi-tier pension system, permitted a
rationalization of pension contributions and established a clear link between benefits and
contributions.
One of the goals of the pension reform was to create a financially viable and sustainable
pension system in our country. The measurcs in this area undertaken were showing results during
the early part of 1998 as the first tier was creating a surplus and expenditures as a share of GDP
were falling. However, during the latter part of 1998, the previous government implemented
executive decisions and legislation that reduced the financial sustainability of the system using up
the accumulated reserves. The slowdown of the economy further aggravated the problem. We
have taken action to tackle this issue and have passed legislation that helps to curb the deficits in
the social insurance budget.
However, the passed measures should be benchmarked against the objectives of the
pension reform program. It is imperative that the reforms are fair, encourage work, and are
financially sustainable in the medium-, and long term. To achieve these objectives, we recognize

that it will be necessary to take the following additional measures. First, early retirement will be
curbed. Second, everyone will have the right to work and roceive a pension. In addition, we will
review the equity of several of the transition measures, which provide very high pensions to a few
special cases. Once these amendments have been passed, we will avoid further amendments and
commit to a policy of building up reserves for the obligatibns of the next decade.
Second, we will urge parliament to pass an acceptable second tier law. To assist the
implementation of this law we have prepared an effective strategy to communicate better to our
citizens the rationale of our pension reform agenda.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program, we shall implement the
pension reform plans and we shall strive to have all three tiers of the pension system in place by
the end of the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period.
B. Strengthening the Credibility of the Public Sector
Public accountability and transparency are key elements of our ongoing reform strategy to
ensure that our institutions improve their efficiency in service delivery and strengthen citizen's
trust in our administration. To guide these necessary reforms in the public sector the Government
adopted a strategy to address the specific problems of corruption. In September 1995 Latvia
adopted the law on prevention of corruption and in February 1997, the Government with support
from the World Bank inaugurated its Corruption Prevention Program with a high-level workshop
at which we formulated an approach consisting of prevention, enforccmcnt, and public education.
Anticorruption.  To increase the credibility of our institutions we are committed to
undertake policy and institutional reform to reduce corruption and increase transparency of the
public sector. For this purpose we created, in June of 1999, a permanent sExecutive Secretariat
subordinate to the Corruption Prevention Council (CPC). We recognize that the CPC requires
additional staff and resources to function properly. Therefore, we have appointed an Executive
Head of the Secretariat to the CPC and have endowed the secretariat with adequate staff positions
and resources. To improve the transparency and accountability to the public of CPC, we have put
in place regulation that will allow and force CPC to publish the status of implementation of all
measures identified in the anticorruption program and that will make CPC establish a mechanism
to effectively monitor and report on changes of corruption in our public sector.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period the key results we
expect to achieve in this area include:
>  CPC Secretariat publishes on a quarterly basis the status of implementation of its
Anticorruption Program and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future;
>  CPC publishes on a annual basis a report on changes in corruption in the public sector and
will continue to do so for the foreseeable future;
> CPC coordinates the review of at least two public-sector organizations for their vulnerability
to corruption and their respective scnior managers are to adopt action plans to implement the
recommendations:
> CPC reoaches an agreement within the Government on the procedure to review draft legal acts
with regard to vulnerability to corruption;



16.Feb. 2000 14:41                                                              No.9494   P. 5
Annex 4
Page 4 of 20
>  At least two key draft laws and five key draft regulations are reviewed with regard to
vulnerability to corruption;
>  CPC implements procedures for the public to report on cases of corruption;
> CPC conducts specialized workshops on conftlict of interest for (i) Parliamentarians; (ii)
Ministers; (iii) State Secretaries and Deputy Statc Secretaries; (iv) SRS staff; (v) judges, and
(vi) other important groups.
To be able to state that we have effectively implemented our anticorruption program, have a
process in place for monitoring and reporting to the public on the progress in our anti corruption
campaign, and have increased public awareness on the issue of corruption, we will need to follow
up the above actions with the following measures during the second year of the Programmatic
Lending Program period:
>  CPC reviews at least four additional public-sector organizations for their vulnerability to
corruption and their respective senior managers are to adopt action plans to implement the
recommendations'
>  Draft laws and regulations continue to be routinely reviewed for their vulnerability to
corruption;
)  CPC Jnonitors that satisfactory action is taken on cases of corruption reported by the public.
Conflict of Interest. Within our State Revenue Service (SRS) we have established an
Anticorruption Unit (AU), which is responsible for evaluating declarations of income and assets
of public officials to identify cases of conflict of interest as well as illicit enrichment. The
Government agrees that the procedurcs uscd by the AU were not sufficiently developed to fulfill
this important task. Therefore, the Government has asked the AU and relevant agencies to
develop a set of guidelines to effectively identify conflict of interest and cases of illicit
enrichment. These guidelines consist of forms for declarations of income and assets, a training
manual on how to process and assess the declarations and a manual and training curriculum for
public sector employees that will guide them in situations of conflict of interest. In addition,
these declarations have bcen submitted by key govemment official such as the President of the
State, Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers and parliamcntary secretaries, as well as myself, and
published.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period the key results we expect
to achieve in this area include;
>  Inspectors in the AU are trained in the evaluation of declarations of income and assets;
>  The School of Public Administration trains all new public officials and 20 percent of existing
officials in conflict of interest;
>  Cases of conflict of interest and illicit enrichment are identified and rcsolved in a satisfactory
and inpartial way and a statistical report on cases is published;
>  A system for public officials to report potential conflicts of interest as they arise is developed
and implementedi

Annex 4
Page 5 of 20
To be able to state that we have effectively implemented the corruption prevention law and
have increased the understanding by public officials of the concepts of conflict of interest and
other ethic standards, we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures
during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
>  The School of Public Administration continues training all now public officials and will train
the remaining 80 percent of public officials;
>  A system for auditing public sector bodies for compliance with requirements for identifying
and resolving cases of conflict of interest is developed and implemented.
Judicial Reform. Judicial reform has been high on the government's agenda and the Cabinet
of Ministers has mandated the Ministry of Justice to develop an action plan to consolidate the
judiciary system. Despite our efforts public opinion polls repeatedly rank our judicial institutions
among the most corrupt and inefficient public institutions in the country. To deal with this issue
the Minister of Justice has drafted several instructions. One instruction to provide greater
transparency in communications between judges and litigants in criminal and civil cases. Another
instruction mandating an element of randomization in assignment of judges to handle court cases
where appropriate. A third instruction which requires all court decisions and rulings to be made
public and fourth instruction providing training to judges and prosecutors in new laws prior to
their enactment.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period the key results we expect
to achieve in this area include:
>  The Sacima adopts a new criminal procedures code, which is in conformity with the Council
of Europe standards for streamlined procedures and which eliminates all ex parte contact
between judges and litigants, unless properly recorded;
>  All renovated or new court buildings meet the demands of ex-parte communication reforms;
>  Cabinet of Ministers adopts a regulation institutionalizing publication of all court decisions
and rulings with a system of cumulative indexing;
> Medium term strategic action plan for the reform of the judicial system is adopted,
incorporating actions to: (i) increase efficioncy, (ii) to strngthen incentives, (iii) guarantee
independence, (iv) enhance transparency and openness, and (v) collect feedback from the
public; the action plan is disseminated to the public;
>  The judiciary establishes a system to monitor and report on its perfornance and on public
confidence in the judiciary; baseline statistics are collected and published;
>  An appropriate system of cumulative indexing has been developed;
>  Cases ofjudicial corruption are resolved in a satisfactory and impartial way.
To be able to state that the judicial system operates more efficiently and effectively with less
corruption and with increased public confidence, we will need to follow up the above actions with
the following measures during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period;
> The judiciary publishes, on a quarterly basis, progress in implemcnting the action plan for
judicial reform and such publication is institutionalized;

Public Sector Agencies. During recent years Latvia has followed the example of many other
countries and delegated the execution of policies to autonomous public sector agencies. We are
aware that this was done in an ad-hoc manner and without having a clearly defined institutional
framework of public administration or legislative fmmework for operations of the agencies,
especially financial accountability, in place. To correct for this shortfall in our legislation, the
law on institutional frarnework of public administration and the law on public sector agencies
which have both been developed in close coordination and agreement with the World Bank have
been submitted to Sacima for their enactment. In the meantime, the Cabinet of Ministers has
adopted the measure that imposes a moratorium on the creation of Public Sector Agencies till
Saelma passes the Law on Public Sector Agencies. During the first year of the Programmatic
Lending Program period we expect to reach agreement on action plan to bring all public sector
organizations into conformity with the two laws.
Our objective is to have at the end of the Progrwnmatic Lending period a well defined
institutional framework of public administration with clearly stated acuountability mechanisms
and financial and policy reporting requirements for various types of public institutions that will
lead to improvements in their financial and program performance indicators. To reach this
objective we will need to ensure that most if not all public sector bodies are in conformity with
the two laws during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> All Public Sector Agencies are brought under the Law on Public Sector Agencies;
Openness of Information. To further enhance our citizen's access to public information, we
have adopted regulation for implementation of the law on openness of information which
stipulates more clearly the classification of information and the institutional arrangements for
ensuring our citizen's access to the information. As part of this exercise we have also developed
a system for monitoring implementation of the above regulation and adopted regulations which
will ensure that information on public requests for information is incorporated in the annual
reports of our public sector bodies.
During the first year of the Progrmmnatic Lending Program period th key results we expect
to achieve in this area include:
>  Action plan is adopted to: (i) establish capacity in public-sector bodies to respond to public
requests for information; (ii) report on compliance with the law' and (iii) educate public on
procedures for obtaining Government documents;
>  Significant progress in implementation of the action plan is achieved in all Ministries;
>  A system for mnonitoring implementation of the Law on Openness of Information is being
designed; which includes (i) a mechanism for measuring fulfillment of public requests for
information and (ii) publication of these measures in the annual reports of public sector
bodies;
>  Annual reports of public-sector bodies include information on (i) rights of public to
infornation; (ii) procedures for public to access information; (iii) measures of fulfillment of

public requests for information; inclusion of this information in the annual reports is
institutionalized.
To be able to state that we hive guaranteed easy and simple access to Govemment's
documents through cffective implementation of the law on openness of informnation we will need
to make sure that the above mentioned action plan is fully implemented.
Annual reports of public institutions. The cabinet of Ministers adopted an instruction on
Annual Public Reports and our ministries have prepared and circulated the very first draft of these
annual reports in 1999. For 2000, we are requiring that all public institutions including regulatory
bodies and inspectorates prepare an annual report. To facilitate this purpose we have adopted
clear and simple guidelines for the contents of the annual report by all public institutions.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period the key results we expeet
to achieve in this area include:
> Amendments to Instruction on Public Annual Reports are prepared for adoption by Cabinet of
Ministers by January 2001, to be used in all public institutions including regulators as of
January, 2001;
' Ton regulatory bodies implement reporting requirements, which include regulatory impact
assessments.
) A system for monitoring compliance with reporting requirements is designed.
To further ensure that all public institutions provide reports on their perforrnance to the
citizens of Latvia we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measure during
the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
>- Surveys are conducted by our Development Agency (LDA) and reports published on private
business sector and public's opinion on the performance of various institutions.
Administrative procedures. A koy priority of our reform program in the public sector is to
develop an improved capacity for administrative dispute resolution, We acknowledge that the
current law on administrative procedure should be amended to stipulate better rules for appeal of
administrative decisions and enforcement of administrative decisions. However, as this law
depends on the enactment of the law on Institutional Framework for the public sector, we have
decided to wait with proposing a new Administrative Procedure Law. Therefore, during the first
year of the Programmatic Lending Program we will submit to Saelma the new Administrative
Procedure Law expecting it to pass, Other key results we expect to achieve in this area include:
> Pilots are conducted in three key public sector institutions with the purpose to establish
administrative systems for appeal;
To be able to acclaim that we have effectively implemented the law on administrative
procedure such that it provides a fair franework for relations between a citizen and the statc, wc
will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures which we expect to be able
to complete still within the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> Action plan to bring all public sector in3titutions into compliance with this law is adopted; a
system for monitoring compliannc with this law is designed;

Procedure Law;
>  A system for monitoring compliance with the Administrative Procedure Law is designed; this
system will include publication, on an annual basis, of a statistical report on appeals and
users' satisfaction with the procedures.
C. Strengthening the Public Sector Institutional Capacity
Streamlining the structure of the public sector. We have been working with the World Bank
and recently also with the European Delegation to streamline the structure of the public sector to
increase its efficiency. To facilitate this work program and address the reforms of the public
administration more adequately we have merged the Bureau of Public Administration Reform
(BPAR) with the Secretariat of the Minister of Special Assignments for Public Sector and
Regional Reforms (MoPSR). To ensure that the secretariat successfully can fulfill its mission, it
has prepared a 'blue print' of public administrative reforms. Our 'bleu print' includes clear
assignments of responsibilities for the design and coordination of the specific elements of the
reform program and an allocation of staff and budgetary resources that commensurate with this
assignment. The Secretariat has also designed a mechanism to monitor and report to my Cabinet
of Ministers and the public at large on changes in public sector management performance.
We started the process of public administration reform because we understood that the
functions and structures of our ministries did fully not meet the demands of a market economy.
The BPAR commissioned the devclopment of a methodology for functional and structural
reviews of each ministry. We piloted this methodology successfully in the Ministry of
Agriculture and have now reached agreement on an action plan for the restructuring of the
Ministry of Agriculture and have assigned adequate resources for this purpose. The Secretariat
has been given the task to monitor the implementation of this action plan. We have also started a
functional review at the Ministry of Economy and launched the functional review in the Ministry
of Justicc. In addition, the Secretariat and the Civil Service Administration (CSA) have prepared
a methodology for a census/survey on employment, and functions, which will provide adequate
data for a horizontal review of functions across the whole of Government. We are planning to
undertake this particular exercise soon with support from the European Union.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period key results we expect to
achieve in this area include:
>  The Secrctariat of MoPSR establishes a mechanism to monitor and report on changes in
public sector management and performance by September 2000;
>  The Secretariat of MoPSR publishes, on an annual basis, changes in public sector
management and performance, partly based on Publio Annual Reports by our public entities;
P  The Secretariat of MoPSR publishes starting in the second quarter of 2000, on a quarterly
basis, progress in the implementation of its reform program;
> The Ministry of Agriculture, including bodies is restructured according to the action plan;
>  Secretariat of MoPSR reaches an agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Justice on an
action plan for restructuring the Ministries and the restructuring has startcd;

2000;
>  Secretariat of MoPSR conducts by June 1, 2000 an analysis of the duplication of functions
between mninistries, based on data from the census/survey on employment and functions.
To be able to state that we have reached a situation were we can claim that the structure and
functions of Government meet the demands of a modem market economy and facilitates the EU
accession process, we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures
during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
)  Restructuring of the Ministries of Economy, Justice, Welfare and Transport is completed.
Y  Secretariat of MoPSR reviews the remaining ministries in depth, and agreernent is reached on
action plans for restructuring these ministries.
Incentives for recruitment and retention of staff Currently our pay system heavily depends
on bonuses and management contracts. We are aware that this system does not cnsure
transparency and equitable rewards for equal work. Therefore the Cabinet of Ministers has
agreed to a broad-banded, transparent uniform pay scale, which rewards merit and minimizes
discretionary and ad-hoc bonuses (see Policy Matrix for details). It should be clear to everybody
that this is a major step forward for not only improving the transparency of our government but
also for the proper functioning of it. To be able to analyze the budgetary consequences of the
proposed new pay system, the Ministry of Finance has developed the methodology for a survey of
the existing structure of pay and this methodology will be used during the first year of the
program to collect the information on the existing pay structure.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period other key results we
expect to achieve in this area include:
> A workshop is conducted for state secretaries and deputy state secretaries to discuss the pay
concept:
> Cabinet of Ministers adopts regulations on the pay system in entire public sector, with a
schedule for the gradual introduction of the naw pay scale;
>  The database on public sector employment, pay and functions is established, with regular
procedures for updating the information.
To reach our goal of having a comprehensive pay system for the public sector that provides a
fair, transparent and equitable reword for the work and ensures retention of our high skilled
personnel, we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures during the
second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> Public pay system covers the entire public sector;
>  Statistics are prepared on public sector pay and research is conducted on developments for
private sector pay and its implications for the public sector.

In addition to the abovc measures to irnproec the public scctor pay system as a means to
motivate our high quality workforce, we need to re enforce the pay reformn with a new civil
service law to promote the development of a professional and loyal civil service cadre. The
support these developments the Cabinet of Ministers already in 1998 agreed on a concept on civil
service developments which has resulted with the help of SIMGA/OECD and the World Bank
into a new law on civil service. This now law on civil service has been submitted to Sacima and
has been harmnonized with the pay reform and includes specific guidelines for performance
reviews administered by superiors and confornity with our ethic principles.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period key results we expect to
achieve in this area include:
> Procedure for performance reviews is established;
>  Training of managcrs in conducting performance reviews is conducted;
> Training of civil servants in conflict of interest issues is conductcd,
To claim that we have developed a professional and loyal cadre of civil servants, we will
need to institutionalize the publication of an annual report on the development of the civil sector
during the second year of the Programmatic Loan Program period,
Public expenditure management, Our fiscal policies have been conservative and our fiscal
outcomes have generally been positive. We have made great strides in improving our treasury
system over the years and fiscal discipline has and will be an important policy stance of the
Government of Latvia. We have, however, the intention to improve our fiscal management
procedures further notably in the areas of comprehensiveness, transparency and fungibility of the
budget, the accountability for the use of our budgetary resources, the development of
performance-oriented budgets in line ministries and we have staned to bring a medium term
perspective to the budget. All of this to allow us to better evaluate performance of our institutions
and come to an aliocative process that is more inline with the countries' priorities. In addition,
we have also commenced work to improve financial accounting and reporting procedures for our
local govemments.
To irnprove the comprehensiveness of the budget, we have integrated all financial activities
of current units under the management of ministries receiving financing directly from the state
budget so-called budget financed institutions (BFIs) into the budget and require them to have
their accounts exclusively with our Treasury. To implement this mneasure the MoF has issued
instructions to the agencies as well as to commercial banks that their accounts should be
transferred to the Treasury, To facilitate this process and to be able to monitor the BFIs, the
Treasury has issued regulation for the BFIs financial reporting and the Cabinet of Ministers has
adopted them.
To corne to the situation in which we can conclude that the status and activities of Ill
public institutions are well defined and accounted for, thus reducing arbitrariness in resource
management, we will need to ensure that during the first year of the Programmatic Lending
program the Ministry of Finance has comnplete information on financial resources of all BFIs.
Other intermediate steps necessary to achieve the above are:
M MoF to report status of BFIs having their accounts with the Treasury to Cabinet;
> Cabinet to agree on corrective measures by June 2000;

>  All BFI are brought within Budget based on Treasury's of agencies' accounts;
' As per the budget law for 2001, the budget structure is revised to detail all budgct-
financed institutions' revenue and expenditure. The budget is appropriatcd on that
basis;
>  All institutions under management of ministries report to the Treasury as per the
Treasury regulation. Reporting inforrnation to be to be compiled in Treasury database.
Database augmented with relevant personnel information after census;
> Financial indicators for institutions under the management of ministries are developed;

>  Based on the new Law on Public Sector Agencies, Ministry of Finance prepares an
acticn plan to bring all agencies into conformity with the law on Public Sector
Agencies with respect to financial management, financial reporting and financial
accountability;
> At least 50% of all remaining agencies are brought under the Law on Public Sector
Agencies and procedures are initiated against financially non-performing ones as per
the law on Public Sector Agencies;
> The Cabinet of Ministers has agreed to no new (i) earmarking of taxes and (ii) creation
of own revenue for special budgets;
>  The Cabinet of Ministers has agreed to discuss and adopt Bank recommendations on
tax earmarking.
To claim that all activities of public institutions are well defined and accounted for and a such
reduce the opacity in resource management, we will need to ensure that all public sector agencies
operate within the Law on Public Sector Agencies and we will need to revisit earmarking of
resourmcs based on inputs and agreement with the Bank, taking into account the sector dialogue,
during the second year of the Programmatic Loan Program period.
The Government, including the State Audit Office (SAO) and parliament, intends to make a
major push to strengthen accountability for tho usc of resources as it recognizes that financial
accountability is limited due to the fact that our fiscal accounts are not fully transparent, that wc
lack a Public Accounts Committee in Parliament and could improve our internal controls. To
correct and improve on these issues SAO has recommended to our parliament to set up a Public
Accounts Committee, which we fully support. The SAO has also prepared and adopted an action
plan to strengthen its own functioning as to be able to provide parliament with a full attestation
audit. We understand that it is important to also get financial audit reports of BFIs and therefore,
we are reviewing their 1998 accounts and financial audits. After receiving the results of this
review by the Ministry of Finance, our Cabinet of Ministers plans to evaluate the situation and to
make a decision on the auditing of the accounts of non-audited request audits of BFIs. As part of
the objective to strengthen our acountability for the use of resources, our internal audit
procedures at the Ministry of Finance need to be further strengthened. For this purpose a three-
year strategic plan has been developed and we have started to prepare action plans, based on this
strategic plan, for setting up audit systems in the following line ministries, Finance, Transport,

To reach our goal of an accountable public sector with proper extemal oversight, we will
need to follow up the above actions with the fbllowing measures during the second year of the
Programmatic Lending Program period:
> PAC: (i) reviews audits and provides responses to our executive branch; (ii) reviews
costs of all policy proposals by Saeima. Effectiveness attested by indicators on
number of law proposals and percentage reviewed and this is assessed by PAC

The Government wants to rationalize its procurement management and we have recently
undergone a Country Procurement Assessment Review by the World Bank. We will discuss the
findings and recommendations when the report will become available in early spring and have the
intontion to formulate a strategy to implement the agreed recommendations during the first year
of the Programmatic Lending Program. During the second year, we will enact legislative reforms
to bring Latvian public procurement legislation and secondary regulations more closely into line
with inrternationally-recognized best practice and put in place appropriate organizational
structures, in order to implement the new legislation, as well as to provide leadership in the
improvement of the economy, efficiency and transparency of the public procurement system.
The Government has the intention to further develop performance oriented budgeting in
the line ministries and acknowledges that this is a necessary intermediate stop to bring a
meaningful medium term perspective to the budget. As a first step we will, parallel to the vertical
functional reviews that we are currently undertaking in our line ministries, also undertake public
expenditure reviews (PERs) in these line ministries. These PERs will focus on assessing if
allocations are according to priorities, efficiency and effectiveness of expenditures. W e have
chosen the first two ministries to be the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Justice as
they have just undergone or are in the process of going through a fimctional review.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period key results we expect to
achieve in this area include:
M Methodology and coverage for carrying out PER has been developed, and responsibilities
have been assigned within MoF and line ministries:
>  Public expenditure Review completed in Ministry of Justice and Agriculture, PER submitted
to Cabinet and recommendations adopted;
>  MoA and MoJ develop non-financial performance indicators for agencies and their pilot
assessment conducted and published;
>  Start PER in Ministry of Welfare and Transport in coordination wit their vertical functional
review;
> Develop action plan for strengthening evaluation function of MoF and pilot line ministries;
> Start strategic plans for ministry of agriculture and Justice. Plans should have (i) explicit
objectives for the medium-term; (ii) explicit programs for reaching development objectives;

programs along functional lines; (v) fully costed programs;
> Manual for costing out activities and policies is operational and staff is trained in pilot
ministries in the use of the manual to be attested by external trainers.
To succeed in establishing a clear link between policies and their need for resources as well
as the commitment by the line ministries to deliver the services for which they receive their
budgcts, wc will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures during the
second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
)> Public Expenditure Review has been completed in Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of
Welfare. PER submitted to Cabinet and recommendations adopted;
>  Complete strategic plans in Ministry of Agriculture and Justice
>  Based on reviews of plans for line ministries, Cabinet of ministers adopts aggregate ceilings
for budget 2002; indicative ceilings budget for 2003-2005 that have undertaken a PER;
)>  Strategic planning starts in Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Welfare;
>  Draft law On State Budget for 2002 submitted to Parliament to include the following
additional information: a) indicators of financial indicators of key government agencies, b)
quantitative indicators of key government agencies, c) strategic plan performance assessment
of pilot ministries. This additional inforrnation made available to the public
To enhance our ability to implement and cxecute a mediwn-term budget, the Ministry of
Finance has submitted to Cabinet of Ministers a draft fiscal strategy statement together with a
medium-term macro and fiscal framework. One of the cornerstones to come to a medium term
budget is that policies are costed out not only for the ongoing budget year. They should show
their implications for the budget over a longer time-period. To achieve this we have decided to
change our main regulation on this issue i.e. cabinet regulation 160. The now regulation to be
issued sometime during the summer will require that new policy proposals by line ministries to
Cabinet of Ministers must be accompanied by offsetting measures and that in order for the
proposal to be submitted to Cabinet of Ministers, fiscal costs of these proposals and offsetting
measures must be prepared by line ministries for 3 years. The MoF will have to review the
proposals for technical accuracy of costs.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period key results we expect to
achieve in this area include:
> Cabinet of Ministers adopts and disseminates through the Web fiscal strategy statement; and
a medium-term macro-fiscal framework;
> Revised Cabinet Regulation #160 adopted by Cabinet of Ministers.
To succeed in successfully implementing a medium-term budget for our country that leads
to more predictability of fiscal operations and where the resource allocations reflect our priorities,
we will need to follow up the above actions to ensure that the medium term perspective is
formalized for all sectors during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
Local Government Finances. There is also a need to improve the accountability by local
governments for their finances. To deal with this issue.we have commenced work to develop a

proposal for an integrated financial accounting and reporting procedures for local governments.
These procedures will allow for better accss to infonnation about local government budget
execution as well as their cash and debt management.
We recognize that given our two-tier structure of Government with around S70
municipalitics this will not be an easy exercise and will require the following measures to be
taken during the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> Preparation and publication of local government accounts in line with the new accounting and
debt management procedures;
> Carry out pilot programs for improved accounting and financial reporting systems at seleoctd
municipalities and carry out annual analysis of performance achievements;
> To allow for more stability and predictability in the equalization mechanism, reform the
system of expenditure need calculation, which is currently subject to political manipulation;
>  Promote client surveys and opinion polls and other forms of community feedback as input
into budget and investment decisions.
To be able to claim that we have significantly improved the accountability and information
about budget execution by local governments, we will need to follow up the above actions with
the following measures during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
>  Prepare evaluation of the financial management system and roports on the scope of the
training system (number of staff trained per municipality);
> Publish reports on local government financial situation.
Social Assistance. There is general consensus among the Latvian Government, the UNDP
and the World Bank that our system of distributing social assistance through local governments
does not reach the poor in the proportions that it could and should. Therefore, we are working an
action plan that will spell out a timetable and financing plan to implement a means tested social
assistance benefit system that targets the vcry poor of our society. During the first year of the
Programmatic Lending Program period, we expect to implement this plan in some municipalities
and to design a new monitoring system. In addition we plan to develop an action plan for placing
gatekeeping and referral decisions and financing responsibilities for social care and social
assistance with one level of government is prepared and approved by Cabinet ('Money Follows
the Client').
To be able to come to a national means tested safety net in Latvia, we will need to follow
up the above actions with a household budget survey to evaluation the delivery of services and
improve on the incentive and monitoring systems that facilitate the allocation of social assistance
expenditures during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
D. Rationalizing the Interactions between the Public and Private Sector
Privatization and Regulatory framework We have successfully privatized most state
owned enterprises and are committed to finalize the privatization process within the next 12
months, if not sooner. We want to ensure that the remaining privatizations and divostitures will
takle place in a transparent framework as to establish an image of trustworthiness with the
possible investors and with the international investment community as a whole. Therefore, it is

our objective to move most of the significant remaining commercial state firms to the private
sector by using best commercial practice in privatization. This to promote open markets,
restructuring and industrial growth while fostering the development of stable governance
structures and adhering to fundarnental principals for its regulatory interventions, We are taking
the necessary steps to accomplish this. We have submitted (i) the Law on Public Service
Regulators and the law on Telecommunications to Saeima, (ii) adopted the concepts for market
structures in our electricity and telecommunications sectors and (iii) have established an
interministerial working group that is developing an action plan to strengthen the regulatory
framework and capacity in each sub-sector sector (energy, telecommunications and post and
railway services) and to be prepared for the upcoming changes when the Saeima has adopted the
Law on Public Service Regulators. This as to establish an effective, well-focussed, and flexible
post privatization governance structure that servos the pubtic interest, mimics the market to the
maximum extend possible and clearly stipulatos a preference for market-like policy solutions and
determinations. We fully understand and subscribe to the need to create a transparent and stable
regulatory framework where required to protect the public interest and encourage competition.
We are committed to regulatory stability and welcome direct foreign investments and recognize
that adhering to the above principles will help attract such investments.
During the first year of the Progranmatic Lending Program period, we expect to enhance the
general regulatory environment further by the following key actions;
' Implementation of strengthening of regulatory capacity and transfer in 2001 of all regulatory
responsibilities to the Public Service Regulatory Council;
> Issuance by the Council of a set principles to serve as a transparent basis for its policy
analysis and detenninations;
>  Develop and announce the Council's medium-term regulatory agenda;
E Elaboration and implementation of a technical assistance plan to enhance the Council's
regulatory capacity.
To succeed in establishing an cffctive, market based, well-focused, and flexible post-
privatization governance structure that serves the public intercst, we will need to follow up the
above actions with some sectoral measures which are presented below and the establishment of
the basic elements of accounting regulation during the second year of the Programmatic Lending
Program period.
To be successful with our remaining privatizationfdivestiture program, we must use best
commercial practices (use of reputed international investment banks/advisors and legal firms) to
privatize successfully these important state companies such that informed decisions are taken. To
accomplish this we have made an explicit decision during our Cabinet of Minister's meeting of
January, 25'h 2000 to use reputed international 'investment bankers/advisors for Lattelekom,
Latvenergo, Ventspils Nafta, Latvijas gaze and Latvian Shipping if necessary and as agreed with
the World Bank, and an appropriate budgetary allocation for the Latvian Privatization Agency's
(LPA) 2000 budget that will fund the necessary expenditures to acquire the advice from reputed
international 'investment banks/advisors. We have also made the decision to ensure that the LPA
will use best commercial practice to procure the international 'investmnent banks/advisors.' We
think that this will ensure a transparent and fair process and will greatly assist us with attracting
the necessary quality investors that we want to involve in the development of Latvia.

We provided LPA with a mandate to negotiate the cxclusivity period and related issues
with the current private sector shareholder in Lattelekorn, We have now agreed on and
announced a model of privatization, market structure and timetable for privatization of our energy
company Latvenergo. We are committed to use intemational tender and procurement methods
acceptable to the World Bank in the privatization of Lattelekom, Latvenergo, Latvia Shipping,
Latvijas Gaze and Ventspils Nafta if necessary and as agreed with the World Bank, To clarify
these matters, the Ministry of Economy has in close cooperation with the LPA prepared a plan for
each of the above mentioned companies that spells out when and for what purpose we plan to use
internationaf 'investment banks/advisors' and how these will be procured.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period we are committed to sell
all or substantially all of our state's shareholdings in Latvenergo, Lattelekotn, Latvian Shipping,
Latvias Gaze and Ventspils Nafta. Through this privatization program we will have no longer
any significant ownership interest or control in the above-mentioned firms with the exception of
transmission and hydropower generation which will remain in state control for the time being. In
addition to the enhancements in the general regulatory environment above, we expect to achieve
in the area of energy regulation and market structure harmonization the energy law consistent
with the chosen market model, regulatory framework and EBU and Baltic integration, if necessary.
Our overall objective in the energy sector is to establish a policy and regulatory framework
and market structure that is of coursc consistent with EU directives, Baltic integration and above
all promotes competition. This framework and structure should continue to ensure a smooth
transition to a liberalized eiectricity supply industry consistent with the changing technological
characteristics of the industry in which the government no longer has any significant ownership
interest or control. We will need to follow up the above actiQns with a continued effort to
implement the regulatory action plan in this area. We will also need to establish the basic
elements of accounting regulations in the cnergy sector during the second year of the
Programmatic Lending Program period.
In the telecommunications sector, we will need to conclude the agreement with the strategic
investor in Lattelekom early in 2000. We need to implemcnt the telecommunications law after it
has been approved by Parliament and effectively address the broad principles for dealing with key
issues such as licensing, interconnections and universal service stated in the law and
telecommunications policy on which the Law is based. We also need to bring the regulatory
framework of the telecommunications sector in line with our agreement with the WTO and with
relevant EU directives. Part of this work includes the preparation of an action plan for the
creation of an independent national Telecommunications Regulator (NTR) in compliance with the
Telecommunications Sector Policy (program) adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1998 and
the law to be adopted in 2000 with due account of the up-coming transfer of its statutory
responsibilities to the Public Services Regulatory Council.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period lkey results we expect to
achieve in the area of telecommunications regulation and market structure include:
>  Liberalization of its infrastructure and establishment of competition rules governing (i)
principlcs of transparency, non-discrimination and objectivity, (ii) fair access to bottlenxec1
telecommunications facilities and scares resources and (iii) the terms and conditions of
interconnection between operators;
>  Establishment of methodology for estimating costs that approximates the best practice
methods that are used in OECD countries;

SW Establishment and publication of procedures for deciding what services to regulate and for
setting prices,
>  Definition of universal service and the establishment of a competitively neutral mechanism to
support universal service goals.
During the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period we expect to move
much closer to modem telecommunications market that is responsive to consumer and busincss
needs and the requirements of the global information economy and internet-based commerce and
in which the government no longer has any significant ownership interest or control in or over
Lattelekom. We will need to ensure that the rules, mothodologies and procedures developed in
the first year are implemented, that tariffs are re-balanced and if necessary measures are taken to
support universal service.
Financial Sector Regulation. We have made good progress in strengthening our banking
supervision, but are critically aware that our current regulatory structure does not fully
accommodate the growth of non-bank financial institutions in our country. At the same time we
have taken steps to introduwc a new law establishing an integrated financial regulatory body. For
this agency to be successful, we clearly need to strengthen our capacity to suporvise the non-bank
financial institutions, ensure that that the new agency is independent and that its formation does
not undermine the credibility of our current banking supervision.
To mitigate these risks, we have agreed on the need for an action plan for strengthening
supervision of non-bank financial institutions like pension funds, investment companies, leasing
companies and the securities market, the need to reach agreement on a proposal for the structure,
organization, and operational arrangement for a unified agency and the need to develop also an
action plan that sets out thc change managernent program that covers the arrangements of
transition form the current regulatory structure to the new unified regulatory agency. We expect
to finish this work during the summer and start implementing thesc plans soon after. This change
management plan will incorporate safeguards to ensure that the quality of our banking
supervision does not suffer during this process.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period we expect to start the
implementation of the action plans described in the previous paragraph and to make satisfactory
progrss in strengthening of the non-bank flnancial regulation.
To reach our goal of a robust and efficient financial regulatory regime that has adopted a
seamless approach to financial supervision, we will need to follow up the above actions with the
actual establishment of the unified financial regulatory agency and the continuation of our efforts
to strengthen all aspects of financial regulation. We expect this to materialize during the second
year of the Programmatic Lending Program period.
Business regulation, Our regulatory system contains many of the formal mechanisms that arc
essential for building an effective and transparent regulatory framework that can interact
efficicntly with the business community in Latvia, We recognize the difficulty with evaluating
the regulatory proposals especially for consistency with existing laws and regulations as wcll as
their budgetary impact. To stramnline this prooess the Ministry of Justice has completed a draft
manual for drafting laws and regulations based on good legislative techniques. The Ministry of
Finance has prepared also a draft manual for asscssing the budgetary consequences of the
proposed draft laws and regulations. Further to this the Ministry of Justice has created a uniform
definition and procedure of 'nornative acts' that will ensure that all these acts are being reviewed
by the Ministry of Justice prior to adoption by the Cabinet of Ministers. To make this an

effective mechanism the School of Public Administration has developed a train program for our
staff on how to undertake impact analysis.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period we expect to train relevant
governmcnt staff in cost and benefit analysis and regulatory impact assessment and that the
Ministry of Justice:
?  Evaluates draft laws and regulation based on the standards described in the manual;
) Trains staffs of other agencies in the application of the drafting manual;
) Ensures that Government staff is trained in impact analysis and regulatory impact assessment.
As our goal is that all laws and regulations will go through a thorough impact assessment
before being adopted, we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures
during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> All line ministries implement adequate regulatory impact assessment procedures;
) A computerized database containing all normative acts, with appropriate indexing, is
produced.
To improve the feedback fromn businesses and households with respect to regulation that
effects them the Government has agreed to improve the ability of civil society to monitor this, we
require regulatory bodies to adhere to clear but simple annual reporting requirements that we
recently adopted. We have taken significant steps to improve our business regulation based on
FIAS recommendations to reduce the barriers to foreign as well as domestic investments. To
improve the ftnctioning of state bodies that enforce regulations such as inspectorates, we have
taken action to strengtben their capabilities in assessment of the impact of their regulatory
enforcement actions, our capabilities to monitor their actions and to improve the accountability of
the state bodies that enforce regulation. To be more specific, the Secretariat of the MoPSR has
prepared and the cabinet has adopted the new rules and procodurcs for inspections (see policy
matrix for details). To create ownership under its constituency, a coordination council for
inspectorates with rotating presidency has been set up to help steer the implementation of this
particular reform program. In addition, we have conducted a workshop on inspection reform as to
solicited feedback on the proposed roforms, have selected inspectorates to pilot the new rules and
procedures and prepared a training module for inspectorates on these issues.
During the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program period we expect to draft new
procodures for collection of fines, to begin the irnplementation of the now inspection guidelines in
the remaining inspectorates, design the content of the annual reporting requirements of
inspectorates and discuss them with the relevant inspectorates and implement them in at least 50
percent of our inspectorates. The next year we will review the reporting guidelines
As our goal is to come to an inspetion process that will be clear and accountable and were
the inspected bodies will have a larger voice regarding the mechanisms of the inspection process
and a situation in which the implementation is monitored as to determine whether the impact is as
initially envisaged, we will need to follow up the above actions with the following measures
during the second year of the Programmatic Lending Program period:
> Experience with implcmentation of new rules and procedures in all inspecting agencies is
reviewed;

>  Implement the performance measures and reporting requirements in all inspectorates;
>  Feedback from inspected bodies is used in the performance evaluations of inspectors and
inspectorates;
) Satisfactory action on reported cases of corruption in inspections is taken.
Regulatory coordination is an area, especially in construction, were we can make
improvements as to minimize delay and costs to the private sector. We have recognized this and
set up a working group to advice us on this issue. Our Development Agency has played a pivotal
role in this and has developed recommendations in to deal with this and we plan to implement
these during the first year of the Programmatic Lending Program togother wit the
recommendation to publish reports that among others summarizes fecdback from real estate
developers, architects and building constructors with as goal to improve efficiency of the permit
process limit the prevalence of corruption and to make sure that all parties involved understand
their rights but also their responsibilities.
To end up with a smooth and efficient process of granting construction permits and to have
reached this goal through a participatory process, we will need to follow up the above actions
with the following measures during the second year of the Programmatic Lcnding Program
period:
> Implement all the FIAS recommendations in this area;
> Solicitate feedback from regulated bodies to evaluate performance of regulators;
> Take satisfactory action in reported cases of corruption.

Introducing  regularly  impact  assessment.
Periodic review of key regulations is needed to
determine whether their actual impact on public
welfare meets prior expectations.   Impact
assessment is best conducted after sufficient time
has elapsed for the regulation to have had impact
or when evidence mounts based on feedback
from the implementing organization or from the
public suggesting that the regulation has been
ineffectively implemented or has had unintended
consequences.    A   number  of  different
institutional arrangements can be used to support
impact assessment, including a decentralized
system in which the line ministries are
responsible for regularly assessing the impact of
regulations within their spheres of control.
Introducing reporting requirements for regulatory
bodies. One instrument for introducing greater
transparency in regulation is to require regulatory
bodies to publish annual reports summarizing
their effectiveness during the year. This could be
accomplished by establishing a working group,
consisting  consist  of representatives  from
BPAR/Secretariat, regulatory bodies, Parliament,
and business groups, which would recommend
clear and simple annual reporting requirements
for all regulatory bodies. BPAR/Secretariat could
formalize these requirements, and pilot them in a
small number of regulatory bodies. A plan would
be needed to bring all regulatory bodies into
conformity with these requirements.
Streamlining regulations. The previous sets of
reforms focus on strengthening the regulatory
process. The Government could also advance
reforms in the substance of regulations. One
signal of commitment in this area would be to
resolve problems of regulatory coordination in
one especially difficult, but important area,
construction permits.

some compromise betveen continuity and
independence, on the one side, and responsiveness
to the broad policies of the elected Administration,
on the other. One such compromise would be to
have the regulators serve staggered terms, so that
an incoming Administration could replace them
only gradually-and perhaps with a Chairman
subject to annual appointment or reappointment by
the President. Such appointees should, at the least,
have some fixed tenure, which cannot be
termninated except in case of abuse of authority.

Council seems to enjoy sufficient political
independence so as to provide to potential investors
the needed assurance that their sunk-investments
will not be expropriated. Foreign investors must be
confident in the stability and durability of their
contracts.  The new regulatory system  should
remove the power of setting prices from the
mninistries and place firmly within the Council. The
Council should have the power to set price-caps for
a well-defined period based on clearly articulated
principles of cost recovery and set at remunerative
levels that enable investment to be financed.
Moreover, there will clearly have to be some
mechanism for appeal and dispute resolution over
regulatory decisions. The relationship between the
regulatory agency and the competition authorities
will also need to be clearly defined.
