STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT OF A
FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General
1.01      The rapid economic growth of Korea in the past decade, coupled
with industrialization, has resulted in major developments and changes in
the transport sector: freight and passenger traffic tripled between 1966
and 1976; and results for 1977, the first year of the Fourth Five Year Plan
1977-78 (FFYP), show a continuation of the trend. This rapid growth in
transport demand was accompanied by a greater diversification among modes, as
railways lost their predominant position and road transport and coastal
shipping increased their share.
1.02      Traffic statistics (Tables 1.1 /1 and 1.2) illustrate these
changes over the 1966-76 decade. The rail transport share of freight traffic
fell from 78% of total ton-km to 45%, while road and coastal shipping shares
increased respectively from 12% to 30% and from 10% to 25%. For passenger
traffic, the rail share of total passenger-km fell from 43% to 25% ovet the
decade, while the road share increased correspondingly from 56% to 74%. These
changes very much reflect the economic advantages of the various modes, as
rail and coastal shipping increasingly concentrate on long distances and bulk
commodities, while road transport handles short distance and more diffuse
traffic.
1.03      As Korea's economy continues to grow and diversify, transport
demand will continue to experience a parallel expansion. Internally, the
transport system will have to cope with larger movements of bulk commodi-
ties, such as coal, cement, ores and oil. The industrial complexes being
developed along Korea's south and southeast coast will necessitate the import
of large amounts of raw materials and the transfer of intermediate products
between plants. A more dispersed demand for nonbulk freight and passenger
transport will follow the general increase in GNP.
1.04      Recognizing the necessity for the transport sector to keep up
with the growing economy, the Government's basic policy in the Fourth Five
Year Plan 1977-81 (FFYP) is to develop, the transport system to meet increases
in traffic demand. Among the other objectives stated in the FFYP documents
the most important are: (a) to increase transport efficiency and promote
economic allocation of traffic among modes; (b) to reduce the fiscal burden
imposed on the Government by the railway by increasing rates and improving
its operations; and (c) to favor maintenance expenditures over new investment.
Other lesser objectives are described in detail in the Bank's latest Basic
Economic Report dated February 23, 1977 (Reference Al)./2
/1 Tables are given in Annex 1.
/2 Refers to material in the project file and listed in Annex 2.



- 2 -
1.05      The FFYP investment allocation for the transport sector is
Won 2,780 billion (US$5.7 billion), or 14.6% of total investment. It is
expected that 45% (Won 1,258 billion) will be invested by the public sector
in infrastructure and equipment. The remaining 55% (Won 1,526 billion) will
be invested by the private sector, primarily for road vehicles and ships.
The allocation for transport investment in the Fourth Plan is about 50%
higher in real terms than in the Third Plan (Table 1.3). Forecast transport
demand indicates that the proposed investment should provide for   increases
of about 34 billion passenger-km and 12 billion ton-km, respectively 30% and
180% more than during the Third Plan, thereby justifying the substantially
larger capital allocation. The allocation among modes reflects the increasing
importance of road transport and coastal as well as international shipping;
proposed investments in these modes are, respectively, 47% and 80% above the
Third Plan, while railways are allocated only 25% more than in the previous
plan.
B. The Transport System
Highways
1.06      The present highway system is still inadequate to cope with the
rapid growth of road transport, despite the Government's effort since 1968
to develop a modern road network. Only 58% of the national roads, 8% of
the provincial roads, and 3% of the county roads are paved, and a high level
of investment will continue to be required. The Bank Group has financed
three highway projects, totalling US$191.5 million: Loan 769-KO in 1971
(US$54.5 million), Loan 956-KO in 1974 (US$47 million) and Loan 1203-KO in
1976 (US$90 million) jointly with a Loan by the Saudi Fund for Development.
Performance on these projects generally has been satisfactory. Details on
the subsector are given in Chapter 2.
Railways
1.07      As mentioned above, major structural changes occurred in the trans-
port sector over the last decade: the transport system is now evolving
into a more balanced multi-modal system in which different traffic modes
complement each other according to their technical and economic character-
istics. Cost comparisons indicate that rail transport is still the most
economic means of moving bulk traffic over medium and long distances, and
also has an important role to play in long distance passenger traffic. In
1977, about 77% of rail freight traffic consisted of six bulk commodities,
as against 69% in 1966. In addition to its long distance hauling of bulk
freight and passengers, the Korean National Railroad (KNR) will play a
growing role in providing rapid transit service for Seoul and its suburbs.
1.08      KNR, as a semi-autonomous agency within the Ministry of Transporta-
tion (MOT) operates 3,097 route-km of standard gauge and 47 km of narrow
gauge. About 320 km of single track industrial lines, between the northeast
and Seoul as well as about 100 km of suburban lines in Seoul are electrified.



-3-
KNR employs nearly 40,000 people of which 34,000 are permanent employees.
Staff productivity in terms of traffic units (pass-km plus net ton-km) per
employee is high (700,000 in 1977) compared with other railways; this is due
to the dense urban and inter-city passenger travel and heavy bulk commodity
traffic as well as to the excellent discipline and productivity of the
staff.
1.09      In 1977, KNR carried 47 million tons of freight over an average
distance of some 220 km resulting in 10.5 billion ton-km. Freight traffic
was 8% above 1976. Long distance passenger traffic continued its rapid
growth restarted in 1973, after a few years of diminishing traffic resulting
mainly from the opening of the Seoul-Busan Expressway. In 1977, KNR carried
162 million long distance passengers achieving 14.6 billion passenger-km or
an 18% increase over 1976. KNR earned positive returns until 1971; since
then, its financial situation deteriorated due to sharp inflation which
increased costs substantially while tariffs were maintained at low levels by
Government. Under the Sixth Railway Loan (1542-KO) which was approved in
March 1978, the Government agreed to implement a financial recovery plan for
KNR; its main feature being that in the future, tariff increases will be tied
annually to increases in the wholesale price index. On the basis of the
plan, positive returns should be restored by the end of 1979.
1.10      Since 1962, Bank Group has assisted KNR through six projects
amounting to US$340 million. The first three lending operations have been
satisfactorily completed. Disbursements of the Fourth Railway Project
(Loan 863-KO) are 96% completed, but the Closing Date has been extended to
March 31, 1979, to allow for disbursements for equipment with long delivery
times. The Fifth Railway Loan (1101-KO) made in 1975 for US$100 million is
over 85% disbursed and will be completed by mid 1979. The Sixth Railway Loan
(1542-KO) became effective on August 3, 1978, and bids for about 90% of the
Bank financed items have been obtained.
Ports and Shipping
1.11      Freight traffic through the ports has increased from about 13 mil-
lion tons in 1966 to over 80 million tons in 1976. This tremendous increase
resulted in serious port capacity problems, particularly at Busan, the largest
port, which handles 20% of the country's external trade and is chronically
congested. The Bank has assisted development in Busan through two port
projects totaling US$147 million and ADB is financing the expansion of
Incheon, the port nearest to Seoul. The Saudi Fund for Development partici-
pated in the financing of the first Busan Port Project. The Government has
also proceeded to develop a number of specialized ports in connection with
industrial development. The latter is largely concentrated on the coast:
i.e. Bugpyeong for cement, Pohang for the inputs and output of the steelmill,
Ulsan for refinery and petrochemical, Onsan for a refinery and nonferrous
metal industry, Changwon (engineering) and Samil (Yeosu) for fertilizer and
petrochemicals.
1.12      The role of coastal shipping has greatly increased in the last
decade, from 10% of the ton-km moved in Korea in 1966 to 25% in 1976. This is
mainly due to the construction of industrial complexes on coastal locations,
and, to a lesser extent, to shortages in rail and road capacity. Korea's



- 4 -
share in the merchant shipping of its external trade has been increasing and
reached about 38% of the total tonnage handled in 1976.
Aviation
1.13      Although domestic air passenger traffic grew rapidly until 1973,
it still amounts to less than 1% of total passenger-km; air-freight is also
negligible. Domestic routes are served by the privately-owned Korean Airlines
(KAL), which also operates internationally. Most international traffic is
handled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport; other international airports
are at Busan and at Jeju Island, a major tourist center.
C. Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
1.14      The Government set up in 1970 a Transport Planning Office on the
recommendations of a study by consultants under the Bank Technical Assistance
Project - Transport, Credit S4-KO, and with assistance provided under that
Credit, the First Hilghway Project Loan 769-KO, and the Third Railway Project
Credit 183/Loan 669-KO. Over the past three years, the Government has taken
steps to further improve transport coordination. In 1975, this function was
reorganized by the establishment of a Transport Coordination Committee (TCC)
consisting of nine directors, representing ministries most directly concerned
with transport matters, and a Transport Coordination Office (TCO) in the
Ministry of Transportation (Chart 1-19013)./1 The TCO is headed by a director
general, who also acts as Chairman of the TCC. Its main functions are to
collect data and assist in the formulation and review of transport policies,
especially those related to pricing and regulation.
1.15      While the charter of the TCC includes intermodal coordination of
transport sector investments, the TCC has not in fact exercised this function.
The Economic Planning Board (EPB), which exercises budgetary control and
plays a senior role with regard to all other ministries, has the dominant
role in decision on investment projects. EPB intends to make much more
intensive reviews of investment projects and has established a separate
Bureau of Project Evaluation to this end. Sector studies covering major
aspects of transport coordination have been identified by the sector mission
and are partly financed under the Sixth Railway Loan (1542-KO). They will be
carried out under the supervision of EPB.
1.16      This approach appears much more satisfactory and workable than the
one where investment coordination was to come under one of the ministries,
namely MOT. The role of the TCO should remain to collect basic data in the
sector and assist in the formulation and review of transport policies,
especially those related to pricing and regulation, since MOT is responsible
for licensing and rates and fares setting.
1.17      The Bank should continue to assist the Government in increasing
the capacity of its transport system to cope with the demand resulting from

the continuous rapid development of the country. Since transport infra-
structure is capital-intensive, the Bank can help to ensure through careful
sector review and project preparation that capacity increases are provided at
the least cost to the economy, and that efficient use is made of existing
capacity before increasing it.
2. HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The public road network totals about 80,000 km consisting of
9,400 km of national highways, 10,900 km of provincial roads, 12,500 km of gun
or county roads, and some 47,000 km of village access roads. Among the
latter, about 36,000 km had been constructed and improved under the self-help
Saemaul Movement at the end of 1977. In addition, there are 12,900 km of city
roads which are mostly streets (Table 2.1). The national highways include
about 640 km of grade separated toll expressways, of which about 500 km are
four-lane divided and 140 km are two-lane.
2.02      The road density is generally sufficient to serve transport needs,
particularly as around 70% of the total land area is mountainous, but the
condition of most of the road network is inadequate. Up to 1967 little had
been done to improve the roads. Even the national roads were only about 15%
paved. The remainder were in bad condition, narrow, with poor drainage,
rough gravel surfacing and often badly aligned, with average driving speeds
of around 20-25 kph. Even now only 58% of the national highway system is
paved, and 8% of the provincial roads (compared with about 95% and 20%
respectively in Thailand). Further, the unpaved roads, including those which
are national roads, remain in a poor state. In spite of some improvement in
the maintenance of national roads, average driving speeds on them are still
only in the range of 25-35 kph. There is thus an urgent need to improve the
highway network, particularly through: (i) reconstructing and realigning a
few major trunk routes; (ii) paving virtually all remaining national highways,
and those provincial highways with high traffic volumes; (iii) improving
gravelled and unsurfaced roads, chiefly through instituting an adequate
system of maintaining provincial and gun roads.
B. Traffic and Road Transport Industry
Motor Vehicles
2.03      The motor vehicle fleet in Korea is still small when compared
with other countries of similar and even lower income levels. The 275,000
four wheel road vehicles presently registered in Korea amount to only 7.9 per
1,000 persons (Table 2.1). The ratios are 14.3 in Thailand, 15.4 in the
Philippines, and 48.2 in Malaysia. Only Malaysia has a higher per capita
income than Korea. There are many reasons why Korea's vehicle fleet is
small: the high taxation of private cars, the restrictive licensing of



commercial vehicles (para. 2.10), the high cost of locally manufactured
vehicles (para. 2.06), and the recent development of the road network. Only
15 years ago, Korea had less than 1,000 km of paved roads.
2.04      The vehicle fleet has, however, been growing rapidly.  Growth
averaged 15% p.a. during the First Plan (1962-66), and 20% p.a. during the
Second Plan (1967-71). Growth slowed down during the early years of the
Third Plan due to the economic stabilization policy in 1971-72 and the oil
crisis in 1973-74. Since 1975, however, the growth has accelerated again to
13% in 1976 and 25% in 1977. Of all vehicles, private cars increased the
fastest, almost doubling since 1974. While the growth rates for private cars
are high, 40% in 1977, the actual number is still small. The situation may
be compared to that of Japan 20 years ago, when the income level was similar
to that of Korea today and the number of cars was 2.8 per 1,000 inhabitants
(Korea 3.3 in 1977). Since then, the car population exploded in Japan,
passing from 200,000 in 1958 to about 20 million in 1977 or almost 175 per
1,000 inhabitants. Will Korea follow the Japanese pattern? It will depend
upon the willingness or ability of the Government to keep the current high
level of taxation in line with increasing incomes. Assuming that incomes
continue to rise rapidly, a high level of taxation would be the only way to
check the explosive growth of private cars. The combined pressure of the
public and the car manufacturers may force Government to let the taxation of
private cars erode in relation to incomes.
2.05      In line with the Government's policy of developing a domestic motor
vehicle manufacturing industry, local production has increased rapidly over
the last decade from about 7,000 four wheel vehicles in 1967 to 75,000 in
1977 (Table 2.3). This growth was fostered by restrictive import licensing
and high customs duties on foreign assembled vehicles. As a result, nearly
all motor vehicles are locally assembled, and contain an increasing proportion
of locally manufactured parts. There are four local manufacturing/assembly
plants with joint participation of Korean firms and General Motors, Ford,
Fiat and Honda, but in 1975, Hyundai produced the first 100% Korean car, and
about 10,000 were exported in 1977 to the Middle East, West Africa and Latin
America.
2.06      The industry's capacity is 205,000 four-wheel vehicles/year, still
three times above the 1977 production level. This explains the relatively
high cost of motor vehicles in Korea. However, despite inflation and rising
incomes, car prices have increased little over the last few years reflecting
improved capacity utilization. Forecasts indicate that production will
overtake present capacity in 1980 and reach 330,000 by the end of the FFYP
in 1981 , with export accounting for half of the production.
Road Transport and Traffic
2.07      As mentioned in Chapter 1 (para. 1.02), road transport has grown
rapidly over the last 10 years, not only in absolute terms but also in
relation to other modes, particularly railways. Freight traffic on highways
(ton-km) represents almost one-third of such traffic on all modes versus only
12% in 1966. During both the Second and Third Plan periods, road freight



-7-
traffic grew twice as fast as all freight traffic, averaging 38% p.a. in
1967-71 and 10.5% p.a. in 1972-76. The share of freight traffic by road is
expected to continue increasing in the long term, although probably more
gradually. Comparing again with Japan, the road share of freight transport,
there, increased from 12% in 1955 (Korea's level in 1966) to 36% in 1975.
2.08      Intercity passenger traffic on highways also grew very rapidly, at
16.6% p.a. in 1972-76. As a result, in 1977, two-thirds of the travel was
done by road and one-third by rail, compared to the reverse proportion in
1966. The trend is expected to continue as the railways concentrate more on
their long distance express services. Until the opening of the Seoul subway
in 1974, all urban transport was by road, and road transport will remain
the predominant mode in urban areas.
2.09      Traffic counts on the national highways have been made since 1965
by the Ministry of Construction (MOC), assisted by the provincial authorities
and are now carried out twice a year. Their reliability has been improved,
and they are now used in planning highway improvements. In accordance with
the Agreement for the Second Highway Project (Loan 956-KO), MOC began to count,
record and analyse traffic data on the provincial highway system in 1973. By
1977, there were regular counts at 385 points on the provincial roads,
covering 30% of the system. During negotiations it was agreed that, by the
end of 1980, traffic counting would be extended to the entire provincial
system (para 5.01(a)). In 1977, the Government established 19 permanent
counting points to monitor traffic trends in the country on a continuous
basis. Pending results from these permanent counts, the overall traffic
growth can be related to fuel consumption (Table 2.4). Annual growth rates
were high during the First and Second Plan period 1962-71, but fell off in
the Third Plan 1972-76. This was particularly marked for gasoline following
the oil crisis; consumption in 1975 was one-third lower than in 1973. Rapid
growth resumed in 1976 and 1977.
Road Transport Industry Regulation
2.10      Commercial vehicle licensing has been rather restrictive in Korea.
Restrictions included: (a) issuing licenses only to enterprises having a
minimum of 20 vehicles in cities or 10 in rural counties; (b) imposing quotas
on total numbers of vehicles in each province as well as service areas or
routes;/1 and (c) regulating rates and fares for freight and passenger
traffic. In line with the Loan Agreement for the Second Highway Project,
(Loan 956-KO) the Government has partially relaxed the restrictions above.
2.11      Regarding the minimum number of vehicles necessary to obtain a
license, the requirements were lowered at the county level from 10 to 5
vehicles. Regulations were also amended to allow waiving these requirements,
when deemed necessary, in view of transport demand and applications in
particular areas. All requirements were removed for pick-up truck services,
A   An "area" license authorizes service within a limited area generally the
Province, and a "route" license authorizes service along a given route
between points A and B.



- 8 -
and allowance was made for the licensing of owner-operators of taxis and
"area" trucks. As a result, about 4,000 owner-operator taxis were licensed
in 1977, over 3,000 of which in Seoul. Owner-operators of "area" trucks are
required to join in associations with a minimum of 5 trucks at the county
level. Regarding route and area regulations, "area licensed" trucks are now
allowed to accept cargo for delivery outside of their assigned area thus
competing with route trucking. Regulations concerning buses remain virtually
unchanged. The reason given by Government is that present regulations are
necessary to ensure regular service and safety.
2.12      Presently 772 trucking companies operate in Korea, 740 under "area
licenses" and 32 under "route licenses" (Table 2.5). The number of companies
increased 15% since 1974 while their average size in terms of number of trucks
was reduced from 48 to 45 trucks. Partly because of restrictive licensing,
but also because of the rapid growth and diversification of the manufacturing
sector, the private truck fleet has grown faster than the common carrier fleet
(Table 2.2, page 3). In 1977, the private truck fleet numbered 70,000 versus
42,000 for the common carrier fleet, while in 1967, the common carrier fleet
of 15,000 was almost three times as large as the private fleet. There are
460 bus comp-anies operating almost 22,000 buses, of which half are used for
urban services (Table 2.5).
2.13      MOT is currently reviewing the licensing system with a view to
further relaxation. It will also monitor the effect of allowing owner-
operator taxi and truck operation in regard to insurance policies, accident
claims, levels of services, financial viability and other aspects of their
operations. A time schedule for completing the above analyses was agreed
with Government during negotiation (para. 5.01(b)).
2.14      Consultants reviewed existing regulations on vehicle weights and
dimensions as part of the maintenance study carried out under the First
Highway Project. This showed that the existing legal limits were reasonable,
including a 10-ton single axle load, but that they should be extended to
cover semi-trailers and trailer combinations. A 35-ton limit was proposed
for all vehicles, and a 16-ton limit for tandem axles. The Government
accepted the recommendations and amended the regulations accordingly, ful-
filling an agreement of the Second Highway Loan.
C. Highway Administration
2.15      The responsibilities of national and local authorities for the
various classess of roads are summarized in Table 2.6. National roads are
the responsibility of the MOC (Chart 2-19014), through its Bureau of Public
Roads (BPR) (Chart 3-19015). The MOC delegates to the Korea Highway Corpora-
tion (KHC) (Chart 4-19016) responsibility for those national highways on
which tolls are imposed, including their design, supervision of construction,
and maintenance, as well as administration and toll collection; financing of
the KHC's administration and its road maintenance is through the toll revenues.
Lower standard roads are the responsibility of the local authorities under
the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) (Chart 5-19017). These roads include



- 9 -
provincial, under the nine Provincial Construction Bureaus (PCB) (Chart
6-19018), and city and county roads under the City and County (Gun) Construc-
tion Sections (CCS) (Chart 7-19019). In addition to its responsibility for
national roads, the MOC advises the Government on policy concerning other
roads.
2.16      The organization of the MOC, including its BPR, is satisfactory for
carrying out all its functions in regard to national highways, subject to
adequate budgetary provision being made for maintenance (paras. 2.31 and 2.32).
The MOC organization has evolved with the aid of technical assistance and
financing provided by the Bank. Technical assistance for setting up the BPR,
and for its initial operations, was financed during 1968-1971 under Credit
S4-KO, (which was incorporated into the First Highway Project, Loan 769-KO,
in 1971). Further technical assistance for setting up the MOC's field
organization for maintaining national highways and for procuring maintenance
equipment, was provided under the First and Second Highway Projects, Loans
769-KO and 956-KO, during the period 1971-1976. The Bank financed projects
have also included training partly through overseas courses, but mainly
through attachment of counterpart staff to consultants for the various
studies carried out under all the highway projects and covering road mainte-
nance, planning, feasibility studies, design and construction supervision.
2.17      The Korea Highway Corporation (KHC) was set up by the Government in
January 1969 to operate and maintain toll highways and, -where so required by
the Government, to supervise the construction of further highways, mostly
intended also to be operated with tolls. The KEC is semi-autonomous, with
its own Board of Directors, Budget and is self-accounting, but is subject
to the general direction of the Minister of Construction. The KHC presently
operates 1,020 km of toll highways (Seoul-Incheon, Seoul-Busan, Suweon-Woeonju-
Saemal, and Daejon-Gwangju-Masan-Busan). It supervised construction of the
last two highways, and of a further 215 km of highways which are toll free,
but are maintained by KHC (Saemal-Gangreung-Mugho, and Daegu-Masan). Its
Articles of Association also permit KRC to finance construction, though it
has not so far done so. In accordance with the Loan Agreement for the Third
Highway Project (Loan 1203-KO), the Government prepared and sent to the Bank
for comment a policy statement, based on a report prepared by consultants, on
the Government's toll road system and the KHC. The policy statement sets out
the limitations and Government controls under which the KHC operates. Firstly,
before designating any road as a toll road, the Government requires a study
to be carried out to determine the economic and financial implications and to
establish an operating system, and levels of tolls, which will limit economic
losses through diversion of traffic. This normally means an "open" system of
toll collection with a limited number of toll collection gates on the highway
itself, and unrestricted access at all intersections with public roads,
rather than a "closed" system where toll gates are set up at all points of
access which are usually restricted in number. The levels of tolls are
subject to review by the EPB and agreement by the Government. After review
of studies completed by KHC in October 1978, the Bank accepted the Govern-
ment's proposal to impose tolls on the Saemal-Gangreung and Daegu-Masan
roads from January 1979. The KHC is technically competent, the roads in its
care are well maintained, and it has ample financial resources through the
tolls collected.



- 10 -
2.18      The provinces through their Provincial Construction Bureaus (PCB)
are responsible for planning, construction, maintenance and administration of
the provincial roads and counties (Guns) and cities are similarly responsi-
ble for local roads. However, the provinces and counties have severe limita-
tions in their organizations, staffing, equipment and financing. Most of
the planning and major construction and improvement of provincial roads has
so far been handled by MOC, which is presently carrying out a study of the
provincial roads system (as well as the national road system) under the Third
Highway Project, Loan 1203-KO. So far, development of the county road system
has been limited mainly to minor improvements. Maintenance of provincial and
county roads is generally poor.  The MOHA has general responsibility for
control and direction of the provincial and local authorities, but presently
does not have any organization within the ministry to deal specifically with
works. Improvement of the organization, staffing, equipment and financing of
the provincial and local authority works organizations is needed, with particular
priority for improving road maintenance. To formulate an action program for
such improvements; a study is included in this project (paras. 3.07 and 3.08).
D. Staff and Training
2.19      As noted in para. 2.16, the MOC/BPR was reorganized, and its staff
trained with assistance provided under previous Bank financed highway projects,
including the training of 11 of the staff in oversees institutions. However,
during the last two years there has been a severe loss of staff chiefly to
the Korean construction industry which has been enjoying boom conditions,
including a vast amount of construction overseas. The MOC lost nearly
50% of its engineering staff while the Planning Division of the BPR lost over
80% of its staff. However, the MOC has taken vigorous action to recruit new
staff and the present deficiencies are only about 15% in numbers. The
large influx of inexperienced staff is naturally causing some problems, and
placing a burden on the remaining staff, but commendable progress is being
made in absorbing the recruits. To assist in replacing the losses of more
senior and highly trained staff, further assistance is being provided under
this project for overseas training of further staff members of the MOC
(para. 3.09). The staffing and training needs of the provinces and local
authorities will be established through the study of organization and main-
tenance for provincial and county roads (para. 2.18).
E. Highway Planning and Financing
2.20      Planning of the national system is the responsibility of the MOC
and is carried out by the Planning Division of the BPR. The Division
carries out traffic surveys and maintains an inventory of national highways.
The BPR drafts the Five-Year Development Programs and Annual Budgets for
development. The drafts are reviewed by the MOC and revised in consultation
with the EPB and Ministry of Finance (MOF) and finally incorporated into the
National Five-Year Economic Development Plans and Annual Budgets. In review-
ing the drafts, the aim is to make the programs consistent with the national



- ii -
development and financial targets established by the EPB and the MOF. The
BPR is also responsible for giving technical advice on all highway matters
to the Government, including the MOHA and the provinces; it reviews proposals
originating from these bodies for road improvements and grants for maintenance.
The Planning Division of the BPR is now competent to carry out feasibility
studies for road projects. However, over the last two years staff turnover
of the Division was over 80% due to the high demand and attractive salaries
of the private sector and new staff will have to be trained (paras. 2.19 and
3.09).
2.21      Planning of provincial roads is the responsibility of the provinces,
and city and county roads are planned by the local authorities concerned;
these local governments are under the jurisdiction of MOHA particularly
regarding budgetary matters. Planning at this level has been minimal and
largely on an ad hoc and political basis, except for the few provincial roads
on which major improvements have been carried out by the MOC. This was
acceptable since little other investment has been made in provincial roads
and even less in gun roads. The Government has so far given priority to the
improvement and paving of the national road system needed to carry the very
rapid increase in traffic resulting from, and needed to support, sustained
strong economic growth (paras. 1.02 and 2.07). Improvement and paving of the
national system is now well underway. About 60% has been paved and the
Government aims to have nearly 90% paved by 1982. The emphasis is gradually
shifting to the development of provincial roads and gun roads, and adequate
planning for these roads is thus becoming more important. A study of the
needs and priorities for the upgrading and improvement of the provincial road
network, financed under the Third Project (Loan 1203-KO), is already underway,
under the management of MOC. This proposed project includes a study for the
maintenance of provincial and gun roads and for the improvement of gun roads.
The study will include recommendations for improving the organizations
concerned with provincial and gun roads and their planning, design, administra-
tion, maintenance and financing (paras. 3.07 and 3.08).
2.22      Road expenditures during the FFYP 1977-81 are planned to total
W 458 billion at 1975 prices or about US$940 million equivalent. Actual
expenditures during the First, Second and Third Plans are given in Table 2.7.
Since they are five-year totals of current annual expenditures, they are not
directly comparable with the FFYP total expressed in constant 1975 prices.
However, a reasonable assumption on the yearly distribution of expenditures
combined with adjustment for variations in the wholesale price index indicates
that road expenditures totalled about W 300 billion in 1967-71 and some
W 350 billion in 1972-76 both in constant 1975 prices. The current plan thus
represents a 30% increase in real terms over the previous one. This appears
reasonable in view of traffic forecasts indicating a 70% increase in both
freight ton-km and passenger-km transport by road during the FFYP.
2.23      Proposed road expenditures in the FFYP still reflect the Govern-
ment's priority of completing the improvements of the basic national road
system (Table 2.8). However, the share of national roads expenditures
in the total is gradually being reduced. It is planned at about 65% in
the FFYP versus 74% and 72%, respectively, in the Second and Third Plans.



- 12 -
The share of maintenance was also planned to increase for national roads, as
the new maintenance organization became fully operational in 1976. Mainten-
ance expenditures on national roads were planned to take 20% of total expendi-
tures on these roads versus only 2% and 6%, respectively, in the Second and
Third Plans. However, budgetary allocations to MOC for maintenance in 1977
and 1978 have fallen short of the planned amounts (para. 2.32). In 1977,
maintenance expenditures amounted to less than 10% of total expenditures on
national roads.
2.24      Total road expenditures in 1977 (Table 2.9) amounted to W 146 bil-
lion (US$300 million) excluding W 69 billion spent by the special cities
of Seoul and Busan. This amount exceeded the planned amount by about 50% in
real terms. As maintenance expenditures were smaller than planned, all the
increase went to construction.
2.25      Expenditures on roads have been much lower than revenues from road
user charges during the Third Plan period when 1972-76 revenues totalled
W 610 billion or US$1,260 million (Table 2.10) and road expenditures W 270 bil-
lion (excluding Seoul special city). In 1977, revenues reached W 203 billion
versus expenditures of W 158 billion, excluding Seoul and W 215 billion when
Seoul is included. The tax structure was substantially modified on July 1, 1977,
with the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) replacing various other
taxes on fuel as well as on vehicles. Excluding VAT, which affects equally
all sectors in Korea, road user charges revenues are expected to be down to
W 170 billion in 1978. Taxation is particularly high on private cars, the
main taxes being on acquisition, about 30% of the value added, and on owner-
ship, with the yearly tax around W 200,000 (US$410) for a small car. Taxes
on gasoline, excluding VAT, are around 200%. Taxes on commercial vehicles
are more moderate, amounting to about 10% of total operating costs for trucks
and buses; taxes on diesel fuel, excluding VAT are only 25%.
F. Engineering
2.26      The MOC, through its BPR, has overall responsibility for the
design of national roads, including toll highways. It has established
standards for national roads and for other government financed road works and
for reviewing proposals submitted by provinces and local authorities. Design
standards established for national, provincial and county (gun) roads, are
shown in Table 2.11. They are reasonable for national roads and also for a
substantial number of provincial roads, a few county roads where traffic
levels are likely to justify paving within the period of about 10 years.
However, the present standards for provincial and country roads will be
reviewed during the study of such roads under this project, and consideration
given to establishing possible further standards for roads carrying lower
traffic volumes.
2.27      The BPR does not itself have staff for carrying out detailed
engineering. This is undertaken usually through the MOC's Territorial
Construction and Management Offices (TCMO) for smaller works, but consultants
are usually employed for design of major construction projects. Supervision
of construction is also carried out by the TCMO's with the assistance of



- 13 -
consultants on major projects. The provinces, through their PCBs are normally
responsible for design of provincial roads. However, in practice, most major
improvements of provincial roads have so far been designed under the direction
of MOC, mainly employing consultants. The counties (guns) are similarly
responsible for county roads, but little substantial construction of such
roads has so far been carried out. The provinces, and to a lesser extent,
the counties, have some engineering staff but their capacity to design and
supervise construction works is limited; as far as roads are concerned, they
are chiefly employed in carrying out the currently inadequate level of
maintenance works.
2.28      Korea now has many firms of consulting engineers, including about
30 firms handling civil works. Most of the firms are rather small, and some
are specialized, for example, in laboratory testing. However, the ability,
range of experience, and capacity of a number of the firms have increased
markedly in the last few years. Partly this has been fostered by their
association with foreign firms, including those employed on previous Bank-
financed projects. The position has now been reached where foreign firms
supply only a nucleus of key staff chiefly to assist the MOC in overall
management and coordination of studies, with particular reference to identify-
ing alternatives and carrying out economic analyses, for which the Korean
firms so far have limited capability. After the feasibility studies have
been completed, and alignments, standards, etc., selected, the detail engineer-
ing is carried out almost entirely by local firms. Participation of foreign
firms is limited at that stage, and for supervision of construction, to
overall management and assistance with special problems.
G. Construction
2.29      The Government's policy has long been to carry out construction
through contracts awarded after competitive bidding. Only minor improvements
for small-scale local works such as those carried out through the Saemaul
village self-help program are undertaken by force account. This Government
policy, together with a large and growing volume of construction works in
Korea, has fostered the growth of a large, efficient and flourishing contracting
industry. There are over 500 construction companies handling civil engineering
and building construction. Of these, 45 firms are qualified to undertake
projects exceeding $10 million, 115 firms projects up to $10 million and
185 firms projects up to $5 million. Furthermore, the industry has expanded
rapidly in its overseas activities, where it has been equally successful.
Korean contractors completed overseas work totalling about US$3.5 billion
during 1977 and the amount may be even greater in 1978. At the same time the
industry is successfully carrying out a very large volume of public works,
and of industrial and housing development in Korea. Although many projects
in Korea are open to international competition, and some foreign firms have
prequalified for bidding, they have not been successful in obtaining work in
the face of strong domestic competition. The successful development of
the Korean contracting industry might serve as a model for a number of other
countries.



- 14 -
2.30      Contractors are left to choose their own construction methods,
subject to meeting performance specifications. This policy, in conjunction
with a strong entrepreneural drive, a competitive and generally undistorted
market, and a steadily growing demand, has resulted in efficient construction
methods and balance of equipment and labor. Contractors are able to obtain
imported equipment, and local production and assembly of construction equipment
is now evolving. Because of the rapid expansion of construction work, there
have been some instances of temporary shortages of materials, such as cement
in 1977. However, the major expansion of the local cement manufacturing
industry has overtaken the shortage.
H. Maintenance
2.31      The MOC has set up a satisfactory organization for maintaining
national roads (para. 2.16) but the budgetary allocation has so far been
insufficient. It has therefore in effect been possible to carry out only
routine maintenence but not periodic maintenance, particularly of paved
roads, of which there is a large and growing backlog of'work. The KHC is
satisfactorily maintaining the toll roads (para. 2.17); financing is from
tolls and expenditure is at about three times the MOC rate per km of road
with equivalent construction and traffic. Maintenance of provincial and
county (gun) roads is not satisfactory (para. 2.18).
2.32      The MOC field organization for maintaining national roads was set
up with technical assistance and equipment financed under the First Highway
project in a pilot province in 1972, and for the remainder of the country
financed under the Second Highway project, in 1975-76, and in accordance with
an agreed time schedule as modified under the Third Highway project. Experi-
ence has shown that to further increase efficiency of MOC's routine main-
tenance operations, some additional equipment is required, which will be
financed under this project (para. 3.06). However, the Government has so far
provided only about half the budget funds needed to carry out an adequate
program of maintenance recommended by consultants in their study of main-
tenance of national roads. The recommended program of maintenance was agreed
by the Government and confirmed in a supplemental letter to the Third Highway
project, including target annual budgetary provisions through 1979, but the
budgetary provisions for maintenance during 1977, the first full year of
operation, and 1978, have been only about half the target figures, when
adjusted to current prices. The actual allocations, and adjusted target
forecasts (excluding equipment depreciation) were: for 1977 W 6.1 billion
and W 13.3 billion; for 1978 W 7.9 billion and W 15.9 billion. The deficiency
has been brought to the notice of the Government during missions and a number
of times in correspondence.
2.33      During negotiations, the Government provided details of its budgetary
provision for maintenance of national roads during 1979 totaling Won 15.4 bil-
lion and estimates of funds required for each of the years 1980 through
1983. They indicate that the estimated annual provision for 1979 agreed
under the Third Highway Project would (at constant prices) be reached in



- 15 -
1980. The estimated amounts should enable the national highway system to be
brought to an adequate level of maintenance over the five-year period and are
considered acceptable. The amounts are expressed in constant (estimated mid-
1979) prices and will require adjustment annually to take account of changes
in prices. The budgeted amount for 1979, and estimates for 1Q80 through 1983
are:
(Won billion) /a
1979    1980    1981    1982    1983

force account)

prices, including costs of operation , repair and replacement of
equipment (which is predominantly used on routine maintenance),
but excluding costs of special highway police patrols.
/b Includes procurement of additional maintenance equipment under the
project of W 1.0 billion in 1980 and W 0.85 billion in 1981.
2.34      Now that the organization for national road maintenance is satis-
factory, attention should be given to improving maintenance of the provincial
and county (gun) roads. The present organization, staffing, equipment and
financing for these roads, including their maintenance, is inadequate at
national, provincial and county levels (para. 2.18). The needs, and a program
and time schedule for improvement, will be formulated under the study included
in this project (para. 3.07).
I. Previous Bank Financed Highway Projects
2.35      The three previous Bank financed highway projects (para 1.06) have
had a major impact in assisting the Government with the construction and
improvement of its national road system, with institution building in MOC,
and with formulating revised policies affecting the whole transport sector.
Assistance with institution building was given for setting up the BPR, and
the MOC's field oganization for maintaining national highways, and for



- 16 -
improving the MOC's road planning. The technical assistance also extended to
helping to set up a Transport Coordination Office in MOT. Significant policy
changes which were evolved through the highway projects include the adoption
of more appropriate road standards, relaxation of restrictive licencing
of the road transport industry, revision of regulations governing vehicle
weights and dimensions, and a modified Government policy on toll roads. A
major advance is the introduction of a satisfactory organization for maintain-
ing national roads, which should be fully effective when it receives adequate
budgetary provision. Indirectly, the three highway projects have helped
promote the Korean contracting industry through a steady and gradually
increasing stream of contracts, and Korean consulting firms through their
association with foreign consultants on the design of the projects.
2.36      In view of the major advances in the Government institutions and
policies concerned with national roads, and subject to adequate future
budgetary provision for their maintenance, there will be no serious institu-
tional impediment to adopting sector lending as far as national roads are
concerned. However, in regard to provincial and county (gun) roads, which
will absorb an increasing proportion of investment in the road subsector,
institutional improvements are required, particularly in regard to road
maintenance. This project will include studies of the institutions concerned
with provincial and county roads, and their financing. This will prepare
an action program for introducing the improvements found to be needed.
However, pending substantial progress being made, which may take several
years, this project must be considered as in a transition period towards
sector lending.
3. THE PROJECT
A. Background and Objectives
3.01       The Government's Fourth Five Year Plan (FFYP) 1977-81 aims to have
nearly 90% of the national road system paved, and to begin to give greater
emphasis to improvement of provincial roads (para. 2.21). In addition, it is
intended to prepare a program for improving the maintenance of provincial and
county (gun) roads, and to initiate planning for county roads and prepare a
future project for their improvement. The Government also aims to further
strengthen the MOCs capability for maintaining national roads, and to
train further staff to replace losses. The object of the project is to
assist the Government to achieve all these aims, concerning the entire road
subsector, and is a logical extension of the previous three highway projects.
B. Description
3.02      The project consists of:



- 17 -
(a)  construction and improvement, including paving, and supervision
by consultants, of 36 sections of national roads totalling about
950 km;
(b)  construction and improvement, including paving, and supervision
by consultants, of 10 sections of provincial roads totalling about
280 km;
(c)  procurement of additional road maintenance equipment for maintaining
national roads;
(d)  a study by consultants of provincial and county (gun) road planning,
construction, maintenance, administration and financing, and of
the institutions involved, and of gun road development to prepare
an investment program, followed by further feasibility studies and
detailed engineering of about 2,000 km; and
(e) provision of fellowships for training staff of the Government.
(a) Construction and Improvement, Including Paving, of National Roads
3.03      Thirty-six sections of national roads, totalling about 950 km, will
be constructed and improved, including bituminous paving, generally following
their present alignments, but with improvement of curves and widening of the
roadway and shoulders, and the provision of adequate drainage. However, in a
few cases realignment will be undertaken of continuous lengths up to a max-
imum of about 10 km where justified by shortening of the route length or
to by-pass congested sections through villages. The roads, and their design
standards, related to traffic volumes in accordance with Table 2.11, are
listed in Table 3.1 and are described in more detail in Working Paper C-1, on
the Project File. Their locations are indicated on the Map. All will have
2-lane pavements except for two sections of 4-lane pavement 4 km and 23 km
long. The widths will vary, according to traffic volumes, with the 2-lane
pavements between 6.20 m and 7.20 m wide and shoulders between 0.55 m and
1.90 m. Design speeds will vary according to terrain, normally between
40 km/h and 80 km/h. Maximum gradients will normally be below 7%, though
some short sections in mountainous areas are up to 9%. Pavements will be of
asphalt concrete and shoulders normally of gravel. New bridges will be
constructed where necessary for reasons of alignment, hydraulic capacity,
width, or structural strength.
(b) Construction and Improvement, Including Paving, of Provincial Roads
3.04      Ten sections of provincial roads, totalling about 280 km, will be
constructed or improved, including 2-lane bituminous paving. The roads, and
their design standards, related to volumes in accordance with Tables 2.11 and
4.1 are shown in Table 3.1 and they are described in more detail in Working
Paper C-1. Widths and gradients are similar to national roads for equivalent
traffic, but design speeds are usually slightly lower.



- 18 -
3.05      Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for items (a) and (b)
above, have been completed under the Second Highway Project (Loan 956-Ko) on
33 of the 36 sections of national roads included in the project (880 km out of
952 km) and on four of the ten provincial roads in the project (107 km out of
282 km), altogether 80% of the total length of the project roads. The feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering were carried out by US consultants
Louis Berger International, in association with eight Korean consulting firms,
between August 1975 and early 1978. The same firms carried out, in early
1978, a preliminary engineering and economic analysis on the remaining nine
road sections and they are now carrying out detailed engineering and will
prepare updated cost estimates and economic analyses, expected to be completed
in early 1979. Copies of the bid documents and updated cost estimates and
economic analyses for these nine road sections will be sent to the Bank for
agreement before bids are invited; this was confirmed during negotiations.
(c) Provision of Additional Road Maintenance Equipment
for Maintaining National Roads
3.06      Additional items of equipment will be procured, which have been
found necessary for the MOC's field organization for maintaining national
roads. It consists mainly of additional trucks, loaders, asphalt mixing and
compaction equipment and some specialized equipment for bridge repairs, snow
removal, and some additional stocks of spare parts. This equipment will
complement that previously provided under the First and Second Highway
Projects (para. 2.32).
(d) Study of Provincial and County (Gun) Road Maintenance and Institutions,
and of Gun Road-Development
3.07      The project includes a study of:  (i) the institutions at national,
provincial and county (Gun) levels concerned with planning, design, mainte-
nance, construction and administration of provincial and gun roads, and of
their financing; and (ii) development of the gun road system. Part (i) of
the study will lead to proposals for the improvement of the institutions,
including any reorganization found necessary, and for the improvement of
provincial and gun road maintenance, together with cost estimates and a
program and time schedule for implementation. Part (ii) of the study will
lead to preparation of an outline tentative long-range program for improving
gun roads, a five-year program of improvements of about 5,000 km of gun roads
for inclusion in the Fifth Five-Year Plan, 1982-86, and after review and
selection by the Government in agreement with the Bank, detailed preparation
of a selected 2,000 km for improvement under a future project. Draft Terms
of Reference covering these subjects were prepared by the appraisal mission.
However, difficulty was encountered in having the Government review these,
and decide on the arrangements for managing and executing the studies, since
the MOHA presently lacks an organization to deal with works institutions and
programs (para. 2.18).



19 -
3.08      The Government later confirmed that MOHA will be responsible for the
studies and agreed to the Terms of Reference subject to minor changes which
have been accepted by the Bank. During negotiations, the Government defined
the arrangements to be made for management of the studies. These include
proposals to create a new Local Road Section in the Local Development Bureau
of the MOHA, with four engineers who will constitute the Government's counter-
part staff for the studies and will participate in the Government's review of
the findings and the formulation and implementation of action programs. Under-
standing was reached on the proposed arrangements, including a time schedule
for setting up the Local Road Section and for appointing consultants and
carrying out the studies (para 5.01(d)).
(e) Provision of Fellowships for Training Staff of the MOC
3.09      The project includes fellowships for a further nine staff members
of the Government for overseas training for periods of up to one year in
transportation economics and project evaluation, and in highway engineering,
with particular reference to maintenance (para. 2.19).
C. Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component
3.10      The cost of the project, including contingency allowances, is esti-
mated at about US$378 million. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at about US$143 million equivalent, or about 38%. The estimated costs are
shown in Table 3.2, and are summarized below. The estimated average costs
per km, excluding contingency allowances (including contingency allowances
shown in parentheses) are: (a) for improvement and paving of roads, US$208,000
(US$263,000); (b) for supervision by consultants, US$2,200 (US$2,600); and
(c) for studies and detailed engineering by consultants for improvement of
gun roads, US$2,000 (US$2,400). The estimated costs per man-month, excluding
contingency allowances, for the small nucleus of key staff provided by foreign
consultants (paras. 2.28 and 3.13), excluding foreign and local travel and
local subsistence allowances, for supervision of construction (about 90 mm)
and the study of provincial and gun roads (about 50 mm) are US$7,500; including
foreign and local travel and local subsistence allowances the costs per man
month are US$9,700. The estimated costs for Korean consultants (about 600 mm
excluding the detailed engineering of gun roads) excluding costs of travel
and allowances are US$3,100 and including travel and allowances are US$3,600.

- 21 -
3.11      Cost estimates for construction and improvement, including paving,
of 33 of the 36 sections of national roads, and of 4 of the 10 sections
of provincial roads, were prepared by the consultants, Louis Berger Interna-
tional, in association with the eight firms of Korean consultants, after
completing detailed engineering (para. 3.05), using unit prices for similar
work obtained from competitive bidding on the Third Highway Project in early
1976, adjusted to cover increases in costs estimated to early 1979, when bids
are expected to be invited. Cost estimates for the remaining three sections
of national roads and six sections of provincial roads have been prepared by
the same consultants on the basis of engineering reconnaissance and estimated
approximate quantities of work and similar unit prices as for the other roads.
Although detailed engineering has not yet been completed for 9 of the 46 sec-
tions of road, the cost estimates are considered satisfactory in view of: (a)
the Government's and consultants' record of good estimating on previous pro-
jects; (b) only 20% of the roads not yet having detailed engineering completed;
and (c) the engineering reconnaissance carried out on the remaining nine
sections, together with the general similarity of the work to be undertaken.
As noted in para 3.05, detailed engineering and final cost estimates for
these 9 sections will be sent to the Bank before bids are invited.
3.12      The cost estimates for procurement of road maintenance equipment
have been prepared by the MOC on the basis of additional needs assessed after
about two year's experience since extending the MOC maintenance organization
for national roads to the entire country, and on prices for units of equipment
based on those received through international bidding on the equipment obtained
under the Second Highway Project in 1975-76, updated to present estimated
costs.
3.13      The cost estimates for consultants' services for supervision of
construction and improvement, for the studies of provincial and gun roads,
followed by detailed engineering of gun roads for future projects, are based
on previous contracts with consultants for similar work, taking into account
the revised mix of foreign and local firms and numbers of staff, and with
costs updated to cover increases estimated to early 1979. The estimated
costs of the consultants for supervision are unusually low as a proportion of
the cost of construction, but this is because: (a) their services are only
to assist the MOC, which is itself supplying most of the site supervisory
staff for the contracts; and (b) most of the consultants' staff will be
supplied by local consulting firms, with only a small nucleus of foreign staff.
The scales of supervisory staff to be provided by both the consultants and
the MOC were further reviewed and confirmed during negotiations. It was also
confirmed during negotiations that the Government will employ consultants for
supervision before awarding any works contracts.
3.14      Contingency allowances include 10% for physical quantities for work
to be carried out, and for equipment and spare parts to be procured, and for
price escalation at average annual rates of 7 1/2% in 1979 and 7% during each
year thereafter, for both local and foreign costs. The cost estimates and
contingency allowances are considered reasonable, and were reviewed and
confirmed during loan negotiations.



- 22 -
3.15      The foreign exchange component of road construction and improvement,
including paving, has been estimated by the consultants at about 53% when
carried out by foreign contractors and about 42% when carried out by Korean
contractors. Since all contracts on the First, Second and Third Highway
Projects have been won by local firms, it is assumed that all contracts under
this project will also be won by Korean contractors and the foreign exchange
component for construction and improvement, including paving, has therefore
been calculated at 42%. This is slightly lower than estimated under the
Third Highway Project (45%), chiefly because of the substantial rise in local
costs of labor which has taken place in the meantime, together with the
gradually increasing proportion of local equipment and materials used. The
foreign exchange component of the consultants' services has been calculated
on the basis of the estimated numbers of man-months of foreign and local
consultants' staff to be employed; it is estimated at 33% on supervision and
only 9% on the studies and engineering, for which Korean consultants provide
practically all the staff for carrying out the detailed engineering.
D. Financing
3.16      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$378 million
equivalent and the foreign exchange cost about US$143 million, which will be
financed by the loan. The local cost of about US$235 million will be
financed by the Government (Table 3.2). The Government provided promptly
adequate funds for the First and Second Highway Projects, but for the Third
Highway Project, for budgetary reasons, it initially extended by about a year
the time for carrying out most of the construction contracts. However, at
the beginning of 1978, the Government increased its budgetary provision and
requested the contractors to accelerate the works to complete them approxi-
mately within the originally estimated construction periods.  It was confirmed
during loan negotiations that the Government will provide adequate and timely
funds and make prompt payments under the project.
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.17      The MOC will be responsible for carrying out the project, through
its BPR, as for the three previous highway projects, except for the studies of
provincial and gun roads (paras. 3.07 and 3.08) for which the MOHA will be
responsible. The MOC will be assisted in supervising the construction and
improvement works by the same consultants who carried out the engineering
(para. 3.05).  The MOHA will be assisted by consultants in carrying out the
studies of the institutions concerned with provincial and gun roads, and of
their maintenance, and the detailed engineering of gun roads for preparation
of future projects (para. 3.08). During negotiations, agreement was confirmed
with the Government on the Terms of Reference for the studies, and on the
employment of qualified and experienced consultants acceptable to the Bank,
and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to assist in supervising



- 23 -
the road construction and improvement works, and to carry out the studies and
engineering of provincial and gun roads.
3.18      Road construction and improvement will be carried out through
contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding by
prequalified firms in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines for
Procurement," and on the advice of consultants. Road maintenance equipment
will be procured through contracts awarded after international competitive
bidding, also in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement;" foreign
bids will be evaluated on the c.i.f. (port of entry) cost, and local bids
on the ex-factory cost, with a margin of preference equal to the import
duties and taxes, up to a maximum of 15%, allowed to domestic manufacturers.
These procedures were confirmed by the Government during negotiations.
3.19      An average of about 9,000 workers are expected to be directly
employed on the construction and improvement works for an average contract
period of 33 months. In carrying out the works, contractors are free to
choose their own methods, including choice of equipment and labor, subject to
works complying with performance specifications. This is in accordance with
Government policy (para. 2.30), which is appropriate because: (a) the
construction works are not of a kind suited to intensive hand labor methods;
(b) there is no serious unemployment problem in Korea; and (c) there is no
significant distortion in the market prices for labor, equipment, materials,
etc. In regard to road maintenance, consultants will investigate appropriate
work methods, including the mix of labor and equipment, as part of the study
of provincial and gun road maintenance (para. 3.07).
3.20      The Government advertised internationally in June 1978 inviting
contractors to prequalify. Bids for 37 of the 46 road sections are expected
to be received in April 1979, and work is to start in June 1979. Bids on the
remaining nine sections are expected to be received by June 1979 and work
start in July 1979. All construction works are expected to be completed by
early 1982. The studies and engineering of provincial and gun roads are
expected to be started in July 1979 and be completed by early 1982. Allowing
for final payments and disbursements, the closing date for the loan will be
December 31, 1982. During negotiations, understanding was reached with the
Government on a Project Implementation Schedule (Table 3.3) and on arrangements
for reporting progress.
F. Environmental and Urban Aspects
3.21      The works have been designed to avoid causing any significant
ecological problems. The alignments follow the existing roads as far as
economically practicable, reducing land acquisition for right-of-way, and
property disturbance, to a minimum. Also, some particularly congested
villages and small towns will be by-passed where traffic conditions would



- 24 -
have been particularly dangerous, or major property demolition would have
been involved. The new road surfaces will be paved, eliminating unpleasant
conditions for traffic and for the population living near the road, due to
dust in dry weather and mud during rainy periods. During negotiations, the
arrangements for acquisition of land, and payment of compensation, for
right-of-way were confirmed by the Government.
G. Disbursements
3.22      Disbursements from the loan will be made on the basis of:
(a) 42% of the total cost of construction and improvement;
(b) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported road maintenance equipment; or
the ex-factory price, excluding identifiable taxes and duties, of
locally manufactured equipment;
(c) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of consultants' services;
and
(c) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of training of staff (through
fellowships).
A Schedule of Estimated Disbursements (Table 3.4) has been prepared. The
cost estimates for the project, the Schedule for Execution, and the Schedule
of Estimated Disbursements were reviewed and agreed with the Government
during negotiations.
4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
4.01      This project will continue to assist Korea in improving and modern-
izing its road transport system. Its benefits are essentially a reduction of
the high costs of moving goods and passengers, and provision of easier access
to some isolated areas with high economic development potential.
4.02      Together with the ongoing Third Project, this project will help
the Government in achieving its targets for road improvement during the FFYP
(1977-81). The two projects will assist in financing about 50% of the
national road paving program; 1,750 km out of 3,700 km. ADB will finance
another 760 km, and the Government will fund the remaining 1,200 km entirely
from its own resources. This project will also partially finance 60% of the
provincial road paving program; 280 km out of 450 km. ADB is considering
assistance for another 120 km, leaving 50 km for the Government to finance
entirely on its own.



- 25 -
4.03      The project supports the Government's strategy of paving existing
gravel roads, which still account for 40% of the national network, rather
than constructing new high standard highways. Feasibility studies show that
for most road sections, the optimum first stage of improvement is to pave
the road largely on the present alignment, with only minimum improvement of
sharp curves, including widening and the improvement of drainage. Standards
in each case are related to traffic levels as explained in para 3.04 and
Table 2.11. The lower cost of such work permits the paving of two or three
times the length of road which could be newly constructed. However, there
are some sections where factors, such as traffic volumes, inadequacy of
present alignments, possibility of substantial shortening of the routes,
justify immediate construction on new alignments. The present approach of
minimizing and phasing investments, increases the feasibility of road projects
and enables the highway system to meet a much larger total transport demand
at lower cost; it follows the recommendations of the consultants and the
Bank.
B. The Project Roads
Location
4.04      The project roads are scattered throughout the northern two thirds
of the country with some concentration on the west coast and in the eastern
mountains. Roads in the west will improve general transport and communications
in a heavily populated agricultural area, and provide faster access to the
provincial capital of Daejon. They will also enable fuller use of potential
distance savings between the western coastal area and Seoul afforded by
roadways built on new dams on the Asan Bay. Roads in the eastern mountains
will reduce transport cost for coal and cement and improve the living condi-
tions in these mining and industrial areas by enabling faster travel and
reducing dust polution. The other project roads will improve access and
transport within predominantly rural areas, which are presently isolated by
the poor condition of existing roads. The economic setting and present
traffic volumes for each project road are described in Working Paper C-1.
The economic analysis of project roads was carried out by US consultants
L. Berger. A feasibility study report was completed in December 1975, and
the analysis was updated in the detailed engineering study completed in
October 1977.
Traffic
4.05      The consultants' estimates of traffic assignment, volumes, and
growth rates are based on regular MOC counts between 1965 and 1974. The
consultants supplemented those by some 150 special counts in 1975, which was
taken as the base year. They also performed origin-destination surveys for
five roads where substantial diverted traffic was expected. Traffic on
project roads ranged from 120 to 2,500 vehicles per day (aadt) in 1975, with
a median aadt around 250 vehicles/day. The typical distribution of vehicles
is 20% cars and taxis, 25% buses, and 55% trucks.



- 26 -
4.06      The traffic growth rates were based on macro-economic considerations
and the same rates were applied to all roads. Growth in both passenger and
freight traffic on the project roads were assumed to be lower than the
corresponding national levels due to an expected lower than average growth of
population and economic activity in the largely rural areas served.
Traffic Growth Rates
(in % p.a.)
Cars and Taxis         Buses        Trucks
1975-90                 11.1               7.0           7.5
1990-2001               13.0               5.5           6.0
Note: the opening year is 1982, and the economic life 20 years.
The generated traffic is expected to increase normal traffic by amounts
ranging from 10% to 30% among the project roads. These increases are based
on studies of earlier cases, where the elasticity of demand for road transport
as a function of reduced operating costs was measured and on traffic counts
following improvements. Traffic diversion from other roads will be signi-
ficant for only five of the project roads. In 1982, the opening year,
traffic on project roads is expected to range from 300 to over 5,000
vehicles/day, with a median over 500 vehicles/day (Table 4.1).
Benefits
4.07      Measureable benefits of the project are mainly in vehicle operating
costs savings due to the improved conditions of the paved roads compared with
the existing rough gravel roads. The consultants calculated vehicle operating
costs as of July 1976 and later updated them to March 1977. Table 4.2 gives
the estimated basic vehicle operating costs; Table 4.3 the range of these
costs on project roads with and without the project. Vehicle operating costs
on existing project roads are high; particularly in mountainous areas where
terrain, alignment, and surface conditions-slow traffic down to average
speeds of 15 to 20 km/hr. The improvement to project roads in these areas
will improve access, facilitating location of industry in the region as well
as increasing the mobility of labor by enabling it to obtain employment over
a wider area. The roads in isolated rural areas will stimulate the production
of diversified crops as well as develop socio-economic contacts between the
rural population and other parts of the country.
4.08      Improvement of project roads will reduce vehicle operating costs by
35% to 65%, for light vehicles and 45% to 75% for heavy vehicles. These
reductions include time savings of drivers and assistants for commercial
vehicles; taxis, buses and trucks. Time savings of passengers have been
calculated separately. Since traffic benefits have been calculated assuming
that roads without the project would remain in their present state, i.e. with
a low level of maintenance, paving and upgrading results in a net maintenance
cost rather than a benefit.



- 27 -
Economic Rates of Return
4.09      The economic rates of return (ERR) for the project roads, calculated
over an assumed 20 years service life, range from 16% to over 40% excluding
passenger time savings (Table 4.4). The weighted average ERA. for all project
roads which account for 96% of total project cost is 26%. This rate of
return excludes investments in road maintenance equipment totalling 2% of
project costs; and studies and training 2% of project cost. Passenger time
savings increase ERR for individual roads by 2 to 4 percentage points. For
the typical road, total benefits following paving would be distributed among
various users as follows: cars and taxis less than 10%, buses about 40%,
trucks over 50%. The proportion of benefits accruing to various users would
gradually change over the project life as light vehicle traffic is expected
to grow faster than bus and truck traffic. However, the shift would be very
gradual, and trucks and buses would still account for 80% of the benefits
towards the end of the assumed service life.
4.10      The construction of project roads will require an average of about
9,000 workers over a 33 month period, creating a total of about 300,000 man-
months of employment, 60% of which for unskilled labor. The new pavements
would bring also non-quantified benefits such as quicker and improved services
and a reduction of heavy dust and mud which covers villages and fields along
existing gravel roads which carry much traffic.
4.11      It is believed that the Government does not at present intend to
levy tolls on any of the project roads and traffic has been forecast, and
ERR's calculated, on that basis. The Government confirmed during negotiations
that tolls will not be levied on any sections of roads to be constructed and
improved under the project without first carrying out studies of the economic
and financial effects, and reviewing the findings of the studies with the
Bank.
C. Sensitivity Analysis and Risks
4.12      The sensitivity of the ERRs was tested for variations in project
costs and benefits. Variations in costs and benefits affect the rates of
return similarly. A 20% change in costs or benefits alters the ERR by 3
percentage points when the ERR is around 20%; by 4 points around 25% and 5
points around 30%. The weighted average rate of return of 26% would similarly
change by less than 5 percentage points in a 20% variation in costs or
benefits. The project is not subject to unusual risks. Costs are based on
detailed engineering of 80% of the roads and the MOC and the consultants have
extensive recent experience of similar works (para. 3.11). Benefits depend
primarily on traffic which on average is already high and unlikely to vary
greatly from projected trends.

5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During loan negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed on a
number of points, the principal ones being:
(a) the extension of collection and analysis of traffic data to the
remainder of the provincial highway system by December 31, 1980
(para. 2.09);
(b)  a review to be carried out by the Government of its licensing
system for commercial road vehicles, with a view to introducing
further relaxation of such commercial licensing (para 2.13);
(c) the maintenance of the national roads in line with an approved
budget allocation for 1979 and an agreed target five-year forecast
of maintenance budget requirements (paras 2.31 to 2.33);
(d)  the arrangements being made by MOHA for carrying out the studies of
the institutions concerned with provincial and gun roads, and of
the maintenance of such roads, and of the development of the gun
road system; (para 3.08);
5.02      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$143 million (represen-
ting about 38% of the total cost) for a period of 17 years, including a grace
period of 4 years.
