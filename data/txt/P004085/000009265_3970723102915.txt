PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RORE& - HIGHWAYS IV (LOAN 1640-KO)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Fourth Highway
Project for -aich Loan 1640-KO was approved in December 1978 for the sum of
US$143 million.
The PCR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Transportation I
Division, based upon a review of the project files and data supplied in
February 1984 by the Ministry of Construction, Korea. Bank staff who worked
on the project have also been interviewed.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1984.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
DeDartment 'OEfl) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft
Comiletion Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA - HIGHWAYS IV (LOAN 1640-KO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Fourth Highway Project continued the Bank's assistance to the
Government of Korea in improving its national road network (para. 2.02). The
project was designed to meet increasing traffic volumes and also to introduce
*       project lending with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) for the provincial
and county road network (para. 2.03).
The project achieved all of its objectives, despite some unavoidable
delays (para. 8.01). The construction and improvement of roads which originally
were unpaved and in largely mountainous terrain was carried out successfully,
though with an overall 18-month delay which was due to budgetary constraints
(paras. 3.02-3.06). All civil works were executed by Korean contractors who
were supervised by the staff of MOC assisted by a team consisting of local
and foreign consultants (parkQ. 3.07). The studies included under the project
produced detailed construction and maintenance programs for Korea's tertiary
(or gun) road network which is managed by MOHA (paras. 3.11-3.18). The ongoing
Provincial and County Roads Project (Loan 2228-KO) is fully utilizing the
studies' results. There is still a balance of US$0.9 million remaining in the
loan which is being utilized for the purchase of road maintenance and traffic
counting equipment. The project also included a training component which
was designed to help replenish MOC's depleted engineering and transportation
planning staff (para. 3.19). Finally, despite cost overruns, the economic
rate of return is higher than that estimated at appraisal due to a considerable
increase in traffic over appraisal projections (para. 6.03).
The outstanding feature of this project was the extensive use of
local consultants, which continued a trend begun under earlier highway projects.
It resulted in extensive responsibilities being placed in the hands of local
consultants as they now form the greater part of the team. Current consulting
studies have essentially local teams with some foreigners in selected, specialized
positions (para. 7.03).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA - HIGHWAYS IV (LOAN 1640-KO)
I. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND SECTORAL SETTING
The Transport Sector
*           1.01      Korea's export-led industrialization has been among the most
successful examples of economic development in recent history. During
1962-78, real GNP grew by 1OX p.a. and per capita income more than tripled in
*           real terms.  Coupled with industrialization and urbanization, major develop-
ments and changes in the transportation sector complemented and supported the
transformation of Korea's economy. Passenger traffic tripled between 1964 and
1971 and then tripled again by 1981; freight increased nine times and five
times respectively during the same period.
1.02      The Government of Korea's (GOK) basic objective in the past has been
to increase transport capacity in line with projected traffic growth and to
avoid major bottlenecks. This objective has been largely achieved. Further-
more, the transport system as developed is reasonably balanced, as there is no
substantial uneconomic allocation of traffic among the various modes.
1.03      Large investments in transportation infrastructure have been comple-
mented by a considerable effort to improve the efficiency of the transporta-
tion system through the establishment and strengthening of institutions to
plan, construct, maintain and operate the facilities and services. This is
true both in the public sector, with the establishing and strengthening of
institutions such as the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) and the Korea Highway
Corporation (KHC), and in the private sector by the successful development of
many contractors (some 500 firms) capable of handling a wide range of public
works in Korea and abroad.
1.04      The Bank has played an active role in advising and assisting the
Corean authorities in pursuing their transport objectives. A summary of
investments follows.

The Road Subsector
1.05      In 1978, Korea had a road network of some 80,000 km consisting of
9,400 km of national highways, 10,900 km of provincial roads, 12,500 km of gun
or county roads and some 47,000 km of village access roads. While road
density was generally sufficient to serve transport needs, the condition of
most of the network was inadequate. Only 58% of the national highway system
and 8% of the provincial system were paved, and the unpaved roads, including
unpaved national roads, were in poor condition. Despite some improvement in



- 3 -
maintenance, average driving speeds were only in the range of 25-35 kph.
Korea's motor vehicle fleet at that time was comparatively small. The 275,000
four-wheel road vehicles registered in 1977 (Table 4) amounted to only 7.9 per
1,000 persons. This compared to 14.3 in Thailand, 15.4 in the Philippines and
48.2 in Malaysia, although only Malaysia haa a higher per capita income. The
vehicle fleet was, however, growing rapidly at 13% in 1975/76 and 25% in
1976/77. Growth jumped to 40% in 1977/78 and 70Z in 1978/79, then fell to 1OZ
in 1979/80 due to the oil price increases at that time. The fleet is now
growing at about 25%.
1.06      Korea's highway development policy has been geared to building a
network of roads to serve the short and medium distance traffic for which it
has an economic advantage over the railroads. The Road Plan developed in
1968, in consultation with the Bank, proposed a vast program consisting of:
(a) the development through 1986 of a network of about 4,000 km of trunk
highways to form a grid of longitudinal and transversal axes linking the four
major gate ports of Incheon, Busan, Mogpo and Mukho toward inland centers, and
(b) the construction over a 10-year period of a 1,600 km two-lane expressway
network on separate alignments from the old roads, which could be expanded
when traffic volumes require it. The program is now 80% completed and serves
industrial complexes located around Seoul and provincial capitals.
1.07      The first three Bank-financed highway projects supported the Road
Plan and had a major impact in assisting the Government with the following:
(a) construction and improvement of its national road system; (b) institution-
building in the Ministry of Construction (MOC), which is responsible for the
national roads; and (c) formulation of revised policies affecting the whole
transport sector. Assistance with institution-building was provided for
setting up the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), MOC's field organization for
maintaining the national highways, and for improving MOC's planning capa-
bility. Significant policy changes which were evolved through the highway
projects include the adoption of more appropriate roads stardards, relaxation
of restrictive licensing of the road transport industry, revision of regula-
tions governing vehicle weights and dimensions, and a modified government
policy on toll roads recuiring financial and economic studies prior to levying
tolls on any road.
1.08      The Fourth Highway Project continued the efforts begun under the
previous projects, and at the same time initiated Bank support for improvement
of the provincial and county roads wlhich had previously received little atten-
tion due to the considerable highway requirements of Government's industriali-
zation policy. This report reviews the progress of the Fourth Highway
Project, based on information provided by HOC and BPR and a review of the
$ank's files in Washington.

II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation Stage
2.01      The project was identified by the Korean Government and prepared
with the assistance of consultants financed under the Second Highway Pro-
ject. It arose out of Government's recognition that Korea's highway system in
the mid-1970s was inadequate to serve the rapidly growing vehicle fleet and
the increasing demand for road transport which was accompanying the country's
rapid development. Government therefore increased highway investment under
its Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) and formulated a highway development
program with the following objectives: to pave nearly 90% of the national
system; to accelerate improvement of the provincial and tertiary systems; and
to further strengthen the institutions responsible for the various systems.
Government asked the Bank for assistance in reaching these goals, and the Bank
responded by allocating an increasing proportion of its transport lending to
the highway subsector and by financing the preparation of a Fourth Highway
Project which supported all three of the Plan's objectives.
Project Objectives
2.02      The three previous highway projects had helped to bring about funda-
mental improvements in the Government's institutions concerned with national
roads (under the MOC). This led to significant advances in the planninp,,
design, construction and improvement of national roads and setting up of the
MOC's field organization to maintain them. Studies were included in the
Fourth Highway Project to strengthen the provincial and county road networks
by preparing a long-range county road development program. This program
combined with the development program prepared for the national road network
under the third Highway Project Loan 1203-KO set the stage for a move to
sector lending. The appropriate follow-on projects (Provincial and County
Roads, Loan 2228-KO, and Highway Sector I, Loan 2392-KO) are both under way.
Project Description
2.03      The project was appraised by a Bank mission in April 1978.  It
consisted of the following components:
(a) construction and improvement, including paving, and supervision by
consultants, of 36 sections of national roads totalling 955 km;
(b) construction and improvement, including paving, and supervision by
consultants, of 10 sections of provincial roads totalling 278 km;
(c) procurement of additional road maintenance equipment for maintaining
national roads;
(d) a study by consultants of provincial and county (gun) road planning,
construction, maintenance, administration and financing, and of the
institutions involved, and of gun road development to prepare an
investment program, followed by further feasibility studies and
detailed engineering of about 2,000 km; and



-5-
(e) provision of overseas training for MOC staff.
2.04      Feasibility studies and detailed engineering for items (a) and (b)
were completed under the Second Highway Project on 33 of the 36 sections of
national roads (880 km out of 952 km) and on four of the ten provincial roads
(107 km out of 282 km), by foreign consultants in association with eight
Korean consulting firms between August 1975 and early 1978. The remaining
nine roads were proposed by the Economic Planning Board in January 1978 and
accepted in principle by the Bank, subject to the provision of engineering
data, cost estimates and economic justifications for the roads. Data indi-
cated that all the proposed roads were likely to be justified, and detailed
engineering for the nine roads and related bid documents were completed in
early 1979 by the same consulting firms engaged for the other roads.
Appraisal Stage
2.05      The appraisal mission, composed of an engineer and an economist,
visited Korea in April 1978 and reviewed the project documents. These
included the detailed engineering plans, economic evaluation, bid documents
and other information requested previously by the Bank.
2.06      Major issues raised at appraisal were:
(a)  The Gyeongju-Pohang Road (23 km).  The GOK wished to have this road
constructed as soon as possible due to the very heavy truck traffic
carrying steel from the Pohang factory. The MOC was considering
bidding without international advertisement and starting the work as
quickly as possible during 1978. Later on, the Bank would be asked
to retroactively finance expenditures occurring before the date of
Loan Signature. The appraisal team suggested that the lack of ICB
would rule out Bank financing and asked the GOK to write the Bank on
its final decision about including this road in the project.
(b) Maintenance Budget for National Roads. The GOK had not met its
obligations under the Third Highway Project to make adequate budge-
tary provisions for maintenance of national roads. Actual
provisions were 50% below requirements. The mission suggested that
the Bank require as a condition of negotiations that the GOK confirm
with the Bank that adequate provisions be made in the budget
proposals to be presented to the National Assembly.
{c) Arrangements for Carrying out the Gun Road Studies. Difficulties
arose because MOHA had no engineer.ing staff and was not oriented to
addressing problems concerning organization, equipment and budget
for civil works institutions and the planning and execution of road
improvements and maintenance works. MOHA subsequently decided that
their new Regional Development Bureau (RDB), which.was set up in
February 1978, would be responsible for the studies, the terms of
reference of which had been prepared by the appraisal mission.



-6-
(d) Financing of Local Cost of Consultants. Local firms were to be used
for some of the consulting work, causing the foreign consulting cost
of the project to amount to about 20% of total consultants' cost.
It was therefore to be decided whether local costs of consultants
(about $6.4 million for both foreign and domestic) would be financed
by the Bank.
(e) Loan Amount. If the Gyeongju-Pohang road remained in the project
and local costs of consultants were financed, the total loan amount
would be about $150 million. This figure was $30 million more than
the original provision in the lending program.
2.07      Loan negotiations were held in Washington from October 30 to
November 3, 1978. The above issues were discussed, and it was agreed that the
project would include the Gyeongju/Pohang road but no local cost financing for
consultant services. This reduced the loan amount to $143 million and the
total project cost to $378 million. It was agreed to allow funding levels for
maintenance to lag about one year behind the amounts scheduled in the Loan
Agreement for the Third Highways Project. The GOK also requested Bank agree-
ment to levy tolls on two Bank-financed roads; this was provisionally
approved, pending the submission of a satisfactory financial and economic
analysis by the GOK. As for the studies, MOHA agreed to provide counterpart
staff required to participate in and manage the studies.
2.08      The loan was approved by the Board on December 14, 1978, the Loan
Agreement was signed on December 22, 1978, and became effective on March 14,
1979.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
3.01      Contracts for construction and paving works were all awarded within
five months of loan signing but many of them were not completed unLil June
1983, some 18 months behind schedule. The feasibility studies and detailed
engineering for projects included in the current Provincial and County Roads
Project were completed in September 1982, about four months behind schedule.
The procurement of highway maintenance equipment started one year late and
was completed by June 1984, about two years behlnd the original schedule.
The project completion date was extended from December 31, 1982 to
June 30, 1984 mainly to accommodate procurement of this equipment as well as
the overseas training component, which was carried out two years behind
schedule due to problems in finding English and other foreign language
speaking staff to be trained.
Road Construction and Paving
3.02      Construction of the Gyeongju-Pohang Road was started in April 1979,
some two months ahead of the overall project schedule. In order to facilitate
rapid construction of the road, the Bank agreed to allow the GOK to invite
bids directly from ten Korean contractors who had already been pre-qualified



-7-
by the MOC. MOC also required the winning bidder to complete the road in 16
months instead of the originally estimated 22 months.  Actual completion took
18 months.
3.03      For the remainder of the roads, bidding was scheduled for July 1979,
about four months later than originally envisaged due to budgetary con-
straints. The bid prices received on the first batch of roads were about 60%
higher (in won) than engineering estimates due mainly to price escalation
stemming from the prevailing highly inflationary climate.  Hence, by July
1979, even before bidding was complete on all roads, it was realized that the
cost estimates would have to be revised substantially upwards and adjustments
subsequently made in the Bank disbursement percentages.
3.04      Although ICB was used, all 48 of the pre-qualified contractors were
Korean since, despite extensive international advertisements, no foreign con-
tractors expressed interest. All contracts were awarded to 42 successful bid-
ders by late 1979 but inadequate budgetary provisions forced construction to
proceed at less than half of the scheduled rate. Due in part to these bud-
getary limitations and the resulting extended construction schedule at a time
of high inflation, civil works cost estimates rose by over 67% (in won) above
appraisal expectations. The MOC tried to solve this problem by authorizing
delayed reimbursements to contractors and arranging financing on concessionary
terms from local banks in the interim. This led to a restoration of construc-
tion progress, but time lost could not be made up and by the original December
1981 target completion date, civil works were only about 60% complete. It
should be noted that this was not the only project encountering difficulties
during the early 1980s. At that time, Korea suffered a sharp slowdown in its
economic development as it adjusted to the oil price shocks which were accom-
panied by an acceleration of inflation. The GOK's policy was to adopt tjfht
monetary and fiscal policies. These actions, together with devaluations-, of
the won, affected all Bank-financed projects which depended on significant
counterpart funds from the Government's budget. Details of the timing and
cost of all contracts are given in Table 1.
3.05      The quality of work was very good and no real technical problems
were experienced with the contractors, rather it was their willingness to
accept delayed payments and continue construction which allowed eventual
completion of works. There were a few changes made during construction such
as upgrading, mainly minor widening on several road sections and widening of
the Nonsan bridge (Lot 59). At Lot 6, (Naedeog-Sodo) the road was extended by
4.7 km to include repair work and asphaltic concrete overlay of an existing
rigid pavement. All changes were estimated to add about 8% to construction
costs.
3.06      The actual length of roads improved and constructed totaled 1,187.1
km; the roads were handed over to the MOC field organization for maintenance.
1/   In 1980 tl'2 won was devalued five times and had the following exchange
rates to the dollar: W 485 at 1/1/80, W 580 at 1/12/80, W 600 at
5/28/80, W 658 at 10/31/80 and W 682 at 11/10/80.



-8-
3.07      Supervision of the civil works contract was carried out by foreign
consultants in association with Korean consultants and the MOC. Their perfor-
mance was generally satisfactory. Reporting was prompt and in adequate detail
for monitoring project performance.
Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment
3.08      This component was intended to continue equipment procurement (then
ongoing under the Second and Third Highway Projects) for use by the MOC main-
tenance organization. It originally consisted of trucks, loaders, asphalt
mixing and compaction equipment, some specialized equipment for bridge
repairs, snow removal and additional stocks of spare parts. Procurement was
through ICB with all bidding arrangements handled by the Government's Office
of Supply Republic of Korea (OSROK) which is the standard procedure. The
numbers of the various types of equipment were decided by MOC and their
consultants, who also prepared the specifications and other draft bid docu-
ments. Under covenants of the Highway II Project (Loan 956-KO), the MOC
maintenance organization had just been extended from a pilot project to a full
fledged organization covering all2yight provinces and hence the equipment
procurement needs were extensive,-
3.09      Procurement of road maintenance equipment under the project was
greatly delayed, and the first list of equipment to be procured was sent to
the Bank in May 1980 (exactly two years behind schedule) for review and com-
ment. While some of the delay was due to budgetary constraints, a good
portion of it was in fact voluntary as OSROK was then actively procuring main-
tenance equipment under the Highway III Project (Loan 1203) and did not yet
need to use funds from Loan 1640. This reflected an attempt to utilize funds
from Loan 1203, which had been originally intended for the purchase of traffic
counting equipment, before the closing date (12/31/79, later revised to
12/31/81). In April 1981 the Bank approved a BPR proposal for joint procure-
ment under Loans 1203 and 1640. It was felt that allowing joint purchases
under both projects would streamline procurement by reducing the frequency of
bidding and evaluation, and respond to priorities for equipment delivery and
utilization.
3.10      The Loan closing date has been extended to June 30, 1984 mainly to
facilitate this component, and to date a balance of $0.9 million remains in
the loan account. It is expected to be utilized shortly on reimbursements for
the current batch of equipment on which OSROK issued invitations to bid in
December 1983.
Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
3.11      Part I - Provincial and Gun Road Organization and Maintenance Study,
and Part II - Gun Road Development Study. Invitations were sent in February
1979 to four short-listed consulting engineering firms to submit proposals for
2/ For example, the total length of national highways under MOC maintenance
increased from 2,900 km in 1976 to 6,000 km by end 1982.

the feasibility studies. The winning bidder, French consultants together with
a local firm, successfully conducted this study which started in September
1979 and was completed in September 1982, about four months behind schedule.
3.12      The Part I study analyzed institutions at the national, provincial
and county (gun) levels concerned with planning, design, maintenance, con-
struction and administration of provincial and gun roads, and of their finan-
cing. In its results, the study was to specify proposals for the improvement
*          of the institutions, including any reorganization found necessary, and for the
improvement of provincial and gun road maintenance, together with cost esti-
mates and a program and time schedule for implementation.
3.13      The study marked the first Bank road subsector involvement with the
Ministry of Rome Affairs (MOHA). Initial difficulties were encountered in
havIng study terms of reference reviewed and decisions made on arrangements
for managing and executing this as well as the Part II study, since MOHA
lacked an organization to deal with works institutions and programs. This was
solved by MORA's creating, in October 1979, a new Local Road Section in the
Local Development Bureau. The section was staffed by four local engineers who
worked as counterparts to consultant staff and participated in the review of
findings and the formulation and eventual implementation of the action
programs. The MOC also assisted extensively by initially administering the
consultants' contract and providing overall coordination.
3.14      The draft report was submitted to the Bank in May 1980, about three
months behind schedule. In its review, the Bank suggested that consultants
examine the feasibility of (a) the maximum practicable use of contracted work
for construction/improvement and maintenance (especially periodic mainte-
nance); and (b) the establishment of a special account for equipment renewal
to be replenished with contributions from user fees based on depreciation and
financial charges.
3.15      The final report was submitted to the Bank in December 1981.  Its
basic output was the preparation of a comprehensive five-year 1983-87 mainte-
nance program for the provincial and county road networks. The program will
enable MORA to establish, by 1987, effective organizations at central, provin-
cial and county levels to carry out the routine and periodic maintenance of
both networks. The report covered in detail the organizational requirements
for maintenance such as establishing a Road Management Division in MOHA,
setting up of an Equipment Renewal Special Account (ERSA) and extensive
training of MOHA employees.  It was also decided to use Double Bituminous
Surface Treatment (DBST) on as many roads as possible where traffic volumes
did not yet fully require asphaltic concrete and also to enable the paving of
a greater number of currently unsealed road surfaces due to the lower unit
cost of DBST. As for gravel roads, it was decided to perform 70% of regravel-
ling by force account and, to allow this, small portable crushing/screening
plants and allied equipment would have to be purchased for each province. The
program outlined the physical output of the utaintenance activities per km for
each year, the timing of maintenance equipment procurement, the annual number
of persons to be trained in specific fields, technical assistance requirements
and related costs. Implementation of the five-year maintenance program would
cost Won 129 billion (at May 1981 prices) and has started under the ongoing
Provincial and County Roads Project.



- 10 -
3.16      The Part II gun road development study had the following objec-
tives: the preparation of a tentative long-range program for improving gun
roads; a five-year program for improving about 5,000 km of gun roads for
inclusion in the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86); and after review and selec-
tion by the Government in agreement with the Bank, the identification of
2,000 km of roads for improvement under a future Bank-financed project.  The
study was done in two phases from September 1979 to August 1982. The first
phase screened 12,500 km of county roads, outlined a long-range improvement
program, and identified a set of priority roads for further screening. The
second phase used first-year benefit-cost ratios based on traffic and esti-         
mated construction costs, road functions and regional balance as screening
criteria to select about 2,000 km of roads to be included for detailed
analyses and subsequently 1,000 km for final design.  The 1,000 km of roads
selected are located in 80 of the 139 counties and are distributed throughout
all nine provinces, with average daily traffic ranging from 50 to 1,200. The
finished road surfaces would be asphaltic concrete (AC), double bituminous
surface treatment (DBST) or gravel. The base cost per kilometer of the county
road improvements averaged US$154,600 in 1982 prices.  The cost is not un-
reasonable in the light of adverse climate and terrain conditions and average
costs under the Fourth Highway Project ($341,000/km for two-lane provincial
roads). Existing alignments were utilized to the extent compatible with sound
engineering and road safety.
3.17      The final gun road development study was issued in September 1982,
and included a detailed implementation schedule, starting in early 1983, which
specified the organizational procedures and responsibilities at the central
and provincial levels for (a) bid procedures and bid award; (b) the supervi-
sion of works and certification of costs of work executed, and (c) the scope
of consultancy services needed and draft terms of reference. The results of
this study form the civil works component of the ongoing Provincial and County
Roads Project, Loan 2228-KO.
3.18      In view of the MOHA engineers' lack of experience in using DBST, Lt
was subsequently agreed to extend the consultants' contract by three months to
allow them to redesign some roads to DBST standards and some others to AC
standards as these changes had been agreed at negotiations for the Provincial
and County Roads Project. The consultants were also asked to prepare and
arrange an overseas training program for MOHA officials and engineers in the
theoretical and detailed practical aspects of executing DBST pavements, and a
seminar was arranged in Seoul for Korean contractors in order to expose them
to the practical aspects of executing DBST pavements.
Overseas Training of MOC Staff
3.19      The project initially included fellowships for overseas training of
nine MOC staff for periods of up to one year in transportation economics and
project evaluation, and in highway engineering with particular reference to
maintenance. In accordance with the terms of reference for the civil works
supervision component, the civil works supervisory consultants assisted MOC in
selecting trainees. The initial invitation to participate in a training
course was sent to MOC personnel in December 1979 (some nine months behind
schedule) and the two individuals selected departed Korea in January 1980.



- 11 -
Subsequently, there were several selections and periodic departures of
trainees until departure of the last trainee in June 1984.  A total of thirty-
seven individuals benefited from this program which was changed slightly from
appraisal expectations by the greater use of short-term courses to accommodate
more personnel. This component, though somewhat behind schedule due to the
difficulty of finding English and other foreign language speaking personnel,
w'as properly executed.
IV. PROJECT COST AND BANK LOAN
*         Project Cost
4.01      The total project cost was $508 million, rather than the $378.2 mil-
lion estimated at appraisal. In current won, the total cost exceeded the
appraisal estimate, including contingency allowances, by about 94%. However,
because of the devaluation of the won in relation to the US dollar during
project implementat i,qn, the total cost overrun expressed in current US dollar
equivalent was 34%._   The majority of the increase was due to price escal -
tion during the highly inflationary construction period from 1979 to 1983. -
Details of actual costs and appraisal estimates are given in Table 2.
4.02      The original cost of the construction component was exceeded by 67%
in won.  Of this cost overrun, 59% was due to escalation of unit   ices during
the construction period (46 months) and 8% due to design changes.-   In dollar
terms, there were overruns of 33% on road construction and improvement, 18% on
consultants services, and 46% on training fellowships.
Loan Disbursements
4.03      Cumulative disbursements (detailed in Table 7) compared to appraisal
estimates were as follows:
3/   US dollar figures are for illustrative purposes only as during project
implementation, there were frequent and irregular devaluations of the won
leading to an overall 61% reduction in its value. US$ conversions were
based on the average value of the won in the period, hence the results
are approximations.
4/   The wholesale price index wdas:  1976 = 100, 1977 = 104.4, 1978 = 116.6,
1979 = 138.4, 1980 = 192.3, 1981 = 235.5, 1982 = 247.6.

It should be noted that even though slower than appraisal estimates, disburse-
ments were faster than the standard country profile which suggests a seven
year schedule.
Reallocation of Loan Funds
4.04      At MOC's request, the Bank loan funds were reallocated on May 27,
1983 so as to utilize the unallocated funds. The total loan amount is
expected to be withdrawn by June 30, 1984, when the ba'ance committed for
equipment procurement should be withdrawn. The following table gives the
original and actual allocation of loan proceeds.

Fulfillment of the Main Loan Covenants
4.05      Compliance with covenants (Table 6) was generally satisfactory,
though more could have been achieved under the study of road transport regula-
tions. Other than the effects of budgetary shortfalls early in the project
period, there was no hindrance to the smooth implementation of the project
schedule. The Borrower adhered to agreements on toll policies, extension of
the traffic monitoring system and eventually the provision of adequate road
maintenance funding.

V.  INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      In addition to assisting the GOK in attaining its road construction
goals, the Fourth Highway Project contributed to the development of all insti-
tutions involved in the road subsector (especialiy the HOHA) and prepared the
basis for the First Sector Project. Hence the main beneficiary institutions
were MOHA and MOC.
Ministry of Construction (MOC)
5.02      The training program has helped to rebuild MOC's technical capabi-
lity which was weakened by a severe loss of experienced staff due to more
attractive conditions elsewhere, generated by the extensive worldwide activi-
ties of Korean engineering and contracting firms. The program also provided
staff training in fields such as transportation economics and highway invest-
ment planning which were not emphasized previously in Korea.
5.03      The project also continued assistance to the comparatively new and
expanding MOC field organization for maintaining national roads. During pro-
ject implementation, the principal limitation on its work capacity was the
per-nuial budget shortfall (typically by 25% of estimated needs). The Bank
continually reminded the GOK of the importance of reliable funding at adequate
levels to maintain the road system, and by 1982 budget provisions were deemed
satisfactory. The maintenance organization is being further developed under
the Highway Sector Loan through the provision of technical assistance to
introduce more modern management procedures for the maintenance of the paved
road network.
Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA)
5.04      At the outset, MOHA had little or no properly staffed road organiza-
tion, but due to the technical assistance and studies financed under the pro-
ject, its institutional capacity has developed rapidly. Before the project,
MORA maintenance organizations at the central and provincial levels were weak;
no proper planning of work was done and maintenance was unsatisfactory due to
lack of funds, trained staff, equipment and materials. This situation has
e         improved as MOHA has been able to start developing the capability required for
road maintenance.
Road Subsector Policies
5.05      The exchange of views between the Bank and Government has helped in
the evolution of road subsector policies. Of these, the most important are
the greater priority now being given to maintenance of the road network,
adoption of the most cost-effective designs and the use of studies to analyze
the effect of tolls before allowing their introduction on a road section.
Road Transport Industry

Korea. Under Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement, UOT was supposed to conduct
a review of regulations governing licensing of commercially-operated vehicles
and exchange views with the Bank on relaxing some of the most restrictive pro-
visions. The MOT did conduct a partial review but dialogue with the Bank was
impeded by extensive changes in MOT staff and of the Government as a whole.
There was still some beneficial result as the licensing of trucks and taxis
was relaxed enough to eliminate restrictions on areas and routes of opera-
tions. This was intended to increase competitiveness and greater efficiency
in road transport.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01      The economic evaluation at appraisal was carried out by the consul-
tants on each of the 36 sections of national roads and 10 sections of provin-
cial roads which were to be improved under the project. Measurable project
benefits were mainly reflected in vehicle operating costs (VOC) due to the
improved conditions of the paved roads compared with the existing rough gravel
roads and other surfaces which were in poor condition.
Traffic
6.02      Traffic in 1982 was higher than expected on virtually all roads,
with actual traffic exceeding forecasts by 20% on averq-e (Table 3). Growth
rates between 9% and 15% were common on most roads. In 1982, most of the
roads had average annual daily traffic greater than 1,100 vehicles per day.
Re-estimated Rates of Return
6.03      Using traffic volumes and updated vehicle operating costs, the ERR
for each road section was recalculated assuming future traffic growth at 7.5%
p.a. and no further real increases in VOC, which is a conservative approach.
The recalculated ERR (Table 5) ranges between 20% to 50% excluding time
savings; this compares favorably with appraisal estimates of 16% to 40%,
excluding passenger time savings. The weighted average ERR for all project
roads was 35%, which is higher than the appraisal estimate of 26%. The ERRs
are higher due mainly to the substantially higher than anticipated traffic
voluimes on the roads at completion. The rate of return at both appraisal and
completion excludes investment in road maintenance equipment and studies which
together total less than 4% of project cost.
VII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The project continued and expanded the dialogue between the Govern-
ment and Bank, started under the previous three projects. This has led to the
further evolution and implementation of policies and programs in the road
transport subsector. Also, the studies undertaken provided the Government
with a planning framework and directly led to Bank involvement with the secon-
dary and tertiary MOHA road network.
7.02      In terms of policy development, the continued dialogue on mainte-



- 15 -
nance funding and reviews of road transport regulations led to further deve-
lopment of road transport policy.  There is now a more decided emphasis on
transport investment planning and the design of least-cost alternatives. Bank
involvement contributed greatly to improving the quality of the projects which
are now both better technically designed and implemented.  This appears to be
generally true for construction works and for maintenance organization and
operation. In addition, there seems to have been an increased desire to
improve the efficiency of the road transport industry, highway maintenance and
planning capabilities.
7.03      During supervision missions, the Bank conducted an effective
dialogue with the Borrower and assisted in solving varinus problems which
occurred. The extensive use of local consultants and the Bank's support in
this venture has led to the development of a competent local industry. Now,
selected foreign consultants can be used in a team of mostly Koreans for the
conduct of feasibility studies, and virtually all Korean teams for detailed
engineering.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project has achieved its overall twin objectives of paving the
way for sector lending with MOC and pioneering institution development with
the MOHA. It has also resulted in the addition of 1,189 km of all-weather
paved roads to the Korean network. The economic returns on the construction
components exceeded appraisal expectations, and the studies and training com-
ponents contributed to the development of MOHA and MOC. The project also gave
special impetus to maintenance and promoted efficiency in road transport by
encouraging the relaxation of excessive restrictions.
