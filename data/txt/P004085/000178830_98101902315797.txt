FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Korea
Amount:           $143 million equivalent
Terms:            The loan would be for a term of 17 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.35% p.a.
Project
Description:   The proposed project would consist of:
(a) construction and improvement, including paving and
supervision by consultants, of 36 sections of national
roads totalling about 950 km;
(b) construction and improvement, including paving and
supervision by consultants, of 10 sections of provincial
roads totalling about 280 km;
(c) procurement of additional road maintenance equipment
for maintaining national roads;
(d) a study by consultants of the institutions involved in
the planning, design, maintenance, construction,
administration and financing of provincial and county
(gunl) roads, and the preparation of a program for
improving the organization and functions of such
institutions, upgrading provincial and gun road main-
tenance and the future development of the gun road
system, to be followed by detailed engineering of about
2,000 km of gun roads.
(e)  provision of fellowships for training staff of the MOC.
As the project encompasses a wide variety of major roads in
many, disparate regions in Korea, it will raise the overall
efficiency of Korea's transport system and thereby contribute
to general economic growth. Measurable benefits of the
project are mainly in vehicle operating cost savings due to
the improved conditions of the paved roads. The construction
of project roads will create about 300,000 man-months of
employment. There are no special risks associated with the
project.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $143 million to help
finance a proposed fourth highway project. The loan will have a term of
17 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7.35% p.a.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Growth and Prospects of the Korean
Economy") was distributed under cover of SecM77-158, dated March 4, 1977./l
The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I.
Recent Economic Developments
3.        Korea's economic position at the commencement of the Fourth Plan
period (1977-81) was stronger than ever before. Despite the balance of pay-
ments difficulties of 1974 and 1975 and a much less favorable international
economic environment than expected, most of the economic objectives set in
the Third Plan (1972-76) were achieved. The economy has shown continued
strength since the commencement of the Fourth Plan period. The exports and
balance of payments targets for 1977 were realized. The rate of growth of
GNP in real terms was 10.3% (as compared with the annual average of 9.2%
postulated in the Plan), and per capita income in current dollars rose from
$700 in 1976 to $864 in 1977. Export value increased by about 29% (albeit at
a considerably lower rate than the 56% registered in 1976), and exceeded the
target of $10,000 million. Continued success was achieved in diversifying
the markets for, and composition of, Korean exports. Although there was a
trade deficit of $477 million, resultiLng from a 25% increase in imports, net
receipts from services ($266 million) and net transfers of about $223 million
offset this deficit and resulted in a current account surplus of $12 million,
as compared with a def:Lcit of $314 million in 1976. The rapid improvement in
the balance of payments was the result of a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade, due in part to quality improvements, and the sharp increase
in the earnings from construction contracts abroad. Furthermore, net trans-
fers averaged nearly $300 million over the past two years. The net gain from
all these factors, together with the increase in tourism receipts, was nearly
equivalent to the total of the current account deficits in 1974 and 1975.
/I The latest Bank Economic Mission visited Korea in October 1978 and its
report is presently under preparation.



- 2 -
4.        Although price increases averaged about 10% in 1977, due, in part,
to the continued stability of import prices and, in part, to the success of
anti-inflation policies, including price controls, inflationary pressures
began to accelerate again during the second half of 1977 and have persisted
in 1978. The Government has tended to view this as being mainly the result
of. the high rate of growth of the money supply caused almost entirely by the
large inflows of foreign exchange earnings, especially from construction
contracts abroad. In response to this view of the inflation problem, the
Government has attempted to reduce the net inflow of foreign exchange by
inducing more cash imports and reducing credit imports, and by neutralizing
the possible monetary impact of some of the foreign exchange earnings
through various monetary measures. Furthermore, the Government announced a
wide ranging import liberalization scheme which took effect on May 1, 1978.
In addition, interest rate adjustments have been made, the most recent being
the raising of deposit and loan rates in June 1978 in an attempt to reduce
the prevailing excess demand and dampen inflationary pressures.
5.        The balance of payments position in 1978 is expected to remain
sound with nominal increases of 24% and 32% in the values of exports and
imports, respectively. The resulting trade deficit of about $1,400 million
is expected to be partially offset by a projected surplus in the invisibles
account of about $950 million (including net transfers), leaving a current
account deficit of some $445 million. Net inflows of medium- and long-term
capital would be about $1,600 million and, in spite of the substantial repay-
ment of some of Korea's short-term debt, Korea's gross holdings of foreign
exchange would be augmented by an estimated $775 million in 1978. This re-
vised estimate takes account of the impact of the additional import liberali-
zation measures which is already reflected in the rate of increase of imports
since the first quarter of 1978. The outlook in 1979 is also expected to re-
main strong with a continued high growth of exports and a gross level of
capital inflow of about $3,000 million, including an allowance for an in-
crease in reserves to about $6,000 million, or about four months of imports,
a level considered prudent in view of Korea's trade dependency.
Longer-Term Problems and Prospects
6.        The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an opportu-
nity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic problems, prospects and
priorities. Korea's longer term goals as specified in the Plan are "growth
with enhanced self-sufficiency" and "greater equity and social development."
The firm intention of the Government as stated in the Plan is to achieve a
maximum rate of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also
with the maintenance of internal price stability. National savings are ex-
pected to finance as much as 92% of total investment as compared with about
72% in the Third Plan period (1972-76).
7.        Growth and stability are not the only objectives.  Enhanced equity
and greater social development are also of importance in the Korean plans.
The main emphasis is on achieving a wider distribution of the benefits of
growth. Health outlays will increase as a proportion of total investment
with special stress on preventive care and an innovative health delivery

system to service low-income families, particularly in the rural areas.
Rural incomes are expected to increase as a result of greater agricultural
productivity and diversification and of increased opportunities for non-farm
employment primarily through the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement and
small industries development, and also because of increasing construction
activities in the rural areas. The quality of life in these areas is to be
further enhanced by the provision of additional infrastructure facilities.
8.        The achievement of these goals would not require a change in the
basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has followed so
successfully since the mid-sixties. The Fourth Plan postulates an annual
rate of incease of exports of 16% in real terms, and a real growth rate of
14% per year will be required during the rest of the Plan period if the
target is to be met. The ratio of commodity exports to GNP is expected to
rise from the level of about 30% in 1976 to about 42% in 1981, with the
manufacturing sector providing about 92% of total commodities compared with
90% in 1976. This demands the achievement of continuous gains in efficiency
and productivity, further success in diversifying both exports and markets
and the maintenance of a favorable domestic policy environment. More than
half of Korea's manufactured goods still consists of textiles, garments,
electronics and footwear, but clearly Korea's comparative advantage is
starting to shift from unskilled labor-intensive items to more capital- and
skill-intensive products. Although not a critical factor at present, Korea
will in future face increasingly severe competition from the less industri-
ally advanced countries which are more amply endowed with natural resources
and where unskilled labor is cheaper. Furthermore, Korea is beginning to
experience constraints on the expansion of several traditional manufactured
exports due to its already dominant position in some cases (e.g., plywood)
and due, in other cases, to the trade restrictions imposed by some developed
countries (e.g., textiles and footwear).
9.        A changing pattern of exports reflecting and responding to shifting
comparative advantage is, therefore, essential for sustained export expansion.
Korean planners are conscious of the need to effect structural changes in ex-
ports and industrial output and are focusing on electronics and machinery
to achieve this. The achievement of the targets set for the export of
electronics, machinery and other capital goods generally requires a concerted
effort on a number of fronts. As the World Development Report points
out, the essential problems in expanding these exports are technological and
organizational. Action is required to bring about the assimilation or
learning of new technology, its adaptation to local needs and conditions,
technology innovation, the rationalization of production processes, quality
improvement and market devielopment, including the provision of export
credits on a significant scale if market penetration in the less developed
countries is to succeed.
10.       In the Korean context, the continued high rate of growth of the
economy is essential, since significant progress toward the basic equity



-;4 _
goals of improved income distribution and reduced poverty could be more
easily affordable when the growth of incomes is high. The predominant role
the export sector is expected to play is appropriate in view of Korea's
limited natural resources. Moreover, Korea has the manpower and the entrepre-
neurial capacity to implement the Plan's investment programs. The Fourth
Plan's priorities, strategy and programs, therefore, remain appropriate. The
Plan strikes a reasonable balance between the various objectives of increas-
ing employment, maintaining a minimum growth of per capita incomes, strength-
ening the balance of payments and making progress towards diversifying the
industrial structure so as to sustain export growth in the 1980s.
11.       Notwithstanding the efforts being made to increase the mobilization
of domestic resources, Korea will continue to need sizeable gross capital in-
flows. It is estimated that foreign capital commitments of about $3,000 mil-
lion would be required annually over the next several years. While Korea is
extending its use of commercial financing from the traditional suppliers and
private barik credits to Euro-dollar syndicated loans and bond issues in the
Furo-bond and Asia bond markets, the magnitude of its external capital
requirements is such that it will have to continue to rely on considerable
capital inflows from official sources, including Eximbanks. Servicing
of the debt should not pose serious difficulties given the present debt
service ratio and the prospects for continued export growth, provided that
the proportion of external debt incurred on shorter term and at high interest
rates is not excessive. On the assumption that Korea can obtain the required
inflow of capital on reasonable terms, the debt service ratio which now
stands at just over 10% is expected to remain at 10-11% until the end of the
decade and decline slowly thereafter.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       As of September 30, 1978, Korea had received 39 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, totalling $2,004.5 million in loans
and $106.8 million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the
refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan). As of that date
$889.7 million of the total Bank lending remained undisbursed on effective
Loans and Credits, mostly from commitments in the past two years.  Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Loans, IDA Credits, and IFC Investments
as of that date and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. As indicated
in the notes, progress on project implementation is generally satisfactory.
13.       In recent years, the thrust of the Bank Group's lending operations
in Korea has been directed towards assisting the Government's efforts: (a) to
secure the external resources required to supplement domestic savings in
sustaining a high GNP growth rate by following a policy of rapid export-
oriented industrialization; (b) to avoid the emergence of infrastructure
bottlenecks; and (c) to complement industrial development with agricultural
and rural development schemes aimed at bringing about a better dispersal of
the fruits of growth through raising incomes and improving the quality of
life in the rural areas.



- 5 -
14.       A substantial part of Bank financing has been directed towards the
vital industrial sector through our lending to Korea's three major development
banks.  The Korea Developnment Finance Corporation has received $220.0 mil-
lion, the Korea Developmernt Bank $252.5 million and the Medium Industry Bank
$85 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. This has re-
sulted not only in the overall development of the industrial sector, but has
also contributed to the achievement of institutional improvements and of
the Government's objective of decentralizing industry. The loan of $80
million for a Heavy Machinery Project was intended to assist in achieving
the structural shift to more skill-intensive industries, which is necessary
to ensure the long-term viability of Korea's export strategy.
15.       As Korea's economy continued to grow and the pace of industrializa-
tion has quickened, there has had to be a parallel expansion of transport fa-
cilities. The Bank Group,, through its assocation with the Government's effort
to modernize and expand the transport sector dating back to 1962, has played
an important role in these developments. Some $340 milion has been provided
for six railway projects designed to increase the railroad's capacity and im-
prove its operations; three loans totalling $191.5 million have been made for
highway construction and paving of high priority sections of the national
network and for a countrywide maintenance organization; and two loans amount-
ing to $147 million have been provided for the expansion of port facilities
at Busan, the premier port, and Mugho, primarily for improving coal handling
facilities.
16.       Korea's paucity of natural resources and dependence on the manufac-
turing segment of its economy has resulted in the adoption of a strategy
based on maximizing the advantages of a skilled and hard working labor force.
The Bank Group has been involved in helping to meet the requirements for
appropriately trained workers and certain categories of skilled manpower
through its lending for four education projects which have pursued the broad
objectives of technical manpower development either through the expansion of
relevant subsectors or through specific quality improvements. Together they
have catered to a broad range of manpower training needs within agriculture,
fisheries, industry and services.
17.       Korea's record of achievement in modernizing its agricultural
sector, although less spectacular than the gains made in the industrial
sphere, are nevertheless commendable. The past fifteen years have seen
agricultural output grow at about 4% per annum, which has resulted in
the country becoming near self-sufficient in its staple food, rice, and made
possible a steady and perceptible improvement in the living standards of the
40% of Korea's population who live in the countryside and rely primarily
on agrarian pursuits for their livelihood. The Bank has lent $325.5 million
for the improvement of irrigation facilities, land and seed development and
the provision of agricultural credit to farmers and processors of
agricultural products. In addition, $155 million has been provided for two
rural infrastructure projects in support of the Government's rural development
program initiated in 1971 to improve the quality of life and the standard
of living in the rural areas.



- 6 -
18.       The Bank's first essay into the field of regional development in
Korea through the project approved in January 1975 (Loan 1070-KO) has proved
successful. The project was designed to support the Government's policy by
financing high priority investments in the poor, primarily agricultural,
southwest region.
19.       Excluding one project that was cancelled subsequently, IFC had by
September 30, 1978, entered into 20 commitments totalling $71.3 million (net
of participation and cancellation). Korea's industrial development programs
have required large capital expenditures in the private sector, a situation
which has enabled a substantially enhanced IFC presence in the past few years.
20.       A primary objective of the Bank's future lending to Korea is to
assist it in sustaining its growth momentum. The basic issue in this connec-
tion is whether Korea can deepen and diversify its industrial structure to
the extent necessary to ensure that it attains its export targets. In addi-
tion to the proposed loan to KDFC, further loans are planned for the other
development banks. Lending to industry will be diversified by the provision
of a loan for a second machinery project which will provide financial and
technical assistance to small- and medium-scale machinery industries. It
will also be necessary to introduce RD&E programs which are better adapted to
the technological needs of industrial development. Projects for technologi-
cal development of the electronics and machinery industries are envisaged in
the program.
21.       Korea's industrialization program, which calls for entering into
more complex fields of manufacturing than hitherto, will require increasingly
high levels of technical competence on the part of its labor force. A loan
to modernize and expand the system of higher technical education so as to
increase its flexibility and responsiveness to the changing requirements
of the economy is, therefore, proposed.
22.       Another strand in the lending strategy is increased support of the
Government's efforts to spread the fruits of growth even more equitably by
the diversification and expansion of the output of the agricultural sector
and through nationwide development programs. Projects are envisaged for land/
water resource development, for agricultural credit, marketing and processing
and for the further development of rural infrastructure.
23.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural
sectors and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent
infrastructural development. Although the transport sector will be given
less emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus
there is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
24.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt dis-
bursed and outstanding at the end of 1977 was about 11%, and the share of
debt service was of the order of 6.0% at that time. These ratios are
expected to increase to around 13% and 7%, respectively, by the end of the
present decade.



- 7 -
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
25.       The fundamental changes in Korea's economy in the past decade were
accompanied by significanit changes in the transport sector. The railway
system, which had been rehabilitated following the Korean War and remained
for many years the only means of large-scale movement of goods and passengers,
has lost its preponderant position, although it still remains an important
mode of transport particularly for bulk commodities. A diversified road
transport network has been developed and about 5,500 km (nearly 60%) of the
national highway system is now paved. The number of private cars in relation
to population is lower than in such countries as Indonesia and the Philippines
although incomes are higher. The share of coastal goods transport in total
traffic has also increased markedly, primarily due to the movement of oil
products. The country's export drive and reliance on foreign trade has led
to a sixfold increase in the volume of port traffic and an eightfold increase
in Korea's international fleet in the last decade.
26.       As indicated in para. 15, the Bank Group, through its association
with the Government's efforts to modernize and expand the transport sector
dating back to 1962, has played an important role in these developments.
27.       As Korea's economy continues to grow and the pace of industrializa-
tion intensifies, there will have to be a corresponding expansion of transport
facilities. The internal transport system will have to cope with the movement
of large volumes of widely used bulk commodities such as coal, cement, oil,
iron and steel, and fertilizer. The industrial complexes which are burgeoning
on the south and southeastern coast and are planned in the southwest will
require the import of large amounts of raw materials and the transport of
intermediate products between plants. Some of these plants are likely also
to export large volumes of their output. In addition, a more diffuse pattern
of growth in non-bulk freight traffic and passenger traffic is expected to
result from the general growth of the economy.
28.       The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81) afforded an opportunity
to formulate and review :investment proposals related to the transport sector
on a more systematic basis than hitherto. Traffic trends were analyzed in
detail and the proposed investments are based on the assumption that Korea's
economy will continue to grow at about 9% per annum and that the deepening of
the industrial structure will intensify. The investments proposed amount to
about W2,800 billion and represent just over 14% of the total investment
called for in the Plan. The modal allocation, compared with that undertaken
during the Third Plan, is as follows:

The Fourth Plan allocation of total investment to the transport sector is
about the same percentage as in the Third Plan period, but represents an
increase of 50% in real terms. About half of the investment will be under-
taken by the public sector (mainly for highways, railways and ports) and the
other half by the private sector, for vehicles and ships. In broad terms,
the investment program appears to respond satisfactorily to the growing
demand for transport facilities and the intermodal allocation of investment
reflects the changing composition of demand. Specific investment projects
will continue to be subject to detailed economic and technical studies to
ensure that their objectives are met in the most economical manner.
Transport Policy Planning and Coordination
29.       The Government set up in 1970 a Transport Planning Office on the
recommendations of a study by consultants under a Bank Technical Assistance
Project and with assistance provided under subsequent road and railway
projects. Over the past three years, the Government has taken steps to
further improve transport coordination by establishing, in 1975, a Transport
Coordination Committee (TCC) consisting of nine directors, representing
ministries most directly concerned with transport matters, and a Transport
Coordination Office (TCO) in the Ministry of Transportation.  TCO's main
functions are to collect data and assist in the formulation and review of
transport policies, especially those related to pricing and regulations.
30.       While the charter of the TCC includes intermodal coordination of
transport sector investments, the TCC has not in fact exercised this function.
The Economic Planning Board (EPB), which exercises budgetary control and
plays a senior role with regard to all other ministries, has the dominant
role in decisions on investment projects. EPB intends to make much more
intensive reviews of investment projects and has established a separate
Bureau of Project Evaluation to this end. Sector studies covering major
aspects of transport coordination are being partly financed under the Sixth
Railway Loan (1542-KO). They will be carried out under the supervision of
EPB.

The Transport Modes
31.       The past and planned development of the various transport modes has
been influenced by: the nature of Korea's terrain (about two thirds of the
country is hilly); the concentration of economic activity and population
around the Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas; the location of the country's major
coal deposits, limestone and cement plants in the northeast; a long coastline
along which industrial activity is increasing; and the economic dependence on
the export of manufactured goods and import of bulk raw materials. The
major features of the transport system (illustrated in the attached Map) are
summarized below.
32.       Railways.  The semi-autonomous Korean National Railroad (KNR)
operates 3,097 route-km of standard gauge and 47 km of narrow gauge lines;
567 km are double track. The single track industrial lines between the
northeast mining and industrial areas and Seoul are electrified, as well as
suburban lines around Seoul.
33.       As indicated above, the share of rail transport fell considerably
over the last decade; the railways now carry only about 42% of the total
freight ton-km versus 78% in 1966, and 28% of intercity passenger-km versus
42% in 1966. Nevertheless, cost comparison indicates that rail transport is
still the most economic means of moving bulk traffic over medium and long
distances, and also has an important role to play in serving long distance
passenger traffic. In 1976, about 81% of rail freight traffic consisted of
six bulk commodities, coal, cement, ore, oil, fertilizer, and grain, as
against 69% in 1966. In addition to its long distance hauling of bulk
freight and passengers, KNR is expecteci to play a growing role in providing
rapid transit service for Seoul and its suburbs.
34.       Ports and Shipp:Lg.  Freight traffic through the ports has increased
from about 13 million tons in 1966 to over 80 million tons in 1976. This
tremendous increase resulted in serious port capacity problems, particularly
at Busan, the largest port, which handles 20% of the country's external
trade. The Bank has assisted the development of the port of Busan through
two projects and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is financing the expansion
of Incheon, the port nearest to Seoul. The Saudi Fund for Development
participated in the financing of the First Port Project (Loan 917-KO). The
Government has also developed a number of specialized ports serving specific
industrial sites, e.g. Bugpyeong handles cement and Pohang handles inbound
and outbound material for the steel mill located there.
35.       The role of coastal shipping has greatly increased in the last
decade from 10% of the ton-km moved in Korea in 1966 to 27% in 1976. This is
mainly due to the construction of industrial complexes at coastal locations,
and, to a lesser extent, to shortages in rail and road capacity. Korea's
share in the merchant shipping of its external trade has been increasing and
reached about 38% of total tonnage in 1976.
36.       Aviation.  Although domestic air passenger traffic has grown
rapidly, it still amounts to less than 1% of total passenger-km; airfreight



- 10 -
is also negligible. Domestic routes are served by the privately owned Korean
Airlines (KAL), which also operates internationally. Most international
traffic is handled at the Seoul-Kimpo International Airport; other inter-
national airports are at Busan and at Jeju Island, a major tourist center.
37.       Highways.  The public road network totals about 80,000 km consisting
of 9,400 km of national highways, 10,900 km of provincial roads, 12,500 km of
gun or county roads and some 47,000 km of village access roads. About
36,000 km of village roads had been constructed and improved under the
self-help Saemaul Movement at the end of 1977. The national highways include
about 640 km of grade separated toll expressways, of which about 500 km are
four-lane and 140 km are two-lane. Up to 1967, little had been done to
improve the roads, only 15% of the national roads were paved. Even now only
58% of the national highway system is paved, and 8% of the provincial roads
(compared with about 95% and 20% respectively in Thailand). The rapidly
growing demand for road transport requires the extensive improvement of the
highway network.
38.       During both the Second and Third Plan periods, road freight traffic
grew twice as fast as all freight traffic, averaging 38% p.a. in 1967-71 and
10.5% p.a. in 1972-76. Intercity passenger traffic on highways also grew
rapidly, at 16.6% p.a. in 1972-76. Despite the rapid road traffic growth,
the motor vehicle fleet in Korea is still small when compared with other
countries of similar and even lower income levels. The 275,000 four wheel
road vehicles presently registered in Korea amount to only 7.9 per 1,000
persons. The ratios are 14.3 in Thailand, 15.4 in the Philippines, and
48.2 in Malaysia. Only Malaysia has a higher per capita income than Korea.
There are many reasons why Korea's vehicle fleet is small: the high taxation
of private cars, the restrictive licensing of commercial vehicles, the high
cost of locally manufactured vehicles, and the fact that the road network
was developed only recently. With rapidly increasing incomes, however, there
is a growing demand for motor vehicles which could lead to a considerably
larger ratio of vehicles to population than at present.
39.       Recognizing the need to improve the highway system, the Government
plans to spend a total of W 458 billion at 1975 prices ($940 million) during
the FFYP (1977-81). This represents a 30% increase in real terms over the
previous Plan. Proposed road expenditures in the FFYP still reflect the
Government's priority of completing the improvements of the basic national
road system. However, the share of national roads expenditures in the total
is gradually being reduced. Under the FFYP, 3,700 km of national roads will
be improved and paved, bringing the proportion of national roads paved to
about 90% of the total. Improvement and paving of provincial or secondary
roads will gather momentum with a program of about 450 km. These roads come
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and not
under the Ministry of Construction (MOC) as in the case of the national
roads. A study financed by the proposed loan will review the need to improve
and strengthen the institutions dealing with lower class roads and, together
with a study of provincial roads under the Third Highway Project, determine
programs for the maintenance and improvement of such roads. The Government
will retain consultants for carrying out the studies of the institutions



- 11 -
concerned with provincial and gun roads, and of the maintenance and develop-
ment of such road systems; and will review with the Bank the findings of the
studies to be followed at appropriate stages with the selection of roads for
detailed engineering (Section 3.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
40.       The importance of maintenance was recognized early in the Bank
Group's lending operations for highways in Korea. In 1972, the HOC field
organization for maintain,ing national roads was set up in a pilot province
with technical assistance and equipment financed under the First Highway
Project. The organization was gradually extended to the entire country with
financing under the Second Highway Project, and in accordance with an agreed
time schedule modified under the Third Highway Project. However, since the
organization became fully operational in 1977, budgetary provisions have
been only half the target: figures agreed during negotiations of the Third
Highway Project. During negotiations agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment on adequate provision for maintenance through annual budgetary approp-
riations (Section 4.05 of- the draft Loan Agreement). Maintenance of lower
class roads under the MOHIA will be studied under the proposed project
(Section 3.05 and Part B of Schedule 2 to the draft Loan Agreement).
41.       The three previous Bank financed highway projects have had a major
impact in assisting the Government with the construction and improvement of
its national road system, with institution building in MOC, and with formulat-
ing revised policies affecting the whole transport sector. Assistance with
institution building was provided for setting up the Bureau of Public Works
(BPR), the MOC's field oganization for maintaining the national highways, and
for improving the MOC's planning capability. Technical assistance was also
extended to help set up the Transport Coordination Office in HIOT. Significant
policy changes which were evolved through the highway projects include the
adoption of more appropriate road standards, relaxation of restrictive
licensing of the road transport industry, revision of regulations governing
vehicle weights and dimensions, and a modified Government policy on toll
roads requiring financial and economic studies prior to levying tolls on any
road. A major advance is the introduction of a satisfactory organization for
maintaining national roads, which should be fully effective when it receives
adequate budgetary provision. Indirectly, the three highway projects have
helped promote the Korean contracting industry through a steady and
gradually increasing stream of contracts, and Korean consulting firms through
their association with foreign consultants on the design of the projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
42.       The objectives of the proposed project are to assist in improving
the highway system to cope with the growing traffic by extending the network
of paved highways by some 1,230 ki, and by preparing a program for improving
the maintenance and development of the provincial and county (gun) road
systems. The project was appraised in April 1978. A Staff Appraisal Report
based on the findings of the mission (No. 2186-KO dated November 16, 1978) is



- 12 -
being circulated separately. Supplementary project data are provided in
Annex III. Negotiations were held in Washington from October 30 to
November 3, 1978 with a Government team led by Mr. Hung-Ki Kim, Director-
General, Bureau of Foreign Capital Management, Economic Planning Board.
43.       The project consists of:
(a) construction and improvement, including paving and supervision by
consultants, of 36 sections of national roads totalling about 950 km;
(b) construction and improvement, including paving and supervision by
consultants, of 10 sections of provincial roads totalling about 280 km;
(c) procurement of additional road maintenance equipment for maintaining
the national roads;
(d) a study by consultants of the institutions involved in the planning,
design, maintenance, construction, administration and financing of
provincial and county (gun) roads, and the preparation of a program
for improving the organization and functions of such institutions,
upgrading provincial and gun road maintenance and the future
development of the gun road system, to be followed by detailed
engineering of about 2,000 km of gun roads; and
(e) provision of fellowships for training staff of the MOC.
Cost and Financing
44.       The estimated total cost of the project, including contingencies,
is about $378 million. The foreign exchange component, which will be fi-
nanced by the proposed loan, is $143 million. Detailed cost estimates are
given in the Loan and Project Summary. The foreign exchange component of the
cost of highway construction and improvement has been estimated at 42% (ex-
cluding right of way), on the assumption that all contracts would be won by
local contractors, as was the case under the previous three projects. The
Korean Government would be responsible for financing the local cost component
and confirmed its ability to do so from its budgetary resources.
Execution
45.       The MOC will be responsible for carrying out the project, through
its BPR, as for the three previous highway projects, except for the studies
of provincial and gun roads for which the MOHA will be responsible. The MOC
will be assisted in supervising the construction and improvement work by the
same consultants who carried out the engineering. The MOHA will be assisted
by consultants in carrying out the studies of the institutions concerned with
provincial and gun roads, and of their maintenance, and the detailed engineer-
ing of gun roads for preparation of future projects. The estimated cost per
man-month of consultants' services (excluding travel and local subsistence
allowance), for supervision of construction and the study of provincial and
gun roads is $7,500 for the small number of senior foreign consultants staff
to be employed, and $3,100 for Korean consultants; the corresponding costs,
including travel and allowances, are $9,700 and $3,600.

Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Contracts for road construction and improvement will be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding among prequalified firms, in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement". Road maintenance
equipment will be procured through contracts awarded after international
competitive bidding, also in accordance with the "Guidelines for Procurement";
a margin of preference equal to the import duties and taxes, or 15%, whichever
is lower, will be allowed to domestic manufacturers.
47.      Disbursements from the loan will be made over 4 years on the basis
of:
(a) 42% of the total cost of construction and improvement;
(b) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported road maintenance equipment; or
the ex-factory price, excluding identifiable taxes and duties, of
locally manufactured equipment;
(c) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of consultant's services; and
(d) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of fellowships.
A disbursement schedule is given in the Loan and Project Summary.
Benefits and Economic Return
48.       Together with tbhe ongoing Third Project, this project will help
the Government in achievin,g its targets for road improvement during the FFYP
(1977-81). The two projects will assist in financing about 50% of the
national road paving program (1,750 km out of 3,700 km).  ADB will finance
another 760 km, and the Government will fund the remaining 1,200 km entirely
from its own resources. I'he proposed project will also partially finance 60%
of the provincial road paving program (280 km out of 450 km). ADB is consider-
ing assistance for another 120 km, leaving 50 km for the Governmenl to
finance entirely on its own. The project supports the Government's strategy
of paving existing gravel roads, which still account for 40% of the national
network, rather than constructing new high standard highways. This approach
of minimizing and phasing investments increases the rate of return of road
projects and enables the highway system to meet a much larger total transport
demand at lower cost; it follows the recommendations of the Bank.
49.       The project roads are scattered throughout the northern two thirds
of the country, with some concentration on the west coast and in the eastern
mountains. Roads in the west will improve general transport and communications
in a heavily populated, well endowed, agricultural area, and provide faster
access to the provincial capital of Daejon. They will also enable fuller use
of potential distance sav:Lngs between the western coastal area and Seoul
afforded by roadways built on new dams on the Asan Bay. Roads in the eastern
mountains which produce primarily coal and cement will reduce the transport
cost of these commodities and improve the living conditions in these less



- 14 -
developed areas by increasing mobility and reducing dust pollution. The
other project roads will improve access and transport facilities within
predominantly rural areas, which are presently isolated by the poor condition
of existing roads.
50.       Traffic on project roads ranged from 120 to 2,500 vehicles per day
in 1975, with a median around 250 vehicles/day. The typical distribution of
vehicles is cars and taxis 20%, buses 25%, and trucks 55%. Traffic is
expected to continue growing rapidly at around 7% p.a. for trucks and buses
and over 10% p.a. for cars and taxis. In 1982, when the project roads would
be completed, traffic on them is expected to range from 300 to over 5,000
vehicles/ day, with a median over 500 vehicles/day.
51.       As the project encompasses a wide variety of major roads in many,
disparate regions of Korea, it will raise the overall efficiency of Korea's
transport system and thereby contribute to general economic growth. While
this contribution is real, it cannot readily be fully quantified. Measurable
benefits of the project are mainly in vehicle operating cost savings due to
the improved conditions of the paved roads compared with the existing rough
gravel roads. For the typical road, total benefits following paving would be
distributed among various users as follows: cars and taxis less than 10%,
buses about 40%, trucks over 50%. The roads in isolated rural areas will
stimulate a diversification of agricultural production as well as favor
socioeconomic contacts between the rural population and other parts of the
country. The construction of project roads will require an average of about
9,000 workers over a 33 month period, creating a total of about 300,000
man-month of employment, 60% of which would be for unskilled labor. The new
pavements would also bring non-quantified benefits, such as quicker and
better services and improved environmental conditions through a reduction of
heavy dust and mud which cover villages and fields along existing gravel
roads which carry much traffic.
52.       The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project roads, calculated
over an assumed 20 years service life, range from 16% to over 40% excluding
passenger time savings. The weighted average ERR for all project roads which
account for 96% of total project cost is 26%. This rate of return excludes
investment in road maintenance equipment totalling 2% of project cost; and
studies and training totalling 2% of project cost. Sensitivity tests assuming
substantial increases in construction cost and decreases in benefits have
shown that, even under the pessimistic assumptions of a 20% increase in costs
or a 20% reduction in benefits, the project would have a weighted average
ERR of over 20% and would thus remain well justified. There are no special
risks associated with the proposed project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the Bank,
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed to the Executive



- 15 -
Directors separately. The draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern
of Loan Agreements relating to highway projects. Special conditions of the
project are listed in Section III of Annex III.
54.       1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Agricultural Sector
Loan No. 795      Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; $33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283   and $15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project, located in one of the most drought-prone areas of
Korea, provides four storage! dams, canal systems and land development to
irrigate 33,700 ha. The project was delayed initially by modifications
in the design of the dams and later when rapid inflation outpaced the
allocation of local funds. The dams have now been completed and about
19,000 ha was irrigated in 1977. Good progress is being made on other
works which are expected to be completed before the end of 1978, about
18 months behind schedule. Consequently, the Closing Date has been extended
from September 30, 1977 to December 31, 1978. The project cost is estimated
at about $151 million compared to $88.6 million at appraisal, but because
of increases in rice and barley prices, the economic rate of return is
expected to be close to the appraisal estimate of 13%.
Loan No. 942      Seeds Project; $7.0 Million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1979
Progress of implementation is satisfactory and physical implemen-
tation should be completed by June 1979, one year later than the appraisal
estimate. The closing date has been postponed from December 1978 to December
1979. The four seed potato storage and processing plants are expected to be
completed in 1978. The final two cereal plants should be completed and ready
for operations by June 1979. Disbursements are now 46% of the loan amount,
however, it is estimated th,at disbursements will be nearly completed by June
1979. All plants will operate on a pilot basis in 1979 and would reach an
average of 75% of capacity by 1980.
Loan No. 994      Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project;
$13.0 Million Loan of June 7, 1974; Effective Date:
March 19, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This project provides long-term funds to the Agriculture and
Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC) for onlending to subborrowers in the

private sector for the purpose of integrating on-farm production of fruits
and vegetables with modern, hygienic processing facilities, using land that
was idle or underutilized. The vegetables and fruits involved are mainly
asparagus, shiitake (oak mushroom), spinach, mushroom, strawberry and peach.
Implementation of the project was delayed by about 18 months owing to lack
of loan demand for some of the processing facilities included in the project.
However, the project is now progressing satisfactorily since September 1977
when the Bank approved AFDC's proposal to widen the project's scope to meet
changed investor demand. Under the revised scope, AFDC will finance
processing and cold storage of fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, and also
fruit juice extraction and concentration and vegetable drying, for which the
loan demand is strong. Subloan applications and approvals have increased
significantly, and AFDC expects to disburse all the project funds by the end
of 1979. Disbursements as of September 30, 1978 were over 56% of the loan.
Loan No. 1193    Second Integrated Dairy Development Project;
$15.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1976; Effective Date:
November 11, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project consists of: (a) the establishment of about 450 new
dairy farms; (b) the continuation of the development begun as part of the
First Integrated Dairy Beef Project on about 400 dairy farms; (c) the expan-
sion of existing processing plants, the diversification of their production,
the establishment of 2 milk collection centers and 50 small milk cooling
units and the construction of a milk products plant at Yeongnam; and (d) the
expansion of technical services for bot'i farm development and milk processing.
Effectiveness of the project was delayed for about a year, but farm develop-
ment is progressing rapidly and the project may be completed within the
period originally foreseen. Although technical assistance for new farmers
has been somewhat weak, the Korea Dairy Beef Company (KDBC) is in the
process of strengthening its farm advisory staff. Construction of KDBC's
new processing plant and expansion of one of the existing plants are under
way. KDBC's financial situation improved over the course of 1976 and the
company showed a profit for the first time in 1977. Prospects are for
continued, gradual improvement. As of September 30, 1978, disbursements were
over 69% of the loan.
Loan No. 1216    Rural Infrastructure Project; $60.0 Million Loan of which
Loan No. 1218T   $40.0 Million Third Window of March 19, 1976; Effective Date:
June 4, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Project implementation is proceeding very well. The Fuelwood,
Roads and Bridges, Water Supply and Rural Electrification components were
completed by the end of 1977. Minor Irrigation has experienced some delays,
mainly the result of budgetary shortages and a cost overrun of 18%, but
should be substantially completed by early 1979. Upland reclamation is
proceeding in accordance with the revised time schedule and will be
completed in 1978. Project monitoring and reporting continue to be satis-
factory and a good start has been made on the Hydrologic Services Study and a

major project evaluation study. The estimated cost of the project is likely
to be 16% above the appraisal estimate, mostly as a result of cost overruns
for Minor Irrigation and Rural Electrification and an increase in the size of
the Water Supply component. Disbursements are practically in line with
appraisal estimates.
Loan No. 1319    Miho Waterslhed Area Development Project; $29.0 Million
Loan of August 5, 1976; Effective Date: October 21, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
This project, located in the central region of Korea, is being
financed under the first Bank loan for area development in Korea. A project
office has been established, and construction work has started on the first
of five major civil work contracts. Altogether, the five contracts will
involve construction of 8 large and 19 small earthfill dams, 284 km of main
and secondary canals and land development for irrigating 12,700 ha. The
project, which will require five years to complete, also involves construction
of 80 km of river channel improvement and 150 km of village access roads, as
well as feasibility studies for a second stage project in the Miho Watershed.
Loan No. 1328    Second Agricultural Credit Project; $20.0 Million Loan
of October 12, 1976; Effective Date: March 10, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project is a continuation and expansion of the agricultural
program financed under the First Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 335-KO).
It provides funds to the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF)
for medium and long-term loans to farmers, through selected Gun (county)
cooperatives of NACF, for investments in apple orchard development, silkworm
rearing houses, sprinkler irrigation for orchards, greenhouses for vegetable
production, and on-farm storage. The project became effective on March 10,
1977 and lending to subborr,awers commenced in the following month. Project
implementation and lending to farmers are generally progressing satisfactorily,
with lending in 1977 exceeding the appraisal estimate. As of September 30,
1978, disbursements were about 37% of the total loan.
Loan No. 1364    Yong San Gang Irrigation Project Stage II; $95.0 Million
Loan of February 11, 1977; Effective Date: April 22, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project will provide irrigation and land development on
20,700 ha in the lower reaches of the Yong San River. Project works include
an estuary dam, sea dike, pumping stations, irrigation canals, reclamation of
5,500 ha of tidal lands, conversion of 3,250 ha of uplands for irrigation of
paddy, land consolidation of 3,200 ha, and irrigation of 1,050 ha of uplands.
Construction of the access roads and a portion of the estuary dam was recently
completed. The main contract for estuary dam construction was awarded in

Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project will benefit some 23,000 farm families by providing
new irrigation on 7,100 ha, improved irrigation and drainage on 3,700 ha and
a more assured water supply on an additional 1,500 ha. Project work consists
of nine pumping stations, 190 km of main and secondary canals and land
development including 5,800 ha of land consolidation, 2,500 ha of improved
drainage (of which 1,500 ha would also be consolidated), 2,200 ha of tertiary
irrigation and conversion of 1,800 ha of upland and forest to paddy land.

March 13, 1978; Effective Date: June 8, 1978;
Closing Date: June 12, 1982
The project would assist the Government's program to intensify
agricultural production, thereby raising rural incomes and foodgrain produc-
tion, and to improve the quality of rural life. The project includes
60 irrigation subprojects on about 9,200 ha, construction of water supply
systems in about 7,400 villages, construction or improvement of about
2,500 km of river banks, connnection of about 2,700 villages to the telephone
network and the installation of about 75,000 subscriber's lines, and training
and project monitoring and evaluation. The project would benefit about
7.7 million people or about 48% of Korea's rural population.
Industrial Sector
Loan No. 1145    Fifth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
$55.0 Million Loan of July 23, 1975; Effective Date:
September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The loan covered about half the KDFC's foreign exchange require-
ments through the end of 1977. The proceeds are being used to finance
direct imports of machinery and equipment, and the foreign exchange component
of domestically-produced capital goods and of civil works.  Over 99% of the
loan proceeds have already been disbursed. KDFC's performance in using
the loan has been highly satisfactory.

Loan No. 1338    Second Korea Development Bank Project; $82.5 Million
Loan, of which $7.5 Million for the Korea Industrial
Leasing Cornpany, of December 23, 1976; Effective Date:
March 21, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project provides $75.0 million to be used by KDB to make
subloans and investments to finance direct imports for industrial subprojects
during the period 1977-78; ithe remainder of the loan, $7.5 million, was
relent by KDB to its wholly-owned subsidiary KILC, to acquire machinery,
equipment, facilities and other property to be leased to investment enter-
prises. Commitment of funds is progressing as expected; as of September 30,
1978, disbursements were over 68% of the total loan amount.
Loan No. 1461    Sixth Korea Development Finance Corporation Project;
$70.0 Million Loan of June 30, 1977; Effective Date:
September 15, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The loan was made to help cover the foreign exchange requirements
of industrial subprojects to be financed by KDFC subloans in 1977-78.
KDFC's performance has been very satisfactory. As of September 30, 1978,
commitments reached $69.0 million.
Loan No. 1466    Heavy Machinery Project; $80.0 Million Loan of
June 30, 1977; Effective Date: December 1, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
The project is designed to manufacture equipment required for
power generation, steel mills, and chemical and petrochemical plants. It
consists of:  (a) foundry aLnd forge shops; (b) fabrication shops; (c) machine
shops; (d) assembly and test shops; (e) support facilities; (f) other auxili-
ary facilities; and (g) technical assistance. Project costs have been
increased by 24% above the appraisal estimate due to addition of equipment
to meet increased emphasis in nuclear power plant in KECO's construction
program; and depreciation of the US Dollar since appraisal. Project imple-
mentation is proceeding well, although increased project scope and some
procurement delays have extended the targeted completion date to April 1980.
The company has submitted a plan of action to achieve, by year-end the
debt equity ratio to 70:30 level specified in the Project Agreement. As of
September 30, 1978, disbursements were over 20% of the total loan amount.
Loan No. 1507    Second Medium Industry Bank Project; $55.0 Million Loan
of January 4, 1978; Effective Date: March 10, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project provides $55.0 million, to be used by MIB to help
cover the foreign exchange requirements of industrial subprojects over four
years. A substantial portion of the loan - $20.0 million - would be earmarked
to assist small-scale, labor-intensive subprojects creating employment at a
gross capital cost per job not greater than $6,000 or enterprises whose fixed
assets are not greater than $250,000. As of September 30, 1978, disbursements
were over 36% of the loan amount.

Loan No. 1574      Third Korea Development Bank Project; $110 Million Loan
of June 21, 1978; Effective Date: September 14, 1978;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The loan would be used to help cover the foreign exchange require-
ments of subprojects to be financed by KDB; apart from direct imports, the
loan would be utilized by KDB to finance the foreign exchange component of
domestically produced capital goods. An amount of up to $10.0 million of
the proceeds of the proposed loan would be made available to KDB's subsidiary,
the Korea Industrial Leasing Corporation Ltd. (KILC), by way of subloans in
order to finance small- and medium-sized leasing projects. Overall progress
is satisfactory. Commitments started in October 1978.
Education Sector
Loan No. 906      Second Education Project; $23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394   $20.0 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project provides equipment for, and extensions to, 85 educa-
tional institutions at secondary, post secondary and university levels. It
also includes preinvestment studies on health and management education. The
Loan/Credit funds are mainly used to finance equipment, with the Government
financing the related civil works. Project execution is now about two years
behind schedule. Initial project actions were slow owing to staff shortages
in the Project Implementation Unit and the Office of Supply (OSROK), causing
delays in the preparation of designs and equipment lists. A government
internal review of procurement procedures halted equipment procurement for
almost a year. These problems are now largely resolved and the project has
been making steady progress. About 70% of the equipment has been contracted,
and 40% delivered; furniture procurement has been completed; civil works are
about 90% complete; and the fellowship program is well under way. However,
because of the initial delays and some project changes recently requested by
the Borrower, the project is now expected to be completed by June 1979;
consequently, the Closing Date was extended to December 31, 1979 to allow
time for the completion of procurement. The Credit has been totally disbursed
as well as 33% of the total loan amount. Disbursements are expected to improve
rapidly as an additional 45% of the Loan is fully committed.
Loan No. 1096    Third Education Project; $22.5 Million Loan of March 31,
1975; Effective Date: June 6, 1975; Closing Date: June 30,
1980
The project includes assistance for extensions and equipping of
nine institutions (technical, agricultural and fisheries) under the Ministry
of Education (MOE) and seven vocational training institutes (VTIs) under the
Administrator of Labor Affairs (ALA). Project implementation is about
one year behind schedule. Lack of counterpart funds for consultants' fees
during the first 20 months delayed preparation of the design and bidding
documents in the MOE component. Changes of the training program of the ALA



ANNEX II

component during implementation necessitated revisions and subsequent delays;
however, because of recent progress in both MOE and ALA components, these
delays will not affect the Closing Date of June 30, 1980. Project costs are
below the appraisal estimaltes. As of September 30, 1978, disbursements were
around 34% of the total loan and should improve significantly in the months
ahead.
Loan No. 1474    Vocational Training Project; $23.0 Million Loan of
July 22, 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The loan provides funds to help finance: (a) construction of and
equipment for 8 Vocational Training Institutes (VTIs), with 450 places each
with boarding facilities; (b) equipment for the Central Vocational Training
Institute (CVTI); and (c) expert services for the Vocational Training Bureau
(VTB), and specialist services to the CVTI and VTIs. Since effectiveness,
overall progress has been satisfactory. About 25% of the civil works had been
tendered by June 1978 (two' of the eight VTIs), equipment lists for the two
VTIs (25% of the total) have also been prepared by the Project Implementation
Unit and approved by the Bank. Adequate local funds have been provided.
Tourism Sector
Loan No. 953      Kyongju Tourism Project; $25.0 Million Loan of
January 4, 1974; Effective Date: May 6, 1974;
Closing I)ate: December 31, 1978
The project forms part of the first phase of the planned develop-
ment of the Bomun Lake resort near Kyongju. It provides for a multipurpose
dam; an irrigation system for about 1,200 ha; improvement and expansion of
the water supply and sewerage and solid waste disposal systems for the city
of Kyongju and the resort area; installation of electrical supply and tele-
communication facilities for the resort area; the construction and/or realign-
ment of about 57 km of roads, infrastructure, including storm water drain-
age, environmental sanitation, community facilities, and a golf course; and
and a school for training hotel personnel. Project implementation is now
progressing satisfactorily although completion of some project components is
likely to be delayed by about a year, due mainly to budgetary constraints.
The Government has now taken steps to provide all needed funds. The delay
has had no adverse effects on hotel development. The first two hotels with
600 rooms are under construction and are scheduled to commence operations in
the spring of 1979. Negctiations with other private investors are under way
for a third hotel and also for apartments and restaurants in the Bomun
resort area. About 72% of the loan had been disbursed as of September 30,
1978.

Loan No. 1070    Secondary Cities Regional Project; $15.0 Million
Loan of January 15, 1975; Effective Date: August 18,
1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Implementation of the Secondary Cities Regional Project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. Three housing sites, two access roads and a city
market have been completed. Construction contracts on the remaining two
subprojects are nearly on schedule. Tenders for the ninth subproject are
being evaluated. Allocation of housing plots has been completed at all
three sites and construction of core houses is under way. After the initial
delays, mainly in fulfilling conditions of effectiveness and establishing
the Gwangju Regional Development Unit, the project has moved extremely well.
Total project costs are now estimated at $22.6 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of $25.0 million ($20.8 million at current exchange
rate). As of September 30, 1978, disbursement was about 65% of the loan
amount.

to March 31, 1979 to allow time for the completion of procurement.
Loan No. 917      Ports Project; $80.0 Million Loan of June 27, 1973;
Effective Date: September 18, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
Nine civil works contracts and ten equipment supply contracts
are already let and work is proceeding satisfactorily. Contract work is also
progressing on the grain handling facil:ity and the grain silo; work on the
head house foundations has been completed. All cargo-handling equipment is
on site and under erection. Overall the project is about 90% completed.
Total cost is currently estimated to be $144 million with a foreign exchange
component of about $102 million. The loan provides $80 million foreign
exchange and the overrun is being financed by a loan of $35 million from the
Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). The Korea Maritime and Port Authority

(KMPA) is adequately staffed, but there has been a delay in implementing
operational and financial procedures recommended by consultants appointed to
advise KMPA on these matters. Consultants for the implementing phase have
now been selected by KMPA and the contract recently awarded. Around 81% of
the loan proceeds have already been disbursed.
Loan No. 956      Second Highway Project; $47.0 Million Loan of January 25,
1974; Effective Date: April 4, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978
The works, consisting of construction, chiefly on new alignments,
of about 130 km of highways and paving, chiefly on existing alignments, of
a further 634 km of national highways were completed on schedule and the
highways opened to traffic: in October 1975. The cost, in US dollar equi-
valent, exceeded the estimate by about 5%. Feasibility studies for future
projects of about 1,000 krm of roads were started in August 1975, followed by
detailed engineering. Delay occurred in setting up a new nationwide highway
maintenance organization but the organization has now been established in
accordance with decrees published in June 1975.  All the maintenance offices
have been constructed and staffed and equipment procured under the loan.
The Government has agreed to increase the budgetary allocations to enable
an adequate program of periodic maintenance to be carried out. By the end
of September 1978, disbursements exceeded 99%, after extending the Closing
Date by a year to allow for procurement of spare parts needed for the
maintenance equipment.
Loan No. 1101    Fifth Railway Project; $100.0 Million Loan of April 10,
1975; Effective Date: July 15, 1975; Closing Date:

The project will help the Korean National Railroad (KNR) continue
as a major carrier of freight and passengers by providing for: the upgrading,
modernization and expansion of track, rolling stock, motive power, and
other equipment; the improvement of the efficiency of operation; and the
strengthening of its financial position. The main components of the project
are: an increase in station and line capacity and improvements in signaling;
acquisition of rolling stock, diesel and electric locomotives, spare parts
and repair facilities; track renewal and improvement; bridge strengthening;
