FOURTH STRUCTURAL ADJIISTMENT LOAN
Loan Summary
Borrower            :    Repub:Lic of Turkey
Loan Amount              US$300.8 million equivalent in various currencies
(including the capitalized front-end fee).
Terms               :    17 years including 4 years' grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Description         :    The proposed loan would be the fourth in a series of
loans to support the Government's structural
adjustment program initiated in January 1980. The
principal aim of the program is to redirect the
Turkish economy towards a development path placing
more reliance on market forces and adopting a more
outward-oriented strategy. The measures to be taken
in this phase of the stabilization program are
outlined in the Government's Statement of Development
Policies - 1983, and fall into two main categories:
(a) At the macroeccnomic level, the program includes
the development of a medium-term framework,
continued rationalization of the public
investment program, reform of the State Economic
Enterprises, import liberalization and export
incentives;
(b) At the sectoral. level, the program includes the
implementation of measures to address structural
issues in the financial, agricultural and energy
sectors.
The loan would finance all imports with the exception
of items financed bv other sources, military or
para-military items,, luxury goods and nuclear reactors.
Risks               .    The main risks arise from uncertainties in the
external environment, including adverse developments
in the growth of trade, and internal factors which
might. impede the Government's determination to carry
out the reforms designed to restore domestic and
external financial 4equilibrium, rationalize investment
and carry out SEE reform.



- iv -
Estimated
Disbursements     :    The proceeds of the loan would be disbursed in two
tranches, $200 million equivalent soon after
effectiveness, and the remaining $100.8 million
equivalent after a performance review to be held in
January 1984.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED FOURTH STRUCTURAIL ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Fourth
Structural Adjustment Loan to the Republic of- Turkey for the equivalent of
US$300.8 million to support the Government's program of structural reforms
designed to restore financial equilibrium and achieve sustainable growth. The
loan would have a term of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects for
Growth" (No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript th,sreto were distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1979 and Maroh 1980 respectively. The
updating of the economic analysis has since been undertaken through the
continuing work on structural adjustment loans (SALs) to Turkey and several
special economic studies. The report of the economic mission in
November/December 1980 to evaluate the investment program and entitled
"Turkey:  Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU) was distributed to
the Executive Directors in December 1981. The report of another mission in
May/June 1981 to review Turkey's industrialization and trade strategy,
entitled "Turkey: Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), was
distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1982. A mission to update
economic developments visited Turkey in June 1982. Its report, entitled
"Turkey: Recent Economic Developments and Medium-Term Prospects"
(No. 4287-TU), is being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. A
report on the energy sector prepared under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy
Sector Assessment Program was issued in March 1983. 1/ Sector studies are
also currently being prepared for the agriculture and financial sectors and
should be ready later this year.
3.       Turkey is about as big as France and Germany combined, with estimated
GNP per capita of $1,540 in 1981. With a population of around 46 million, the
density is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural land), although the
rate of urbanization is high (about 45 percent). The population growth rate
(2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income countries. But
the employment situation has deteriorated steadily, with unemployment
currently about 16 percent, despite rapid economic growth in the mid-70s and
substantial emigration of workers to Western Europe and, more recently, to the
Middle East. There is little or no absolute poverty, but income distribution
is still relatively skewed. Data for more recent periods are incomplete but
indicate a deterioration in the position of most wage and salary earners over
the last few years, with a sharp real decline in the minimum wage. There are
1/  Turkey:  Issues and Options in the Energy Sector (No. 3877-TU), March 1983.



- 2-
also considerable regional differences and large rural-urban disparities.
Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the rate of adult literacy
remains relatively low (60 percent in 1975).
4.        Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy, even though
its relative importance is declining. It contributes 21 percent of GDP
(1982), employs about 53 percent of the labor force, and provides about half
of merchandise exports (including processed food). Turkey is one of the very
few developing countries which is self-sufficient in food. It has a modern
irrigated sector producing cash crops and most exports, and a traditional
rain-fed sector emphasizing grains and livestock mainly on the Anatolian
plateau. Turkey has considerable potential for expanding agricultural
production and exports, but faces major constraints such as inadequate
research and extension services, insufficient credit, and poor utilization of
irrigated areas.
5.        The major emphasis of past development strategy was on rapid
industrialization. Thus, in the 1970s the industrial sector absorbed up to
30 percent of total investment and today accounts for 27 percent of GDP and
nearly 60 percent of exports (mainly textiles, processed foods, and leather
products), but only 10 percent of the labor force. The private sector is
dominant in exports and accounts for some 60 percent of industrial
value-added. The aim of industrial policy had been to achieve
self-sufficiency through import substitution, while giving exports a secondary
role. The principal policy instruments were large public investments in State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) and high levels of protection for private
investment. These policies yielded high growth rates and an expansion of
domestic production of some key basic and intermediate goods, but they also
resulted in the establishment of high cost uncompetitive industries--both
private and public--with limited export possibilities.
6.        Turkey has large underdeveloped energy resources (hydropower and
lignite), but little petroleum. Energy consumption has grown in line with
GDP, but remains below the per capita average for middle-income developing
countries. Oil imports accounted for over 85 percent of oil consumption and
cost $3.6 billion in 1982, equivalent to about 63 percent of exports. Even
though the value of oil imports as a percentage of export earnings has fallen,
the energy situation remains a major preoccupation of the Government. Prices
for most products--especially petroleum products--have been brought into line
with international prices since 1980.  Investments in energy have the largest
share in the public investment program. The principal impediments to
development of the sector include institutional constraints, insufficient
financial resources for exploration, inadequate project implementation
capacity, and the absence of comprehensive energy demand management.
7.        The economic policies pursued during the seventies led to rapid
economic growth, especially in industry, until the mid-1970s. By then the
incipient problems were greatly aggravated by the rise in the cost of oil and
other imports wihich led to a sharp deterioration in Turkey's terms of trade.



The response was inappropriate--continued expansionary policies and
capital-intensive import-substituting investment, based mainly on external
borrowing, much of it short-term. The rapid GNP growth, averaging 7.7 percent
per year in 1973-76, came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as the massive external
debt burden lk-d to a loss of creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports,
disruptions in industrial production, and a rapid rise in urban unemployment.
By the end of 1979, GNP growth was negative, the budget deficit was 4 percent
of GNP, and the inflation rate had accelerated to 64 percent. Throughout the
crisis of 1977-79, economic management remained weak. It was not until
January 1980 that the Government launched a policy of structural adjustment
placing a greater reliance on market forces and an outward orientation.
8.       A military government assumed power in September 1980 following a
period of sustained unrest. This government:, like previous military regimes
in 1960-61 and 1971-73, has emphasized its commitment to restore civilian
rule. A Consultative Assembly was set up to draft a new constitution, which
was overwhelmingly endorsed in a nationwide referendum in November 1982.
Parliamentary elections based on new election and party laws are scheduled for
November 1983.
PART II - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROCESS: 1980-82
9.       The Government's program of January 1980 for restructuring the
Turkish economy was a major departure from the policies pursued over the
previous two decades. The principal goals of the new program were to shift
from an inward-looking to an outward-oriented strategy, and to place greater
reliance on the interplay of market forces. The early stages of the program
focused on stabilizing a crisis situation through a series of measures
designed to correct serious external and dormestic imbalances. With the easing
of the immediate crisis, the Government was able to develop a more
comprehensive set of adjustment policies.
10.      The structural adjustment program seeks to make the transition from
an industrialization strategy based on import substitution to one with an
outward orientation, through measures designed to stabilize the economy while
laying the foundation for sustainable growth over the medium term. The
program includes the following main features;
(i) a realistic and flexible exchange rate;
(ii) incentives to encourage producers to export;
(iii) tight monetary conditions to restrain domestic demand and
control inflation;
(iv) improved external debt management;
(v) deregulation of interest rates to encourage private savings;

(vi) steps to improve institutional efficiency in key sectors;
(vii) rationalization of the public investment program;
(viii) initiation of SEE reforms to reduce the burden on public
finances and improve their efficiency; and
(ix) progressive liberalization of imports including the elimination
of quantitative restrictions and the rationalization of the
tariff structure.
11.      From the outset it was clear that the structural adjustment process
would be a medium-term effort, as it represented a fundamental change in
attitudes, institutions, and policies. The Government's approach has been to
proceed on a year-by-year basis, setting targets in the annual programs that
are formulated in line with the overall objectives.
12.      After three years of the structural adjustment process, it is
possible to take a broad look at the achievements of the 1980-82 period, which
suggest striking success in some areas, less so in others, and some unresolved
problems. Throughout the period, the reform program was strictly adhered to.
Most fiscal and monetary targets in the stabilization program were met,
although there were some slippages. Major structural reforms in the tax
system, the import and export regimes, the SEE pricing mechanism, public
investment, the liberalization of interest rates, and the adoption of a daily
fluctuating exchange rate, all contributed to substantial short-term progress
with favorable longer-term implications. After two consecutive years of
decline, real GNP grew in 1981 and 1982 by 4.2 percent and 4.4 percent
respectively (Table 1). This was due primarily to significant improvements in
the foreign balance since the stabilization program allowed for only slight
increases in domestic demand.
13.      Growth in 1981 and 1982 was not even across sectors.  1981 saw a low
rate of growth of agriculture compensated by a relatively high growth rate in
the industrial sector. By contrast, in 1982 the agriculture sector, due to
favorable rainfall conditions, witnessed a bumper crop leading to a
6.7 percent growth rate in value-added, which was offset by a lower than
expected 3.2 percent growth rate in industry. While the overall performance
of the economy during the last two years has been satisfactory, the growth
rate of private manufacturing continues to be hindered perhaps by a perception
that a revival of domestic demand will be slow. Private investment recovered
modestly in 1982.
14.      On the inflation front, the Government was able to restrain the
growth of incomes and domestic demand to acceptable levels while redressing
public finances and the SEE accounts. As a result the inflation rate, as
measured by the wholesale price index, dropped from an annual increase of
107.2 percent in 1980 to 36.8 percent in 1981 and further to 25.2 percent in
1982.

15.      Balance of Payments.  Developments on the external account have been
particularly impressive over the last three years. The current account
deficit, which stood at $3.2 billion (5.6 percent of GNP) in 1980, fell to
about $1.0 billion (1.7 percent of GNP) in 1982 (Table 2). Of particular
importance was the impressive growth of merchandise exports, which rose from
$2.9 billion in 1980 to $4.7 billion in 1981. This 62 percent growth was
followed in 1982 by a further increase of 22 percent to $5.75 billion.
Merchandise exports in 1982 were close to the Government's target of
$5.8 billion despite a decline in the export prices of agricultural products.

16.      Throughout the period export growth has been led by the manufacturing
sector, and has involved a distinct shift in destination from the EEC
countries to the Middle East (Table 3). Industrial exports registered a
growth of 119 percent in 1981, followed by a further 50 percent rise in 1982.
The flexible exchange rate policy of the Government was the single most
important factor contributing to this performance. The weakness in the
domestic market was also a factor as it forced private entrepreneurs to turn
to external markets for survival. Export growth was helped by a comprehensive
set of export incentives, which served to offset the bias in the protection
system towards domestic production, by the measures taken by the Government to
improve administrative arrangements affecting exports, and by the expansion of
Middle East markets in this period.

17.      By contrast, the lower than anticipated growth in merchandise imports
was mostly due to factors exogenous to Turkey. The drop in merchandise
imports in dollar terms by about 2.3 percent in 1982 reflects unexpected price
movements in oil and raw material imports, a stronger US dollar, reductions in
stocks, and the elimination of a risk premium previously paid by Turkish
importers. On the other hand, the recession in the Western economies
contributed to lower than anticipated receipts of workers' remittances. The
positive results in the trade balance during the period under consideration,
and especially in 1982, more than compensated for the negative developments in
the services accounts.
18.      Public Finances.  In the fiscal area progress has been in the right
direction. The most notable feature is a marked retrenchment of the public
sector. Government Consolidated Budget expenditures, which stood at
24.0 percent of GNP in 1980, fell to 21.5 percent in 1982 (Table 4). The
budget deficit to GNP ratio, which stood at 4.6 percent in 1980, decreased to
1.4 percent in 1981, and further to 1.2 percent in 1982, while SEE transfers
as a percentage of GNP showed a steady decline from 4.8 percent in 1980 to
2.8 percent in 1982. Despite these successes, the improvement in the budget
balance was somewhat uneven during the period, due principally to shortfalls
in tax revenues. The tax collection problem has been a source of continuing
concern, and there have been systematic shortfalls in forecast revenues.
Although program figures have generally been more optimistic than
realizations, the Government has reacted by aligning its expenditures with its
resources, thereby continuing the trend towards an eventual positive budget
balance.

19.      SEE Accounts.  The financial perfornance of SEEs has registered
substantial improvement over the last three years (Table 5). A situation of
chronic deficits has changed into one showing growing profits in 1981 and
1982. This turnaround reflects the Government's efforts in the short term to
improve the financial situation of the SEEs through price adjustments and, in
the longer term, to address the critical issues of increased efficiency and
reform of the SEEs. The measures taken during 1980-82 had a significant
impact on SEE accounts. Basic structural reforms, with the overall objective
of having a viable SEE sector more responsive to market forces, were expected
to be introduced in 1982 through a comprehensive SEE reform decree. The
passage of the legislation took longer than anticipated, probably because of
the far-reaching nature of the changes sought. But the reform decree was
approved recently and is discussed further in para. 59.

20.      Public Investment.  Restraining the high rate of growth in public
sector investment was a major objective of the structural adjustment process.
Efforts were made to constrain the level of public investment in line with
available resources, to limit the number of projects to a manageable level,
and to ensure that priority projects received larger allocations in order to
speed up their completion. As a result, public sector investment in real
terms declined by 3.7 percent in 1980, rose by 9.4 percent in 1981, and
increased by only 0.8 percent in 1982. Private real investment, by contrast,
declined by 17.2 percent in 1980, declined again by 8.8 percent in 1981, and
rose by 5.4 percent in 1982. The aggregate figures show that the Government
has been able to continue to rationalize its investment program and to lower
the public sector's dependence on external resources (Table 6).

21.      The Role of the Bank.  The Bank has supported the Government's
structural adjustment process through a variety of actions, of which the
successive SALs form an important part. Other components include project
loans, economic and sector work leading to policy recommendations, and
technical assistance. A substantial part of the lending and economic programs
is geared to the realization of the objectives of structural adjustment, most
notably in the field of industrial policy and SEE reform. The Bank's economic
and sector studies have in particular helped to strengthen the Government's
policy formulation. The Bank's supporting activities also include special
economic studies funded by the Bank, staff advisory assistance, for example on
the External Debt Management System and the use of planning models, and a
number of technical assistance packages within the project loan agreements.
The Bank will continue with this comprehensive approach to structural
adjustment in the coming years.

22.      Bank/IMF Cooperation.  The Bank's support to the structural
adjustment program in Turkey has from its inception involved a close working
relationship with the IMF. In June 1980, the IMF entered into a three-year
Standby Arrangement with the Government of Turkey for a total of
SDR1,250 million (about $1.6 billion). The principal conditions of the
Standby are the maintenance of external competitiveness through a flexible
exchange r.ce policy, ceilings on Central Bank credit to control aggregate
demand, and limitations on budget transfers to SEEs. Other conditions relate
to timely fulfillment of reserve requiremeni: obligations of banks, limits on
the contracting of new nonconcessional public or publicly guaranteed external
debt, and a performance criterion on trade and payment restrictions. The
present Standby Arrangement is to expire on June 17, 1983, and the Turkish
authorities have indicated their interest in a new one-year arrangement. A
review by the IMF at the halfway mark (March 1982) of the Standby Arrangement
showed that performance in implementing the monetary program had been
satisfactory. Since then the agreed credit limits have continued to be
honored and the latest (April 1983) IMF review has concluded that all
performance criteria have been met despite l:he severe strain put on the
banking system by the collapse of some of the money brokers in 1981 and 1982.
23.      The Bank is in agreement with the Fund's basic position that
stabilization of the economy is an essentiaL prerequisite for a return to a
sustainable growth path. The Bank takes the view that the period of austerity
necessary to bring inflation under control, redress the public finances, and
improve the balance of payments should be used to lay the groundwork for a
major restructuring of the Turkish economy. Thus, the Fund's attention to the
country's monetary and fiscal balance, the maintenance of external
competitiveness, and SEE financial performance has complemented the Bank's
structural adjustment efforts in the areas of SEE reform, import
liberalization, export promotion, rationalization of public investment, and
the development of a medium-term framework.
24.      In summary, the 1980-82 period has witnessed impressive progress in
the structural adjustment process.  The stabilization program is proceeding
satisfactorily, export growth can no longer be termed a short-term phenomenon,
and a substantial measure of monetary and fiscal discipline has been
introduced in the management of the economy. Yet the structural adjustment
process, and its achievements, must be viewed as part of a medium-term
effort. Much remains to be done. Many of the actions so far taken must now
be extended and broadened so as to ensure that the structural changes firmly
take root. Thus the SAL IV program, conceived as a step forward in the
medium-term plan of structural adjustment, seeks to consolidate and strengthen
many of the policy reforms in SALs I through III while, at the same time,
beginning to address some key sectoral issues. With the pressures for crisis
management now under control, and with the Turkish economy performing in a
more satisfactory fashion, it is now possible to focus more on the medium
term. How the SAL IV program is placed in this context is taken up in the
next section.

PART III - THE SAL IV PROGRAM
25.      The draft Fifth Five Year Development Plan (1984-1988), which will
serve as the Government's medium-term framework, will be completed by
mid-1983. Preliminary discussions indicate a high correlation between the
Government's draft plan and the Bank's medium-term projections as set out in
the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). 1/
26.      The CEM sets out a medium-term scenario which indicates a
continuation of the stabilization program until 1985, followed by a strategy
aiming at a 6-6.5 percent per annum GDP growth and a manageable balance of
payments. 2/ Two basic assumptions on export sustainability and on fiscal
discipline have guided the Bank's projections. The continued growth of
exports is based on the view that the 1981-82 upsurge was not a temporary
phenomenon. It is also assumed that the monetary and fiscal policy slippages
observed in 1982 will not disrupt the basic shift in development strategy.
Table 7 below presents the projections of key economic variables for the
period 1983-1990.

1/  Turkey:  Recent Economic Developments and Medium-Term Prospects
(No. 4287-TU), June 1983.
2/  These projections do not reflect the recent decrease in oil prices.  The
beneficial effects of real oil price declines lead to potentially higher
GDP growth rates in 1984-85 as well as lower external borrowing
requirements. However, this has to be balanced against probable lower
exports to the oil producing countries. The Government's 1983 growth
target is likely to remain unaffected by the new situation since there is
a lag in translating improvements in the current account balance into a
higher growth rate.



- 13 -
27,      These projections assume that merchandise imports will grow slowly in
real terms through 1984 and then pick up from 7-8 percent to an average of a
little over 9 percent for the 1985-90 period. The current account balance,
under these assumptions, will show a decreasing deficit for 1982-85 as
stabilization curtails imports while encouraging exports. As higher growth
rates set in, the trend would be reversed for the 1985-90 period, and Turkey's
current account deficit would increase again. The terminal -enc 1990 would
show a deficit of $1.8 billion as compared to a 1985 projected deficit of
$485 million. The projected c:apital account will remain manageable throughout
the projection period given the constraint oa the growth of debt and the need
to maintain a reasonable debt service ratio. This would permit Turkey to meet
the amortization and interest payments arisiag from the debts rescheduled
during the 1978-82 period and maintain foreign exchange reserves equivalent to
two months' imports (para. 100).
28.      Consistent with this scenario, the projections indicate a GDP growth
of 5 percent per annum for 1982-85 (the stabilization period), and a higher
figure of 6.1 percent per annum for 1985-90 (the growth period). Achievement
of these growth rates will depend on the growth of the productive sectors,
namely agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend to a large
extent on the Government's determination to render the public sector more
efficient and to create a more favorable investment climate for the private
sector.
29.      The medium-term scenario presented above assumes an increasingly
important role for private investment in line with the policy of rationalizing
public investment.  Private investment is expected to grow at an average
annual rate of 9.6 percent during 1982-85 and 11 percent during 1985-90. As a
corollary, the growth of public investment is projected to slow down from a
high of 7.8 percent per annum in real terms during 1980-82 to a more moderate
5.0 percent during 1982-85 an,d eventually to 4.4 percent per annum for
1985-90. This is consistent with the medium-term goal of a one-to-one ratio
between private and public fixed investment by 1990.
30.      The Bank's medium-term scenario is, of course, only one of many
possibilities and is used in this report specifically to illustrate Turkey's
potential given the present view of future resources. In what follows the
Government's 1983 program has been placed against the backdrop of past
achievements (1980-82) and the Bank's medium-term projections (1984-90) in
order to better illustrate the place of SAL IV in this continuum.
Turkey's 1983 Economic Program in the Structural Adjustment Process
31.      The Government's 1983 economic program (upon which the Government's
1983 Statement of Development Policies is bz.sed) has been conceived as the
continuation of the structural adjustment process. It should be construed as
another incremental step towards the twin goals of stabilization and the
restructuring of the economy for the purpose of regaining a sustainable growth
path. The measure of its reasonableness is how it builds on already
established trends and how well it fits into a medium-term scenario of the
type described in paras. 26-30 above.



- 14 -
32.      At the macro-level the program revolves around two central objectives:
(i) further progress in the reduction of the rate of inflation in
line with the trends of the last three years; and
(ii) a further reduction in the current account deficit in
preparation for the additional foreign exchange requirements of
anticipated higher growth rates in the coming years.
The attainment of these objectives is in turn dependent on fiscal and monetary
policies designed to control the budget deficit, limit the financing
requirement of the SEEs, and define the credit ceilings to be adhered to by
the Central Bank. Moreover, with respect to the external accounts, the
successful pursuit of further reductions in the balance of payments deficit
depends critically on the continuation of the flexible exchange rate policy.
33.      With a real GNP growth rate targeted at 4.8 percent, the program
reflects the continuous improvements noted since 1980 and projects a slightly
higher growth rate than the 4.4 percent realized in 1982. Figure 1
illustrates the growth trends since 1980 and places the 1983 program in the
context of the Bank's medium-term projections in the CEM. 1/ As shown in
Table 8, the 1983 program growth rate of 4.8 percent will be due primarily to
a projected increase in domestic demand of 4.3 percent (versus 2.5 percent in
1982) and a 0.5 percent contribution from the foreign balance (versus
1.9 percent in 1982). The impetus to this growth is expected to come from an
improvement in private fixed investment which is projected to grow at
7.0 percent in real terms, compared with 5.4 percent in 1982, as confidence
gradually picks up. The stabilization program is achieving its aim of
lowering inflation, redressing the fiscal and monetary balances and laying the
groundwork for a progressive increase in private sector activity. It must be
borne in mind, however, that austerity programs are not compatible with
private investment booms as demand is usually deficient and interest rates
high. In the case of Turkey, in the 1980s, a resurgence of private investment
can only be achieved gradually over the medium term.
1/ The Base Case in these projections reflects a 6.1 percent per annum
average real growth of GNP over the 1985-1990 period.

34.      In sectoral terms the 1983 program calls for a growth of 3.4 percent
in agriculture and 5.5 percent in industry. With agriculture to a great
extent dependent on the vagaries of the weather, the program target represents
more or less an average long-term growth rate. The industrial growth rate of
5.5 percent represents a marked improvement over the 3.2 percent performance
of 1982 and reflects the same expected improvements, based on trend evidence,
as seen in GNP and private investment growth since 1980.
35.      The Government intends to continue lo restrain the growth of domestic
demand to acceptable levels while concurrentLy improving the public finances
and the SEE accounts. The Government has sought a new one-year arrangement to
follow the current Standby Arrangement with the IMF, which expires on
June 17, 1983.  The credit ceilings agreed u2on as part of the arrangements
will continue to restrain the growth of the monetary aggregates in line with
the 1983 inflation target of 20.0 percent. Figure 2 places the 1983 inflation
program (as measured by the wholesale price index) within the context of past
trends.
36.      The Government feels that continued improvement in the current
account balance is essential as the 1984 capital account will begin to come
under the pressure of repayments of rescheduled debt. Moreover, given the
need to increase imports in line with an accelerating growth rate in the
medium term, it is clear that the efforts of the Government to sustain the
export expansion of the last three years must continue if Turkey is to be able
to meet both its growth targets and its external commitments. The 1983
program is designed to further decrease the current account deficit by about
$200 million (Table 9). The program calls for a 17 percent growth in the
value of exports of goods (from $5.8 to $6.8 billion) and some improvement in
the contribution from workers' remittances, both predicated on the assumption
of a revival in the growth of the industrial economies. Imports of goods, on
the other hand, are programmed to reverse their 1982 trend and increase in
value terms by about 12.8 percent, mainly on the strength of the continuing
improvement in the growth of domestic demand partly offset by some favorable
developments in oil prices.
37.      The 1983 program for the balance of payments represents a reasonable
incremental improvement in the ratio of current account deficit to GNP.
Viewed against the actual trends of the last three years (-5.6 percent in
1980, -3.5 percent in 1981, and -1.7 percent in 1982) as well as the
medium-term projections, the programmed -1.5 percent current account deficit
to GNP ratio is realistic. This ratio is expected to worsen again from 1985
onwards as the foreign exchange requirements of increased growth manifest
themselves, but should not become a problem as the debt service ratio is
expected to decline (Figure 3).

38.      Public finances have improved significantly in the last three years.
But there is still need for further retrenchment in the public sector's call
on resources and credit. The Government's 1983 program, in line with this
objective, calls for a decline in the expenditure to GNP ratio from
21.5 percent in 1982 to 20.8 percent in 1983 and in the budget balance from
-1.2 percent of GNP in 1982 to -0.6 percent in 1983, and for SEE transfers to
stabilize (at 2.8 percent of GNP in 1982 and 2.7 percent in 1983). Figure 4
places the 1983 targets within the framework of past trends and the Bank's
medium-term projections.
39.      The Government's program for the SEEs calls for continued
improvements in their financial performance. Total profits before taxes are
projected to increase from TL46 billion in 1982 to TL68 billion in 1983, and
the ratio of profits to GNP to increase from 0.5 percent to 0.6 percent
(Figure 5). The financing requirement, excluding the depreciation offset,
also shows an incremental improvement in thE! program, going from 6.7 percent
in 1982 to 5.9 percent in 1983 (Table 10). The changes introduced under the
SEE reform decree are discussed in para. 59 below. Thus while the 1983
program for the SEEs shows a modest improvemient in the overall accounts, it is
anticipated that with the passage of the decree there will be substantial
progress in 1984, especially in the ratios of profit and financing requirement
to GNP.

40.      With respect to public investment, the 1983 program represents a
further narrowing of the gap between public savings and public investment, and
underlines the Government's continuing efforts to decrease the claim on
outside sources of funds for public investment. The savings-investment gap of
the public sector, which stood at 10.3 percent of GNP in 1980, 6.1 percent in
1981 and 4.3 percent in 1982, is now targeted to decrease to 4.1 percent in
1983 (Table 11). Figure 6 charts a related trend, namely the ratio of the
public sector borrowing requirements to GNP.

41.      The Government's macroeconomic program represents a realistic and
feasible improvement on the gains already achieved since the inception of the
structural adjustment process in 1980. It is compatible with both the
shorter-term stabilization and the medium-term structural adjustment process.
It is also the basis on which the Statement of Development Policies - 1983,
which serves as the basis for the Government's request for a fourth SAL, has
been formulated. A description of the policies contained in the Statement
follows. 1/
1/ The policy measures to be supported by SAL IV are set out in detail in the
Statement of Development Policies - 1983, attached to a letter from the
Minister of Finance to the Bank dated April 22, 1983 (Annex IV-A).

Program Review
42.      The policy actions contained in the Statement fall into two main
categories:
(i) Aggregate Level
- Medium-Term Framework
- Fiscal and Monetary Policy
- Public Investment
-  Reform of State Economic Enterprises
- Import Liberalization
-  Export Incentives
(ii) Sectoral Level
- Financial Sector
- Agriculture
- Energy
Each of these areas is discussed more fully below. As with previous SALs, the
SAL IV package encompasses a number of decisions already taken, some in
process, and others that will need to be addressed during the course of the
program spanning 1983 and early 1984. The miain actions are also summarized in
matrix form (Annex IV-B).
Medium-Term Framework
43.      Beginning in 1983, the Government will undertake annual reviews and
draft its next annual program in the context of its most up-to-date
medium-term projections. The aim is to ensure that the 1984 economic program
is compatible with the recent improvements in the basic macroeconomic
variables, and with the medium-term objectives of the Fifth Five Year Plan,
the first draft of which is expected at the end of June 1983 while final
publication is anticipated for mid-October. In order to monitor progress in
the development of the medium-term plan as well as in its annual
implementation, it would be a condition of tranche release under SAL IV that
there be satisfactory progress in the development of a 1984 annual program
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 4). The Bank would examine whether the program
reflects, in its targets, the continuation of stabilization, albeit at a
slower pace, as well as the implementation of the first year of a plan where
expenditures are in line with resources, and where there are no unwarranted
discontinuities in the trends of the macro-aggregates. With respect to the
formulation of the Plan as a whole, the Bank will continue its dialogue
regarding the medium-term prospects with the Turkish authorities through a
Plan Review Mission which is currently scheduled to visit Turkey in the second
half of 1983.
Fiscal and Monetary Policy
44.      The broad aim of the Government's fiscal and monetary policy in 1983
is to support the growth targets in the 1983 program. This is to be done by
achieving relative price stability and increasing public savings, as well as



- 22 -
by meeting the credit demands of the productive sectors and supporting the
export effort. Of primary importance is a continued improvement in the budget
balance, the inflation rate and the public sector borrowing requirements.
45.      In the monetary area, the expected new one-year Standby Arrangement
with the Fund will govern the 1983 monetary program to help ensure a
20 percent inflation target and a further improvement in the public sector
accounts as spelled out in some detail in paras. 33-41. In the fiscal area,
in addition to the measures described in the Statement of Development
Policies, the Government will apply the measures stipulated in the
February 1983 "reconciliation" law designed to facilitate the settlement of
pending tax cases. Moreover, personal income tax collections would now be
governed by a new system, under which assessment would be based on the
principle of living standards. 1/ The advance tax payments system would also
be abolished and replaced by the living standards system. Finally, draft
legislation for introducing a value-added tax is currently under discussion in
the Consultative Assembly. With these measures the Government is reiterating
its commitment to the principle that expenditures should be matched by
revenues in line with a more efficient and equitable tax system.
Public Investment
46.      Public and private investment are expected to play complementary
roles in the development strategy. The restoration of private investment
depends in part on the availability of infrastructure and essential inputs,
such as power and basic materials, that can only be provided by the public
sector. This role of the public sector became blurred in the period prior to
1980, which witnessed the evolution of a public investment program whose size
encroached on private sector savings and whose composition was unrelated to
sectoral objectives. The redefinition of the role of public investment under
the structural adjustment program includes as a basic medium-term objective
the restoration of an approximately equal balance in the ratio of public to
private fixed investment (as against the 60:40 ratio that prevailed in 1982)
and the removal of physical and social bottlenecks to economic growth. In
order to allow the private sector to play its leading role in output and
export expansion, it is the Government's objective that public investment
should increasingly be financed by public resources and, therefore, that the
ratio of public sector borrowing requirements to GNP should decline over time.
47.      Bearing the above in mind, the Government intends to continue its
investment strategy that:
(i) restrains the growth of public investment so as not to create
excessive pressures on domestic and external resources;
(ii) focuses public sector investment on high priority projects in
infrastructure, agriculture, and energy, with manufacturing
increasingly left to the private sector;
1/ Living standards are defined on the basis of a combination of income and
wealth, whereby non-wage income is estimated according to a wealth
schedule and added to wage income to determine taxable income.



- 23 -
(iii) establishes rates of return criteria for all new investments
while improving project evaluation methods;
(iv) concentrates the public investment program on a smaller number
of projects to shorten completion times; and
(v) progressively raises the share of SEE investments financed from
their own resources.
48.      The level of public f-ixed investment programmed for 1983 is
TL 1043.5 billion at 1982 prices (TL 1258.8 billion at 1983 prices). This
represents no change as compared to the programmed level for 1982
(TL 1043.0 billion at 1982 prices) and a 5.2 percent increase over the
estimated level achieved in 1982. The latter increase is attributable to a
shortfall in investments in 1982, which registered a growth in real terms of
only 0.8 percent over 1981 as against a target of 6 percent. This was a major
achievement in expenditure control. A notable feature of 1982 was the
adoption by the Government of a deliberate policy to make no supplementary
budgetary allocations during the course of the year.  The 1983 program shows a
reduction in the share of pubLic investment in total fixed investment as
compared to the two previous years. This share is expected to decline in
future years in line with the Government's stated policy. Table 12 below
shows the movement of public investment during the period 1980-83 as compared
to the period 1974-78.

49.      The increases in the investment allocations in the 1983 program
reflect the Government's concern to rehabilitate and expand infrastructure for
supporting exports and removing bottlenecks in energy production. The
Government has also taken into account the major improvement in domestic
resource mobilization in 1981 and 1982, which has enabled the financing of a
greater proportion of public investment out of public savings without
pre-empting resources from private sector investment. With the increase in
public savings from 5.2 percent of GNP in 1S980 to 8.3 percent of GNP in 1982,
the gap between public investment and public savings has been progressively
reduced from over 10 percent of GNP in 1980 to 4.3 percent of GNP in 1982
(Table 6).



- 24 -
50.      The changing sectoral composition of public investment is shown in
Table 13. Most noteworthy is the maintenance in the allocation for energy at
about 34 percent of total public fixed investment and the increase in the
allocation for agriculture and transport from the 1980 levels. On the other
hand, the share of manufacturing has dropped from 29.7 percent in 1980 to
16.3 percent in 1983. Table 13 also shows how closely the sectoral pattern of
public investment in the 1983 program compares with the pattern for 1982-85
suggested in the Public Sector Investment Review Report (PIR), which called
for increases in energy, agriculture and transport and a decline in
manufacturing.

51.      The Government has assigned priority to projects having high
rates of return and capable of being completed within a short period.
Other criteria for priority include projects designed to help develop
indigenous energy resources, rehabilitate or extend the infrastructure
in energy, transport and agriculture, and support exports generally.
Both the 1982 and 1983 Investment Programs reflect the application of
these criteria. The 1983 Program has reduced the number of ongoing
projects to about 6600 as against 7400 in the 1982 Program (and over
9000 in the 1980 Program). No new large projects (i.e. costing over



- 25 -
TL 5 billion) have been included. A number of large projects, the
economic viability of which had not been established, have been dropped,
deferred for restudy or substantially reduced in scope in the 1983
Program. 1/ Projects in this category (40 in all) received less than
6 percent of the total allocations for large projects in the 1983
Program.
52.      The 1982 and the 1983 Programs also reflect a determined effort
to speed up the project completion rate by focusing funds on a more
limited number of projects. In 1982, over 80 percent of the funds
allocated for large projects wient to the 87 projects identified as high
priority. In the 1983 Program the share has increased to about
85 percent (Table 14). 2/ The Government completed 51 major projects
(including 10 in irrigation) in 1982 and expects to complete 65 major
projects (19 in irrigation) in 1983.

National Transport Master Plan, the Government has revised the scope as
well as the completion date (1997 as against 1990) of the Arifiye-Sincan
High Speed Railway.
2/  The total number of large projects and the number of priority projects
have increased from 157 and 86 respectiv,ely in the 1982 Program to 187 and
112 respectively in the 1983 Program as a result of upward revisions in
the estimated total project cost. No new large projects have been
included in the 1983 Program.



- 26 -
53.      Weakness in project preparation, evaluation and selection in the
various agencies is one of the reasons for the questionable quality of some
projects in the investment program. The Government is trying to build up its
evaluation capability primarily in the State Planning Organization (SPO),
supplemented by that in key agencies and the State Investment Bank (DYB). The
head of a reorganized project evaluation unit in SPO was appointed in early
1982 and the department is now in operation.  Staff from the Bank's Economic
Development Institute (EDI) visited Turkey in November 1982 and held
consultations with SPO, DYB, and the Ministry of Finance on the subject of
training in project preparation. As a result, proposals are under
consideration for organizing regular training courses in Turkey for Government
and SEE staff as well as for instructors who could conduct training courses in
the future. The first joint EDI/DYB course is to be held in Ankara later this
year. Meanwhile, courses in project evaluation conducted by the DYB are being
strengthened. The Government has also set up a Planning and Programming
Department in the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, one of whose
principal functions would be to review large energy projects.
54.      The momentum launched by the PIR and maintained by the monitoring of
public sector investment through the SALs will help the Government achieve the
longer-term objective of an approximately equal balance between public and
private investment. The Fifth Five Year Plan will continue to restrain public
investment below the level which would endanger the gains made in the last
three years. In order to continue to monitor progress, it would be a
condition for tranche release under SAL IV that the Government should make
satisfactory progress towards rationalizing public investment and
concentrating resources on high priority projects (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 4). An appropriate benchmark would be that the mid-year investment
review should confirm that at least 85 percent of the funds allocated for
major projects would go to the 112 priority projects as programmed.
Reform of State Economic Enterprises
55.      The State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) in Turkey were established
starting 50 years ago to fulfill needs not adequately served by the private
sector. Over the years, they have come to play a dominant role throughout the
economy--in industry as well as in traditional public utilities, transport,
and agricultural marketing and supply. The SEEs currently account for a
substantial share of public investment (40 percent), GDP (8 percent), and
non-agricultural employment (10 percent). In industry, SEEs have a virtual
monopoly in petroleum refining, steel, alcoholic beverages, and basic metals,
and have large shares in fertilizers, pulp and paper, cement, coal, sugar,
machinery, and chemicals.
56.      Since the late 1970s, the operating losses and growing investment
demands of the SEEs have placed substantial burdens on the budget and added to
inflationary pressures. While some SEEs were well run and profitable, in
aggregate they showed increasing losses through 1980. Since then, as a result
of certain interim measures taken by the Government, primarily relating to
liberalization of output prices, the profitability picture has changed
significantly, and the SEEs recorded an overall net profit of nearly
TL46 billion in 1982. What has not happened, however, is any major
improvement in SEE efficiency. Consequently, the burden of economic and



- 27 -
technical inefficiency has in many cases merely been reallocated from the
budget to customers and the private sector generally.
57.      The majority of the problems affecting the SEEs arise from the fact
that while the enterprises have been organized as economic entities with the
objectives of efficiency, productivity, and profitability, they are subject to
constant intervention by the Government in pursuit of different and often
conflicting objectives. The causes of poor performance include price
controls, uneconomic investments, overstaffing, lack of autonomy, frequent
changes of management, inadequate salaries for managerial and technical staff,
excessive centralization of decision making:, and a confusion between economic,
social, and political goals.
58.      SEE reform has been a major goal of the Government's structural
adjustment program. During 1980 and 1981, the Government implemented a number
of interim measures to improve short-term financial performance, redirect the
SEEs' investment programs and finance them increasingly from non-budget
sources, and undertake legal reforms to institutionalize these changes. These
measures have had some impact, as mentioned earlier (para. 19). There is also
some evidence of a greater propensity on the part of some SEE managers to make
use of the discretion that is available under the law. The financial position
of the operational SEEs, together with the Government's projections for 1983,
are provided in Annex VI. These are summarized in Tables 5 and 10 and in the
text. Reference has already been made to the steady improvement in SEE
profitability. It may also be mentioned that the share of wages and salaries
as a percentage of sales has steadily gone down, from 33 percent in 1979 to
15 percent in 1982. The Government's strici: controls on SEE employment
continue to be in force. Total employment has declined from 550,000 in 1979
to around 520,000 in 1982.
59.      The core of the Government's program for SEEs is a wide-ranging
reform decree that has recently been approved. The new decree classifies
State enterprises into different categories and lays down uniform principles
relating to the composition of their Boards of Directors, the tenure of Board
members and the qualifications required of top management.  The enterprises
will henceforth be allowed to determine their product prices; if for any
reason the Government establishes prices, the loss, if any, to the enterprise
will be made up by the Government. Employees of the enterprises will be
subject to a new personnel regime different from that applicable to Government
employees. The enterprises will also have greater autonomy in determining
their investment programs, within the framework of the national plans. The
Government's strategy is to bring about greater efficiency in SEE performance
through decentralization of responsibility, greater management autonomy and
competition. The ultimate objective is to place the SEEs in an economic
environment where they would compete on an equal footing with private sector
firms, especially with regard to output prices, factor inputs, and credit.
While the Government recognizes that the challenge is to change deep-rooted
attitudes, not merely laws, the new decree should have considerable impact by
signaling the new approach towards SEEs. Within the framework of the SEE
decree, the Government intends to seek the Bank's assistance in providing
technical assistance aimed ait improving the overall performance of selected
SEEs.



- 28 -
60.      With regard to the financial aspects of SEE performance, reference
has already been made to the targets in the 1983 program relating to overall
profitability, SEE investments, and financing requirements (para. 39). In
addition, the Government has decided to limit budget transfers to SEEs in 1983
to TL292 billion, representing a zero rate of real growth over 1982 given
present inflation assumptions, and within the above ceiling, to maintain the
share of manufacturing SEEs at or below the 1982 level in real terms. It will
also ensure that reimbursement of SEE duty losses is limited to TL95.5 billion
in 1983, representing a small decrease in real terms over 1982. The
Government's policy of not permitting SEEs automatic access to Central Bank
financing or to additional transfers from the Treasury will be continued, and
whenever possible, SEEs will be encouraged to raise their own funds.
Import Liberalization
61.      The objective of opening the Turkish economy to competition from
abroad is an essential component of the Government's structural adjustment
program. The Government's long-term policy is that import restrictions should
not be used to protect domestic producers except in special circumstances such
as, for example, fostering infant industries. It is keenly aware that efforts
to reduce the effective level of protection and the bias towards domestic
production are essential to restructure the economy and stimulate competitive
exports to support growth. Nevertheless, because of entrenched domestic
forces dependent on protection and international trade restrictions, it
recognizes that the process will entail considerable effort at the political
level. The Government's intention is to gradually shift from a licensing
system of import control to one relying on tariffs and to reduce these tariffs
over the medium term. In doing this, it will draw on the results of the
ongoing protection studies including the Bank-sponsored study expected to be
completed by September 1983.
62.      The Government has been taking legal and administrative steps to
liberalize the import regime over the last two years, including the abolition
of the quota list in 1981, shifting of over 200 items from Liberalized
List II 1/ to the more liberalized lists (List I 2/ and the Levy List 3/),
allowing duty-free importation of inputs going into exports, thus bypassing
the normal regime, and providing some additional de facto liberalization by
permitting imports of items domestically produced which are indirectly needed
for exports or to keep domestic prices down through competitive pressures
(e.g. steel and PVC). The 1983 Import Regime continued the policy by shifting
1/ Includes items which require an import license, issued normally if the
goods cannot be supplied locally in comparable quality and quantity, and
at a reasonable price.
2/ Includes items which are noncompetitive with domestic production and
freely admitted.
3/ Introduced in the 1982 Regime--includes items which can be imported
without restriction but are subject to a flexible levy that is adjusted
from time to time.



- 29 -
another 26 items 1/ (including long fiber cotton, dry batteries and video
casettes) to List I and the Levy List. There is no information available on
the value of imports entering in 1982 under List I, List II and the Levy List
separately, although the Government expects to have this breakdown available
by the end of 1983. It has been estimated, however, that on the basis of 1982
imports, the value of the items shifted from List II to List I in January 1983
amounted to $40 million, or about 1 percent of the 1982 total non-oil and
non-investment goods import bill. 2/ As part of the 1983 Import Regime, steps
were also taken to reduce the rates of import guarantee deposits, and improve
procedures for extending the period of validity of import licenses. In
addition, foreign exchange earners are allowed to open foreign currency
accounts of up to 5 percent in value of their annual export earnings which may
then be used for imports under List I and List II. 3/
63.      The Government is proposing to move in a more systematic way from a
licensing system of import control to one relying on tariffs over the medium
term. Preparation of a concrete action plan for liberalization is dependent
on the results of the Bank-sponsored Protection Study. 4/ Some Bank
involvement is foreseen in the final stages of the study, especially in the
preparation of a set of policy recommendations. This should enable the
preparation of the action plan by September 1.983. The Government has
confirmed that it will adopt a plan to rationalize the existing tariff system
by introducing a rational tariff structure, including providing for the
industrial restructuring necessary to produce a more competitive and
export-oriented industry, and set out a timetable for shifting from a
licensing system to one relying on tariffs.  The Government will begin
implementing the plan starting with the 1984 Import Regime, when a substantial
share of imports will be shifted to the more liberalized lists. Satisfactory
progress in import liberalization would be a condition of tranche release
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
Export Incentives
64.      Sustaining the growth of exports is central to the new development
strategy. Much has been done to improve export incentives since
January 1980. By far the most significant change has been the maintenance of
a realistic exchange rate, adjusted daily since May 1981 against a
trade-weighted basket of currencies. Between June 1981 and November 1982, the
1/ Of which 13 were shifted to List I and 13 to the Levy List.
2/  In the 1982 Regime, the Government had slhifted 35 items to List I, with an
import value estimated at $110 million oni the basis of 1981 imports
(3 percent of non-oil and non-investment goods imports).
3/  In the case of imports frcom List II, no Licensing would be required for
imports of up to 20 percent of the allocated 5 percent. As a result of
this relaxation, it is expected that about $70 million worth of goods
under List II will be imported without a license in 1983.
4/ Entitled "The Study on Restructuring the Existing Protection and
Incentives System", approved by the Research Committee in April 1981, and
currently expected to be completed in September 1983.



- 30 -
real effective exchange rate was depreciated by about 13 percent. Low cost
export credits, indirect tax rebates, and privileged access to foreign
exchange and imports have further increased the attractiveness of exports. 1/
Certificates entitling the exporter to export credits covered about 80 percent
of the total value of exports during 1981 and the first half of 1982. This
percentage has recently come down to about 75 percent. Altogether, the
average subsidy rate on industrial exports was 11 percent in mid-1981, helping
to offset the bias in the protection system towards domestic production as
well as the costs for inexperienced Turkish firms of learning to penetrate
export markets.
65.      The Government further liberalized the export regime in 1982.  The
number of items requiring an export license was reduced from 25 to just two:
tobacco and opium. Also in February 1982, for exports exceeding $4 million
per year, the minimum tax rebate was increased from 5 to 6 percent. In
April 1982, the export tax rebate scheme was revised and additional benefits
were granted depending on the volume of exports realized in a calendar year.
Further, in line with the objective of reducing export subsidies in the medium
term and placing greater reliance on the exchange rate policy, the subsidy
provided from the Interest Rate Rebate Fund on long-term credits for
export-oriented investment was reduced from 40 to 35 percent. The Central
Bank also amended the rediscount rates for export credits in April 1982. For
manufactures of investment goods for export, the rate was increased to
34 percent from 27.5 percent; and for credits from the Export Promotion Fund
to 23.75 percent from 15 percent.
66.      Under the foreign exchange retention scheme, industrial exporters
were allowed to retain one-half of their net foreign exchange earnings which,
prior to December 1982, could be transferred to other users. In
December 1982, the export retention scheme was modified to remove features
which gave rise to what was essentially a multiple currency practice; the
right of exporters to transfer foreign exchange to a third party was
abolished, so that exporters could use foreign exchange obtained under the
scheme only to meet their own import requirements following current import
regulations (as modified by the 5 percent relaxation described in para. 62
above).
67.      As domestic conditions become more prosperous, the time will come
when incentives must be designed more carefully if exports are to continue at
the desired level. Under more normal conditions, the two incentives that are
now important will lose much of their force: domestic demand will revive, and
interest rates for non-exporters will fall. The indirect tax rebate will also
weaken to some extent. Thus, in an environment where potential exporters
enjoy stronger domestic demand, Turkey will need to redesign its incentive
structure if exports are to continue. Several recommendations in this regard
have been made in recent economic studies, including:
1/ A fuller description of these incentives and their importance is given in
the Industrialization and Trade Strategy Report (No. 3641-TU), Chapter 2.



- 31 -
(i) continued lower-interest loans to exporters, perhaps for longer
terms (e.g. 12 to 18 months);
(;i a separate program of multi-year credits for exporters of
capital goods to develop the potential in that sector;
(iii) continued free access to imported inputs, free of duty;
(iv) a system of export credit insurance;
(v) the exclusion from the benefits of preferential export credits,
of exports with less than 20 percent of value-added;
(vi) a system of credits for indirect exporters; and
(vii) most important of all, a foreign trade regime including a
tariff policy that removes the bias in incentives favoring the
domestic market against exports.
68.      Although the management of a flexible exchange rate during the last
two years has been a major incentive to exports, the bias favoring the
domestic market over exports is still strong. This is reflected in a level of
protection that is still too high. Since explicit export subsidies cannot be
increased beyond present levels, a practical solution would be a reduction in
protection of domestically produced goods that compete with exports. As part
of the SAL IV Program, the Government will carry out during 1983 a detailed
review of export incentives including the recommendations set out in para. 67.
External Debt
69.      As the size and complexity of the external debt file increased, the
Government recognized that the major obstacle in formulating a proper debt
management policy was the inability to compile and evaluate the appropriate
data rapidly and accurately. In order to facilitate data handling, the Bank
supported a program under SAL I for the Ministry of Finance to undertake the
computerization of Turkey's debt recording system. The timetable for this
effort set forth in SAL I has not yet been fulfilled. The Ministry of Finance
underestimated the complexity of the task and relied heavily on in-house
skills supplemented by an outside consultant. Although a system was designed,
it has recently been judged inadequate for Turkey's needs by the Ministry of
Finance. A Bank evaluation of the system cane to similar conclusions.
70.      The Government has reaffirmed its intention to close the gaps in the
present manual debt reporting system, computerize it, and install and properly
staff a system for better management of external debt.  The Ministry of
Finance is seeking outside help and is looking both to the Bank and Fund for
assistance in designing a computerized system, under a timetable to be agreed
with the Bank.



- 32 -
Financial Sector
71.      An important determinant of the success of the domestic mobilization
effort as well as the revival of private investment will be the effectiveness
of changes being introduced in the financial system. Its present structure
and mode of operation are not conducive to enhanced efficiency in either
domestic resource mobilization or resource allocation. Two-thirds of all
credits are allocated at heavily subsidized rates, the capital market is
underdeveloped, enterprises are undercapitalized, and the large industrial
groups are closely linked with the banking system to the detriment of new
entrepreneurs. The banking system's cost-effectiveness compares unfavorably
with countries at a similar stage of development. The fiscal burden imposed
upon it is also, in international comparative terms, exceptionally heavy.
These problems are of a structural nature and will need to be resolved in the
medium term. There are also short-term problems. The most pressing one
appears to be the high level of the real cost of credit, currently of the
order of 28 percent on average for non-agricultural enterprises. This has
created acute problems of liquidity for banks and firms alike. Moreover,
there is considerable disparity between the cost of concessional and
non-concessional credit. The supply of concessional credit is restricted
leading to arbitrariness and delays in allocation.
72.      In line with the program for restructuring the Turkish economy, the
Government, in July 1980, deregulated commercial bank interest rates to
reflect market conditions and to encourage private savings. With this
liberalization, and as inflation went down, the average real interest rate
paid on sight and time deposits rose from -46 percent in 1980 to 18 percent in
1982. Increased competition from within the banking system, from brokers, and
from the higher rates paid on short-term Treasury bonds, created strong
pressures and led many banks unofficially to offer nominal rates of around
60 percent for 6-month time deposits in 1982.
73.      The increase of deposit interest rates to abnormally high levels,
together with the high intermediation costs in the banking system and heavy
taxation of financial operations, gave rise to serious problems. Lending
rates increased sharply, particularly for non-preferential credits for which
rates rose to around 60 to 70 percent. This culminated in a crisis in
July 1982, when Banker Kastelli, the largest brokerage house with an estimated
$600 million in deposits, collapsed. The firm's collapse was attributed to:
(a)   the acceptance of progressively poorer risks in order to keep
up with growth in placements on which it depended; and
(b)   the inability of brokers to maintain a high rate of inflow of
funds into their operations in the face of high interest
payments due and a restrictive monetary policy.



- 33 -
74.      The Government acted ,quickly to meet the crisis by guaranteeing
payment of normal interest and principal on deposit certificates and bonds
surrendered as security against deposit by brokers, and allowed banks in
temporary trouble to call on emergency funding from the Central Bank.
However, the brokers' crisis prompted savers to switch funds from smaller
banking institutions to larger banks. Even the larger banks found the
increase in deposits a mixed blessing because of the prevailing high real
deposit rates paid, and difficulties in finding enough creditworthy borrowers
in a recessionary environment.
75.      The Government introduced several measures at the beginning of 1983
which are designed to lower thie cost of credit. Interest rates on time
deposits (6-12 months) were lowered by 10 points to 40 percent, and on
one-year deposits by 5 points to 45 percent. In order to make time deposits
somewhat less attractive, the interest rate cn sight saving deposits was
raised from 5 percent to 20 percent. To reduce the cost of intermediation and
to compensate for the reduction of the interest rates on deposits, the
withholding tax on interest income was reduced from 25 to 20 percent, the
highly differentiated cash reserve requirements (with separate rates for sight
and savings deposits and substantially lower rates for deposits used for
specific purposes) were replaced by an equivalent single rate of 25 percent,
and the rate of interest paid by the Central Bank on reserves unified at
1.5 percent monthly. In addition, the liquidity ratio, which varied from
10-15 percent according to the size of the bank and was being monitored once a
month, was replaced by a single rate of 10 percent monitored continuously.
The permissible ratio of Government bonds has also been increased from 25 to
50 percent. To ease the problem of undercapitalization of firms, legislation
has been enacted to allow industrial firms to revalue their fixed assets and
accumulated depreciation without incurring an immediate tax liability.
Legislation to regulate the accounting profession is under consideration.
76.      The measures taken by the Turkish authorities so far are a positive
step towards simplifying the maze of regulations surrounding banking
operations and improving the performance of money and capital markets. The
Government intends to review the results of the January 1983 measures (this
might take till the third quarter of the year) before considering further
action with regard to interest rates.
77.      The SAL IV program supports the Government's policies to reduce high
real interest rates. The Government intends to reduce the cost of
intermediation by gradually reducing the financial transactions tax in two or
three steps by June 1984, with a reduction to 10 percent by June 1983, and
seeking alternative source of revenues to make up for the loss in tax
receipts. Furthermore, to facilitate the creation of an interbank money
market which would ease the liquidity problems of individual banks, it is the
Government's intention to reduce substantially the financial transactions tax
for transfers between financial institutions. To lessen the excessive demand
for non-preferential credit, interest rates applied to preferential credits
are to be reduced by end-1984 with the lowest, rates set equal to the rate of
inflation. The Government has also agreed that as long as real interest rates
on non-preferential credits exceed 20 percent, the real interest rates on
preferential credits should, in principle, be set at a positive level. A



- 34 -
study will also be undertaken by the Government to explore the possibilities
of introducing a system of floating interest rates for medium- and long-term
credits.
78.      As part of the SAL IV Program, the Government is considering
proposals for revision of the Banking Law which will inter alia increase the
role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the banking sector, introduce a
standardized accounting system for banks, improve the system of monitoring bad
debts, introduce a deposit insurance scheme, and review credit extension
limits by commercial banks to a single customer.  An enabling law has been
passed that would permit the Government for a period of six months to amend
the Banking Law through decrees.
79.      With regard to revitalization of the capital market, the Government
intends to ensure that the Capital Market Board begins to function effectively
as the authority in charge of supervising the securities market, both primary
and secondary. 1/ As part of the same effort, the Government will, in
addition to issuing treasury bills and Government bonds at competitive rates,
encourage bond issues by development banks which can independently service
their debt. The Government has also agreed under the SAL IV Program to
undertake studies related to:
(a)   devising strategies for long-term development of the equity
market including measures in the areas of accounting and
auditing standards; and
(b)   reviewing the introduction of medium- and long-term bonds with
interest rates indexed to the announced interest rates on time
deposits.
80.      In order to monitor progress in achieving these objectives, a
condition for tranche release under SAL IV would be that there is satisfactory
progress towards reduction in the level of the financial transactions tax
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 4).
Agriculture
81.      The importance of the agricultural sector in the economy is
declining, but it still accounts for an unusually large share of GDP
(21 percent), labor force (53 percent), and merchandise exports (47 percent
including processed food) compared to other middle-income LDCs. Moreover,
Turkey is able to meet its domestic food needs, and the agriculture sector
also indirectly contributes substantially to industrial exports. Production
grew on average by a little over 3 percent per annum in the 1970s due to an
extension of the irrigated area, and a tripling of fertilizer use and the
tractor fleet. The sector has a large positive trade balance ($1.97 billion
in 1982), which helps to offset deficits in industry and energy. However,
imported inputs for the sector, such as fertilizer and its raw materials,
plant protection chemicals and fuel, remain substantial.
1/ At the request of the Government, the IFC is providing assistance to the
Government in the development of an efficient capital market in Turkey.



- 35 -
82.      The sector's main contribution to structural adjustment over the next
few years will be to maintain, and if possible, increase its positive trade
balance. Agricultural exports are projectecL to grow at 3 percent per annum in
volume to reach $5.9 billion in nominal terms by 1990, while agriculture
imports are projected to reach $580 million by then. To achieve these
targets, sectoral GDP growth will have to be in the order of 3.1 percent per
annum.  With the closing of the arable land frontier in the 1970s, growth in
the sector must come from productivity increases, in terms of improved
irrigation, research and extension, and credit facilities.
83.      The Government has already initiated measures designed to promote
agricultural productivity and exports, and the Bank has supported these
through SAL operations and project lending. The export-oriented strategy
initiated in 1980 encourages Turkey to produce in accordance with its
comparative advantage in a wide range of commodities, particularly fruits,
vegetables, pulses, cereals and livestock products. Export growth of both
agriculture and agro-industries has been promoted by the exchange rate policy,
and a range of fiscal and financial incentives. Production and investment
incentives have also been introduced. This new development strategy aims at
minimizing market distortions and Government intervention by shifting from a
support to a floor pricing policy, and by reducing or eliminating input and
pricing subsidies.
84.      This shift in strategy led initially to some disarray in the
agricultural sector. The rate of growth of agricultural GDP fell in 1980 and
1981, but has rebounded in 1982 (6.7 percent real growth), aided by good
weather and an apparent adjustment by farmers to the new agricultural
environment. Agricultural exports have also responded to the new incentives,
and earnings grew at an average annual rate of 29 percent in 1980 and 1981.
In 1982, however, export earnings declined by 3.5 percent, due primarily to a
fall in prices of the key export crops, hazelnuts, tobacco and cotton, despite
an increase in exports, in volume terms, of 15 percent. In line with the
Government's policy of encouraging exports with a higher value-added,
agro-industrial exports grew by 38 percent. The diversification of exported
agricultural products has continued, with exports of livestock products,
barley, lentils and other pulses growing markedly; the shift in export markets
towards Middle East and Nortlh Africa has also become more marked.
85.      There are several Ministries and other official agencies responsible
for different aspects of agricultural development. Thus the Government
recognizes that an improvement in the overall planning and coordination within
the sector is essential to its sustained development. To improve production
efficiency and marketing technologies, the Government has decided to set up an
inter-ministerial working group to set priorities for technology generation
and to develop medium-term plans for reorganizing and consolidating
agricultural research activities. Another inter-ministerial group will be set
up to develop medium-term plans for reorganizing and consolidating the
Government's diverse extension services, including decentralization of
responsibility to the regional level and strengthening links with research
entities. The Government has also decided to take an important step in
improving agricultural technology by revising the seeds decree to enable an
efficient and expeditious testing of imported varieties of seeds and to
encourage the formation of joint ventures with foreign firms for commercial
seed production.



- 36 -
86.      In 1981-82, the Government undertook a reorganization of the Ministry
of Agriculture, designed to consolidate fragmented services. To improve
inter-agency coordination, the Government has decided to establish an
inter-ministerial working group to develop a medium-term planning capability
to analyze agricultural policy and make recommendations for policy reform.
Once the working group with responsibility for this area has been set up, the
provision of technical assistance by the Bank could be considered.
87.      There has already been considerable progress in developing an
agricultural sector more responsive to market signals. The measures taken
include deregulation of agricultural exports, simultaneous reductions in the
subsidization of agricultural inputs and progress in replacing support prices
by commodity floor prices. Implicitly, farmgate price stabilization has
become the main policy objective in lieu of incentive pricing and income
parity. In the context of SAL IV, the Government has agreed to continue its
policy of moving from producer support prices to floor prices, and to this
end, will develop an appropriate methodology for setting floor prices in line
with domestic and international commodity price trends and the exchange rate.
Substantial progress has already been made in reducing the fertilizer
subsidy: fertilizer prices were increased five-fold in 1980, and increased
again in September 1981. In line with its commitment under SAL II, the
Government intends to complete the phased elimination of the fertilizer
subsidy over the next three years. Progress has also been made in increasing
water charges, and further progress is expected in reducing the subsidies on
irrigation development.
88.      If production in accord with comparative advantage is to take place
without an undue rise in the domestic price of food commodities, the imports
of food and food products must also be liberalized. To analyze the situation
more comprehensively, the Government plans to initiate a review of its
self-sufficiency policies by the end of 1983, including examining the
implications of liberalizing food imports and the feasibility of removing
restrictions imposed on the exportation of wheat by the private sector.
89.      The system of agricultural credit suffers from serious distortions,
misallocations and wastage of scarce resources. These problems are being
addressed in the context of the proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project.
In particular, agreement has been reached on achieving a positive real
interest rate for agriculture, as well as to promote, inter alia, the
development of other financial institutions in the rural sector and to improve
the efficiency of TCZB, the major agricultural finance institution. Another
major weakness in the system of agricultural financing is the inefficiency of
the sales cooperatives, which undertake the Government's support purchases.
As part of the SAL IV Program, the Government has agreed to develop and
implement proposals for improving the efficiency and accountability of the
sales cooperatives, and to study measures to make them financially
self-sufficient with their credit obtained on commercial terms.
90.      The public investment program for agriculture was substantially
improved in 1982 under the SAL III program, by achieving a better balance
between subsectors and focusing on a more limited number of projects,
especially quick yielding irrigation projects. The Government has effectively



- 37 -
dropped or deferred a number of large projects in the agriculture sector in
line with the Bank's recommendations. In the context of SAL IV, continued
progress in the rationalization of the program would be sought, and the
Government has agreed to maintain the share of the 1983 investment program
allocated to agriculture at at least 11 percent, the same as in 1982.
Energy
91.      The central importance of energy in Turkey's economic prospects can
be gauged from the fact that in 1981, Turkey's petroleum imports reached
$3.9 billion, which amounted to over 80 percent of total exports and
40 percent of all imports. Total energy consumption in 1981 was estimated at
about 33 million tons of oil equivalent (t.o.e.), while total domestic
production of energy amounted to about 19 million t.o.e. The Energy
Assessment Report 1/ indicates that in order to sustain acceptable GDP growth
rates of about 5-6 percent through 1990, energy demand will continue to rise
at about 8 percent per annum throughout the 1980s. Thus by 1990, total energy
demand is expected to amount to some 65 million t.o.e. Turkey is well endowed
with hydropower potential and low quality lignite, both relatively
unexploited. The Government's policy has been to reduce the dependence on oil
imports by concentrating on the expansion of domestic energy production while
attempting to restrain the growth of consumption through demand management.
The task of developing and executing a rational energy management program has
been the concern of the Government and the Bank over the past two years.  In
addition to the Energy Assessment Report which has recently been approved by
the Government, detailed work has been undertaken relating to the power
subsector. Similar studies need to be carried out to gain a better
understanding of the lignite subsector.
92.      The Government's principal objectives in the energy sector include:
(a)   improving the efficiency of key institutions;
(b)   improving energy planning and inter-agency coordination;
(c)   carrying out a review of the major projects in the energy
sector to determine their feasibility and priority, and
focusing investment allocations on high priority, economically
viable projects;
(d)   stepping up efforts at energy conservation; and
(e)   taking steps to increase the participation of the private
sector, both domestic and foreign, in the development of energy
resources.
While a measure of success has been achieved in attaining these objectives,
much more work remains to be done. The major sectoral issues will be
systematically addressed in an energy action plan that the Government expects
to develop in consultation with the Bank in the course of the next few months.

93.      Improvement in the performance of Turkey's major State institutions
in the energy sector is fundamental to the success of the energy development
program. Many of the key problems underlying SEE inefficiency are being
addressed through the SEE reform package (paras. 55-60). Proposals to
reorganize TPAO 1/ are under active consideration, and consultants have
recently been selected (to be funded under an ongoing Bank loan) to carry out
a thorough review of TPAO's existing management and planning systems.
Technical assistance is similarly to be provided to TEK 1/ and TKI 1/ in areas
such as management information systems, financial and cost accounting,
inventory control, and manpower planning. A new petroleum law with several
important provisions that are expected to make Turkey more attractive to
foreign exploration companies was enacted in March 1983. Revisions to the
mining law designed to stimulate private sector involvement in lignite
production are in an advanced stage of consideration. These measures should
serve to strengthen the institutional capability in the energy sector.
94.      The 1983 public investment program accords high priority to energy,
with energy investments receiving over 34 percent of the total
allocations. 2/ The program concentrates resources on projects with high
rates of return which can be completed quickly or which help to make better
use of existing plant capacity. Seven major projects in the energy sector
were completed in 1982, while 10 projects are scheduled for completion in
1983. As part of the SAL IV Program, a Planning and Programming Department
has recently been established in the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources. This Department will bear the responsibility for inter-agency
coordination with TEK, TKI, TPAO and SPO with regard to energy investments.
It will carry out a detailed review of the large energy projects included in
the investment program, undertake pre-investment studies, and evaluate all new
project proposals. It will also be responsible for formulating and updating
energy demand forecasts (the first update is to be completed in 1984) and for
translating these into appropriate investment plans.
95.      During 1983, the Government plans to continue its policy of adjusting
energy prices to reflect changes in the economic cost of energy. Frequent
adjustments are being made to petroleum prices to keep pace with international
prices and changes in the exchange rate. In November 1982, for example,
petroleum prices were raised by close to 20 percent. Price levels for
petroleum products are currently above international costs. Other energy
prices are also being adjusted regularly to cover costs, although distortions

exploration and for producing, importing, refining, transporting, and
marketing oil; Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu (TEK), the agency responsible for
generation, transmission, and distribution of almost all the electricity
sold in Turkey; Turkiye Komur Isletmeleri Kurumu (TKI), the agency with
responsibility for extraction of coal and lignite.
2/ This comprises electricity (referred to as energy in Turkish
publications), petroleum exploration and refining (about 11 percent of
manufacturing investment), coal and lignite mining (about 90 percent of
mining investment), and pipelines (about 2 percent of transport
investment).



- 39 -
still exist in relative prices of different sources of energy. Under SAL IV,
the Planning and Programming Department in MENR will review, by end-1983,
existing energy pricing policies with a view to identifying appropriate
relative pri-es between petroleum products and lignite to encourage the most
efficient use of energy resouices. The Energy Assessment Report has
recommended that the present bulk and retail tariffs for electricity be
restructured to reflect the long-run marginal cost of supply including a
reasonable real rate of return on assets.  Tne Government has accepted this
recommendation in principle, and further action on it will be pursued through
ongoing project work.
96.      It is clear that increased efficiency in the use of energy must play
an important role in reducing the pressure on existing resources. The
Government intends to strengthen considerably the current institutional and
incentive arrangements for encouraging energy efficiency. A new energy
conservation law is expected to be enacted in 1983 and will be followed by the
formulation of a comprehensive national conEervation program, which will
define the objectives and guidelines for enErgy conservation in all sectors of
the economy. Two energy conservation divisions are being set up in the MENR;
one will monitor energy efficiency and consE!rvation programs, and the other
will carry out research in energy conservation and environmental protection.
97.      Overall, the Government's approach to the development of the energy
sector consists of a combination of carefulLy selected investments,
institutional improvements, and incentives, supported by changes in the legal
framework. The Government has thus far concentrated most of its efforts to
reduce dependence on importecd oil by expanding lignite and power output.
There is, however, a limit to what the State lignite and power development
agencies can be expected to accomplish, even if all the proposed institutional
reforms are carried out quickly and effectively. In order to reduce Turkey's
dependence on imported energy, the Government would have to place a higher
priority on a complementary approach comprising the expansion of efforts to
develop other known primary energy resources, particularly the recovery of oil
from proven reservoirs, the development of gas resources, the exploitation of
geothermal fields, and the more extensive use of forestry resources and wood
plantations for fuelwood. A second important element would be the enlistment
of the skills and resources of the private sector, both domestic and foreign.
The third element of the complementary approach would be the encouragement of
greater efficiency in the use of existing energy resources. This includes
instituting pricing and other policies thal: encourage greater efforts to
reduce energy consumption, and establishing institutions that can provide
technical assistance to industry in energy savings. While none of these
approaches alone will solve the problem of the high dependence on imported
energy resources, together they should be able to make a substantial impact on
the problem.
Overview
98.      The Government's structural adjustment program represents a
systematic effort to change the basic direction of Turkey's economic
development. It is a medium-term program, since the structural changes that
are being attempted will take several years to be completed. Furthermore,
deeply-entrenched attitudes will change only slowly, as more evidence becomes



- 40 -
available that the new development strategy is being consistently applied and
will not be reversed. As this report shows, much has been achieved during the
first three years of the program, principally in the areas of macroeconomic
policies (including domestic resource mobilization, export promotion and
import liberalization), rationalization of public investment and improvement
in SEE performance, and in policy reforms in the agriculture, industry and
energy sectors. The principal challenge for the Government in the coming year
is to broaden and deepen the structural adjustment process, building on the
progress already made, and to place it in a medium-term framework that sets
out the primary economic goals for the 1980s. The SAL IV Program represents a
positive response to this challenge. If successfully implemented, it will
result in significant incremental achievements in all the main areas of
economic performance. Moreover, although the Government's own medium-term
plan is expected to be finalized only in October of this year, the work
already done on it in Turkey suggests that it will be fully compatible with
the goals of the structural adjustment program and will help to guide the
process in the years ahead.
Creditworthiness
99.      At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of
$7.2 billion in short-term debt and $6.9 billion in medium- and long-term
debt. It was faced with service payment obligations (mostly on short-term
debt) of $5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly three times the value of
merchandise exports in 1977. Following the resolution of the 1978 debt
crisis, Turkey pursued a very conservative policy of external borrowing which
was restricted almost entirely to long-term borrowing. Much of this was
arranged through the OECD Consortium for Turkey and was extended on
concessional terms. Also, between 1978 and 1980 Turkey rescheduled some
$9.6 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of rescheduling
arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors. Approximately
$6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in convertible TL
deposits and bankers credits and $1.2 billion of non-guaranteed suppliers
credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or partially converted into
TL obligations. As a result of these actions, short-term debt as a percentage
of total debt outstanding fell from 49 percent in 1978 to 12 percent in 1981.
Inflows were mostly from official sources--major creditors being the OECD
countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the total debt outstanding at
end-1981, 87 percent constituted medium- and long-term debt. Based on the
growth scenario outlined earlier, debt outstanding and disbursed as a percent
of GDP is projected to rise from 28 percent in 1981 to 31 percent in 1982 and
then fall to 29 percent in 1985 and 26 percent in 1990.
100.     Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. The debt service ratio increased to about 24 percent in 1982 from
about 14 percent in 1981 as a result of a large repayment of previously
rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements. The medium-term
projections show a decline of the debt service ratio to 19 percent in 1984, an
increase to 21 percent in 1985 (again on account of repayments of rescheduled
debt), and then a fall to 18 percent in 1990. The projections assume a
conservative level of commitments from commercial banks of about $120 million
per year during 1984-85 and about $200 million per year during 1986-90.



- 41 -
However, the projections also indicate that Turkey will require additional
annual gross capital inflows of about $1.0-$3.0 billion during 1985-90 in
order to close the anticipated balance of payments gap. A significant
proportion of it, perhaps on tlhe order of an additional $500 million -
$1.0 billion, will have to be borrowed from commercial banks during 1985-90.
There are some recent encouraging signs of Turkey's ability tc enter the
commercial market. In 1982, Turkey concludec a prefinancing of $200 million
for the agricultural cooperatives through a syndicated loan with about 30
Japanese and Gulf Banks participating. In addition, about $100 million is
expected to be raised soon to prefinance imports of oil from Iraq. Very
recently, Morgan Guaranty has received a mandate from the Turkish Government
to take the lead in raising medium-term finance of $200 million from
commercial banks for a loan to the Central Bank for balance of payments needs.
Risks
101.     The Turkish economy is at a transitional stage in its structural
adjustment. The medium-term prospects outlined in this report are derived on
the assumptions of export sustainability and a revival in private
manufacturing investment accompanied by fiscal and monetary discipline.
Besides a continuation of the policies introduced since January 1980, this
implies significant progress in key areas of structural adjustment such as SEE
reforms, financial and banking reforms, impcrt liberalization and further
rationalization of public sector investment. Without these adjustments, it
would seem difficult to envisage a rapid development of an efficient private
sector, on which the new development strategy hinges. The prospects are
favorable, but there are nevertheless some risks which could slow down
progress.  They include external factors such as adverse developments in the
trade environment and the availability of support from the international
commercial capital markets. Moreover, the costs of the stabilization process
in the form, for example, of increased unemployment and a decline in real
wages, may lead to pressure on the Government to abandon stabilization
policies earlier than desirable and revert to a high growth strategy before an
adequate foundation for it has been laid.
102.     The factors underlying the remarkable growth of exports over the last
two years have been analyzed in the report. Factors which threaten the
sustainability of future export growth include a quick revival of domestic
demand, the instability of the new export markets in light of the recent
decline in oil prices, the sluggishness of private investment in manufacturing
and the possible weakening of export incentives, including some relaxation in
the exchange rate policy of maintaining as a minimum existing external
competitiveness. These risks are not inconsequential since the recovery of
the Turkish economy and its ability to service a reasonable level of debt
depends heavily on a successful expansion cf exports. Failure of the export
drive, given the dependence on imports, could mean that Turkey would have to
resort to a strategy of reduced growth as a mechanism of adjustment, if it is
to avoid a repetition of the problems of the late 1970s.
103.     Turkey's prospects for future comraercial borrowing appear good
although it is unlikely that the level and composition of concessional medium-
and long-term commitments realized in 1980 will be repeated. Hence Turkey



- 42 -
will need a significant amount of foreign commercial bank medium-term credit,
in addition to the diversification of its bilateral aid arrangements. The
recent major improvement in the balance of payments should enable Turkey to
begin again to borrow medium- to long-term in international markets. However,
there are risks involved, since in addition to the reluctance on the part of
donors to lend to Turkey in light of its past history and recent slow progress
in debt management, the payment difficulties affecting developing countries in
general may severely affect the syndicated loan market.
104.     Another major risk concerns the adequate response of private
investment to the adjustment process. The new development strategy including
sustained export growth is dependent on the revival and redirection of private
investment in the medium term. An inevitable consequence of the current
stabilization process is the low level of private investment and the threat to
solvency of some of the commercial banks and private firms. Depressed
domestic demand, the inadequacy of the Turkish financial sector, high interest
rates, and the lack of equity funds are the major medium-term issues facing
the recovery. For the immediate future, the existence of substantially
underutilized capacity in many industries offers the prospect for expansion of
production without further investment. But in the medium term, the current
low level of private investment will have to be raised. The current steps to
restructure the financial sector assume great importance in this respect. In
addition, the stabilization process should lay the groundwork for a
progressive increase in private sector activity by succeeding in its aim of
lowering and then stabilizing inflation. The revival of the private
manufacturing sector is also dependent on continued progress in the control
and improvement in the composition of public investment. This calls for a
modest public investment program in coming years with more emphasis on
infrastructure, energy and agriculture to support the private sector and the
export drive. The major risk in this regard is the possibility of Government
formulating a large public sector-oriented Fifth Five Year Plan.
105.     On balance, while these risks are serious, they are not
insurmountable. The demonstrated capacity of the Turkish Government to carry
forward its program, devise flexible responses to new circumstances, and hold
steadfast to essential policies, gives confidence that the Turkish adjustment
program will continue to show commendable progress. The prospects of
declining concessional funds and the increased need to resort to the
commercial markets, make it all the more important that the program be kept on
track. Yet the biggest risk may well be in the political arena, for the
re-emergence of party political activity is bound to have some impact on the
direction of economic policy. The new Government will need to be particularly
adept at reconciling the inevitable sharper focus on the social costs of
several years of stabilization that will follow the restoration of democracy
with the restructuring objectives Turkey has set for itself.
Social Costs of Restructuring
106.     The adjustment program, which combines stabilization policies and
reform measures, has entailed some transitional costs, primarily in terms of
depressed domestic demand, increased unemployment and some possible distortion
in income distribution. While data on unemployment remain poor, they indicate



- 43 -
a deterioration in the employment situation, with unemployment increasing from
14 percent in 1979 to about 16 percent at present. The available data on
income distribution indicate a significant ceterioration during the last three
years in the position of government employees and industrial workers. The
principal cause for this has been the decline in real wages.
107.     The overall erosion in real personal incomes will be mitigated as
inflation is brought under control. Over the medium term, the unemployment
problem will be reduced if there is substani:ial economic growth resulting from
increased private investment and exports. 3uccess in pursuing the new
development strategy hinges upon the maintenance of the policy of real
positive interest rates and encouragement of exports, both of which should
reduce the bias in favor of high capital-intensive investments and promote
employment.
PART IV - THE PRO-POSED LOAN
108.     The proposed loan is the fourth in a series of loans supporting the
Government's structural adjustment program initiated in January of 1980. The
main developments of the program have been described in this report. A letter
from the Minister of Finance dated April 2., 1983 sets out the major
refinements in the program and the new policy actions envisaged for 1983 and
early 1984. The letter and its updating St:atement of Development Policies -
1983 are attached as Annex IV-A. Preliminary discussions on the possible
content of the SAL IV package were held wil:h the Government in October 1982,
and the proposed loan was appraised in March 1983. Negotiations were held in
Washington on May 24, 1983. The Government delegation was headed by
Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Counselor for Financial and Economic Affairs, Embassy
of the Republic of Turkey.
109.     The proposed loan of $300.8 milliDn (including the capitalized
front-end fee) would finance about 3 percent of Turkey's total merchandise
imports and about 9 percent of the gross capital inflows over the disbursement
period (mid-1983 to mid-1984). The loan is designed to continue Bank support
for the structural adjustment program through 1983 and early 1984, and has
been determined partly in light of the overall size of the Bank's lending
program for Turkey.
110.     The proposed loan would finance cEll goods to be imported into Turkey
except for goods financed by other sources and a specific list of excluded
items such as military or paramilitary items and luxury goods such as tobacco,
precious stones and jewelry, gold, and nuclear reactors and parts.
Counterpart funds would be deposited in a special account with the Central
Bank; as under previous SALs, the Government would continue to use these to
help finance expenditures included in its development programs. While the
Bank has not sought to influence the Government in its allocation of funds,
the Government has indicated that it would expect to continue to allocate the
funds to high priority development projects.



- 44 -
Procurement, Disbursement and Administration
111.     The satisfactory administrative arrangements made for SALs I-III
would be continued, with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank bearing
the main responsibility for administering the proposed loan. Procurement and
disbursement performance under the SALs has been entirely satisfactory. To
simplify disbursement, the minimum amounts for invoices and withdrawal
applications established under the previous loans, $5,000 and $25,000,
respectively, would be retained (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para. 1 (e) and
Section 2.10 (b)). The loan would be disbursed against only foreign
expenditures, with retroactive financing permitted up to $40 million of
expenditures made after June 1, 1983 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
para. 1 (c)). The retroactive financing is to ensure a smooth flow of
commitments and payments during the transition period between the third and
fourth loans. Imports would be made directly by actual users, with imports
costing $10 million or more procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Certain commonly
traded commodities may be purchased through price quotations from organized
international commodity markets. All contracts of lesser value would be
awarded through normal trade channels on the basis of normal procurement
procedures of the public and private sector firms concerned. The procurement
procedures of public sector firms provide for substantial international
bidding or shopping and are satisfactory. Firms in Turkey have adequate
choice of international suppliers to ensure reasonable availability and price.
Monitoring
112.     Monitoring of performance under the SALs involves essentially two
complementary and inter-related activities: a more general monitoring of the
progress on implementing the program and the monitoring of specific progress
as a condition of tranche release. Time and data considerations place limits
on the actions that can be meaningfully monitored before tranche release.
Proposed conditions for release of the second tranche of $100.8 million
include:
(a) satisfactory progress in the development of a 1984 annual program
(para. 43);
(b) satisfactory progress towards rationalizing public investments
and concentrating resources on high priority projects (para. 54);
(c) satisfactory progress in import liberalization (para. 63); and
(d) satisfactory progress towards reduction in the level of the
financial transactions tax (para. 80).
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
113.     Through May 31, 1983 the Bank/IDA have lent $3,939 million to Turkey,
through 71 projects. Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds lent,
industry and DFCs for 34 percent, power for 13 percent, structural



- 45 -
adjustment and program loans for 26 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education and tourism for the remaining 9 percent. As of
March 31, 1983, IFC commitments to Turkey totalled about $236 million, of
which about $82 million were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1983,
with notes on the status of ongoing projects.
114.     The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crisis from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures, and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds.
The implementation of private sector projects has generally been more
satisfactory. Recently, however, the high interest rates for working capital
combined with depressed domestic demand and reluctance of investors to take
the foreign exchange risk, have led to slow commitments under DFC lending.
Disbursements average 53 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural
adjustment loans) as compared to 55 percent for Tunisia and 45 percent for
Morocco.
115.     Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of redirecting the Turkish economy towards a development path placing more
reliance on market forces and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy.
These objectives also include increasing donestic savings and reorienting a
restrained public investment program to reflect the Government's priorities of
completing ongoing projects f'aster and emphasizing quick-yielding new
investments with positive balance of paymenl:s impact. The main vehicle for
the Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. Three SALs have so far been approved, and
the proposed loan would be the fourth.
116.     Agriculture, industry, transportation and energy will continue to be
the key sectors for project lending. In agriculture, projects are expected to
emphasize irrigation, credit, and reform of the extension and research
services. In industry (including DFCs), the emphasis will be on the promotion
of exports, employment, and increasing operitional efficiency. Energy
projects underway are for power generation '7ased on domestic hydro and lignite
resources, as well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration.
Future projects will emphasize both the oil/gas and coal/lignite sub-sectors.
In addition, transportation projects will focus on developing the
infrastructure to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of
operations.  Projects for industrial training, urban and regional development
and public utilities may supplement these efforts.
117.     The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently inc'Ludes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development p'Lan, employment, SEEs, transportation and the
agro-industrial subsector.



- 46 -
118.     This loan and a loan for power transmission are the third and fourth
operations of this fiscal year to be presented to the Executive Directors at
the same time. A loan for development of the Thrace gas field is also
expected to be ready for Board presentation shortly. Other projects being
processed include: technical assistance to SEEs, industrial training,
agricultural extension, gas utilization and rehabilitation of the paper
industry.
119.     The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was
9 percent in 1981, and is expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
13 percent in 1981 to about 14 percent in 1985.
120.     IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, meat processing, motor bicycle engines, truck
manufacture, piston rings and cylinder liners, and tourism. It has also
invested in the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB). New investment
opportunities are being pursued.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
121.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of special interest are described in paras. 43, 54, 63,
80, and 112 and listed in Section III of Annex III of this Report.
122.     I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
123.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.       STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF MARCH 31, 1983 1/
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 - Ceyhan Aslantas Multipu;rpose Projet: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973.  Effective Date:
March 20, 1974. Closing Date: December 31,1983.
The project is expected to be substantially completed by the current
Closing Date of December 31, 1983.  As of March 31, 19839 about $35.5 million
has been disbursed of this $44 million loan.
Ln. No. 1023 - Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power ProjectO  US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Progress has been made on the power component in line with the
measures recommended in February 1982. The civil works contracts have been
renegotiated and additional contractors brought in. TEK has delegated site
management to STEAG, a German project management firm. The main contractor,
Foster Wheeler (FW), has revised the work plan taking into account the use of
erection personnel being made available by the main equipment suppliers. The
revised work plan concentrates maximum effort in completing Unit No. 1 by end
1984. Units No. 2, No.3 and No. 4 would follow at one year intervals. With
the arrangements made through the US EXIM Bank, and the proposed reallocation
of an additional US$6.8 million from the IBRD loan, financing for the FW
contract through end 1983 is assured. Social infrastructure and salary
problems persist.  The contract for operation and training for the mining
component expires in July 1983. Decision on renewal has not been taken. The
contract for mine consulting is continuing. TKI has not negotiated frame
contracts for mine equipment maintenance. Maintenance of mine equipment is
inadequate. TKI's ability to mine lignite in sufficient quantities to
adequately supply the power station (17.6 million tons per year) will be
assessed in connection with the appraisal of a supplemental loan tentatively
scheduled for September 1983.
Ln. No. 1130 - Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of
June 23, 1975. Effective Date: January 22, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1984.
Satisfactory progress is being maintained except for delayed payment
to contractors by DSI. The Bank has agreed to the Government's request for
reallocation of proceeds so as to provide additional funds for short-term
credit, which is expected to be sufficient to cover needs until a proposed
second agricultural credit project, now scheduled for Board consideration in
June 1983, becomes effective.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln. No. 1248 - Agricultural Credit and Agro-Lndustries: US$54.3 million loan
of May 5, 1976. Effective Date: May 11, 1977. Closing Date. June 30, 1984.
The supervised credit and ferryship components are fully disbursed
and the stu-i_ of TCZB organization and operations has been completed. Due to
reluctance of sub-borrowers to assume foreign exchange risk and availability
of other sources of credit without this risk, only 11 percent of the
agro-industries component has been disbursed. The Government is considering
proposals for dealing with this issue.
Ln. No. 1258 - Balikesir Newsprint: US$70 million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, L976. Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Although the Closing Date has not been extended, accounts are being
kept open pending settlement of final payments. As of March 31, 1983, $68.4
million, or 98 percent of the total loan amount, has been disbursed. A
project completion report is under preparation.
Ln. No. 1265 - Livestock III: USt21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976.
Effective Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
The Closing Date has been extended to March 31, 1984 to allow for
utilization of the remaining $6.8 million of undisbursed loan funds. Project
implementation has been satisfactory. However, the increased availability of
locally bred offspring of imported cattle at considerably cheaper prices than
for comparable directly imported cattle, has caused a serious reduction in the
demand for sub-loans. The Bank is currently considering a request from the
Government for restructuring all three ongoing livestock projects to include
financing for the foreign exchange component: of loans for sheep and beef
fattening in addition to dairying; locally bred improved cattle and sheep, as
well as imported ones; and farm machinery and equipment, livestock housing,
pasture and forage production, feeds and other inputs in addition to livestock.
Ln. No. 1310 - South Antalya Tourism Infrast:ructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date: March 1, 1978. Closing Date; December 31,
1983.
Project implementation is about two years behind schedule due to
initial difficulties relating to land acquisition and project organization.
At present most project works are either completed or under advanced
implementation. The Closing Date has been *extended for the first time by one
year to December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, $10.8 million, or 42 percent
of the total loan amount, has been disbursed.
Ln. No. 1379 - DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date: July 21, 1977. Closing Date:
December, 31, 1982.
The Closing Date for this loan has not been extended, but the
accounts are being kept open for settlement of final payments. As of
March 31, 1983, the undisbursed balance of this loan is $7.0 million.

Page 5 of 9
Ln. No, 1585 - Northern Forestry: US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date: October 30, 1978. Closing Date: March 31, 1986.
Overall physical achievements are about 60 percent of targets. Local
funding, which is almost totally dependent on timber sales, has been
inadequate due to a depression in the construction industry. Although
equipment procurement is still behind schedule, proposals for foreign
equipment procurement have been agreed, providing for initiation of remaining
procurement in 1983/84 with completion of disbursement expected by early
1986. A management consultant to assist the project implementation is
expected in Ankara shortly.
Ln, No. 1586 - Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Dat`e  October 31, 1978.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1985.
Tmplementation of the supervised credit program is extremely slow due
in part to the increased availability of locally bred offspring of imported
cattle at considerably cheaper prices than for directly imported cattle. A
Government request for restructuring of all three ongoing livestock projects
(see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No, 1606 - Erdemir Stage II Steel:  US$95.0 million loan of June 30,
1978. Effective Date:  July 30, 1979.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1983.
Inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira have caused serious
financial problems for the company.  Proposals to tackle the situation are
being considered by the company and the Government in consultation with the
Bank. Implementation of the main components of the original project is one
year behind schedule with additional delays now expected on some non-critical
support facilities and several additional items recommended by consultants to
improve productivity, quality, and efficiency. A financial plan prepared by
the company is being reviewed.   Extension of the Closing Date to permit
utilization of the remaining loan funds is dependent upon development of a
satisfactory financial plan.
Ln. No, 1741 - Ports Rehabilitation: US$75 million of July 2, 1979.
Effective Date:  January 22, 1980.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1983.
Cumulative loan disbursements of $38.0 million up to March 31, 1983
were only about 51 percent of the total loan amount due to initial delays in
tendering, awarding contracts, appointing consultants for port planning study,
and finalizing specifications of a 250-ton floating crane. Physical
implementation is now progressing satisfactorily. Extension of the Closing
Date is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1742 - Grain Storage: US$85 million of July 2, 1979. Effective
Date: January 21, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Prequalification procedures for silo construction contractors are in
progress. The Government is currently examining the merits of possible
adjustments in the project contents to take account of changes in relative
prices and cost increases due to previous delays.

Page 6 of 9
Ln. No. 1748 - TSKB XIII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$60
million of July 12, 1979. Effective Date: October 25, 1979. Closing Date:
September 30, 1983.
Delays in committing this loan have resulted due to c,ib-borrowers'
reluctance to bear foreign exchange risk and cancellation of loan contracts
because of financial distress caused by high interest rates and shortage of
local currency. These financial problems which are endemic in the Turkish
private sector have prevented TSKB's serious arrears position from improving.
The current Closing Date of September 30, 1933 is not likely to be extended.
As of March 31, 1983, about $43.4 million has been disbursed.
Lns. Nos. 1754 and 1755 - TSKB (US$65 million) and SYKB (US$15 million)
Private Sector Textiles loans of September 17, 1979. Effective Date;
February 29, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
A lower than anticipated level of commitments (about $38 million or
55 percent of forecasts) stilL prevails due to depressed conditions in the
textile industry and the sub-borrowers' reluctance to assume foreign exchange
risk. Local consultancy service has been reorganized on schedule, as a
private sector joint venture without further need of the Bank's financial
support.
Ln. No. S-15 - Ankara Air Pollution Engineering: US$6 million loan of
December 12, 1979. Effective Date: April 4, 1980. Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Out of the five components of this project, only two (Seyitomer Plant
and Air Pollution Monitoring Equipment) have so far been partly implemented,
representing US$0.9 million or 15 percent of the total loan amount. The test
results from the MTA pilot plant showed that investment in a larger scale
pilot plant would not be warranted. The Alternative Technology Study will not
be executed since no feasible processes exist for coke or hot briquetting
manufacture based on Turkish lignite. The Gas Production Study will be
implemented, but the cost for the study might be significantly higher than the
appraisal estimate. Revision of the cost estimates and extension of the
present Closing Date are under consideration.
Ln. No. 1844 - Karakaya Hydropower: US$120 million loan of May 21, 1980.
Effective Date: August 15, 1980. Closing D)ate: December 31, 1988.
Implementation after initial delays is now satisfactory. The cash
generation covenant was not met for 1982, and is not likely to be met for
1983. This matter is now being pursued with the Government.

Ln. No. 1847 - Sumerbank Textiles Modernization and Rationalization:
US$83 million loan of May 28, 1980. Effective Date: February 27, 1981.
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
After initial delays of about one year due to delayed loan
effectiveness and staffing problems of the project implementation unit,
project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily and the costs are
within appraisal estimates. The reorganization plan for the Cotton Textile
Division was approved by the Sumerbank Board in March 1982. Recruitment of
competent personnel for the Cotton Textile Division and the project
implementation unit has been hampered by salary limitations on State Economic
Enterprises. The situation is expected to improve after the passage of the
SEE reform decree.
Ln. No. 1862 - Livestock V; US$51 million loan of June 6, 1980. Effective
Date:  October 22, 1980.  Closing Date:  June 30, 1987.
Progress on the credit component for livestock development, witb the
exception of boilers, is extremely slow. The Government has decided not to
implement the meat processing component due to changes in its investment
priorities, and a request has been received to reallocate the funds.
Implementation of the animal health and breeding components is reasonably
satisfactory. A Government proposal for increasing the types of livestock
credit eligible for financing (see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1916 - Petroleum Exploration Project: US$25 million loan of
November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Project implementation is slow due to delay in contracting consulting
services and initiating technical studies. Acceptable drilling locations have
not yet heen identified in southeast Turkey. The Bank has recently approved
the Government's request to extend the scope of the loan to include the Thrace
basin, which has been found to have a highly attractive potential for
hydrocarbon exploration, and to reallocate a portion of the proceeds of the
loan to finance computer equipment for higher quality seismic data processing
needed for the Thrace program. Progress in separation of TPAO's
import-related operations is also behind schedule because of its relation to
the broader issues under consideration in the SEE reform legislation.  Energy
audits for five major industries are currently in progress.
Ln. No. 1917 - Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project:
US$62 million loan of November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project is about one year behind schedule due to initial delays
in equipment procurement and delivery. Bids for the enhanced recovery studies
for other fields are under review, and the studies are expected to start
shortly. The fracturing of the Hamitabat gas field has been completed
successfully and has demonstrated the feasibility of full commercial
development of the field. Progress in separation of TPAO's import-related
operations has also been delayed because of its relation to the broader issues
under consideration for the SEE reform legislation.

Ln. No. 1952 - Labor Intensive Industry Project: US$40 million loan of
March 13, 1981. Effective Date: June 12, 1981. Closing Date;
June 30, 1986.
A ,-oor investment climate still continues to hamper loan
utilization. As of January 31, 1983, subloans totalling $16.8 million had
been approved by SYKB.
Ln. No. 1967 - Second Fruit and Vegetable Project: US$40 million loan of
April 6, 1981. Effective Date: August 1981. Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding more slowly than projected, but
should improve as a result of experience gained to date: all consultants have
been engaged and are in place. Three of the four Regional Marketing
Corporations will become operational as socn as TCZB's contribution is
received in early May 1983.
Ln. No. 1985 - Fertilizer Rationalization znd Energy Saving Project:
US$110 million loan of May 15, 1981. Effective Date: August 28, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
The project components of AZOT ancl IGSAS are progressing
satisfactorily. GUBRE, one of the three beneficiaries, has not yet signed a
contract with an engineering company for project implementation because of
changes proposed in the scope of the project by GUBRE management to further
improve its economic viability.
Ln. No. 1998 - State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project: US$70 million loan
of June 3, 1981. Effective Date: August 27, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank is
considering the Government's request for an extension of the deadline for
completion of a study of DYB's future role.
Ln. No. 2093 - Export-Oriented Industries Project: US$100 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: May 28, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Although the special task force for dealing with problem projects is
now functioning relatively effectively, prolonged low capacity utilization
rates in industry and high interest rates make a substantial improvement in
arrears unlikely in the near future. Demand for direct foreign exchange fixed
asset financing has been declining due to reduced private sector investment
demand as a result of current economic conditions and the unwillingness of
sub-borrowers to bear foreign exchange risk. The technical assistance program
for potential exporters has been proceedirg on schedule.

Ln. No. 2094 - Erzurum Rural Development Project; US$40 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: November 24, 1982. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
Since the loan became effective in November 1982, implementation has
been on schedule for the irrigation, soil conservation, new roads, plant
protection, and veterinary services components. However, progress is slow
with extension services and recruitment of consultants, and it has proved
difficult to recruit and retain a project manager in Erzurum.
Ln. No. 2131 - Second Fertilizer Rationalization Project: US$44.1 million
loan of May 13, 1982. Effective Date: April 13, 1983. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
This loan became effective in April 1983. The Government has
requested cancellation of Part A of the project which relates to GUBRE, one of
the four beneficiary fertilizer manufacturing companies of the project, which
is no longer interested in proceeding with its portion of the project.  The
total loan amount will accordingly be reduced from $44.1 million to $38
million to reflect this cancellation.  The other project components are making
satisfactory progress.
Ln. No. 2137 - Highway Rehabilitation Project: US$71.1 million loan of
May 13, 1982. Effective Date: August 13, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress continues to be good. All civil works and procurement
contracts have been bid and feasibility studies have been completed for all
the remaining road sections included in the loan.
Ln. No. 2158 - Structural Adjustment Loan III: US$304.5 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date; July 16, 1982. Closing Date:
December 15, 1983.
This loan became effective in July 1982. The first tranche of the
loan has been fully disbursed. Release of the second tranche has been
authorized (May 1983).
Ln. No. 2159 - Istanbul Sewerage Project: US$88.1 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date: January 24, 1983. Closing Date:
December 31, 1988.
This loan became effective in January 1983.

April 22, 1983
Mr. A. W. Clausen
President
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
Washington, D. C.
Dear Mr. Clausen:
We have now completed the third year of the Government's program for
restructuring the Turkish economy. The adjustment program has helped Turkey
to progress towards an inflation rate that is more compatible with a sustained
rate of economic growth and to restore the balance between the public and
private sectors in 1982. The major accomplishments in 1982 as well as our
program for 1983 have been summarized in the attached Statement of Development
Policies. I am writing to you at this time to request a Fourth Structural
Adjustment loan in the amount of $300.8 million during 1983 to support the
Government's ongoing medium-term program of structural change.
During 1983, the Government intends to continue to open up the Turkish
economy to the interplay of market forces and, as part of this effort, to
reduce further the selectivity of various Government policies. The attached
Statement of Development Policies for 1983 outlines the main elements of the
Government's medium-term program for structural adjustment and the measures
underway or to be taken during the year. These policies have been discussed
in detail with your staff. Agreement has been reached with the International
Monetary Fund on the performance criteria of the monetary program through the

INTRODUCTIO'N
1.       The Government is entering the fourth year of its program of
structural adjustment. This program has as its objective to redirect the
Turkish economy towards a development path placing more reliance on market
forces and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The success of this
process so far is most evident in the rapid growth of exports and the equally
rapid decline in the inflation rate.
2.       This "Statement of Development Policies" underlines the Government's
commitment to continue the adjustment process and describes the measures to be
implemented in 1983 to support the medium-term program of structural change.
These measures are of two distinct types:
(i) macro-economic, which include the development of a medium-term
framework, SEE reforms, import liberalization, export growth
and the continual rationalization of the public investment
program; and
(ii) sectoral, which include the implementation of specific measures
to deal with structural issues in the agricultural, energy and
financial sectors.
3.       The last three years -- since the January 1980 reform program was
formulated -- have witnessed considerable progress in the fundamental
restructuring of the Turkish economy. The new strategy has four major
strands: monetary stability, export promotion, an enhanced role for the
private sector especially in manufacturing, and an increased reliance on
market forces as opposed to regulation. This has given the economy an outward
orientation and helped to lessen the depenclence on import substitution and
production for the domestic market which hitherto characterized economic
management. The complete harmonization of the various policy regimes
underpinning the new orientation is, of course, a medium-term effort which can
only be partially undertaken in any given year. It is therefore important to
think in terms of incremental achievements within the broader context of a
medium-term framework.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.       The year 1982 was another positive period in the structural
adjustment process despite ithe attention given by the Government to
constitutional reform, the chain of bankruptcies among the money brokers as
well as problems encountered in trading with the EEC. Further progress in the

Page 3 of 15
stabilization program brought inflation down near the 1982 program target of
25 percent. Continued restraint in the fiscal and monetary areas contributed
significantly to the success of the Government's stabilization measures,
thereby increasing the chances for a more rapid return to the target growth of
6-7 percent per annum within the next few years. The program target of
$5.8 billion in exports was realized and represents a commendable 24.4 percent
gain in value terms over 1981.
5.       GNP grew at 4.4 percent in real terms in 1982, which is slightly
higher than the comparable figure for 1981. However, performance was not
equally satisfactory in all sectors. In the agriculture sector, due to
favorable rainfall conditions, a bumper crop contributed to a 6.7 percent
growth rate in value-added in comparison to the program target of
3.2 percent. To some extent, this was offset by a lower than expected growth
rate of 3.2 percent in industrial value-added versus 6.4 percent programmed.
Performance in other sectors of the economy was more or less on target.
Nevertheless, there was some concern that the growth rate of manufacturing was
being hindered by the private sector's perception that a revival of domestic
demand would be slower than originally anticipated.
6.       The current account deficit for 1982 was less than the mid-year
projection of $1.4 billion and well below the program figure of $l.8 billion.
It stood at $1.1 billion in spite of an unanticipated decline in the export
price of agricultural products and in response to a lower than expected value
of imports. As a percentage of GNP, the current account deficit fell from
3.5 percent in 1981 to about 1.7 percent in 1982. Despite the lower than
anticipated levels of workers' remittances in 1982, positive results in the
trade balance more than compensated for the negative developments in the
services account.
7.       In the fiscal area, progress was in the right direction even though
the indicators show a slight slippage in comparison with the program targets.
Government expenditures as a percentage of GNP declined from 22.6 percent in
1981 to 21.5 percent in 1982. Revenues were less than programmed, but the
Government reacted by decreasing the rate of expenditures and by cancelling
supplementary appropriations so that the budget balance, as a percentage of
GNP, improved slightly over 1981 to about 1.2 percent. By contrast, the SEE
accounts showed a marked improvement with net profits climbing to 0.5 percent
of GNP in 1982 from 0.1 percent in 1981. The financing requirements of SEEs
decreased both in absolute and relative terms, falling from 9.3 percent of GNP
in 1981 to 6.7 percent in 1982. For the year as a whole, public sector
borrowing requirements dropped from a level of 6.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to
5.5 percent.
8.       In the monetary area, all credit limits established under the Standby
Agreement with the IMF were observed although the collapse of some of the
money brokers put a severe strain on the banking system. The Government's
prompt actions averted a crisis of confidence, and any excess liquidity which
existed in September was eliminated in the last quarter of 1982 through a



- 65 -                         ANNEX IV-A
Page 4 of 15
smaller than envisaged growth of Central Banlc credit. Moreover, the continued
adjustment in the exchange rate contributed significantly to the continuing
export surge.
9.        In sum, Turkey has achieved significant progress in the structural
adjustment process during 1982.  The stabilization program ;.F proceeding
satisfactorily, export growth can no longer be termed a short-term phenomenon,
and the elimination of the use of supplementary budgetary appropriations in
mid-year vividly illustrates the Government's commitment to fiscal and
monetary discipline. However, there are areas of concern. Private investment
has remained sluggish mainly on account of the high cost of credit and lack of
availability of medium- and long-term funds. The financial situation was
aggravated by the failure in June 1982 of the largest brokerage house. While
the Government has averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector,
additional actions to reform and to strengthen the financial sector will be
undertaken this year.
AN OVERiLL VIEW OF THE 1983 PROGRAM
Macro-Objectives
10.       The Government's 1983 program has been conceived around a
continuation of the stabilization effort, with particular emphasis on the
control of inflation and further progress in the export area including
maintenance of the flexible exchange rate policy designed, as a minimum, to
maintain external competitiveness. Moreover, in addition to developing a
medium-term plan, the program emphasizes the determination of the Government
to open up the economy to market forces and, where appropriate, to gradually
eliminate selectivity in the application of Government policies.
11.       The Government is of the view that inflation must be brought under
control and that fiscal balance must be achieved before Turkey can regain its
target growth path. The Government's 1983 program is aimed at achieving these
short-term goals as rapidly ais possible in order to enable adequate attention
to be devoted to medium-term issues includiing growth and employment.  The
progress achieved in the balance of payments during 1982 will allow the
Government more latitude in 1983 to encourage some revival in domestic demand
while still keeping the current account deficit under control. In real terms,
GNP is targeted to grow at 4.8 percent in 1983, representing a moderate
improvement over the 1982 level; this will be due primarily to a projected
increase in domestic demand of 4.3 percent (versus 2.5 percent in 1982) and a
0.5 percent contribution from the foreign balance (versus 1.9 percent in
1982). The impetus to this growth is expected to come from a revival of
private sector investment which is projected to grow at 7.0 percent in real
terms.  In sectoral terms, the program calls for a growth of 3.4 percent in
agriculture and 5.5 percent in industry.



- 66 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 5 of 15
12.      With stabilization as a cornerstone of the Government's strategy in
1983, inflation is targeted to be reduced to 20 percent. Wages in the public
sector will be adjusted generally in line with the targeted inflation rate,
and it is hoped that the Supreme Arbitration Board will hold a similar line
with respect to union workers.
13.      Improvements in the current account deficit are expected to continue
in 1983, but at a slower pace than in 1982. Accordingly, the current account
deficit is anticipated to decrease to $0.9 billion from $1.1 billion in 1982,
representing a slight drop in relation to GNP (1.5 percent versus
1.7 percent). These results are based on a 17 percent growth in the value of
exports (from $5.8 to $6.8 billion) and a marginal improvement in workers'
remittances, both predicated on a revival of growth in the industrial
economies. Imports will reverse their 1982 trend and are projected to
increase in value terms by 12.8 percent mainly on the strength of an upturn in
domestic demand.
POLICY ACTIONS AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL
The Medium-Term Framework
Objectives
14.      The Fifth Five Year Development Plan will be completed by mid-1983
and will enable the Government to chart its course over the medium term.
Medium-term problems will be defined and their solution assigned priorities
within the Plan's annual programs.
Policy Actions
15.      Beginning in 1983, the Government will undertake an annual review and
draft its next annual program in the context of its medium-term projections.
This will enable the Government to carry out indicative planning more
efficiently and to provide both the public and private sectors with guidance
on macro-economic indicators over the medium term. The quality of its
planning capabilities both in the SPO and in the executing ministries will be
improved by:
(i) the upgrading of skills through the hiring of additional staff
and a more systematic staff development policy;
(ii) reorganization to improve the decision-making process;
(iii) the introduction of modern management methods; and
(iv) improved use of data processing.

Fiscal Policy
Objectives
16.      The Government's consolidated budget for 1983 indicates the
seriousne-.& with which it intends to pursue fiscal restraint and the
continuation of the stabilization effort. Expenditures, estimated to be about
TL2,265 billion or 20.8 percent of GNP, are expected to be matched by revenues
amounting to 20.2 percent of GNP; this will leave a negative budget balance of
0.6 percent which would be a further improvement on the results of 1981 and
1982. If revenues fail to match the planned 25 percent increase in 1983,
expenditures will be pared accordingly. It should be noted that in contrast
to the practice prior to 1982 when extra-budgetary appropriations could he
undertaken through administrative decision, supplementary appropriations now
require legislative action and must be suprorted by sufficient additional
revenues.
Policy Actions
17.      In the area of tax collection the Government intends to improve the
collection-to-assessment ratio. The number of tax controllers has recently
been increased, and penalties for arrears remain unchanged at the high rate of
10 percent for the first month and 3 porcent per month for subsequent months.
18.      To improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system in 1983, the
Government has:
(i) reduced personal income tax rate on the first TL1 million of
taxable income from 39 to 36 percent;
(ii) reduced the corporate income tax from 50 to 40 percent (in
respect of income accrued in 1982);
(iii) abolished the fiscal balance tax on corporate profits and
income;
(iv) doubled the assessment ratEs on real estate taxes;
(v) linked personal income tax paid by the self-employed to the
taxpayer's wealth; and
(vi) enacted a law to facilitate payment of tax arrears in
installments over the next two years.
Monetary and Credit Policy
Objectives
19.      For 1983, the aim of monetary and credit policy is to support the
growth targets set out in the annual program. This is to be done by achieving
relative price stability, increasing public savings, as well as by meeting the



- 68 -                            ANNEX IV-A
Page 7 of 15
credit demands of the productive sectors and supporting the export effort.
Agreement has been reached with the International Monetary Fund on the
performance criteria of the monetary program through the end of the current
Standby on June 17, 1983. It is the intention of the Government to explore
the possibility of a one-year addition to the present three-year agreement
with the IMF.
20.       The Government of Turkey is committed to a flexible exchange rate
policy which will, as a minimum, maintain external competitiveness. The
Government intends to continue this policy, which it has applied consistently
since 1980, because of its critical importance to the export drive and to
Turkey's medium-term outlook. In 1982 the nominal (December over December of
the previous year) effective exchange rate was depreciated by 21.5 percent in
accordance with this policy, resulting in a real depreciation of about
4 percent.
21.       The banking crisis of 1982 has highlighted the importance of reforms
in the fnancial sector. Of particular importance to the macro-economic
outlook for 1983 will be the procedures for determining interest rates. At
present, lending rates remain high in real terms and therefore tend to hinder
investments. The Government's objectives in this area are to:
(i) increase the role of the market in the determination of
interest rates;
(ii) progressively decrease selectivity as a policy tool in setting
interest rates, including to the SEEs;
(iii) reduce substantially the costs of intermediation; and
(iv) encourage the availability of medium- and long-term credits for
the productive sectors of the economy.
Policy Actions
22.       The Government has:
(i) arranged that the largest banks (those with deposits in excess
of 3 percent of total bank deposits) will determine the
appropriate level of interest rates;
(ii) fixed reserve requirements at a uniform rate of 25 percent for
sight and time deposits instead of the previous system of
differentiated rates;
(iii) changed the liquidity ratios of banks, which were between 10
and 15 percent and monitored once a month, to a single rate of
10 percent and monitored continuously; and
(iv) reduced the withholding tax from 25 to 20 percent.

Public Investment
Objectives
23.      Public fixed investment is programmned to grow at 5.2 percent in real
terms for 1983, following a shortfall in realized investmernt in 1982. The
emphasis, as in the previous year, will be on the completion of ongoing
projects rather than on the c:ommencement of new ones. The growth rate of
5.2 percent, which is justified by the necessity of investing in
infrastructure to support the overall level of economic activity, is intended
to represent an upper limit. With regard to the public investment program,
the Government will continue to:
(i) rationalize the ongoing public investment program;
(ii) restrain the growth of public investment in line with the
requirements of the Government's policies for the public sector
and avoid crowding out private sector investments;
(iii) accord priority to investments in energy, agriculture and
infrastructure;
(iv) progressively reduce, over the medium-term, the share of public
investment in total investmEnt; and
(v) reduce the share of public funds going to the manufacturing
subsector.
Policy Actions
24.      Within the framework of achieving the longer term goal of an
approximately equal balance in the ratio oi- private and public fixed
investment, in 1983 the Government intends to:
(i) design the Fifth Plan in accordance with the stated priorities
in energy, agriculture and infrastructure with a minimum of
50 percent of the allocations going to these three sectors;
(ii) ensure that the 87 projects identified as priority projects
receive at least 85 percent of the allocation for large
projects;
(iii) coDtinue to diminish the role of the public sector in
manufacturing by limiting allocations to 16.3 percent of the
total;
(iv) continue to review ongoing projects in order to identify
priority projects and drop those of uncertain economic merit;
and
(v) ensure that all new projects meet satisfactory economic and
financial rates of return and rates of completion criteria.

Page 9 of 15
25.      At the institutional level, the Government will continue to
strengthen its project evaluation UDit in SPO by appointing additional
qualified staff. It will also strengthen the project generating units in the
executive agencies and the SEEs by the establishment and appropriate staffing
of units to carry out pre-investment studies. Training programs will be
specified in order to staff the units with the required skills. Efforts will
be made to extend and upgrade DYB courses in project evaluation in the SEEs.
Reform of State Economic Enterprises
Objectives
26.      In the area of SEE reform, the Government's primary task will be the
implementation of the SEE reform decree (due to be approved in May 1983).
Given the importance of SEE reform to the achievement of the Government's
medium-term objectives, the Government will continue to take measures designed
to bring about immediate improvements in the financial situation of the SEEs.
Policy Actions
27.      The program for the SEEs in 1983 will proceed on two fronts:
financial and legislative. With respect to the financial aspects of the SEEs,
the Government will:
(i) ensure that the program target of profits to GNP ratio of
0.6 percent is achieved; that the SEE investment to GNP ratio
does not increase beyond 6.5 percent; and that the financing
requirements of the SEEs as a whole remain below 5.9 percent of
GNP;
(ii) limit budget transfers to SEEs to TL292.0 billion in FY83,
representing a zero rate of real growth over 1982 given present
inflation assumptions, and within the above ceiling, transfers
to manufacturing SEEs will similarly be subject to a zero real
rate of growth over 1982;
(iii) continue its policy of not permitting SEEs automatic access to
Central Bank financing or to additional transfers from the
Treasury and, at the same time, encourage SEEs to raise their
own funds;
(iv) take measures to encourage SEE managers in TPAO, TMO, T.SEKER
and TZDK to reduce their stock-to-sales ratios; and
(v) ensure that target duty losses for 1983 are maintained at a
maximum of TL95.5 billion, representing a small decrease in
real terms over 1982, and that special efforts are made to
address these losses in TZDK and TCDD.

Page 10 of 15
28.      SEE employment decreased in 1982 mainly because of the inability to
fill new positions. The policy of hiring only one new employee for every two
vacancies arising is still in effect, and the 1983 program calls for a maximum
increase of 2.8 percent, for reasons of new investments coming on-stream.
This will be regarded as an upper limit, and every effort will be made to
reduce somc of the inefficiencies associated with unproductive labor.
29.      Within the framework of the proposed SEE reform decree, the
G?verymept intnds to seek tlhe Bank's assistance in improving the performance
o? se ec etd SE s.
Import Liberalization
Objectives
30.      The Government's import liberalization policy will continue in 1983.
This policy is an essential component of the medium-term structural adjustment
process because it will help to remove the serious bias in favor of the
domestic markets and against exports.
Policy Actions
31.      The Government reiterates its intention to:
(a) rationalize the existing tariff system; and
(b) gradually shift from a licensing system of import control to
one relying on tariffs.
With respect to (a) above, the Government, drawing on the recommendations of
the ongoing protections studies, will introduce a rational tariff structure
including providing for the industrial restructuring necessary to produce a
more competitive and export-oriented industry. With respect to (b) above, the
Government will adopt: a plan by September 1983 which sets out a timetable for
shifting from a licensing system to one relying on tariffs. In pursuance of
this plan, the Government will, in the 1984 Import Regime, shift a substantial
share of imports from Liberalized List II to Liberalized List I or the Levy
List. The Government will also simplify import formalities.
Export Incentives
Objectives
32.      During 1982 the Government encouraged exports through a policy mix of
subsidies and incentives, the most important of which were a flexible exchange
rate and selective eKport credits. The l1S83 program will continue to depend
on improvement in exports; it is therefore the Government's intention to
maintain the exchange rate policy, to ensure the availability of a
satisfactory level of export credits in 1983 within the credit constraints,
and to encourage commercial banks to incre!ase their role in such financing.



- 72 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 11 of 15
Policy Actions
33.      It has been three years since the present export incentive regime was
introduced. The Government will carry out during 1983 a detailed review of
incentives including:
(i) the possible exclusion from the benefits of preferential export
credits, exports with less than 20 percent of value-added;
(ii) a study of a system of medium- and long-term credits to support
the exports of capital goods in engineering services;
(iii) the introduction of a system of export credit insurance; and
(iv) a study to examine the possibility of introducing a system of
credits for indirect exporters.
POLICY ACTIONS AT THE SECTORAL LEVEL
The Financial Sector
34.      In view of the importance of the financial sector in the overall
structural adjustment process, the Government's objectives are to restore and
maintain confidence in the financial system and to expand its range, reduce
the cost of credit, improve the efficiency of credit allocation, allow more
competition in the financial sector, strengthen the institutions which
supervise the financial system and revitalize the capital market. Immediate
actions will be undertaken to redress the short-term problems of the financial
sector with the aim of reducing the high cost of credit for non-preferential
borrowers, and by streamlining selective credit practices and support policies
for banks and firms facing acute problems of liquidity and solvency. The
structural problems which are related to sectoral finance, the efficiency of
the financial institutions, the development of capital markets and bank
supervision will be addressed over the medium term with initial actions being
taken in 1983.
35.      The specific measures the Government intends to take in 1983 and 1984
are to:
(i) Interest Rates
(a) reduce further real interest rates, which are at
excessively high levels, by lowering the deposit interest
rates and gradually reducing the transactions tax. This
may be done in 2 or 3 steps by June 1984, with the first
step of reducing the transactions tax from 15 percent to
10 percent taking place by June 1983. Alternative sources
of Government revenues will be sought to compensate for any
shortfall;



- 73 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 12 of 15
(b) reduce, as early as possible, the disparity of interest
rates applied to preferential credits. The lowest rates
will be set equal to the rate of inflation. As long as
real interest rates on non-preferential cr^dits remain
high, real interest rates on preferential credits will, in
principle, be set at a positive level;
(c) introduce a deposit insurance scheme; and
(d) undertake a study for introducing a system of floating
interest rates for mediumr-term and long-term credits;
(ii) Capital Market
(a) ensure that the Capital I[arket Board begins to function
effectively as the authority in charge of supervising the
securities market (both primary and secondary markets) with
temporary assistance at the outset by official auditors;
(b) revitalize the bond markEt by issuing treasury bills and
Government bonds at competitive rates and by encouraging
bond issues by development banks which can independently
service their debt (if necessary with a Government
guarantee as a transitional measure);
(c) undertake a study reviewing the introduction of medium- and
long-term bonds with interest rates indexed to the
announced interest rates on time deposits; and
(d) undertake a study to devise strategies for long-term
development of the equity market including measures in the
areas of accounting and auditing standards, taxation, the
organization of a new and viable stock exchange as well as
the establishment of new securities market firms and
reorientation of the investment guidelines of insurance
companies and pension funds;
(iii) Business and Financial Structure
(a) enable firms to revalue their fixed assets and accumulated
depreciat:ion. Revaluation will be done once as of
December 1L982 by income and corporate taxpayers. Economic
assets in the balance sheet will be revalued by
coefficienits which are derived from price indices. As a
result of this, new financial sources will arise and will
be used to issue new bonds and shares without bearing
taxes; and
(b) introduce legislation regulating the accounting profession
including the establishb,ent of an Association of Chartered
Accountants to be responsible for the formulation of
professional standards and principles;



- 74 -
ANNEX IV-A
Page 13 of 15
(iv) Bank Control and Supervision
(a) enlarge the role of the Central Bank in supervision of the
banking system;
(b) introduce a standardized accounting system for the banks;
(c) improve the system of monitoring bad debts and revise the
related tax regulations; and
(d) review credit extension limits by commercial banks to a
single customer.
The Agriculture Sector
36.      The Government will continue to promote increasing productivity and
growth of exports through encouraging a crop mix which better reflects
Turkey's comparative advantage. The outward orientation would include
modifying rigid self-sufficiency as a goal and increasing agricultural exports
while allowing for food imports as necessary. In pursuing this policy, the
Government will ensure that the objectives of its self-sufficiency policies
are not endangered. A greater share of the 1983 investment program will be
allocated to quickly gestating high priority infrastructure and services
projects. The Government will aim at further improving price signals and
reducing subsidies to increase the efficiency of resource allocation. Special
measures will be taken to improve the availability of credit, to reduce the
subsidy on short-term lending, and to improve the administration and
accountability of the sales cooperatives and segregate their financing from
the Agricultural Bank. Also, steps will be taken to increase water charges
and improve their collection. Other specific measures to be taken will be as
follows:
(i) Agricultural Investment
The portion of the overall 1983 investment program allocated to
the agriculture sector will be maintained at at least
11 percent;
(ii) Pricing and Marketing
(a) with regard to those commodities for which the Government
announces guaranteed procurement prices, the Government
will continue its policy of moving from producer support
prices to floor prices and, to this end, an appropriate
methodology will be developed for setting floor prices in
line with domestic and international commodity price trends
and the exchange rate;
(b) in line with the present commitment, the Government intends
to phase out fertilizer subsidies progressively over the
next three years;



- 75 -                      ANNEX IV-A
Page 14 of 15
(c) a review of the self-sufEiciency policies will be initiated
by the end of 1983 including examining the feasibility of
removing restrictions imposed on exportation of wheat by
the private sector; and
(d) the seeds decree will be revised to enable efficient and
expeditious testing of imported varieties of seeds and to
encourage formation of joint ventures with foreign firms
for commercial seed prodiction;
(iii) Research and Extension Services
In line with the reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture
undertaken last year, the Government will establish the
following three interministerial working groups with
responsibility to:
(a) develop a medium-term planning capability in order to
analyze agricultural policy and make recommendations for
policy reform;
(b) set priorities for the use of research and to develop

(c) develop medium-term plans for reorganizing and
consolidating the Government's diverse extension services
including decentralization of responsibility to the
regional level in addition to improving links with
agricultural research;
(iv) Credit
The Government will develop and implement proposals for
improving the efficiency andl accountability of the sales
cooperatives and study measures to make them financially
self-sufficient with their :redit obtained on commercial terms.
The Energy Sector
37.      The Government recognizes the importance of energy to future
prospects for growth and the need to reduce oil imports by increasing the
production of indigenous sources of energy and by encouraging greater
conservation. In the investment program, highest priority has been accorded
to investment in energy with 34 percent of the public investment program
channelled into this sector. The medium-term energy investment program is
currently under review, and emphasis will be placed on high priority,
economically viable projects with due consideration given to the
implementation capabilities of the energy agencies and the availability of
financial resources.

38.      Importance will be attached to improving the performance and
efficiency of key institutions in the energy sector under the new SEE decree.
It is also the Government's aim to devise a better system of planning and
inter-agency coordination in order to formulate accurate and realistic energy
demand forecasts and to translate these into appropriate investment plans.
Encouragement will be given to stimulate private sector involvement in energy
development. Accordingly, the Government is revising the petroleum and mining
laws. Satisfactory legislation on energy conservation and the design of a
comprehensive national conservation program will also be undertaken.
39.      Other measures to be taken by the Government in 1983 are to establish
a Planning and Programming Department in the MENR with appropriate terms of
reference and staffing. The work program will include the responsibility for
coordinating preparation of revised energy demand forecasts to be updated on
an annual basis, the first of which is to be completed during 1984. The
Planning and Programming Department will carry out a proper evaluation of a
number of large, high priority projects in the energy investment program. The
Planning and Programming Department will also review, by end-1983, existing
pricing policies and practices with a view to identifying appropriate relative
prices between petroleum products and lignite so as to encourage the most
efficient use of energy resources.
