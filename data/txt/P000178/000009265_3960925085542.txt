PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BURUNDI
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 976-BU)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Education
Project in Burundi for which an IDA Credit was extended to the Government
in April 1980. The Credit became effective in July 1980. The estimated
total cost of the project was US$18 million of which US$15 million was
covered by the Credit. The Credit account was closed on June 30, 1986 when
all the funds were disbursed.
This repor;, prepared by a Unesco mission for the Government of
Burundi under the terms of the Unesco-World Bank Cooperative Agreement, is
a follow up on the Government-prepared evaluation report dated December
1986. The Unesco mission, comprising an architect and a technical edu-
cator, reviewed the relevant files at IDA headquarters and discussed the
project with the concerned IDA  staff.   The mission visited Burundi during
February 13-27, 1987, held mettings with the appropriate authorities and
visited project institutions.   Information  from  the  field visit and the
Government report was used in preparing this report. The valuable assis-
tance provided by the Government, particularly Project Implementation Unit
staff, is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with thi revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited ty  OED  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments on September 23, 1988. An
English  translation  of  two  telexes   received  from  the  Borrower  are
reproduced as Attachments I and II.

SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 976-BU)
EVALUATION SUWMARY
Introduction
The Second Education Project (Credit 976-BU, in the amount of
US$15.0 million) was identified by a Unesco-IDA mission in August 1978 and
?rep&7ed by the Government with Unesco assistance in February 1979.
Project appraisal in May 1979 and post-appraisal in September 1979 by the
Association were followed by negotiations during November 29 - December 3,
1979. Total project cost was estimated at US$18.0 million equivalent, or
Franc Burundi (F.Bu) 1,620 million, including contingencies.  The Credit of
US$15.0 million covered 83 percent of total cost, including the foreign
exchange cost of US$13.35 million, while the balance of US$3.0 million was
to be financed by the Government.   Following Board approval on January 29,
1980 the Credit Agreemen: was signed on April 23, 1980. The Credit became
effective on July 21, 1980.
The project was originally scheduled to be completed in December
1984 and the Closing Date was June 30, 1985. With an augmented staff and
careful planning, the PIU was able to complete the implementation of the
original project items ahead of schedule, with cost savings amounting to
27.5 percent of the US dc_lar appraisal estimates. The savings enabled the
Government to  include  additional  project  items:    construction  of two
technical schools (bringing the total to four), 16 multipurpose learning
centers and miaor renovation of some general secondary schools. The Credit
Agreement was amended twice, in November 1981 and March 1983 to accommodate
additional project activities (para. 1.17), which were completed in April
1986. The Closing Date had been extended to June 30, 1986. Total project
cost, including the additional items, was US$18.0 million or about
F.Bu 1,680 million, the latter being 4 percent higher than the appraisal
estimate (par&. 3.01) The Credit of US$15.0 million was fully disbursed.
Oblectivea and Scope
The project was designed to assist the Government in (1) training
middle-level technicians and skilled workers in industry and commerce; (ii)
implementing and evaluating its educational reform; and (iii) strengthening
the Ministry of National Education (MNE) in planning and management of
educational services. The original project comprised the following:



(vii)
A. Technical Secondary Education
(a)  Construction, furnishins and *euipp:nx oft
(i)  Two new tecondary technical schools, including staff
housing;
(ii) A mechanics department in an existing secondary technical
school, and
(iiit A commarcial lower secondary department, including board-
ing and staff housing, in an existing secondary commercial
school.
(b) ProsIsion of Technical Assistance: Eight man-years in workshop
management.
B. Education Services and Studies
(a) Provision of equipment, materials and vehicles to the Planning
Unit of MNE;
(b) Provision of vehicles to the Inspectorate and the General
Secondary Education Bureau (BEPES) and the Technical Secondary Education
Bureau (BEET);
(c) Provision of vehicles and nine man-years of specialists ser-
vices to the PIU; and
(d) Implementation of a study on primary education and literacy
programs and another on technical education.
As mentioned above, the Credit Agreement was amended in 1981 and
1983 to allow for the inclusion of additional project items, among other
things.
Implementation Experience
Implementation of the original project components was about a year
ahead of schedule. Efficient project implementation was due to a strong
PIU, staffed mainly by expatriates, and the use of a simplified, modular
design for buildings and standardized building components such as roor
trusses, roofing, doors and windows, all of which contributed to a short-
ened construction period and significant cost reduction (para. 2.05).
Unacceptably high ICB quotations for the construction of the Bubanza
Constructiot. Trade School and the Gitega School for Public Works led to the
decision to use force account to build these two schools. No major prob-
lems were encountered during construction. All project buildings are good
quality one storey structures. All equipment was delivered on time and
fully used, except in the Kamenga Technical Secondary School where lower
than expected enrollment resulted in equipment underutilization (para.
2.09).  Furniture, prc aced locally, was serviceable although poorly
designed and constructed (para. 2.10).



(viii)
Technical assistance  was  well  used.    Specialist services were
effective in equipment verification and installation and management of
training programs.   Regrettably  the  project  made  no provision to train
local staff as counterparts to the foreign experts (para. 2.11 (a) and
(c)). Underestimation of design and supervision requirements and extended
use of force account instead of contracts for some civil works resulted in
the use of 15.8 man-years instead of the planned 9 man-years of technical
assistance. The planned pre-investment studies on technical education and
basic education were undertaken by Unesco which published the findings in
1980 (para. 2.11 (b)).   Overall  efficiency in implementation  resulted in
about US$5.0 million savings which were subsequently used to finance the
additional project items mentioned above.
Results
The project has been successful in meeting quantitative targets,
promoting educational reform, and strengthening Ministry of National
Education services (para. 6.01).   The  extension of two existing technical
schools (Kamenga CSS and TSS) and the construction of two new schools
(Bubanza CTTS and Gitega SPW) contributed to total enrollment capacity in
technical education and diversification of courses and programs. Simul-
taneously, staffing of the Technical Secondary Education Bureau and the
Planning Division of MNE was strengthened (para. 6.02). On qualitative
achievements, however, the results are mixed. While the rationalizaD.ion of
the technical education structure, curricula and methods represented a
break-through for Burundi, the results in some technical and conmercial
courses fell short of appraisal expectations (paras. 4.23 and 4.28). Some
project schools have high dropout and rep-tition rates, while their train-
ing facilities are  underutilized  (paras.  4.09-4.10).   Although positive
curriculum changes have been made, the allocation of teaching periods for
practical work at the Bubanza CTTS was inadequate (para. 4.07), and no
practical training arrangements were made with potential employers for
stAdents of the heavy-duty equipment course at Gitega SPW and the general
mechanics course at Kamenge TSS  (paras.  4.10-4.12).    As a result of the
lack of a staff development program, there is a shortage of local technical
and commercial subject teachers, among whom two-thirds are unqualified.
Over 50 percent of technical and commercial subject teachers are expatri-
ates, and even among them about a quarter are unqualified (para. 6.06).
Sustainability
While the project schools were reported to be adequately main-
tained, the high dependency on expatriate teachers, who comprise over 50
percent of the project schools' teaching staff, places the project's
sustainability on a precarious position, unless steps are taken to train
more local staff to replace the  expattiates.   The use of expatriates also
suggests a high dependency on external aid in financing a major part of the
recurrent expenditures (teacher salaries) of the project institutions.
Thus, replacing expatriates  with  local  staff  will  also entail assuming
responsibility for higher recurrent costs which must be borne by the
Government.



(ix)
Findints and Lessons
(a) The project demonstratea that a well-staffed PIU, aided by
efficiently used technical assistance, can *xpedite project
implementation   and   lower    costs   significantly   (paras.
2.03-2.05);
(b)  Th- lack of a  local  staff  development program to replace the
expatriate PIU staff meant that there has been little insti-
tuticnal development in that the experience gained through the
project will be lost when the expatriates leave (para. 2.03);
(c)  A high dependency on  expatriate  teachers places the project's
sustainability in a precarious position (paras. 4.18-4.21); and
(d)  Close coordination is required  beLween schools responsible for
formal technical instruction and employing agencies with heavy
duty  equipment  to   provide   students  with  practical  work
experience.



L PROJECT BACKGROUND
Socio-Ec.omic setting
1.01 Burundi is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the
world. About 95 per cent of its population, estimated at 4.5 million in 1984,
is settled on small land holdingp scattered across hilly rural areas, making a living
from subsistence farming, tea and coffee which are Burundi's main export crop.
1.02 The major constraints to development have been (a) the dependency of
foreign exchange earningp on one major commodity, coffee, which accounts for
about 85 per cent of export receipts; (b) general poverty (US$240 GDP per capita
in 1984); (c) a land-locked position dramatically raising import transportation
costs; (d) limited natural resources, in particular a relatively small agricultural
area; (e) rugged terrain resulting in population dispersion pnd poor communications;
and (f) extremely low levels of education and skillsi/ which preclude a more
efficient use of the limited natural resources of the country and reduce possibilities
for develoFment projects. Moreover, Burundi is co..fronted with such population
problems as a current annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent; rural-urban migration
mainly towards Bujumbura, the only major city in the country; and a very young
populationa', resulting in an increasing dependency ratio and burden on the active
population.
1.03 Since 1977, the Government has been committed to a development policy
to benefit the whole population. The major objectives of this policy, reflected
in the Third Five-Year Development Plan (1977-1982), have been to: (a) emphasize
agricultural production to meet the needs for food, (b) increase the rate of
economic growth while providing greater employment opportunities and more
income to the poorest segments of the population; (c) give the Government a
more active role in mobilizing financial and private sectors; and (d) foster
decentralization of economic and social activity. A number of actions have
been taken in particular to develop rural areas and retain their population
by improving their living conditions and increasing their working efficiency and
earnings. Among these actions is the expansion of basic education, assisted by
the Project.
1.04 Between 1976 and 1980, GDP growth averaged 4.5 per cent per annum
in real terms, as compared with the revised plan target of 5 per cent. Agriculture
has remained the mainstay of the economy and contributes 60 per cent of GDP
and practically all exports of the country although the general productivity in
this sector has been low. Improvements have been sought through the intreduction
of new crops and techniques, marketing procedures and land preservation. However,
the active participation of the farmers and support of Government services have
been limited by the low level of basic education among the rural population,
and by limited managerial, technical and administrative skills in the public sector.
1/ Three out of four adults are illiterate and, despite recent substantial progress,
primary and secondary enrolment ratios are still very low.
2/ Primary and secondary school-age groups represent about 15 per cent and
17 per ce-nt of the total population, respectively.

duaion Setor
1.05 General. Formal educatiord./ was introduced hy Christian missionaries
and expanded under the colonial administration. Until 1962, the main emphasis
was placed on primary schooling. Education was generally based on European
patterns and reached only a small percentage of the population. In 1962, primary
schools enrolled only 18 per cent of the relevant age group. Since 1973, the
Government, with Unesco assistance, has introduced a comprehensive reform
of the education system to adapt education to local environment and make it
more responsive to the country's development needs. Substantial progress has
been made since then, in particular during the period of the Plan and after the
adoption of the double-shift system in 1982. As a consequence, the primary
enrolment ratio was 52 per cent of the age-group in 1985/86, but the literacy
rate only 25 per cent (1981). Private non-formal institutions (the Yagamukama
centres) enrol an additional 30 per cent of the age group. At the secondary
education level, the enrolment ratio is among the lowest in the world at 2.5 per
cent of the relevant age group and is insufficient to provide an adequate base
for middle-level manpower training programmes. The higher education ratio,
at 0.9 per cent, is quantitatively sufficient for the country's manpower needs
but higher education is not oriented towards practical employment requirements.
1.06 Administration and Planning. The Ministry of National Education (MNE)
is generally responsible for the development of education policies, management
o. the education sector and coordination of vocational training which is under
the jurisdiction of other ministries. The implementation of the primary reform
and the supervision of the primary system has been entrusted to the Rural
Education Bureau (BER), while the reorganization and reform of secondary
education are being introduced under the responsibilty of the Secondary Education
Bureau (BES) and Inspectorate. The Technical Education Bureau (BET), which
was created in 1977 within the Directorate General of Secondary Education,
is responsible for the development and implementation of the technical education
reforms. Educational planning is carried out by a Planning Unit established in
the Ministry of National Education in 1977.
1.07 Primary Education. At this level, the 1973 reform emphasized the use
of the national language, Kirundi, as the language of instruction instead of French
which would be taught as a second language from fifth grade. It also initiated
courses in environmental sciences (etudes du milieu) and practical subjects. The
basic objective was to prepare students for productive life in their environment,
rather than for the next level of education. Primary schools were to be
progressively converted into Multipurpose learning Centers (Centres de Formation
Polyvalente - CFPs) - community schools for children and adults, focal points
for training, civic activities and rural development programmes.
1/ The structure of the formal education system is, at present, as follows: six
years of primary, four years of junior secondary (JS), three to four years
of senior secondary, and two to five years of higher education.



- 3 -
1.08 Secondary Education. Secondary education comprises general secondary
education, teacher training, and vocational and technical courses. General
secondary education has been expanding at about six per cent per year between
1978 and 1981. In spite of the overall increase in enrolment, admission to the
first year of secondary education has stagnated because of shortages of student
places aggravated by a substantial number of repeaters. Under the reform,
curricula of secondary education were to be diversified. Primary teacher training
courses enrol JS graduates and last two years.
1.09 Technical Education. Skilled worker and middle-level technician training
courses of three to four years' duration are given in woodwork, electrical
technology, mechanics, public works, metal work and construction. In addition,
there are three agricultural schools, one commercial school and four paramedical
training centres. Technical education has been growing rapidly at about 13 per
cent per year over the years 1980-1985. The output is sufficient at present to
meet manpower requirements for middle-level technicians, but is insufficient
for semi-skilled and skilled workers.
1.10  Higher Education is provided by She National University of Burundi which
offers options and applies international standards. The Government is attempting
to reduce training abroad as the heterogeneous backgrounds and levels of education
obtained by students abroad create difficulties in the work place. Enrolments
almost quadrupled between 1974 and 1979. Entrants are now strictly selected
and Government fellowships have been reduced. This has resulted in better control
and stabilization of enrolments at the planned level. in addition, orientation
of students has resulted in better matching of skills with labour market needs.
1.11  Non-formal Education includes: independent religious Yagamukama centres,
government-sponsored social centres and ad4lt training courses in the Multipurpose
Learning Centres (CFPs). The Yagamukama centres teach functional literacy
and numeracy, crafts, health, nutrition, sanitation and improved cultivation of
foodcrops to primary school age children and adults who cannot be served by
the formal system. The programmes have been popular and effective, considering
the scarcity of resources available to them. However, parents prefer public
primary education when it is available as it is the only programme which can
lead to secondary education. Since 1980, the Ministry of National Education
has provided a two-year basic programme for adults and unschooled youth in
the CFPs. The results of this programme have so far been rather disappointing.
1.12  Manpower Needs. It is estimated that 95 per cent of Burundi's Labour
Force is involved in subsistence agriculture and that at least one third of manpower
resources in this sector is underutilized. Better education of the rural population
is essential to increase agricultural productivity and for the success of programmes
aiming at conitrolling population growth. The modern sector, concentrsted in
Bujumbura, employs only about 100,000 persons in construction, industry and
trade, of which 70 per cent are in the public sector.
1.13  Education Finance. Public education in Burundi is virtually free for the
users and financed from the Government budget, except for book fees. However,
secondary and higher education students are required to pay a small fee. More
than 95 per cent of Government financing of education is through the MNE.
In 1981, total expenditures for education averaged 15 per cent of total government
expenditure, representing 2.8 per cent of GDP. The MNE capital expenditures



- 4 -
over the last five years have ranged between three per cent and seven per cent
of total Government capital investment and are projected to average about five
per cent during the remainder of the 1980s. The share of education recurrent
expenditures in the Government's budget decreased fro#m about 22 per cent in
i978 to 17 per cent in 1984 and is expected to return to 22 per cent in the late
1980s. While this is a heavy burden on the Government budget, it is similar to
that of other African countries at a comparable level of development. However,
it seems clear that on financial grounds it would be difficult for the Government
to achieve its aim of UPE by the year 1990. Major cost savings measures already
decided upon are being implemented. These measures include: (a) the introduction
of double shifting at the primary level; (b) the phasing out of boarding at the
secondary level; (c) an increase in secondary school fees; (d) more careful screening
of entrants and limitation of fellowships at the university level. In addition more
liberal grade promotion policies have been adopted at primary level.
Prolct Identifiation
1.14 The Project was identified by a joint Unesco-World Bank mission in Augut
1978 and prepared by the Government with the assistance of a Unesco team
in February 1979. It was then appraised by a Bank mission in May 1979.
Negotiations were held in Washington from 29 November to 3 December 1979.
The Project was approved by the IDA Board of Directors on 29 January 1l80.
Project ObJectives
1.15  The objective of the Project was to assist the Government in (a) training
middle-level technicians and skilled workers in industrial trades and
secretarial/administrative skills; (b) implementing and assessing the reform of
the education system; and (c) strengthening the MNE's planning, supervisory
and Project implementation services.
Project Content
1.16 The Project as approved included:
Technical Secondary Education
a. Construction, furnishing and equipping of two new boarding technical secondary
schools, including staff housing.
b. Construction, furnishing and equipping of a mechanics department in an existing

h. Provision of nine man-years of specialists' services and vehicles to the PIU.
P!ojct Amendments
1.17  The Credit Agreement was amended twice: (a) on 27 November 1981,
to allow for the execution of civil works of the two new boarding technical
secondary schools by force account, and (b) on 2 March 1983, to allow for (i)
the establishment of a revolving fund, (ii) the construction, furnishing and equipping
of about fifteen multipurpose learning centres (CFP) and (iii) the maintenance
and improvement of existing secondary schools.
H. PROJECT IMPLEMENTAIION
2.01 The Credit Agreement was signed on 23 April 1980 and it became effective
on 21 July 1980. The Project, as initially designed, was completed on schedule
with a total cost underrun of 27.5 per cent in terms of US$. The Agreement was
amended to include additional components and the Closing Date was extended
from 30 June 1985 to 30 June 1986 to allow for implementation of these additional
components (see para. 1.17) and the extension of the Technical Assistance
Programme until the new Closing Date of the Credit Account.
Projct A
2.02 The Project Imple. .entation Unit (PIU) was established by Presidential
Decree on 5 November 1976 as the 'Bureau du Projet Education' (BPE) in the
Ministry of National Education for the implementation of the First Education
Project. Its main duty, according to the Decree, was to administer the Project
and to liaise with IDA. Over a period of time, PIU duties expanded. It has
implemented the First and Second Education Projects and is implementing the
Third Project as well as an African Development Bank-financed Project.



- 6 -
2.03  Initially, the PIU staff consisted oi a national Project director, an expatriate
architect-deputy director, a national Project accountant and a support staff of
about 30. During the implementation of the Second Education Project, the number
of staff increased and the key staff posts such as the Director General (Project
Director), the accountant, the procurement officer, architect and site supervisors,
were occupied by the same persons throughout the implementation of the Project.
(See Annex 1). The Director-General was a national of Burundi, but nearly all
other key posts were occupied by expatriates. The Third Project provided posts
for two architects, one procurement specialist, two construction supervisors and
one accountant.
2.04  The PIU presently employs 11 staff in the professional category, 75 in the
category of support staff and qualified workers, and 151 non-qualified or semi-
qualified workers, all on a permanent basis. An estimated number of 1,400 workers
of different categories is employed on a temporary basis.

2.05  All buildings included in the Project had their architectural and structural
designs prepared by the PIU staff. An external consulting firm was called upon
for the preparation of the electrical and water/sanitation installation design and
the external works, as well as for the topographical surveys of the Bubanza and
Kitega sites. The work of the consulting firm was satisfaCtory. Building designs
are simple and functional and well adapted to local conditions. The plans follow
a modular system proposed in a relevant study prepared by the Unesco Regional
Bureau for Africa at Dakar (BREDA). This has allowed the standardization of
the building components such as roof trusses, roofing, doors, windows, etc. and
architectural details throughout the Project buildings. This standardization made
possible the prefabrication of a large number of building components in the
workshops of the PIU and the simplification of construction with the result of
shortening the execution periods and reducing the cost. Space requirements and
areas are in conformity with appraisal estimates. In the Bubanza CTTS, the Gitega
SPW and the mechanics department of the ETS, Kamenge, additional spaces, mainly
classrooms, were required because of changes in the curricula. Appraisal estimates
were based on the assumption that common courses would last two years and
specialization would start in the third year. Actually, common courses last only
one year. The additional year of specialisation increased the number of grc ps
and the requirements in the number of classrooms (See details in Annex 2).
Cntrwtio
2.06  AU Project buildings have one storey, and their construction is in general
of reinforced concrete framework with exposed brick, non-bearing walls, steel
roof trusses and corrugated iron roofiig. (See details in Annex 3). The quality
of cornstruction is good and the buildings require little maintenance because of
appropriate design and construction materials.
Civil Works
2.07  It was foreseen at appraisal that civil works contracts for the academic
anti F- rrlir - f i-iliti , nf tF  Psli\ n  t"M    ntl tF  r,it , ePW ,willd F'  w rti d



on the basis of international competitive bidding. The staff housing of the above
institutions the Mechanical Department of the Kamenge TSS and the Typing and
Bookkeeping Department of the Kamenge CSS were to be carried out by the PIU
utilizing force account procedures. Sixty-five per cent of the total civil works
component were to be carried out under private contracts and 35 per cent under
force account procedures. International tendering for the above two contracts
took place between L.arch and June 1981, but the bid prices were not considered
acceptable and, at Government request, IDA authorised in November 1981 the
use of force account procedures to build the Bubanza and the Gitega academic
and boarding facilities. The Credit Agreement was amended accordingly. The
CSS and the TSS facilities at Kamenge were completed and became operational
in September 1981 and September 1982, two and one year ahead of schedule
respectively. The Bubanza CTTS works were completed by June 1983 and the
institution was operational in September 1983 as scheduled. The Gitega SPW
works were completed by April 1983 and the institution was operational in
September 1983 as scheduled.
2.08 No major problems arose during construction. The working drawings of
the Kamenge TSS had to be corrected after the excavation work (two per cent
of the total works) was carried out because the original plans of the buildings
were not compatible with the agreed educational requirements. This was due
to defic.ent coordination between the Technical and Vocational Directorate of
the MNE, the Technical Education Bureau (BEET) and the PIU architect, resulting
in a misinterpretation of the worksheets. The Bubanza CTTS site required extensive
development work because of the irregularities of the terrain. The school was
finally built on four terraces with ground levels varying 13 metres in altitude.
In all, 22,000m3 of earth had to be moved. The Gitega site was flatter and only
3,300m3 had to be moved.
Egpment
2.09 The equipment lists were prepared by the MNE in collaboration with the
chefs de travaux and technical teaching staff, and were approved by IDA. The
equipment, of appropriate type and quantity, was delivered and installed in time.
In most of the Project schools, the equipment is in full use. However, because
the total enrolment in the Mechanics Department of Kamenge TSS is lower than
was planned (para. 4.20), not all the equipment in this department iE in full use.
Most of the consumable materials for training purposes are supplied to the schools
in sufficient quantity by the MNE.
Fur'niture
2.10 Furniture lists as well as technical descriptions and tender documents were
prepared by the PIU. Manufacturing was based on technical descriptions and
prototypes, as no drawings were prepared. Furniture was produced by local firms
after local competitive bidding. All furniture was delivered to Project institutions
in sufficient quantity and in step with the progress of the construction work. The
quality is satisfactory without being excellent. There are minor problems relative
to the quality of the wood which was not always dry enough, and the welding
workmanship of the steel parts. Reception of the finished products has not always
been systematic because of lack of facilities and staff.

2.11 The Project originally included: (a) the services of two engineers to be
enggd as Chefs de Travaux for three and a half years each, one for the Mechanics
Department of the Kamenge TSS and one for the Gitega SPW; (b) 12 staff-montth
of specialists' services required for the pre-investment studies; and (c) nine staff-
yer of specialists' services to reinforce the PIU.
(a)       ialsts' services as chefs de travaux. SpeCialists' services for the
Kamenge TSS and the Gitega SPW were provided unier contracts with
two Canadian firms. Bcth specialists started their v ork in 1982 under
two-year contracts which were later extended until 19W6. In 1985, because
he had to return to his job in Canada, the chef de travaux at Gitega SPW
was replaced b'1 another one, an engineer teaching at the same school.!/.
Annex 4 shows the planned and actual implementation of the technical
assistance programmes for the Project schools. The technical assistance
programme has been sumc_..sful in assisting both schools in the verification
and checking of all equipment, supervision of the installation of machine,
and management of the implementation of the training programme.
However, it was less successful in training local counterparts. At the Gitega
SPW, the local technician specialized in mathematics and physics has been
trained to take over as chef de travaux. As far as the Mechanics Department
of the Kamenge TSS is concerned, no member of the local staff has been
nominated or trained during Project implementation to take over as chef
de travaux.
(b)   Pre-investment Studies. Two pre-investment studies, one on Technical
Education and another on Basic Education were undertaken and published
by Unesco in 1980. The study on technical education was used during the
implementation of the Second Education Project and the study on basic
education provided essential inputs in the identification of the components
for the Third Education Project in BurundL2/. Both StiAdies were also utilized
for updating and expanding the sector memorandum produced by the IDA
in FY 1981.
(c)   Technical Staff of the PIU. According to the Appraisal Report (January
1980), the services of an accountant and of contruction supervisors for
a period of two years up to the Closing Daie of the Credit Account of
the First Education Project (March 1983) were planned to be paid by the
First Project. An additional nine man-years of technical assistance were
included in the Second Project to finance a full-time architect, two addit tal
construction suparvisors and a procurement specialist over a period of
three years. The Project has financed a total of 15.8 man-years as against
nine planned, of which 6.75 were for architects, 3.08 for construction
supervisors, 2.75 for the accountant and 3.08 for the procurement specialist.
The increase of the Technical Assistance Programme was due to an
underestimation of the Design and Supervision requirements combined
with the change in the execution of the construction - the extended use
of force account instead of contracts. An additional post of architect
was required as well as an extension of the term of the first architect and
the site supervisors. In addition, the accountant's services were financed
by the Project from the first quarter of 1981 until the end of 1983 and
a,



- 9 -
not as foreseen in the Appraisal Report. Financing of the procurement
specialist's services began in November 1980 instead of July 1982. Some
0.17 man-year were used for a technician (see details in Annex 4). The
technical assistance to the PIU has been very successful in assisting in
the implementation of the civil works and procurement components of
the Project as explained in paras. 2.05 and 2.07 above, and in para. 3.02.
The task of training local counterparts has not been accomplished because
no local staff was provided for the corresponding posts and no fellowships
were provided to train persons in the relevant specializations.
2.12 During Project implementation, BEET, in collaboration with the chefs
de travaux, technical teachers and some potential employers, prepared currlcql
and teaching materials for all the Project schools. After evaluation and
experimentation, some curricula have been changed and improved. The mission
found that new curricula and teaching materials are quite satisfactory for training
purposes.
2.13  During implementation, the Project schools have received a sufficient
number of textbooks and library books at a cost of about $152,000. The distribution
of the books, according to cost, is shown in the table below.

111. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
3.01   The total Project cost, including contingencies, was estimated at US$ln.0
million (F.Bu.1,620 million). All originally agreed Project components were
completed at a cost of US$13.05 million (F.Bu.1,218.3 million), at a cost 27.5
per cent in US$ and 25 per cent in F.Bu. lower than the original estimate. The
remaining funds were used to finance additional components (See para. 1.17).
The Project was completed with a total expenditure of US$18.0 million or
F.Bu.1,679.89 million (four per cent over the original estimated cost in F.Bu.).
Annex 5 provides a detailed comparison of appraisal and actual costs by component.

3.02  The considerable underrun in the total cost of the orig;inal Project can
be explained as the result of a combination of factors, the principal one being
the increased efficiency of the PIU which needed better organization, staffing
and equipment in order to cope with the duties of a construction enterprise building
under force accoutht. The PIU acted efficiently on three important elements
of the Project: (a) desig: it prepared functional and economical desgns with
standardized plans and  uilding elements; (b) construction: standardization in
the design allowed prefabrication and/or preparation of a number of building
elements in a central workshop as well as bulk purchases of materials which
resulted in economical and rapid construction; (c) management and supervision
of the works: by reducing the construction period, contingencies (cost increases)
were also reduced.
3.03  This kind of PIU intervention had not been foreseen at appraisal. Therefore
assumptions about the cost of civil works were based on: (a) unit costs for
execution by private contractors (65 per cent of the total value of civil workcs);
(b) more time for implementation with ensuing higher contingencies; and (c)
no designs being available (hence, cost estimates were based on ordinary designs).
For these reasons, estimated construction unit costs were substantially higher
than actual unit costs.
3.04  The cost of furniture was over-estimated b,cause: (a) its costs were,
as is usual, estimated as a percentage of construction costs; and (b) the efficiency
of the LU had a beneficial effect on the costs of both furniture and equipment
by reducing the period of implementation and facilitating procedures. The
corisiderable increase of Project administration costs (+231%) and technical
assistance costs (+24%) above the original Estimate is justified by the results
of the Project. Project administration costs, in this case, also include costs
normally included in the civil vorks component (overheads, equipment, etc.)
when this is executed by private contractors. The increase of US$1.43 million
for Project administration and technical assistance can be set against a decrease
of US$5.9 million for civil works, furniture, equipment and professional services,
resulting in a net saving of US$4.47 million, which represents 27.5 per cent of
the total Project cost in US dollars.
3.05  The picture of the final cost of the amended Project is given in Table
1 and the details in Annex 5. All expenditure on civil works, furniture and
equipment including that of the additional components was roughly covered by
the cost estimated for these categories at appraisal. The actual cost of technical
assistance exceeded estimate not only because of an extension of technical
assistance for project management but also because of reimbursement of technical
assistance expendittire incurred for the First Education Project.
3.06  Table 3.2 presents a distribution of estimated and actual Project costs
by category for the expanded Project. The figures shown here are alsc somewhat
distorted by the fact that the civil works cost includes only labour and local
materials.   Imported   building   materials   were  included   under  the
furniture/equipment/vehicles category (See Annex 6). Project administration
includes overheads and salaries relative to civil works which, under the normal
situation of private contracting, would have been included under civil works.

3.08       Disbursements were completed two months before the revised Closing
Date and ten months after that originally proposed. The bulk of the Credit (93%)
was disbursed by the end of the first term of 1984, 15 months before the original
Closing  Date.   The  high  rate  of  disbursement  is  due  to  the efficient
implementation.  Table  3.4 shows a comparison  of Project financing foreseen
at appraisal and as actually implemented. The distortion in Project cost (see
para. 3.06) must be borne in mind in interpreting the changes in financing
experienced in this case.

IV. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
Projected  hools and Depatmentb
4.01  One of the main educational objectives of the Project was to assist the
Government in training middle level technicians and skilled workers in industrial
trades and secretarial/administrative skills by providing construction, f urniture
and equipment for: (i) the Construction Trade Training School (CTTS) at Bubanza;
(ii) the School for Public Works (SPW) at Gitega; (iii) the Mechanics Department
of the Kamenge TSS; ard (iv) the Typing and Bookkeeping Department of the
Kamenge CSS.
4.02 Bubanza CTTS started its operations in September 1983 and now provides
380 places for skilled worker trainees in masonry/concrete construction, plumbing,
electrical installation and general mechanics. The duration of tht course is three
years at A3 level.i/ The Gitega SPW was established in September 1983 and
it replaced an old secondary school for training of surveyors and technicians
(GETO) previously located in Bujumbura. The new school provides training
programmes at two interacting levels: at the A2 level, 270 middle-level technicians
are being trained in surveying, construction supervision, drafting and rural
engineering/hydraulics; and at the A3 level, 60 skilled workers are being trained
in heavy-duty equipment operation and maintenance. The duration of both
programmes is three years. The Kamenge TSS became operational in 1982 in
the framework of the expansion and modernisation of the existing technical
secondary school. The department provides 90 places for middle-level technician
training specializing in general mechanics and industrial drawing. The duration
of the course is three years at A2 level. The Kamenge CSS was established in
September 1981 in the framework of the reorganisation of the existing commercial
secondary school. The department provides 280 student places of which not
less than 50 per cent are reserved for girls. The two-year programme in typing
and bookkeeping is the only training programme in the country at this low (A3)
level. Annexes 8, 9 and 11 show proposed and actual student enrolment and output,
teacher qualification and the student:teacher ratio in the projected schools and
departments.
Course Stucture, Eftimon Pro_ammes and Curricula
4.03  The mission found that, in principle, the courses established by the Project
follow the structure proposed by the appraisal mission. However, during Project
implementation, two schools (Bubanza CTTS and Gitega SPW), after consultation
with potential employers of graduates, have reduced the proposed common course
for some of the specialisations from two years to one and now provide
specialization as of the second yeara/. (For details see Annex 12). These changes
meet the employers' requirements. However, they involve numbers of teachers
and training space beyond those foreseen at appraisal.
1 / The explanation of the skill level is given in the glossary.
2/ These changes have been done without consultation with the IDA and without
proper consideration of additional recurrent cost implication they entail in
terms of Rdditional staff requlirement'i.



-15-
4.04 At the time of appraisal, it was noted that the overall technical and
vocational training programmes, with 34 per cent to 55 per cent of the time
devoted to pneral education subjects, were very academic and not specifically
oriented towards possible future employment opportunities. This was particularly
true in the case of industrial training schools where the initial year for A3 and
A4 levels courses included about 80 per of general education courses essentially
to make up for deficiencies in primary education. An additional shortccming
was the standardized duration of courses which did not take into account the
differences and specific requirements of the various trades.
4.05 The changes in the admission policy made by the Government during Project
implementation within the overall structural and curricular reform of education
has led to improvements in the curricula of technical and vocational courses
and oriented them more towards employment opportunities.'
4.06 Skilled Worker Proframmes (Level A3). At the time of appraisal, it was
agreed that the industrial type of programmes (mainly for tte Bubanza CTTS,
and the Gitega SPW) of three years duration each, would comprise 25 per cent
general education and science elements and 75 per cent work hop and field practice
and related theory. For commercial programmes in the Kamenge CSS, it was
proposed to maintain a two-year course with 40 per cent general education
including reinforcement elements mainly in Kirundi, French and English, and
60 per cent vocational training.
4.07 As can be seen in Annex 13, the distribution of teaching time between
goneral and technical! giuI.etq in the new curric1la hoc been modified considerablv
in the direction envisaged at appraisal. However, the allocation of teaching
periods for practical work at the Bubanza CTTS, especially for general mechanics
and electrical instaUation courses, seems to be inadequate (between 32 per cent
and 34 per cent only) compared with that of general subjects with related theory
(about 68-66 per cent).
4.08 In Typing and Bookkeeping the divergence between what was proposed
by the appraisal mission (40 per cent for general and 60 per cent for technical
subjects), and the actual distribution of teaching time (29 per cent for general
and 71 per cent for technical subjects) is fully justifiable in the light of changes
in the level of student intake for this course (paragraph 4.13).
4.09 One of the programmes proposed under the Project which has not been
fully implemented is the training of heavy-duty equipmnent operators/maintenance
workers at the Gitega SPW. In 1980 it was agreed between the Ministry of National
Education and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) that 60 students
of the heavy equipment operators' training section of the Gitega SPW would
utilize the existing training facilities and heavy equipment of the MPWH "Brigade
Ecole" located in the vicinity of Gitega and operating with the assistance of
ORT1/.
4.10 According to this agreement, the Section began the implementation of
three-year programmes containing general and technical subjects provided at
school as well as practical work (including engine operation) to be provided by
the MPWH. However this practical work has never been properly organized.
Although the MPWH agreed again in 1983 in the context of the forthcoming Fourth
Highway Project, to provide opportunities for practical work to trained engine

-16-
operators at the SPW, this support was withdrawn by the conclusion of a formal
agreement between the MNE and MPWH 1/on the division of responsibility for
training this type of skilled worker (Annex 14). However, for a group of students
who was supposed to graduate from this section in 1986, the training was extended
by one year to provide them with the practical work they had missed during the
previous three years of training.
4.11 Middle Level Teckmician Propammes (Level A2). At the time of appraisl,
it was agreed that the curricula for the middle-level technician training (mairuy
for the Gitega SPW and the Mechanics Department of Kamenge TSS) of three
years duration each would include 30 per cent general education and science
and 70 per cent technical training. As can be seen from Annex 13; the distribution
of teaching time between general education and technical training at the Gitega
SPW, is nearly on target (29 and 71 per cent respectively). However, the teaching
time allocated to general subjects and science in the Mechanics Department
Kamenge (TSS) appears to be insufficient (only 24 per cent) to provide a solid
background for technician training. The Department follows the recommendationm
of the appraisal mission, to have the first two years of training common for all
students and specialization in mechanics or industrial drawing starting in the
final third year.
4.12  At present, the Department is organized as an actual production unit.
The technical training programme includes a substantial number if production-
oriented training sessions covering ail aspects of mechanical production so that
the students are able as early as possible to participate in actual repair,
maintenance and manufacturing operations at school. However, nothing has
yet been done to arrange proper practical training directly within enterprises
at the final stage of the programme.
Admiion Policy, Enrolments and Output
4.13  During Project implementation and in order to improve technical education,
to adapt it better to employment opportunities, the Government has introduced
some structural reforms: a minimum age has been established (15 years) and
academic standards required for admission to technical sctiools have been raised.
At present, at leat two years of cycle d'orientationr' are required for admission
to A3 level training programmes instead of the compietion of primary education
as was the cam  at the time of the appraisal missionm  For some courses at the
A3 level, the Typing and Bookkeeping Department at the Kemenge CSS for
example, the admision level is even higher, namely, after completion of the
four-year  cycle  d'orientation.  In  keeping  with  the  appraisal  mission
recommendation, at present 50 per cent of student places in this Department
are reserved for girls ±.
4.14 Admission to the A2 training programmes requires completion of the cycle
d'orientation, and in some cases the best students from the A3 level are accepted.
In line with the appraisal expectations, the Bubanza CTTS and the Mechanics
Department at Kamenge TSS admit boys for training, and the Gitega SPW also
admits some girls to the A2 level'4. At present, all the Project schools provide

after the six yaof primary education.
3/ In 1986/87, out of 146 students, 103 are girls (70 per cent).
4/ In 1986/87, out of 268 students, 15 are girls (six per cent).



-17-
equal opportunities for all applicants, including those from remote areas of the
country by providing boarding facilities. The selection is competitive and is
determined according to (a) student preferences for a certain course V/; (b)
educational atta nment in the "cycle d'orientation"; (c) recommendations made
by the school, from which the student comes; and (d) availability of places in
each course.
4.15 The mission found that although all the schools in the Project began their
programmes on or before the agreed schedule (para. 6.02), the enrolment at some
of the sChools is still below the originally agreed level. As can be seen from
Annex 8, the enrolment of two newly established schools in the 1986/87 academic
year is nearly on target: Bubanza CTTS, 363 students out of 380 places available
(96 per cent), and Gitega SPW, 300 students out of 330 places available (91 per
cent).
4.16  However, the enrolment in two other schools in the Project is well below
the appraisal target - 57 students in the 90 places available at the Mechanics
Department, Kamenge TSS, and 147 students in the 280 places available at the
Department of Typing and Bookkeeping in the Kamenge cs.l/. The main reasons
for this shortfal' &re: (a) reduction of student intake (para. 4.26), and (b) a high
percentage of drop-outs (paras. 4.23 and 4.24).
4.17  In 1986/87, 79.8 per cent of the enrolment target was reached in the Project
schools (862 students in the 1,080 places available). As can be seen from Annex
8, in 1986 the total output of the schools and departments in the Project was
267 graduates or 74.5 per cent of the target. The output of two departments,
the Department of Mechanics and the Department of Typing and Bookkeeping,

operation and maintenance (Gitega SPW) because of the extension of the course
by one year (para. 4.10). It is expected that in 1987 the total output of the schools
in the Project will be increased to 88 per cent of the projected target.
Teachivn Staff
4.18  In discussing benefits and risks of the Project, the appraisal mission
accepted that a number of qualified national technical teachers might not be
available for service in time, and the Government provided assurances that
qualified expatriate teachers would be assigned to teach and provide pedagogical
training to national teachers in Project schools until national teachers were
available to fill their posts (para. 4.06, Appraisal Report). As can be seen in
Annex 10, at present, out of 94 teachers of technical and commercial subjects,
48 teachers or 51 per cent are expatriates and out of 26 teachers of general
subjects, seven teachers or 27 per cent are expatriates.
4.19  One of the problems facing the Project schools is the surplus of teachers
and at the same time, under-utilization of student places establi-hed by the Project
(para. 4.17). As a result, the student:teacher ratio in some schools is wen below
what was proposed by the appraisal mission (Annex 11).
1/ Each student is allowed to make three choices.
2/ The empty places available at the CSS are now being used for the training
of A2 level technicians and nurses.



-18-
4.20  At the time of appraisal it was estimated that in addition to 15 general
subject teachers, 74 technical teachers would be required for the proposed schools.
Of the latter, 14 were supposed to teach commercial subjects and 60, including
three workshop managers, teach industrial and technical subjects. As can be
seen from Annexes 9 and 10, in 1986/87, apart from teachers Of commercial
subjects, there were 71 teachers of technical and industrial subjects, including
three workshop managers, by comparison with 60 estimated at the time oij
appraisal. There are two reasons for this surplus. Firstly, the reduction of the
common course from two years to one with specialization introduced in the second
year instead of the third for some of the programmes at Bubanza CTTS and Gitega
SPW. This early specialization required some additional technical teachers who
had not been foreseen at the time of appraisal (para. 4.03). Furthermore, the
MNE has to retain some extra expatriate teachers in order to provide pedagogical
training to national technical and industrial teachers already selected as
counterparts. However, as far as training teachers of commercial subjects at
Kamenge CSS is concerned, the selection of national teachers as counterparts
to expatriates appears still to be a problem; at present, out of 23 commercial
teachersl/, cnly seven are national, and 16, or 70 per cent, are expatriates.
4.21  Another problem  concerns the quality of teaching staff. At the time
of appraisal it was estimated that for the Project schools, the proportion of
qualified, semi-qualified and non-qualified technical and industrial teachers should
be about 38 per cent, 57 per cent and five per cent respectively. Although by
1986/87 the proportion of qualified technical teachers (national and expatriate)
was 52 per cent, the percentage of non-qualified teachers was still very high
at 29 per cent.
Internal Efficiency
4.22  The pass rate of students in the Project schools varies from school to
school. As can be seen in Annex 8, at Bubanza CTTS, for example, after the
first year of training and during the last three years, about 12 per cent of the
students do not continue their training at school, and about 11 per cent of second
year students are repeaters. At the Gitega SPW, the average of students dropping
out is about eight per cent, except for the 1986/87 academic year when the school
lost 20 per cent of its second year students. The average rate of eight per cent
for repeaters is acceptable according to MNE norms.2t
4.23  However, the internal efficiency of the two other Project schools cannot
be considered normal. At tlhe Mechanics Department of The Kamenge TSS, for
example, for the last three. years the drop out rate of first year students has
been about 42 per cent. The situation was aggravated in 1986/87 when 13 per
cent of third-year, 15 per cent of second-year and 25 per cent of first-year
students were repeaters; the Department also lost seven per cent of second-
year students and 45 per cent of first-year students as dropouts.
l/ They are teaching both levels A3 and A2.
2/ The MNE norms for repeaters are about 10 per cent.



- 19 -
4.24  At the Bookkeeping and Typing Depatment of the Kamen             the
average rate of reaters of first year students has bon about 19 per cent for
the past three years, and the dropout rate has increased from eight per cent
in 1984/85 to 25 per cent in 1985/86 and 30 per cent in 1986/87.
4.25  In the view of the mission, the factors militating against internal efficiency
include two which are common to all Project schools. They are: (i) the relatively
weak academic background of entering students, and (ii) problems of quality
of teachers (para. 4.21).
4.26 The mission found that in spite of reforms of lower cycle secondary school
curricula (cycle d'orientation), and improved teaching methods introduced in
Grades 1-10 by the MNE since the time of appraisal, many of the students are
still inadequately prepared to enter technical and particularly A2 level-type
industrial schools such as the Mechanics Department of Kamenge TSS. Thee
is some indication that many students are afraid to enter this department after
lower cycle secondary school because they consider this programme too difficult.
This is probably one of the reasons why the annual intake to this programme,
which was provided by the Project with an intake capacity of 30, has dropped
to about 20 students.
4.27 In order to improve the proficiency of incoming students in mathematics,
physics and other science subjects, additional remedial courses for this type
of industrial programme will be required.
4.28  In spite of the improved proficiency of students entering the Typina and
Bookkeeping Department.l/, the internal efficiency of this course is still very
low. One reason for this is the quality o wintering students. The mision 'oun.d
that the best students entering the CSS are often trying to join an A2 level
programme available at this sc )zol 2/ which also accepts students after 10th
grade of lower cycle secondary school. Thus the students entering the A3 level
Typing and Bookkeeping Department consider it as a second choice and are not
very interested in the programme. A second reason concerns the uncertainties
of employment opportunities after graduation from an A3 level programme.
There are some indications that employers much prefer graduates from an A2
level programme to those of an A3 level programme whom they consider to be
too weak in terms of qualifications. The quality of graduates from the A3
level would probably be better if at the end of the final year some practical
training could be organized for the students directly at places of potential
employment, such as is done for A2 level students.
4.29  A third reason probably has to do with the techniques and attitudes of
teachers towards the students of the two different levels of programmes offered
at this school. There are some complaints that because most of the teachers
are teaching both A3 and A2 level programmes, some of them are too demanding
with A3 level students without having taken into account the specific level of
A3 students and without using appropriate teaching techniques.
1/ Since 1982, the level of intake for this department has been after graduation
from 10th grade (end of lower cycle of secondary school) instead of 9th grade
as was proposed by the appraisal mission (para. 4.13).
2/ Three-year programmes at A2 level in secretarial skills, accountancy, law
and management which make it possible for graduates to obtain salaries higher
than those of A3 level programmes.



- 20 -
4.30 The Ministry of National Education should study the problems of both
the Mechanics Department of TSS and the Typing and Bookkeeping Department
of CSS more carefuUy so as to raise the level of internal efficiency, while
continuing to improve the internal efficiency of the two other Project schools,
(Bubanza CTTS and Gitega SPW).
External Productivity
4.31 In keeping with the Credit Agreement, a monitoring and evaluation
programme was established at BEET to follow and assess the activities of students
enroUed in technical education, both during their training and after graduation.
The efficiency of this programme varies from one Project school to another.
4.32 Gitega SPW. This school introduced its tracer system in 1983 and has
already carried out an investigation of three groups of graduates. The results
of this analysis are given in the table below.

three years
The mission found that out of 152 graduates identified in the table, 85 per cent
are working directly in industry or in state'private companies, 12 are employed
as teachers at vocational schools, eight are continuing their education at a higher
level, two joined the military service, and no trace has yet been found of the
43 or 28 per cent other graduatesd./ The BEET is continuing to trace these other
graduates and the tracing of 1985/86 graduates has already started.
4.33     Bubanza CTTS. The first group of 85 students graduated from  this
school in 1986. BEET is coUecting information concerning the employment of
these graduates, but it is too early to make any sort of analysis or draw conclusions
at this stage because the information is insufficient.
4.34     Kamenge TSS (Mechanics Department). The first output of 18 students
was in 1985. Out of this number, seven students or 39 per cent started work
immediately in local companies, five were hired as teachers, four continued
their education, and two were unemployed at the time of the survey,
having changed jobs two or three times. The second group of 14 students graduated
in 1986. Out of this number, 10 graduates or 71 per cent started work in industrial
companies, one entered business, two were hired as technical teachers, and one
continued his education abroad l/

4.35     Kamenge CSS (Typing and Bookkeeping Department). In spite of the
fact that this department began its activities long ago, the tracer system for
its graduates has not been established as yet. According to BEET, there are
difficulties establishing thxis system because of the large number of graduates
widely dispersed and because of the instability of their empioyment.
4.36     The mission found that the evaluation of student performance as well
as the content of teaching programmes and teachers' performance during the
training in the Project schools is being done on a permanent basis. As a result,
some useful corrections in the content of programmes, curricula, level of intake
etc. have already been made. However, as far as the direct evaluation of
graduates' performance at their places of employment is conicerned, there are
still problems and some effort is needed to improve the tracer and evaluation
system as a whole.
4.37     Multi-purpose Learning Centres (CFP). Contrary to the original concept
of the educational reform, teaching of acrdemic and practical subjects at the
CFPs is not done by the same teachers. Each CFP consists in reality of two
centres: (i) the primary schools whose teachers teach virtually exclusively
academic subjects and belong to the departmert of primary education and (ii)
the centre para-scolaire, whose instructors teach practical subjects to out-of-
school youth and belong to the Department of Non-formal Education.
V. IDA PERFORMANCE
5.01  Project generation took about two years which can be considered normal.
About 50.6 man-weeks, 72 per cent of the totai, were spent on missions related
to Project generation and 19.6, 28 per cent, on supervision missions (see Basic
Data).
5.02  The Project was supervised by 11 IDA missions. The intervals between
missions were two to 12 months, with an average of six months. The average
stay in the field was nine days. Nearly all missions were carried out concurrently
with supervision of the First Education Project and appraisal and supervision
of the Third Education Project. Architects participated in eight missions, general
educators in seven, economists in five and technical educators in three. In a
Project with mainly technical education components, the more frequent presence
of a technical educator was needed in order to advise the Government on the
adoption of measures for the timely resolution of the problems mentioned above
concerning the Mechanics Department at Kamenge TSS, the Typing and
Bookkeeping Department at Kamenge CSS, and the Heavy Duty Equipment
Operation and Maintenance Section at Gitega SPW, as well as the development
of technical teaching staff for the Project schools (paras. 4.18 - 4.21).
5¢03  In order to assist in the preparation of an ex-post evaluation report on
the Project, it would have been helpful to have provided guidelines to the PIU
at a very early stage so that the work toward such evaluation might have been
planned and launched early. It would also have been helpful for IDA to have
assisted the PIU in the techniques of classifying data on expenditure so as to
permit comparisons with appraisal targets at Project completion.
5.04  The Association showed flexibility in agreeing to two amendments to
the Credit Agreement and good judgement regarding the reallocation of Credit
proceeds. Thus, following the reallocation of the unspent proceeds, the new items
were efficiently implemented.

VI. CONCLUUONS
6.01  The objective of the project was to assist the Government in training
middle-level technicians in industrial trades and secretarial/administrative skills,
implementing and assessing the reform of the education system and strengthening
the MNE's planning, supervisory and project implementation services. The project
has been successful in meeting quantitative targets and has made a very valuable
contribution to the implei-ieitaititos uf t1he educational -eform and to strengthening
the MNE services through the provision of logistical support.
6.02 The extension of two existing technical schools (Kamenge CSS and TSS),
and the construction of two other schools (Bubanza CTTS and Gitega SPW), have
contributed not only to the expansion of the total enrolment capacity, but also
to the diversification of courses and programmes. Through the project, four
new courses have been established at A 2 level and seven at A 3 level. As of
1986/87, the total number of vocational/technical courses established by the
MNE reached 33, 11 courses (33 per cent) of this number came from the project.
During project implementation, new regulations for admission to technical
education and new content and duration of programmes were introduced. The
staffinlg of the Technical Secondary Education Bu-eau (BEET) and the Planning
Division of the MNE were strenghtened and operate satisfactorily.
6.03  In implementing the project, the PIU has demonstrated increased efficiency.
The physical aspects of the project were completed in time (Annex 15) and
important savings representing more than a quarter of the cost of the project
were made. This was the result of the experience gained in the previous Education
Project, combined with the good utilization of the technical assistance allotted
to the project unit. The savings were used efficiently for the implementation
of additional physical components relative to the First Education Project and
for the extension of the technical assistance of the Second Project. The PIU
has gained experience and consolidated its position as a well-organized and
equipped unit capable of managing, designing and executing construction and
procurement of important projects by its own means. However, a deficiency
of both the First and Second Education Projects is that their contribution to
the development of a local implementation capacity was not adequate judging
from the fact that up to the date of the completion mission, the key technical
posts of the PIU remain occupied by expatriates.
6.04  With regard to the attainment of qualitative aspects, achievements are
mixed. No doubt, the project has represented a major breakthrough in the system
of technical education in Burundi with pilot institutions gearing training to the
actual requirements of production and providing a model for the rationalization
of structures, curricula and methods of technical education and training. At
the same time, contrary to the expectations expressed in the Appraisal Report,
some of the project items such as the Mechanics Department of Kamenge TSS
and the Typing and Bookkeeping Department of Kamenge CSS, do not provide
a high quality of training and have not improved students' motivation (Paras.
4.23 - 4.28). Some project schools have high dr^pout and repetition rates and
their training facilities are underutilized. In one case, at Gitega SPW, a
programme was started, but because of the different ministries involved in its
implementation, it has never been finished. (Paras. 4.09 - 4.10). As a result,
the project target of 360 graduates per year has not yet been achieved (Para.
4.17). To overcome these problems, careful study is required to determine the
appropriate remedial measures.



-23-
6.05  Although the distribution of teaching time between general and technical
subjects in the new curricula has been modified considerably in the direction
envisaged at appraisal, the allocation of teaching periods for practical work
for some of the courses at Bubanza CTTS seems to be inadequate (para 4.07).
During the final stage of project irrplementation no practical training was bceing
properly arranged with potential employers for the students of the heavy-duty
equipment course (Gitega SPW) and the general mechanics course (Kamenge
TSS) (paras 4.10 and 4.12).
6.06 The mission found that the appraisal mission had overestimated the
Government's ability to provide teachers of technical subjects from engineers
and technicians who were expected to retur.a from fellowships abroad; in fact
during project preparation no proper staff development programme was adopted.
As a result, at present, more than 50 per cent of teachers of technical and
commercial subjects are expatriates and even among thery 27 per cent are
considered to be semi-qualified or non-qualified.
6.07 The tracer system has been established at all project schools except in
the Typing and Bookkeeping Department; additional efforts are required to
strengthen the evaluation of graduates by employers.
