F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The development objective of the proposed project is to promote an integrated ecosystem
management (IEM) approach to guide the development and implementation of sustainable
land management (SLM) practices in the North and Northwest (NNWF) regions of Rio de
Janeiro State. The desired principal outcomes for the primary target group (smallholder
families and communities) are: (i) improved capacity and organization for NRM, and (ii)
increased adoption of IEM and SLM concepts and practices.

The global environmental objectives are to: (i) address threats to biodiversity of global
importance, (ii) reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes, (iii) enhance carbon
sequestration, and (iv) increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM
approach in the management of natural resources. The desired principal outcomes for the
global environment are: (i) conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and (ii)
increased carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems.

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 State and sector background: Long isolated from other major rainforest blocks in South
America, the Atlantic Forest has a diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The State of
Rio de Janeiro has the highest percentage of the Atlantic Forest biome in relation to total area, in
Brazil. At project appraisal in 2005, less than 10% of that forest – an area of global importance and
home to an estimated 20,000 plant species – was still standing. Centuries of sugarcane and coffee
plantation had dramatically depleted forest habitats. Many unique and in some cases critically
endangered vertebrate and bird species were clinging to survival.

1.1.2 The project area, the North and Northwestern Fluminense (NNWF) administrative regions,
encompassing 22 municipalities covering an area of 15,000 km2 and with about 30,000 family farms,
had the largest stands of remaining Atlantic Forest in the State. While some of these tracts were
already under conservation in protected areas, most were dispersed, on private lands and not protected.
The principal threats facing the Atlantic Forest in the NNWF region at the time of appraisal were
deforestation stemming from land conversion and charcoal production, and soil erosion caused by
deforestation, over-grazing, and inappropriate agricultural practices. From 1990-2000, the State of
Rio de Janeiro had the highest rate of deforestation of all Brazilian states with tracts of Atlantic Forest,
with most occurring in the NNWF region.

1.1.3 Agriculture and Socio-economic conditions: A significant portion of the NNWF population
was (and remains) dependent on agriculture, characterized by extensive cattle-raising of low technical
input and productivity. Pasture degradation, soil erosion and decreasing water availability had
reduced productivity, while increased competition from other regions/countries along with declining
prices had impacted most heavily on small family farms, reducing incomes, deepening rural poverty
and prompting out-migration. Such farms depended on manual labor, lacked corrective measures to
address soil fertility, made little use of technical assistance and rural extension, and showed only
modest organizational capacity. Urgent interventions were warranted to introduce integrated
ecosystem management (IEM) and sustainable land management (SLM) practices, given the potential
for improved land use, the need to increase carbon storage in NNWF agro-ecosystems, the
significance of the Atlantic Forest biome and associated agro-ecosystems for the conservation and
sustainable use of biodiversity of global importance, and growing threats to remaining habitats.

1.1.4 While the NNWF region was the largest agricultural producer state-wide and had benefited
from State Government efforts to boost the availability of agricultural credit and technical assistance, a
positive foundation for conducting project activities (see 1.1.5), greater effort was needed on two
fronts: a comprehensive, cross-sector approach to ecosystem management to ensure ecosystem
integrity, justifying the use of IEM methodologies to plan and implement SLM activities; and, greater
public awareness of SLM techniques to conserve natural resources and strengthen demand for them, as
well as to adapt SLM techniques to the project area. Constraints affecting the adoption of IEM and
SLM were: (i) insufficient human and institutional capacity and weak community organizations at the
local and state levels; (ii) producers’ lack of capital to undertake the fairly heavy, up-front investments
needed to adopt SLM techniques; (iii) limited number of SLM practices adapted to specific agro-
ecological conditions of the NNWF region; and (iv) insufficient organized data and information
available to decision-makers to incorporate eco-system level considerations into productive activities.
The project sought to address these deficits.

1.1.5 Rationale for Bank assistance: The project was seen as a key complement to the Bank-
supported set of projects to improve natural resource management (NRM), environmental
conservation and development in the States of Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina, Parana and Rio Grande do

                                                     1
Sul and in other parts of Latin America. It was also consistent with a range of government programs
and external donor efforts, including in the area of payment for environmental services (PES). The
project was consistent with the then-current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), strengthening a key
development pillar (Environment and Natural Resources Management) by fostering environmental
protection and management, natural resources management, and global environmental externalities
including carbon sequestration and biodiversity.

1.1.6 The project was also consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy and its Operational
program on Integrated Ecosystem Management (OP 12); and with the Sustainable Land Management
Operational Strategy (OP 15). 1 It also fit GEF Strategic Priorities for: (i) biodiversity (BD-SP2),
facilitating the mainstreaming of biodiversity objectives within production systems and development
of market incentive measures; and (ii) sustainable land management (SLM-SP1), by including a heavy
focus on SLM capacity building.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives, and Key
Indicators

1.2.1 Project Development Objective (PDO): As stated in the PAD and Credit Agreement, the
project sought “to promote an integrated ecosystem management approach to guide the development
and implementation of sustainable land management practices, while providing environmentally and
socially sustainable economic opportunities for rural communities living in the North and Northwest
Fluminense administrative regions of the State of Rio de Janeiro?. The main expected outcomes were
improved capacity and organization for natural resources management, and increased adoption of IEM
and SLM concepts and practices.2 Progress would be measured by the following Key Performance
Indicators (KPI - see also Data Sheet), shown aligned with their sub-objectives:

Improved capacity and organization for natural resources management:
     Coordinating bodies with significant stakeholder representation from MC and municipal levels
       active at the regional and local levels (1 regional committee (COREM) by PY 1), at least 40
       local committees (Micro-catchment Management Councils (COGEM) by PY 2) to integrate
       project concepts and activities into ongoing rural development efforts.
Increased adoption of IEM and SLM concepts and practices:
     IEM/SLM practices adopted by at least 1,900 farmers in 40 communities in at least as many
       MCs by Project Year (PY) 5 (80% of the project target), thereby reversing land degradation
       and improving local livelihoods.

1.2.2 Global Environmental Objectives (GEO): The GEO sought to: (i) address threats to
biodiversity of global importance; (ii) reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes; (iii) enhance
carbon sequestration; and, (iv) increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM
approach to the management of natural resources. The main, desired outcomes for the global
environment were: conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity; and, increased carbon
storage in terrestrial ecosystems. The following indicators, also aligned with their sub-objectives,
would measure progress:

Address threats to biodiversity of global importance:
    Change in total land area characterized by biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices that
       enhance soil structure stability in micro-catchments (32,000 ha by PY 5);



1
   OP 12: promote adoption of comprehensive land and ecosystem management interventions that integrate ecological, economic and social
goals to achieve long-term protection and sustainable use of biodiversity, reduction of net emissions and increased storage of carbon in
terrestrial ecosystems, and the conservation and sustainable use of watersheds, providing benefits at the local, national and global levels. OP
15: address land degradation issues and support adoption of SLM practices.

       Total area of riparian and other native forests rehabilitated for biodiversity conservation and
        hydrology stabilization objectives (1,440 ha by PY 5); and,
     Area of biodiversity conservation-friendly land use mosaics established on private lands
        supporting corridor connectivity in project watersheds (1,240 ha by PY 5).
Reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes:
     Reduced erosion (50 percent by PY 5) and downstream sedimentation (50 percent by PY 5) in
        at least 3 micro-catchments.
Enhance carbon sequestration:
     Amount of CO2 sequestered (1.5 tons of CO2/ha by PY 5).3
Increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM approach to the management of
natural resources:
     40 rural community organizations created that have adopted and implemented IEM strategies
        in 40 micro-catchments (by PY 4);
     Education and training of beneficiary stakeholders (1,900 by PY5), project executors (150 by
        PY5), and schools (25 by PY5); and,
     Best practices and lessons learned disseminated through workshops, events and media
        campaigns in the NNWF region.4

1.3 Revised PDO/GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

1.3.1      Neither the PDO nor GEO was revised. Key Performance Indicators were not changed.5

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The primary, potential target group included about 4,000 small- and medium-sized farmers,
rural youth, school teachers and community leaders in 50 pilot micro-catchments covering some
100,000 ha (about 15% of the aggregate micro-catchment area). In addition, a significant percentage
of the total regional rural population (estimated at about 1.0 million) would be targeted with
awareness-building media tools.6 The stakeholder pool was broad, including relevant State, Federal
and municipal institutions, NGOs, private sector bodies and academia.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1      Four components comprising 10 sub-components supported project objectives (see Annex 2):

Component 1: Planning for Integrated Ecosystem Management Actions (6% of total project cost)
financed studies, based on lessons learned from land management investment activities, to influence
policy-making and strengthen state and local frameworks to facilitate adoption of IEM principles and
SLM practices. Sub-components: (i) Strengthening of IEM Incentive Structure and Ecosystem
Management Systems; and (ii) Local Land Management Planning.

    Stated in the PAD Arrangements for Results Monitoring table as equivalent to 34,000 tons of CO2 by PY5.
4
    Included as an indicator in the PAD Log Frame but not the Main Text.
5
    The targeted number of beneficiaries (1900, a Key Performance Indicator) was synonymous with the number of Individual Farm Plans
(PID), a target of 1900 mentioned only in the PAD Arrangements for Results Monitoring table. A project beneficiary’s access to GEF
incentive financing required a PID. Reduction of the PID target (to 1,450) automatically implied reducing the targeted beneficiaries, but the
latter was a KPI and any formal change needed approval of the Country Director. Only the PID adjustment was mentioned in Aide Memoires.
6
   The incidence of poverty among rural households in the State of Rio de Janeiro was, at the time of appraisal, about 27% (440,000 people),
or about 2.5 times the poverty levels of urban areas. This percentage increased to 35-39% in some municipalities in the NNWF region,
levels similar to the poorest regions of Brazil, e.g., the Northeast.
                                                                     3
Component 2: Support Systems for the Adoption of IEM/SLM Practices (57.4% of total project
cost) financed technical and financial support for investment subprojects 7 benefiting 1,900 small
farmers/others (individuals or groups) to shift from non-sustainable farming practices to sustainable
livelihood activities to improve biodiversity, reduce/reverse land degradation, and increase carbon
sequestration. Sub-components: (i) Financial Support for Sustainable Natural Resources Management;
and (ii) Support to Adaptive Management Practices.8 Investments would be grouped under five lines
of activity: (i) recuperation of degraded areas; (ii) use and sustainable management of biodiversity;
(iii) management of water resources; (iv) re-orientation of productive systems to sustainable systems;
and (v) commercialization of socio-environmentally sustainable projects.

Component 3: Organization and Capacity-Building for Integrated Ecosystem Management
(16.0% of total project cost) financed improved farm- and community-level capacity to manage
natural resources by strengthening rural organizations, and by sharing project implementation
experiences and lessons with stakeholders at all levels, to broaden project impact. Sub-components:
(i) Community Organization; (ii) Training of Project Executors; and (iii) Training and Environmental
Education of Beneficiaries.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (17.5% of total project cost)
financed participatory management and monitoring activities to leverage project impact, effective
project implementation and coordination, and results dissemination. Sub-components: (i) Participatory
Management of the Project; (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation; (iii) Project Dissemination.

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1      Components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 There were two Level 2 restructurings, both dated November 9, 2010: (i) Project closing date
was extended 12 months to November 30, 2011 to permit full disbursement of the GEF Grant and
achievement of project objectives; and (ii) US$715,000 was reallocated from Category 6 Unallocated
and US$40,000 from Category 5 Incremental Operating Costs to Category 1 Goods (US$55,000),
Category 2 Consultants’ Services (US$350,000), and Category 3 Training (US$310,000). No
significant changes were made to project design, scope or scale, or implementation arrangements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Background analysis:

2.1.1 The Project took its lead – conceptually and technically - from several decades of Bank
support for and evaluation of successful projects in Southern Brazil which had increased agricultural
productivity and reduced soil loss through innovative approaches to sustainable land management and




7
  The PAD mentions a target of 4,400 “proposals?, which was an indicative target within a demand-driven project framework - the first of its
kind in this State. Farmer demand IEM/SLM investments, could not be projected with any accuracy. It should also be noted that a single PID
could generate several proposals from an individual farmer for investments in different but complementary “practices? intended to maximize
on-farm impact. A single subproject might constitute several “practices?.
8
   Access to project benefits - maximum amount of project support - was to be differentiated based on type of farmer, size of land-holding,
whether market-oriented/not, and depending on the category of subproject chosen. This was to ensure support to the neediest while also
garnering the participation of farmers with capacity to develop and implement successful, replicable subprojects. Even so, all residents of
micro-catchments were to benefit from improved management of the natural resource base and future scaling up of the project strategy.
                                                                     4
biodiversity conservation. 9 The lessons from those operations stressed: the micro-catchment as the
optimal unit for conservation planning and management; technical changes delivering direct and early
productivity benefits to farmers; greater impact and sustainability via integration with related,
complementary programs and political support; extensive training using group and participatory
approaches; and, socio-economic and environmental monitoring to quantify/demonstrate the national
and global externalities from improved land management. These projects also promoted changes in
agricultural research models and the provision of rural technical assistance services to more
participatory, environmentally-friendly approaches. Project design reflected these lessons through: a
defined set of micro-catchments; financial incentives to promote adoption of SLM practices directly
on farmers’ land; strengthening state and local policymaking and political support for IEM principles
and SLM practices; and, strengthening rural organizational capacity and participatory monitoring
systems.

2.1.2 The project drew on Socio-economic and Environmental Diagnostic Studies and a Social
Assessment conducted during preparation to identify relevant issues, their consequences and the
constraints needing solution. Relationships between smallholder agriculture, the environment and
rural poverty were explored and defined. The strategy focused on developing mechanisms to
complement specific elements of federal, state and local programs already underway. Many of the
investment activities had potential to produce both global and local benefits, so GEF funding was
limited to developing the enabling conditions (information, experimentation, collective action, access
to technical assistance and inputs, monitoring and evaluation), to allow farmers to make informed
decisions on management systems capable of reducing biodiversity loss and land degradation.

Assessment of project design:

2.1.3 Objectives and Indicators: Despite the characteristic breadth of the GEO, the project did not
seek to finance the actual large-scale implementation of IEM. It was a pilot/demonstration operation,
emphasizing on-the-ground actions which could be replicated and provide the foundation for scaling
up. The PDO was more “local?, with specific goals for the target population: improved capacity and
organization for NRM, and increased adoption of IEM and SLM concepts and practices leading to
better incomes. The PDO and GEO were clearly-stated (language added to the Logframe version (see
footnote 2) focused even more tightly on the welfare of rural communities) and their Key Performance
Indicators (KPI) were linked rationally to the main themes. The inclusion of a PDO and GEO with
separate sets of indicators was typical of similar projects approved at that time; the GEF had begun to
require that projects demonstrate real impact on people’s welfare and include appropriate indicators,
resulting in the PDO/KPI’s language regarding improved production practices and rural livelihoods.

2.1.4 Even so, there was confusion and overlap in the wording, meaning and targets of key PDO,
GEO and Intermediate Outcome Indicators, too many of the latter and some of questionable relevance.
Social impact indicators were also included - separate from the Logframe – many unlikely to be
measurable within the project period (PAD, Annex 3). The implied monitoring and evaluation burden
was heavy. Certain targets should have been allowed to evolve in consonance with institutional
capacity, pace of implementation on the ground, and emerging constraints.10 Indicator targets for the
challenging IEM/SLM activities were tough given the pilot nature of the project and time likely to be
available for on-the-ground activities once the initial – and characteristically time-consuming –
learning period had positioned project institutions to launch them.11 Targets such as a 50% reduction


9
    These included: Parana Land Management I Project; Santa Catarina Land Management II Project; Sao Paulo Land Management III
Project; and Ecosystem Restoration of Riparian Forests in Sao Paulo Project.
10
     The Logframe targeted 1,900 farmers adopting IEM/SLM practices, assumed to combine 1,450 individual farmers and 150 groups
averaging three members. The target of 1900 PIDs is mentioned in the “Arrangements for Results Monitoring? table of the PAD, not in the
Logframe. However, “technical assistance and financial support for on-the-ground investments? under sub-component 2.1 targets “at least
1,000 producers and 150 groups?, not the expected 1450/150 combination (1900) for farmers and PIDs, and is an error.
11
     As with similar projects where experience shows that it is not only technical/field activities which are being tested/piloted, but also
institutional capacity and local organization, targets could have been lower. However, the original project team believed targets were
                                                                     5
in erosion and sedimentation at the micro-catchment level required longer-term and more massive
interventions focused on changes in land use and management, difficult to achieve/measure from
small-scale, dispersed demonstration efforts. The targeted 32,000 ha of on-land NRM improvements
was also challenging.

2.1.5 Components, technical design and organization: The project’s four components (and 10
subcomponents) were a logical projection of the key obstacles hindering improved NRM defined at
appraisal (see 1.1.3). The inter-institutional and inter-sector integration and coordination – both
vertical and horizontal – were as complex as the project’s technical design, needing to align targets,
objectives, timetables, modus operandi and commitment from numerous participating bodies.
Technical design was drawn from successful, micro-catchment-focused Bank-supported operations
within and beyond Brazil, and sought to integrate with existing federal and state programs combining
rural and environmental support. However, the project’s technical strategy and institutional
framework/structure were new to Rio de Janeiro State and the difficult learning process was
inescapable. Aide Memoires reveal the complex training, organizational measures and sequencing -
the latter especially vulnerable to disruptive factors with few immediate solutions – required at all
levels to position the project for take-off in the field.

2.1.6     As background to the design and targets, the State of Rio de Janeiro had been “outside?
observers throughout the Bank-supported NRM projects in the southern states and wanted their chance.
Given the delays and poor prospects for processing a full-scale Bank loan, that opportunity came via a
GEF operation but a somewhat top-heavy one which evolved to incorporate key elements of the larger
vision. The State was highly-motivated to pursue innovative approaches and had already brought new
ideas to the wider micro-catchment discourse. The GEF operation was over-loaded and had not
benefited from the long dialogue-building of the other states but despite this the Bank team maintains
that specific targets were carefully-considered at the time and believed reasonable. In fact, the team
aimed to exceed those targets, which in several key cases occurred, with the benefit of an extended
closing date and the accumulated experience of key institutions.

2.1.7 Project management, implementation arrangements: The implementation framework was
rational in principle, but demanding in practice for a small demonstration project testing unfamiliar
technologies and relying on the collaborative capacity of multiple entities/programs with varying
levels of commitment, understanding and/or experience. 12 Such entities were to sign agreements
(convenios) with SEAAPI, the goal being to leverage their operational capacity while mainstreaming
the project approach within them. Experience shows that their roles and responsibilities needed better
definition up-front to avoid technical and operational disfunctionalities. Surprisingly for a project
seeking to mainstream a technological approach within an existing State program, key project
mechanisms did not apply to the co-financing agencies/programs. The primacy of their own rules and
standards meant they were not obliged to use the PEMs and PIDs to guide subproject
planning/investments, participate in the micro-catchment councils (COGEM), or share basic data on
their project operations and results. The GEF-financed and co-financed activities, with some
exceptions, moved largely in parallel. The regional offices of EMATER-Rio were to be the project’s
decentralized executive units interacting directly with micro-catchment stakeholders but EMATER-
Rio was weak, technically outdated and lacked firm commitment to the project concept, requiring
major effort over time to meet project demands. However, the seemingly complex and bureaucratic



reasonable and that the State could have handled even higher targets in some cases. Another factor driving targets was the then-bleak
prospect of processing the planned larger loan and the resulting temptation to load up the GEF.
12
    State Rural Extension Agency (EMATER) and State Agricultural Research Enterprise (PESAGRO) (SEAAPI agencies) supported
extension and research; Brazilian Agricultural Research Enterprise/Soils Division (EMBRAPA-Soils, State Environmental Management
Foundation (FEEMA, an agency of the State Secretariat for Environment and Urban Deveopment (SEMADUR) and the State Mineral
Resources Department (DRM, an agency of State Secretariat of Energy, Naval Industry and Petroleum (SEINPE)) supported monitoring
activities; also involved were the Public Defender’s Office (DPGE), the NGOs SOS-Mata Atlantica and Conservation International Brasil
(CI/Brasil), and a private Foundation for Project Coordination, Technological Studies and Research (COPPETEC).
                                                                 6
hierarchy of steering committees designed to guide the project at the State, regional, municipal and
local levels actually worked well in practice. 13

2.1.8 Financing: The Rio Rural/GEF was originally conceived as a blended operation to
complement a proposed Bank loan but the State’s uncertain creditworthiness delayed Federal
Government consideration of the Carta Consulta for the latter. The GEF thus covered a smaller
project area than that envisioned under the blended operation but given the State’s improving
macroeconomic situation and the GoRJ’s interest in a loan, the GEF emphasized foundational
activities for scaling-up and replication, e.g., sustainable production models and state-wide
dissemination of experiences and lessons. The project was to complement activities from ongoing
programs in the sector and region, and leverage their co-financing estimated at appraisal at around
US$8.20 million equivalent, about 55% of total project cost.

2.1.9 Participatory processes: An intensive and broad-based consultation with national, state and
local beneficiaries and stakeholders accompanied project preparation and under-pinned the
Socioeconomic and Environmental Diagnostic Studies and the Social Assessment. Civil society
stakeholders also shaped the initial project concept and selection of project areas. Two NGOs – SOS
Mata Atlantica and CI-Brasil – were included as project executors. The missing element however, was
gender; women were not part of this process, an omission highlighted by the 2005 Quality at Entry
Assessment (see 3.5.2). This consultative framework was expected to consolidate during the
implementation period via Project Steering Committees (see 2.1.5) and other project elements such as
participatory monitoring, and collective implementation of the PEMs.

2.1.10 STAP Roster Review (SRR): The SRR agreed with the general thrust of the project but not
with its assumed capacity to reverse deforestation or reduce poverty due to its pilot scope/scale and the
likely limited impact of incentives and education. The SRR called for a shift from low value
subsistence cropping to higher value-added products. The Bank/Project team responded that the
project’s main thrust was to strengthen the organizational and conceptual structure for self-
management of natural resources by rural communities using a methodology developed by the Federal
University of Rio de Janeiro. Post-harvest, value-added activities were already incorporated in project
design but this was further strengthened and clarified, and specific examples provided by the reviewer
were included as eligible for incentives under the five main lines of activity (see 1.5.1).

Adequacy of Government commitment:

2.1.11 The State and Federal Governments had established a policy agenda incorporating the
following: (i) the State Credit Program for Agricultural Production and Diversification (Moeda
Verde); (ii) State Micro-catchment (MC) Program for Rural Sustainable Development (Rio Rural)
providing rural extension and infrastructure to rehabilitate micro-catchment resources (e.g., erosion
control on rural roads); (iii) National Family Agriculture Program (PRONAF), providing credit and
assistance for smallholders to improve productive capacity; and (iv) other, non-governmental
initiatives to support State Protected Areas, e.g., KfW’s Pro-Atlantic Forest Program in the NNWF,
and the GEF-supported Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund to help establish private protected areas
in the Serra do Mar Corridor and conservation research. The project’s focus on SLM, IEM and
biodiversity conservation was consistent with government’s established framework and sector
development plans, was expected to contribute to implementation of Government’s National
Biodiversity Policy, and met eligibility for GEF funding according to guidelines of the National
Commission on Biodiversity (CONABIO).

Risk Assessment:


13
  CEDRUS, COREM, COGEM, CMDR: respectively, State Council for Sustainable Rural Development; Regional Micro-catchment
Council; Micro-catchment Management Council; and, Municipal Rural Development Council.
                                                         7
2.1.12 Critical risks identified at appraisal were comprehensive and candid but ratings were uneven
and mitigation measures varied in relevance and efficacy. The risk rating of modest for SEP’s ability
to function in a complex multi-institutional setting was under-stated, as was the likelihood that the
many partner institutions would interact seamlessly and effectively. Greater clarity was needed at
appraisal in defining the roles and responsibilities of participating agencies and programs and in
mainstreaming the entire framework to promote durable forms of collaboration and intersection.
Project complexity was not mentioned as a risk, but was substantial given the small size of the project,
its technical innovations and its predictably difficult, initial learning trajectory in a State with little/no
experience working with the Bank. And, the lack of local and institutional capacity was rated
substantial but was expected to be addressed by ongoing programs of SEAAPI, PRONAF and state
environmental agencies, an oddly hands-off approach but understandable given the small scale of the
project and its integration goals. The project could not do everything.

2.2 Implementation

Factors affecting project implementation and outcomes:

2.2.1 The SoRJ’s difficult fiscal situation created budget and counterpart funding issues for the
project. Delayed release of State counterpart resources in the first two years disrupted Annual
Operating Plans and sequencing, reverberating across the framework of activities designed to position
the project for its next stages. Further, State budget resources were drawn away from the project (and
other state activities/programs) to finance completion of the new Metropolitan Urban Transit system in
Rio de Janeiro, in financial straits due to the appreciating value of the Real to the US Dollar. The
State’s permitted level of indebtedness under the Federal Fiscal Responsibility Law was also an issue,
with the State seeking to negotiate an increase in its debt ceiling to create fiscal space for the many
pending programs/projects. The GEF had to wait in line for funds, delaying key activities for several
years. The erratic release of counterpart resources also affected farmers’ land management decisions
and agricultural activities, dependent on financing synchronized with seasonal production cycles.
Apart from continuous pressure from the Bank team on the executing and related agencies, and their
appeals for resources from the State, this situation was beyond the project’s control.

2.2.2 Project launching activities were caught between two mandates - the end of one
administration and the start of another. In Brazil, this period is typically characterized by a lack of
resources in the final year of the outgoing government, and the desire of the incoming administration
to acquaint itself with and “adopt? a project in its policy agenda before it commits budget resources.
While the PIU/SEP team did not change, the leadership in virtually all other project-associated
institutions did. The Bank team’s experience and the strategy of project management by negotiation
mitigated the risks associated with State institutions’ initial lack of political will. Once convinced, the
State came on board with important support, sustained throughout the implementation period, e.g.,
kept/supported the central-regional project structure; worked hard to improve the counterpart funding
situation; authorized a public bidding process to contract new technical executors for EMATER/Rio;
and, supported preparation of the new Rio Rural/IBRD project (and proposed Additional Financing).

2.2.3 Institutional capacity and innovative project design delayed execution. The multi-
institutional nature of the project further complicated project launching/execution.14 Training activities
were protracted, duplicative and linear. A more agile system which bunched training in shorter periods
interspersed with practical experience was needed, and was subsequently introduced. Project


14
   The Project team noted in hindsight that activities could have been included to mainstream multi-institutional collaboration. Rio de Janeiro
State both under the GEF and the Rio Rural/IBRD has tended to depend on strong project leaders/individuals within a weak – albeit evolving
- institutional setting, entailing risks if that leadership is disbanded. While the core project objective was not entirely dependent on the multi-
institutional arrangements/linkages, their comparatively informal nature suggests a potential future risk. As in other southern states, Rio de
Janeiro needs to develop a culture of inter-institutional collaboration on its flagship rural programs.
                                                                        8
innovations, including the focus on micro-catchments, required an unexpectedly long period for
municipalities, executing agencies/partners and targeted farmers to internalize and understand the
project rationale/logic and gain sufficient confidence to engage. Previous, failed State and local
initiatives had left farmers disenchanted and reluctant to get involved. The fact that project design
reflected the Bank’s extensive experience with similar operations in several southern states, and that
the State was broadly familiar with those projects, had actively sought a similar project and already
had a “domestic? variant (Rio Rural) ongoing, could not mitigate the need for Rio de Janeiro State to
go through the learning cycle itself. Experience showed that this cycle - albeit unusually long in this
case - typically resulted (and did result) in a sharp take-off and rapid progress.

2.2.4 EMATER/Rio, responsible for technical assistance and rural extension (ATER) services,
was challenged by the project’s concept and methodology. Its presence and effectiveness in the
micro-catchments were uneven, with managers and technicians variously unwilling to innovate or be
accountable for performance. Concerns arose about EMATER’s capacity to respond to the
accelerating demand for subprojects including under the new Rio Rural/IBRD operation for which
EMATER-Rio also took the technical lead in the field. With the State’s adoption of the Rio Rural
program as a flagship development priority, EMATER-Rio was boosted by the contracting/training of
150 new field technicians; special spreadsheets were developed to monitor technicians’ performance
and achievement of ATER targets, and to hold managers accountable; and, consistent efforts were
made to build institutional commitment to the project approach.15 EMATER/Rio’s performance had
improved significantly by end- project (see also 2.2.2).

2.2.5 Gradual strengthening of the Real to the US Dollar in the initial years reduced resources
available to the project. By 2009, when field activities were ready to launch, the Bank team noted
that project targets would be difficult to achieve due to the 40% decline in the Real/US$ exchange rate.
However, only minor changes were made to targets: the number of PIDs was reduced from 1,900 to
1,450; the targeted number of SLM-adopting “beneficiary? farmers was informally reduced in 2010
from 1,900 to 1,450 (due to its implicit linkage to the number of PIDs). The target of 32,000 ha
expected to reflect changed, biodiversity-friendly practices, was not adjusted since it was an aggregate
of GEF-financed and other-financed activities/subprojects and project authorities (correctly as it
turned out) believed it was still achievable. 16 Project indicators, targets and/or their composition
needed realistic analysis which would typically have occurred under the Mid-term Review (see below).

2.2.6 The Mid-term Review (MTR) contributed to improving the project’s pace and quality but
a more formal, better-reported process was needed. The MTR represented an analytical and
practical process conducted from 2008 to 2010. The Bank team and State project counterparts were
aware that more intensive management of project activities and institutions was required, given the
protracted and difficult launching experience, but above all a more disciplined and realistic approach
to improving the performance of EMATER/Rio and other extension agents crucial to the field
activities was essential. The Bank/Client consensus emphasized greater attention to inter-institutional
integration, communication and project monitoring, and the need for an extension of the closing date
and a reallocation of funds. Monitoring and organized feedback on various issues were already
underway while an MTR evaluation study was being prepared by independent consultants. However,
the concluded study was not accepted by the PIU, it did not become the analytical guide for a
systematic revitalization of the project, and the project archive lacks any discussion of its findings and
recommendations (although some of the latter were consistent with project teams’ independent




15
   A related issue affecting the quality and timeliness of field operations was the delayed (procurement-related) contracting of the Foundation
for Project Coordination, Technological Studies and Research (COPPETEC), responsible for training the technical executors in the various
phases of local planning, an activity of fundamental importance to other project activities.
16
     There were no formal arrangements for systematic data collection/sharing between the PIU and the project’s co-financing partner
programs (e.g., PRONAF). End-project data aggregation in key cases was a protracted and difficult exercise.
                                                                      9
assessments of the way ahead). 17 The informality of the MTR represented a missed opportunity inter
alia, for a more timely and participatory analysis of project design including indicators, data collection
arrangements, and institutional collaboration.

2.2.7      Project at Risk: The project was never declared at risk.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Design: The vision and framework for M&E was comparatively sophisticated especially for
first-time implementers, covering the monitoring of project impacts (including social) and tracking of
physical and financial execution through an MIS, with expected regular feedback. The approach was
two-pronged, combining “complete? or full monitoring in three micro-catchments and participatory
monitoring in all beneficiary micro-catchments. The framework also included a project portal to
channel project-related information to policymakers and steering committees, and a coordination unit
within SEP including EMATER-Rio, State University of North Fluminense (UENF), the Brazilian
Agricultural Research Company (EMBRAPA) to monitor environmental activities/outcomes and
socio-economic aspects. An M&E design issue which complicated the measurement of project
achievements was the lack of agreed procedures for data collection/aggregation of GEF-financed and
co-financed activities. Targets were aggregates but the PIU had little/no access to the databases of co-
financiers, creating difficulties ex-post in constructing/reporting a complete picture of performance.

2.3.2    M&E implementation: Taken as a whole, M&E met its quantitative targets and the project
was a successful example of participatory monitoring. The project financed baseline and MTR studies,
and a well-organized and thoughtful final report, but was unable to monitor/collect social impact data
to the extent foreseen at appraisal. The project also conducted all required local, state and regional
dissemination seminars/events and established the planned project portal (www.microbacias.rj.gov.br)
which by closing had registered some 42,000 visits. Bulletins were distributed, disseminating the
project, its practices and results; brochures were prepared in classroom-accessible language;
technical/operational and conceptual manuals for SLM practitioners and extensionists were produced
and disseminated; and, folders encapsulating the demands of Micro-catchment Development Plans
(PEM) were distributed, providing communities with a tool to leverage resources beyond the project.
As standard practice, all project dissemination materials utilized data generated by project M&E
(Annex 2). A summary of the two main monitoring mechanisms is as follows:

(a) Complete monitoring: 18 The complete or intensive monitoring of three micro-catchments
generated important results including data/analysis on the impact of pollinizing species on economic
crops; the importance of forest remnants to pollinizing species; and the identification and study of
forest remnants in the micro-catchments and their importance to biodiversity conservation. Challenges
included: the project’s multi-institutional structure and difficulties in coordinating and operationalizing
monitoring activities; the high cost of data collection and production of technical materials; a time-
consuming baseline study of mixed relevance to the project; delayed and/or deficient feedback of data
to micro-catchment communities and technicians; and, information collection campaigns not
synchronized with the subprojects themselves to benefit from results and feedback; and,


17
    See “Relatorio de Avaliacao de Meio Termo?, Fundacao de Estudos Agrarios “Luiz de Queiroz? (FEALQ), January 2010. The PIU
asserts that the report did not follow a “classic? evaluation methodology, and put undue emphasis on recommendations concerning activities
not directly related to the project. The report commended: (i) the project’s partnership with the Public Defender’s Office to institute the
Community Conduct Statutes re environmental conservation; (ii) beneficiary empowerment through participatory management; and, (iii) the
“incubation? methodology for building farmers’ organizational commitment to the environment; but was critical of (iv) weak integration of
involved institutions despite project efforts; and (v) the project’s modest investment in educating beneficiaries to improve incomes and
quality of life. Recommendations included sharing successful experiences more widely with internal and external audiences and putting a
higher value on promoting inter-institutional collaboration. Such findings were incorporated into the already evolving and renovated
managerial approach which included greater accountability from EMATER-Rio for the performance of annual rural extension
activities/targets.
18
    The project also launched a digital inclusion initiative enabling local farmers in 13 micro-catchments to use computer centers (installed in
schools and community centers) for access to project information from the regional and state levels including from the project MIS.

                                                                      10
(b) Participatory monitoring: This methodology evolved into a highly useful instrument, generating
information from which important subproject results were detected. The product of this monitoring
approach proved fundamental for the project’s cost-effectiveness and economic/other evaluations and
studies. The main weakness was lack of consistent dissemination/use of information generated to
motivate and mobilize the participation of additional groups of micro-catchment residents.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards compliance: Safeguards performance/compliance was rated uniformly
Satisfactory by supervision missions. The project was classified Category B (Partial Assessment), with
an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to ensure
conformity with OP 4.01. The project also triggered Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Forests (OP 4.36).
The project’s basic thrust was to establish the organizational and practical foundation for long-term
integrated SLM with local and global environmental implications. The project team included senior
environmental specialists/economists, and supervision of compliance with triggered Safeguards was
thorough and consistent, aiming to avoid and/or minimize any potential negative impacts and enhance
planned outcomes. Supervision found that the identification, preparation and implementation of
activities on the ground followed recommended practices consistent with the project’s EMP. In
addition to ensuring that project-financed investment activities built environmental commitment while
doing no harm to natural habitats and forests, project achievements included the Decree authorizing a
system of Payment for Environmental Services (PES), the Action Plan to implement the Serra do Mar
Biodiversity Corridor, the Statutes of Community Conduct mandating community compliance with
environmental laws, and creation of Nature Protection Reserves in several micro-catchments, paving
the way for sustainable compliance longer-term (see section 3.2).

2.4.2   Fiduciary compliance:

(a) Financial Management (FM) performance varied over the course of the project. FM supervision
was intensive in the initial years. Problems were diagnosed and evaluated, training was provided, and
time-bound action plans and close follow-up sought to correct multiple deficiencies. The root cause
was lack of experience with Bank FM procedures/systems and human resource issues. FM staffing,
organization, information, archiving and reporting were improved to varying degrees over time but
internal controls remained problematic. With some exceptions, FM was rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory up to mid-2010 due to overall inherent and control risks being rated as substantial and,
at the project and implementation levels, high. An Action Plan with specific risk mitigation measures
was designed to integrate all major FM functions. The rating was restored to MS when controls were
examined by the Bank and found acceptable, and sustained at MS because project closure precluded a
final FM supervision mission (which was expected to restore the rating to Satisfactory).

(b) Audit reports were delayed, quality was uneven and auditors’ opinions swung between unqualified
and qualified, the latter reflecting the same internal control risks/deficiencies detected by Bank FM
missions. The Client worked hard with the Bank FM team to resolve the issues defined, since inter alia,
they represented a risk to the preparation and approval of the Rio Rural/IBRD operation which was/is
coordinated by the same Secretariat and PIU as the Rio/GEF. The 2010 and 2011 audits will be
conducted jointly, with results due by June 30, 2012.

(c) Procurement performance was mixed due to: inexperience with Bank procurement and the
resulting slow pace of acquisitions and consulting contracts; conflict between Bank and State
procurement norms; and, weak organization of procurement (and FM) functions along with human
resource issues. Bank procurement specialists delivered effective training and guidance to the PIU,
which learned how to resolve bottlenecks and accelerate procurement processing. Procurement
capacity had evolved by closing to a standard the Bank rated Satisfactory.

                                                  11
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Post-completion operation: The post-completion transition looks promising with some
caveats. First, positive feedback from the end-project survey and the demonstrated productivity and
income benefits of the shift to improved land management bode well. Farmers were convinced about
the relationship between the new, environmentally appropriate practices they adopted and their
improved productive situation and quality of life. Second, the importance of operation and
maintenance (O&M) was inculcated in beneficiary farmers through tailored training from the project’s
technical executors to implement and maintain their investments. Farmers were not required to sign an
up-front commitment, but O&M was a standard element of TA and training for the operational phase
of specific SLM practices, and PIU management supervision and participatory monitoring reports
routinely discussed O&M progress and performance. Third, institutional capacity has continued to
grow as a direct result of the larger, even more demanding follow-on operation (see below), which has
the same institutions in key roles. But whether participating institutions developed the synergies likely
to sustain their collaboration beyond the GEF - under the Rio Rural/IBRD or within the State’s wider
Rio Rural efforts - is not known. Evidence suggests that a more formalized framework which maps the
intersection, responsibilities, policy linkages and incentives driving multi-institutional arrangements
needs closer attention in the design of projects which adopt such approaches.

2.5.2 Related operation: As mentioned earlier, the Rio de Janeiro Sustainable Rural Development
Project (known as Rio Rural/IBRD, total cost US$79.0 million, Bank loan US$39.5 million) seeks to
increase the adoption of integrated and sustainable farming systems in specific areas of the State,
thereby increasing small-farm productivity and competitiveness. Its incentives scheme is intended to
address market failures through one-time matching grants, while improving the policy environment
and investment climate, and helping economic agents manage up-front transaction costs associated
with technology adoption and organizational innovation. Key elements of the Rio/GEF’s operational
and institutional structure were adopted by the Rio/IBRD: the Borrower is the State Secretariat of
Agriculture and Livestock (now SEAPEC); the project is coordinated by the same PIU with the two
NNWF regional offices supplemented by another three in different regions; EMATER-Rio plays a
crucial technical and operational role; and the established GEF FM, Procurement, M&E units/systems
were expanded and enhanced. About 65% of the Rio/IBRD overlaps geographically with the Rio/GEF.
The Rio/IBRD is intended to complement and build on the Rio/GEF by focusing on farmers’
productivity and income generation within a conservative environmental framework. The Rio/IBRD
operation is implicitly but not overtly micro-catchment-based, and utilizes the participatory COGEMs
and COREM organizational structure, as well as the PEMs and PIDs for investment targeting, good
indicators of longer-term sustainability at more decentralized levels.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1. Project objectives remain highly relevant to country and global priorities and to the Bank’s
assistance strategy for Brazil. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY2012-2015 emphasizes
among its four strategic objectives, the further improvement of sustainable natural resource
management and enhanced climatic resilience while contributing to local economic development. The
Bank group would expand support for sustainable development in the Amazon, the Cerrado and
fragile eco-systems - the latter particularly relevant to Rio de Janeiro State. Project design – especially
the micro-catchment organizational and productive focus – remains highly relevant to local conditions.

3.2.1 Project Development Objective (PDO): The following results were achieved – citing key
indicators followed by supporting evidence - cross-referenced to the GEO where indicators overlap
(see also Data Sheet and Annex 2):

Substantially achieved: Improved capacity and organization for natural resource management
leading to integration of project activities with on-going rural development efforts.

      The project established one Regional Micro-catchment Council (COREM – 100%) with
       significant stakeholder representation from the micro-catchment and municipal levels; and 48
       local Micro-catchment Management Councils (120%) providing active forums for integrating
       project concepts and activities into ongoing rural development efforts.

Other important outcomes:

      1,292 (GEF-financed) farmers, individually or in groups, acquired Individual Farm-level
       Development Plans (PIDs – 89% of a reduced target of 1,450); and, 48 Micro-catchment
       Executive Plans (PEMs – 120%) were developed using participatory rural diagnoses,
       improving farmers’ capacity for organized natural resources management activities;
      Local land management/NRM planning improved. Farmers and public programs targeting
       rural populations acquired - through the PEMs and PIDs - a “roadmap? for better-organized
       local development financing of SLM technologies/practices and other development needs;
      The PID/PEM planning process fulfilled a key project strategy – using GEF resources to
       increase and improve existing investments in sustainable agriculture through organized,
       participatory mechanisms (see Annex 2 regarding PIDs, PEMs, COGEMs and COREM);
      The multi-disciplinary Incubator of Sustainable Rural Enterprises (IRS) methodology was
       adapted successfully to the rural environment, boosting community organizations’ capacity for
       collective action and self-management of natural resources. 588 farmers in 87 groups
       implemented small-scale agro-industrial ventures producing environmentally sustainable
       goods and services;
      Farmers/stakeholders idescribed the benefits of their strengthened organization: greater access
       to technical assistance, knowledge, local and state authorities, and new practices which
       conserved their green assets while increasing their productivity (see Annex 5);
      The Rio GEF integrated its activities via relationships with/links to a wide range of State and
       Federal public programs, most directly to the PRONAF, Moeda Verde and State Rio Rural
       programs, but including many others; and,
      Diverse awareness-building and educational events reached several thousand stakeholders
       who reported that project capacity-building initiatives were useful and rewarding, improving
       their understanding of the project approach integrating economic, environmental and social
       concerns (see GEO Sub-objective 4 below); and
      This was demonstrated by farmers undertaking similar subprojects at their own expense and
       by the State Government’s sustaining this approach under the follow-on operation.

Substantially achieved: Increased adoption of IEM and SLM concepts and practices.

      2,254 farmers (155% of reduced target), members of 48 organized communities in 48 micro-
       catchments, adopted some 4,092 IEM/SLM practices on about 31,650 ha (106%), their
       investments aligned with the five categories defined at appraisal: recuperation of degraded
       areas, use and sustainable management of biodiversity, water resources management,




                                                 13
           reorientation of productive systems and the commercialization of “green? products (Data
           Sheet and Annex 2); 19
          Land degradation was reversed by the introduction/adoption of these practices (see GEO sub-
           objectives below);
          Livelihoods were improved: ex-post economic and cost-effectiveness analyses of investments
           in pasture rotation, rustic poultry production, beekeeping/honey production and protection of
           water sources/springs, show average IRRs (for the first three) of 59%, 26.2% and 32.7%
           respectively, indicating strong potential for beneficiary income generation and increasing the
           likelihood that adoption rates of IEM/SLM will continue to increase (see section 3.3); and,
          The cost-effectiveness of environmental impacts in all four cases was very positive (see table,
           section 3.3), a further incentive promoting increased adoption.

Other important outcomes:

          Some 2,728 investments in IEM/SLM practices were financed: 1,292 GEF-financed and 1,154
           co-financed (mainly PRONAF) investments representing 1,292 and 962 families respectively;
          Adaptive research units (13) established on farmers’ land, the participatory evaluation of
           results, and proactive dissemination activities, expanded technology adoption by farmers;
          Farmers were already independently adopting the technologies introduced on their land,
           expanding from experimental to larger areas at their own expense/risk (Annex 2, Box 2.1.19);
          A wide range of environmental education/awareness-building events, facilities and media
           tools promoted/expanded stakeholders’ understanding of the project’s concept and objectives,
           increasing their acceptance/adoption of new practices (see GEO Sub-objective 4 below); and,
          Stemming directly from the Rio GEF experience and demonstrating the project’s multiplier
           effects, seven long-term research units were established (now being maintained under the Rio
           Rural/IBRD) to increase the scope of adaptive technologies available for farmer adoption.

3.2.2 Global Environmental Objectives (GEO): The following results were achieved, cross-
referenced to the PDO where indicators overlap (see also Data Sheet and Annex 2):

Substantially achieved: Address threats to biodiversity of global importance

          IEM/SLM practices were introduced on 31,650 ha (99%) to promote the conservation and
           sustainable use of biological diversity, reverse land degradation and promote green production
           techniques;
          Biodiversity conservation was fostered by establishing 792 ha of land use mosaics (64%) on
           private lands supporting corridor connectivity in micro-catchments. This activity was more
           complex and time-consuming than anticipated; and,
          1,332 ha of riparian and other native forest were restored for biodiversity conservation and
           hydrology stabilization objectives (93%).

Other important outcomes:



19
   Many farm families - the 1,292 with PIDs providing a detailed guide to on-farm needs - got support for several “practices? under a single
subproject (and some families got two or more subprojects), adopted to support a sustainable intensification of smallholder crop production.
In many cases, two or more practices are needed to generate a “concept? or an “approach? such as Conservation Agriculture, i.e., zero tillage
equipment, crop rotation, soil conservation (contour farming, terraces), soil mulching, which the project sought to promote. Final analysis
also shows that, for some of the practices incentivated, beneficiaries financed, with their own resources (or even without the need for
additional resources), additional sustainable practices such as water source protection, organic fertilization, and regeneration of vegetation in
water recharge areas.




                                                                      14
         A Payment for Environmental Services (PES) mechanism was enacted by Decree and
          established, the direct outcome of project-supported studies and policy dialogue under a joint
          initiative of the Secretariats of Environment (SEA) and Agriculture (SEAPEC). The Decree –
          one of the most important project achievements - obligates the State to financially support
          such system within the State’s Water Resources Management Policy. The PES was piloted -
          with EMATER and SEAPEC participation - in the São João River Basin. Signature of the
          Decree followed a transparent, negotiated process involving State environmental institutions,
          NGOs and civil society which, acting jointly through the PES Forum, are now defining
          priority areas for biodiversity/environmental conservation, valuation criteria, monitoring
          methodologies and institutional arrangements. The São João River Basin Committee,
          influenced by the project, adopted the PIDs and PEMs as planning tools and is now paying
          upstream farmers to provide environmental services;
         A study developed recommendations and an Action Plan to support implementation of the
          Serra do Mar Biodiversity Corridor in project watersheds; and,
         The project adopted a multi-institutional approach designed to build a longer-term framework
          supporting agro-ecological conservation in vulnerable areas, and to integrate,
          methodologically and financially, the project’s IEM/SLM elements into existing programs.

Substantially achieved: Reverse land degradation in agricultural landscapes.

         The targeted 50% reduction in erosion and sedimentation was not achieved. Telemetric
          monitoring stations and hydro-sedimentology points were installed near the outfall area of
          three micro-catchments to identify possible changes in hydrologic variables resulting from
          SLM practices implemented on-farm. The effects on sediment reduction could not be detected
          because, to monitor such changes in small areas, this monitoring equipment needed to be
          installed immediately adjacent to treatment areas, i.e., where new practices were implemented,
          which is now occurring under Rio Rural/IBRD;
         Recent studies by Embrapa/Soils (2011) however, in two of the project micro-catchments
          showed reduced concentrations of sediments attributed to the project’s effective control of
          erosive processes. 20 These results are taken to be representative of what is likely to have
          occurred in other project micro-catchments (see Annex 2).

Other important outcomes:

         Soil structural stability was enhanced in micro-catchments through investments including
          crop/pasture rotation, soil conservation equipment, agro-forestry systems, minimum tillage
          and riparian/other forest restoration (see Annex 2);
         Case studies on soil quality improvement, evaluated based on organic material and nutrients in
          the surface layer of soil in six subprojects monitored over three years showed: (i) increased
          organic material in four subprojects (67%) averaging 5.04 g/dm3 or 0.5%; and, (ii) increased
          potassium and phosphorus in five subprojects (83%) averaging 10.14 mg/dm3 for phosphorus
          and 2.14 mmolc/dm3 for potassium;21
         Watershed management strategies were developed in five micro-catchments, and 13
          sustainable agro-ecosystem management methodologies were adapted to local conditions,
          tested/validated on-farm, and with independent replication by farmers underway by closing.

Substantially achieved: Enhance carbon sequestration


20
    Reductions of 26% in average values of sediment concentrations and 31% in maximum values of sedimentation in the Breja de Cobica
micro-catchment; and 7% in average values for sediment concentrations in suspension, and 8% in maximum concentrations of suspended
sediments in Santa Maria/Cambioco micro-catchment.20
21
   These results cannot be extrapolated to other subprojects since each area has its own soil characteristics and each subproject its own
management system.
                                                                  15
          Evaluations conducted through participatory research, and associated closely with pasture
           rotation investments, indicate the storage/sequestration in the soil of 80 tons/ha and in the air,
           about 5 tons/ha (compared to a project target of 1.5 tons/ha);
          Taking into account that some 224 pasture rotation subprojects were implemented with an
           average area of 1 ha/subproject, carbon sequestration totaled 19,040 tons (19 tons per R$1,000
           applied given the average subproject value of R$4,506.23);
          Based on 1.5 ha/subproject released for biodiversity conservation (336 ha in total), carbon
           sequestered in this area was a total 9,475 tons (or 28.2 tons/ha for each R$1,000 applied,
           resulting in a carbon “price? paid by the project of about R$35.00/ton).

Substantially achieved: Increase awareness at all levels of the value of adopting an IEM approach to
the management of natural resources

          The project established 48 rural community organizations (COGEMs) whose members
           adopted, individually and collectively, IEM/SLM strategies in 48 micro-catchments,
           exceeding targets in both cases;
          Environmental education and awareness-building – in various formats and forums, and
           stressing IEM approaches - reached 2,600 members of micro-catchment communities, 5,730
           members of the wider regional population, and 20 local schools; and,
          Best practices and lessons learned were disseminated through 31 State events, four national
           events, five workshops and establishment of a Project Portal (webpage)
           <microbacias@agricultura.gov.rj.br>.

Other important outcomes:

          Beneficiaries and COGEM members described their improved understanding of the
           significance of the IEM approach integrating economic, environmental and social concerns;
          Surveys showed the project increased environmental awareness in 84% of municipalities
           surveyed; 36% noted better water quality, attributed to source protection activities; 68%
           favorably evaluated activities in re-forestation, soil conservation, use of organic fertilizer,
           reduced use of agro-chemicals, and activities to inculcate safe disposal of chemical containers;
          Municipalities noted the positive, motivating role of the COGEM Councils in these outcomes;
          Consistent and intensive efforts were made to explain and disseminate the project and its
           emerging results and lessons widely through numerous events, forums and media materials;
          Collaborative, participatory preparation of PIDs and PEMs built awareness of the holistic
           nature and value of IEM;
          Economic and environmental outcomes (see 3.3 and Annex 3) were convincing evidence of
           IEM’s value to beneficiary farmers;
          The project successfully piloted innovative organizational and technical mechanisms focused
           on the micro-catchment and on farmer participation and self-management of natural resources;
          The Rio GEF was integrated - to varying degrees - with a large cohort of related programs, 22
           gradually building awareness of and buy-in to the value of the IEM approach to NRM;

         Evidence suggests that the project’s IEM message has reached the highest levels of the State,
          reflected in the State Governor’s strong financial backing for the Rio Rural/IBRD operation,
          support for the PES Decree, and expansion of the State’s Rio Rural program.

3.2.3 Project costs and financing: As shown in Annex 1, total project cost was US$18.31 million,
122.47% of the appraisal estimate. Cost sharing differed significantly from appraisal. The GEF Grant
financed 36.3% of project cost compared to the appraisal estimate of 45%. The Recipient (State
Government) contribution was barely 57% of appraisal, while the Federal Government’s contribution
was four times the original estimate at US$4.80 million, chiefly due to the declining US Dollar/Real
exchange rate, as well as very high demand for PRONAF financing (which made up most of the
Federal contribution) and the abundant flow of these funds nationwide. Contributions from
beneficiaries and NGOs were about 28% and 3.2% respectively, of their original estimates. The
expected contribution of beneficiaries was estimated at about 20% of GEF financing for subprojects
(sub-component 2.1) but reached only 8% mainly because financing for environmental practices
subprojects was exempt from the beneficiary counterpart requirement.

3.2.4 Co-financing: The project successfully leveraged an additional US$3.04 million in
contributions from diverse sources (see Table 2.31.2, Annex 2). The methodology involved bidding
events - based on Micro-catchment Development Plans (PEMs) - which disseminated financing
opportunities to public and private entities involving environmental, social and cultural projects to be
executed in the Rio Rural/GEF area (the NNWF). Lists of potential, interested co-financing entities
were compiled and distributed to local EMATER technicians, regional offices, farmer associations and
individual producers who then prepared and transmitted specific proposals to these interested bodies.
The process was monitored/supported by specialist consultants within the Sustainable Development
Superintendency (SDS) of the State Agriculture Sectretariat. Communities received technical
assistance to prepare projects whose financing was submitted to public bid or presented directly to
“listed? agencies such as the Amparo Research Foundation of Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ), the National
Council for Science and Technology Development (CNPq) and various foundations for financing.
The longer-term goals of this effort were: (i) sustainability of project activities beyond closing; (ii) to
bring other sector institutions and programs to the rural development and SLM “table?; and, (iii) to
create mechanisms for the integration and consolidation of public policies/planning and co-investment
programs with a rural focus. This co-investment strategy enabled development institutions to reach
down to the local level, overcoming the time and distance challenges of micro-catchment residents,
while fostering their autonomous, self-managed development.23

3.3       Efficiency

3.3.1 Due to the demonstration/pilot nature of the activities and relatively modest GEF investment,
project design included cost effectiveness considerations to promote maximum implementation
effectiveness and multiplier effects beyond the project, but did not conduct an economic analysis. An
ex-post analysis utilized an internal rate of return approach to derive economic results, and cost-
effectiveness factors for environmental impacts, the latter based on GEF guidelines.24 The outcomes
for four types of subprojects are summarized below (see full analysis, Annex 3).

                                                               (i) Case study 1: Irrigated pineapple cultivation: With increased
                                                               availability of water, farmers were able to increase the irrigation
                                                               period on one hectare, leading to an increase of about 12% in
                                                               production representing 2,666 kg/ha, which at a value of R$0.85/kg
                         The economic results of water         represented a gain of R$2,261.10/ha or, R$0.77 per Real applied by

                                                               R$ 3,975.00. Further, in this area farmers are also producing meat
                                                               and the expected increase in arrobas25/year with irrigation will be
                                                               1.5. Considering the value of arroba of R$ 93.00, the annual value
                                                               will be R$ 139.50. Taking into account the application of
                                                               R$ 2,930.00 for water source protection, results indicate a return of
                                                               R$ 1.40 per Real applied (without considering the cost of

                         expended/invested.


3.3.2 The PAD referred to the relatively high cost to farmers of introducing SLM practices on-farm
as a disincentive to making such investments. Undoubtedly, certain SLM practices do imply
significant costs at the initial implementation stage, especially when they require construction or
renovation of structures and a higher labor input. Project incentives enabled farmers to surmount this
obstacle, tiding them through to the results phase where they saw initial costs diluted and understood
better the cost-benefit of SLM adoption. Among diverse possibilities within the State’s technological
stocks, the project selected the most economical and always those adapted to local eco-climatic
conditions. Criteria considered included: (i) degree to which on-farm structures needed to be changed;
(ii) low labor requirements; (iii) low requirement for the acquisition of external inputs; (iv) little need

      Measure of weight equivalent to about 15 kg


                                                                 18
for sophisticated equipment, and the use of predominantly low-cost, and easily learned and applied
technologies; and (v) potential for replication and continuity/sustainability (as a practice per se).

3.3.3 To summarize, in regard to economic results, project-financed subprojects contributed directly
to sustainable income improvements - due to increased productivity with low costs - and indirectly by
the opportunity cost and cost effectiveness of environmental impacts. In relation to environmental
impacts, the project made an important contribution to biodiversity preservation directly from the
regeneration of native forest associated with environmental subprojects (e.g., protection of springs),
and indirectly, through the release of areas for preservation of biodiversity associated with productive
investments (e.g., pasture rotation). Other important results observed included improved soil quality,
carbon storage, and increased water quantity and quality.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 This rating is based on the following: (i) The development priority and project objectives were
and remain, relevant to the environmental conditions affecting thousands of small and medium-scale
farms in the State of Rio de Janeiro, and to the increasingly fragile eco-systems of Atlantic Forest
areas of Brazil, and globally; (ii) The project’s GEO and PDO were substantially achieved when
viewed - as intended at appraisal - as the technical, operational and institutional framework for more
extensive efforts state-wide (and already under expansion through the Rio Rural/IBRD operation); (iii)
Project sustainability is boosted by strong evidence of its methodological institutionalization within
state public policy including importantly, the State’s Climate Change Plan, multiplier effects observed
in independent local replication of the project methodology beyond the project regions, and capacity to
attract/leverage public and private resources; (iv) Analysis indicates project efficiency judged by its
positive direct and indirect economic and environmental benefits; and (v) The project disbursed just
under 100 percent of the Grant with a one-year extension of the closing date.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 Poverty impacts and social development: The project’s technical design was based on the
confluence between smallholder agriculture, environmental degradation and rural poverty. The NNWF
region showed the worst socio-economic indicators in the State stemming, in rural areas, from a
moribund agriculture sector, precarious living conditions, lack of organization and poor natural
resources management. An ambitious set of social impact monitoring indicators was developed, not
all of which were measured or even measurable within the timeframe and resources available.26 The
following is relevant to the indicators developed:
      2,254 farm families (GEF and co-financed) saw the socio-economic and environmental
        benefits of adopting the IEM/SLM approach, and of participatory mobilization and
        organization of micro-catchment communities;
      Most beneficiaries were poor, small-scale farmers whose agricultural profitability/prospects
        increased as a direct result of their shift to more sustainable farming methods (Table 3.3 and
        Annex 3);
      Some subprojects from adaptive research started to use certification of origin labeling;
      Successful demonstration activities on-farm resulted in replication by farmers using in many
        cases, their own resources, but the overall extent/intensity ot replication was not studied;
      Beneficiary surveys suggest that organizational capacity and social capital improved
        substantially but formal validation is needed;


26
   The depth and complexity of the social impact indicators (PAD, Annex 3) were beyond the project’s capacity, time or resources to
monitor and evaluate.


                                                               19
          Better-organized farmers with PEMs and PIDs, and organized in their COGEM councils, now
           have - and confirmed having - greater access to public programs, and Government’s targeting
           of such programs is likely to be more effective based on these guides; and,
          Beneficiaries also reported a reverse migration effect in their immediate areas indicating that
           their localities had become more promising, economically and socially, to live and work.

3.5.2 Gender: The project made strong efforts to include women including investments in 245
subprojects valued at some R$607,000 under the direct leadership/responsibility of women.
Subprojects included diverse SLM investments, small-scale agro-industries, crafts, clothes-making and
group equipment acquisitions. This was a QAE/supervision-driven development since project design
made no technical or operational distinction in regard to gender, and the participation of women was
not mentioned in the PAD. The QAE noted this omission, stating that the role of women in sustainable
agriculture and the need for a gender-sensitive approach were standard practice by the time of
appraisal and women should have been part of the consultation process at preparation. The Bank team
asserted that the operational strategy relied on ongoing programs with lines of support geared to
women and that several specific activities supported by sub-components were typically those
embraced by women and had been selected as a direct result.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.3 The institutional “platform? for SLM and rural poverty reduction – both for the immediate
benefit of the Rio Rural/GEF and by definition, the Rio Rural/IBRD project, and longer-term, the
State’s agro-ecological support programs - was strengthened through institutional partnership
formation horizontally and vertically, and the intense and often difficult learning process involved in
positioning the project for, and implementing, field operations. Innovative partnerships with
international environmental NGOs improved conservation strategies and led to the more efficient use
of resources and scientific knowledge to promote and implement/mainstream conservationist activities
in private areas/property.27 However, this broad institutional foundation, involving inter alia, five state
secretariats and many dependent agencies, proved ambitious for a pilot, demonstration project.
Participating institutions/leaders showed uneven engagement with the project over time, sought to
impose their own modus operandi and objectives, and/or resisted critical input designed to improve
their/project operations, generating some conflict within the project, and demonstrating that multi-
institutional collaboration remained a pilot effort.28


3.5.4 On the other hand, partnerships such as that with the Public Defender’s Office generated
important results, establishing participatory norms and procedures for NRM via the legally-binding
Statutes of Community Conduct (ECC). Further, a new culture of co-responsibility and local
empowerment emerged from the COGEMs’ partnership with micro-catchment residents to implement
the project vision locally, as evidenced from interviews conducted with COGEM members (see Annex
5). Even within this dense institutional environment, limited/no experience with the project
methodology, and the pilot nature of the intervention in the NNWF, the PIU/SEP management team


27
   Participating NGOs had a crucial role in mainstreaming the design and implementation of activities compatible with the objectives of the
Serra do Mar Biodiversity Corridor. They prepared TORs for studies, provided satellite images, analysed eco-system fragmentation and
landscape connectivity. These activities created greater knowledge/awareness of biodiversity richness and threats in the Corridor area, and
prompted farmers to implement conservation measures such as restoration of riparian zones.
28
   The Client Completion Report cites the example of the project’s collaboration with the State Secretariat of Education (SEDUC) to
implement the planned Telecenters where participatory, decentralized management and farmers’ access did not conform to the project vision.
Protracted technical and operational problems also affected the performance of EMATER-Rio, responsible for the field investments. The
Mid-term Review study attributes institutions/agencies’ resistance to constructive critiques to: their belief that the larger, Rio Rural/IBRD
had resolved/minimized most problems; an inability to come to terms with/consolidate new technologies and multi-disciplinary approaches;
and, the inability to determine why some micro-catchments and some inter-institutional collaborations did better than others. This study also
notes, as further explanation for uneven institutional collaboration and engagement with the project, the fact that all state secretaries
associated with the project were changed during the project execution period, with the exception of the project’s Secretariat of Agriculture,
Livestock and Supply, and the same was true for the mayors of most NNWF municipalities.
                                                                    20
was able to improve institutional integration which has in turn been beneficial to the Rio Rural/IBRD
project and to the State’s own broader Rio Rural program.

3.5.5 EMATER-Rio and PESAGRO were pivotal project institutions importantly due to their
capillarity and reach in the countryside. Projects covering extensive territory require support from the
public institutional “apparatus? but their adaptation to farmer demands and new methodological
approaches, and attempts to overcome old ways can be slow and difficult. Both institutions evolved
markedly over the course of project execution but important needs remain - specifically in the case of
EMATER: greater technical presence in the field; stronger, more consistent commitment and
engagement in project decision-making and willingness, as a principal executing agency, to put project
priorities first; stronger technical preparation and renovation of field teams; and, a more proactive and
strategic vision to make structural adjustments and keep abreast of project demands.


3.5.6 The planned coordination forums/arrangements (COGEMs, CMDRs, COREM and CEDRUS)
generally functioned well. The original premise was to strengthen existing entities (CMDRs and
CEDRUS) and establish new forums at the micro-catchment and regional levels to promote farmer
participation and integrate activities, programs and institutions. The 48 COGEMs, albeit of varying
capacity and organizational levels, generally performed their assigned functions – supporting
beneficiary selection, coordinating activities at the micro-catchment level and supervising the
submission of statements of expenditure. Many members of the COGEMs also participated in the
CMDRs, facilitating a two-way flow of information about progress in the micro-catchments and the
municipal discourse. The COREM considered and approved subproject proposals, communicating
with the COGEMs and ATER technical executors in the micro-catchments about all related activities.
In the final phase of the project, joint evaluations were conducted between the COGEMs, CMDRs and
the COREM resulting in proposals for regionalized as well as micro-regional activities designed to
facilitate the State’s wider Rio Rural program and to integrate other public policies. The CEDRUS
forum pre-existed the project and was kept regularly informed about project performance and results
from involved municipalities to support its primary function of integrating initiatives and institutions
in environment, health, education and culture.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.7     The project was the catalyst for important, unanticipated outcomes:
         Organizational and social elements of the project approach are being used by the State
          Government in the “unidades de pacificação? to restore social coherence and empowerment in
          areas being “re-taken? from the drug cartels;
         Government increasingly acknowledged the methodology’s productive benefits, supporting
          expansion of the Rio Rural/IBRD, not only to reimburse the project for disaster emergency
          measures implemented in 2011, but new funds to consolidate, expand and pilot new activities;
         Case studies/interviews revealed that the principles of transparency, participation and social
          control which guided project activities on the ground, restored a measure of confidence in the
          public sector, easing the path for the Rio Rural/IBRD and new State initiatives;
         Several municipalities adopted Special Nature Protection Reserves (RPPN) based on the
          project’s conservation principles and organization; and
         The Fund for Socio-environmental Best Practice (FUNBOAS) was created to remunerate
          farmers who contribute to conservation of the regional environment. Resources are derived
          from water usage charges and at closing, some R$60,000 had been transferred to small-scale
          collective and individual projects using Rio/GEF planning, mapping and selection criteria.29



29
    The FUNBOAS projects are included in the PIDs and PEMs and activities supported so far include sanitation, water source protection,
riparian forest restoration, pasture rotation, coffee processing and the fencing of Permanent Preservation Areas (APP).
                                                                 21
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 The project evaluation team surveyed project beneficiaries, municipal authorities and
COGEMs with the following results: (i) Social organization: Beneficiaries/others believed, despite
weaknesses, that project-sponsored organization in a region where most pre-existing forms of
organization were moribund was empowering, enabling a solid front in their representations to
authorities and specifically, to accessing programs, projects and public policy. The overall conclusion
was that while COGEMs varied significantly in capacity and organization they had demonstrated
potential to organize and energize local groups; (ii) Technical assistance and rural extension
(ATER): Beneficiaries observed that interaction between the Rio Rural/GEF and other programs and
projects was common, and that the project provided three major benefits in relation to ATER services:
their improvement; the incorporation of environmental concerns; and farmers’ improved access to
ATER per se. The presence and involvement of the ATER technician was viewed as fundamental to
the credibility of the new practices proposed; and, (iii) Subprojects: The project’s innovative interface
with environmental concerns was repeatedly noted by beneficiaries in all micro-catchments surveyed.
Farmers reported increased productivity and income generation from the Rustic Poultry Kits and
Pasture Rotation investments and understood the relationship between the new practices adopted under
Rio/GEF and their improved productive situation. They saw the project/subprojects as improving local
conditions and as a key factor in their decisions not to out-migrate.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.1.1    The following factors impact on the sustainability of project outcomes:
        Beneficiary farmers and their representative bodies clearly “bought? the project methodology,
         seeing positive direct and indirect benefits on their incomes, wellbeing and physical
         environment from the IEM/SLM approach, and the established organizational framework;
        Evidence, as noted earlier, of the project’s methodological incorporation within State public
         policy including the State’s Climate Change Plan, multiplier effects observed in independent
         local replication of the methodology beyond the project regions, and capacity to
         attract/leverage public and private resources;
        Building the PID, PEM and COGEM framework into the Rio Rural/IBRD is sustaining
         farmers’ organizational links to the overall package of approaches constituting IEM/SLM;
        Cross-sector institutional growth from the collaboration needed for projects of this type, even
         though this aspect of project planning and execution was far more difficult and less successful
         than expected, remaining largely a pilot.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 A Quality at Entry Assessment in FY2005 rated the project Satisfactory overall. Strong
features were cited as: impressive ownership of the project by Brazilian counterparts who took the
lead on the initiative and financed it even before GEF funds became available; clear strategic
relevance, and high priority for the need to address biodiversity and sustainable land management




                                                   22
issues in Rio de Janeiro State; and, the good track record of other, similar projects addressing land
management issues in other Brazilian states, and thus good prospects for the Rio GEF. Areas needing
improvement included: more attention to future scaling up, given the high rates of loss of remaining
forest in this region; design was not based on a strategic analysis of state aims, including large farmers,
other policy interventions, actions of other agencies such as electricity and transport, and hence the
plausibility of the project’s expected impacts on small farmers was uncertain; lack of clarity in the
project’s articulation and presentation, possibly caused by an intense focus on meeting internal
operational deadlines; and, need for a stronger analysis of the basis for expecting that small farmers
would change their behaviour.

5.1.2 The ICR broadly agrees with this assessment but not with the rating, taking into account that
the QAE was conducted soon after effectiveness before the implications of design issues had become
evident. While the State’s initial difficulties were familiar to the Bank team from experiences in other
southern states, the framework of objectives, activities and multi-institutional arrangements exceeded
the State’s capacity in the initial years and in some cases throughout – even bearing in mind other
obstacles such as fiscal. The lessons from those states did not ease the burden on Rio State of having
to undergo the same learning process, in this case unusually long. The QAE’s reference to unclear
articulation and presentation is assumed to include over-designed and confusing indicators and
inconsistencies in the PAD, creating difficulties for project monitoring and the desired optimal focus
on biodiversity results. On balance, the ICR rates quality at entry as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3 Supervision missions were regularly spaced and comprised experienced specialists. The
project benefited from stable Bank task management from appraisal to its final year, and the Rio GEF
task team had extensive experience with similar projects upon which the Rio State GEF was modeled.
The Bank team was proactive in cultivating strong relationships with the client and related institutions
and in helping them work through the many complex organizational, institutional and technical issues
arising from project design. While the record shows 10 supervision missions in six years, below the
Bank standard and the needs of a project with implementation challenges requiring more intensive
coverage, this was mainly a function of inadequate reporting/recording of the informal but substantive
supervision of the GEF conducted during preparation and implementation of the Rio/IBRD operation,
which involved the same State (lead) institution and PIU, and saw substantial leveraging of the GEF
experience to enhance the larger project. Ratings for the GEO and Implementation Progress in the
first three years were unduly optimistic given the low level of disbursement but reflected the team’s
expectation that this was the normal precursor to a second phase of accelerated implementation and
successful conclusion, as seen in other states. Safeguards policies were well-supervised and missions
included senior Bank and FAO environmental expertise. The Mid-term Review however, was
problematic, as described in 2.2.6. On balance, the ICR rates supervision as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.4 This rating acknowledges that while the project addressed clearly-defined issues affecting
natural resources management and rural poverty in a highly degraded and vulnerable area of global
importance, using methodologies tested successfully in other states and regions, it was over-designed
for ambient conditions, especially institutional, and the description, design and number of indicators
and some aspects of the PAD created monitoring challenges and confusion at the project evaluation
stage. Taking into account supervision performance, where an otherwise skilled oversight of a difficult
project by an experienced Bank team is compromised by several concerns relating to supervision
reporting, the MTR and realism of ratings, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
                                                   23
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1 The State Government was committed to the project concept from the earliest days and
supported preparation of both the Rio Rural/GEF and its successor, Rio Rural/IBRD. Even with a
change of government in 2006, the project management team was left intact, of fundamental
importance for overall stability in the early years, especially of a project facing many challenges.
Government supported the PES Decree including the incorporation of project results and lessons, and
the project’s efforts to attract/leverage additional, complementary sources of financing. However, as
noted elsewhere, deficits in government’s performance constrained project implementation: delayed
disbursements and erratic counterpart funding in the first three years due to acute fiscal difficulties
saw the project struggle to gain traction; delayed internalization of Bank project norms and
administrative procedures by the State institutions sharing project execution, distorted the institutional
reformulation process underway during the project’s launch years; and, government could have
provided greater political guidance and proactivity by fostering the engagement of State secretariats
and municipal administrations in project activities.30

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 The regionalized structure of the PIU/SEP with an Executive Secretary at the center and two
regional Executive Secretaries worked well, steering the project through its initial difficulties and
accelerating an almost-moribund project to meet or exceed most of its key targets with a one-year
extension. Obviously, the project’s improving budget and counterpart funding situation over time,
along with agreed internal restructuring of the PIU breathed new life into project operations after an
unusually slow start. Notably, the same PIU/SEP team was also coordinating the much larger Rio
Rural/IBRD operation from 2009 onwards, a major task indicating (and further stimulating) significant
institutional growth. SEP’s creation of thematic management units was also effective in injecting
rigor into the supervision of project executing teams. Finally, as noted in 3.5.4, the PIU/SEP, even
with limited/no experience with the project methodology, improved institutional coordination and
supported the strengthening of EMATER-Rio’s field operations, benefiting the larger Rio Rural/IBRD
operation and the State’s own wider rural program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3 This rating balances the difficult but ultimately significant maturation of key project
coordinating and executing bodies, reflected in the many project achievements/successes, against a
series of obstacles impeding the progress of this project especially in its first half. Some of these
impediments were beyond the control of project executors, and others resulted from fundamental
institutional weaknesses, all set against a backdrop of competing State priorities with greater political
weight.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1      The following lessons are among the more important:


30
   As background, it is worth noting that agriculture and the rural sector generally, still have little political currency in Rio de Janeiro State,
aggravated by the State’s massive investment in petroleum, plus the Olympics and World Cup. As the project consolidates over time, and
beneficiaries assert their demands, rural development may gain more traction in the interior of the State but its ability to become a powerful
player in the State’s future policy dialogue will be difficult.


                                                                       24
Projects seeking methodological change and requiring a strong, committed field presence need
careful upstream analysis of the institutional profile and capacity of proposed partners and co-
executors. Mechanisms must be designed up-front for formalizing partnerships and integrating cross-
sector efforts for IEM projects which experience demonstrates, require shared implementation. Such
frameworks also require joint agreement on roles, relationships, responsibilities and budgets bearing in
mind institutions’ inherent, differentiated characteristics. Clear, measurable targets, inter-institutional
commitments not dependent on individual relationships, channels of communication between
institutions and with the coordination unit, and oversight mechanisms which measure performance of
individual partners, are all essential.

Collaborative monitoring, data-collection and storage need to be negotiated between the executors
and partners to ensure that a Bank-supported project co-financed by other programs can access
project-related data reflecting the performance/achievements of all players. Monitoring, evaluation
and dissemination can have a material impact on a project’s ability to detect and resolve critical issues
affecting immediate execution and to support related, larger-scale and longer-term efforts. Joint
project databases and agreed data formats are needed to support whole-project evaluation, especially
where co-financing partners have their ownmanagement structures, field operations and procedures.

To secure genuine collaboration on IEM longer-term, mechanisms are needed to create intersection
and communication between the Recipient/Borrower and the other co-financing programs or
institutions. The trajectory of the two major financing groups under the Rio Rural/GEF essentially ran
in parallel with co-financiers not obligated to use the organizational or financial instruments developed
to empower farmers and facilitate the application of IEM principles to their development. Nor, as
mentioned above, were co-financiers obliged to share their project data with the project/PIU. While
the mechanics of a more collaborative, co-financing effort may have exceeded the GEF’s capacity, the
principle is valid for larger operations.

GEF projects can tend to have sweeping objectives which envision global impacts from localized,
demonstration/pilot-scale activitie while the “companion? Project Development Objectives tend to
be more grounded and local. A clear distinction is needed between demonstration/foundational goals
and those requiring a full measure of development. Expecting both can be difficult to deliver as in the
case of the project’s ambitious erosion and sedimentation goals more likely to be detectable in larger,
more concentrated areas, and the project’s complex social goals - not even overtly evident from the
PDO - which were clearly beyond its capacity to deliver or measure.

The qualifications of the technical teams and their adequate presence on the ground, as well as
their close and regular contact with beneficiaries, promote farmer confidence and the credibility of
the project and its institutions. Technicians’ motivational role - even more than technical - the use of
participatory methodologies, the strength of the technical strategy and its consistency with project
objectives are indispensable elements. Further, the training process is not linear. Experience shows
that training is best conducted as project activities evolve, at critical points and for short, intensive
periods targeting specific capacity gaps. This approach requires a strategy, planning and flexibility.

The project demonstrated that a conjunction of mechanisms and events is needed to mobilize and
motivate small farmers to engage with/in biodiversity conservation through their agricultural
practices and indeed as activities in their own right, on their properties. The project effectively
combined decentralized, participatory governance mechanisms, stakeholder education including the
dissemination of results, financial incentives and the direct demonstration of technologies on-farm.
The critical element was undoubtedly the GEF-financed grant mechanism to trigger/incentivate
adoption of initially unacceptable technologies, which would likely not have happened as rapidly
without the financial incentive.



                                                    25
Related to the above, financial sequencing is critical: using the GEF instrument for demonstration
effects through non-lending technical assistance and grants produced results which became
incentives in their own right to spur farmers to further, independent adoption/utilization. In
addition, government recognized that biodiversity conservation through technological innovation on-
farm has a legitimate longer-term place at the table in the public policy dialogue on rural development.
Demonstration effects also undoubtedly prompted government’s acceptance of the PES concept and
approval of the Decree – the new Law was approved after Rio/GEF results began to appear – and
promoted/consolidated its support for the larger Rio Rural/IBRD operation.

Establishing a PES system and actually launching its physical and financial component on-farm,
demonstrated the value of inter-institutional and multi-disciplinary collaboration at each stage:
analytical, political, technical, financial and physical. The participation of farmers in the evolving
policy dialogue and the value of their PIDs and PEMs to providing a disciplined, decentralized
organizational and sequencing framework supporting successful PES activities, were also critical.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

7.1     The Implementing Agency, SEAPEC, on behalf of the Borrower, confirmed its overall
concurrence with the findings of this ICR (see Annex 7). The main divergence in the Implementing
Agency’s evaluation of the project relates to the overall performance of the Bank and that of the
Borrower, which they consider to both be satisfactory, given the results which have been achieved and
despite the initial difficulties encountered by the Project. The Bank considered the Borrower's
implementation trajectory and the consensus was that an MS rating was appropriate, reflecting a
balanced assessment of positive and negative factors throughout project implementation.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     Drawing on the project archive including the Client’s Final Report (SEAPEC/SEP 2012), the
following summarizes the main achievements/outputs under individual components/sub-components
and end-project results.

2.2      Component 1: Planning for Integrated Eco-system Management Actions (US$0.94
million, 6.0% of total project cost) intended to provide national and beneficiary stakeholders with a
strengthened framework at the state and local levels to support IEM approaches to sustainable rural
development and protection of critical eco-systems. The main components and activities were to drive
a stronger support framework and planning for IEM, the former as studies and the latter as action
planning of IEM/SLM activities to be conducted under Component 2. Component 1 activities would
intregrate with the State Rural Extension Service (EMATER) regular program, and with other existing
programs addressing biodiversity conservation, protected areas, environmental legislation enforcement
and environmental monitoring.

2.3     Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening of IEM Incentive Structure and Ecosystem Planning
Systems. Implemented by SEP, the subcomponent financed studies and workshops to strengthen the
foundation of existing incentive and planning structures for sustainable eco-system and land
management in the NNWF. The sub-component achieved most of its targets.

Achievements:

          Decree (2011) obligating the State Government to financially support a Payment for
           Environmental Services (PES) system within the State’s Program to Revitalize and Conserve
           Water Resources, itself instituted within the State’s Water Resources Management Policy;
          Seminars to divulge the results of the Study of a Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation
           Integrated with the Serra do Mar Corridor Initiative, in partnership with Conservation
           International-Brasil and the State University of North Fluminense; 180 technicians trained by
           Conservation International in biodiversity conservation strategies;
          Study to improve institutional integration intended to improve governance and access to rural
           development public policies;
          Study to design an incentives program to support the economic sustainability of rural
           communities’ productive and NRM practices;
          Integration of the Rio Rural/GEF with State and Federal public institutions/programs, and
           NGOs to improve project activities;31
          Five Watershed Management Strategies updated and fine-tuned on basis of the first 20 PEMs;
          The land suitability analysis was not conducted due to time, expertise and financing factors.

2.4      Payment for Environmental Services: Up to 2011, when the project-promoted Decree was
signed, there had been only isolated experiences of PES in Rio de Janeiro State financed by the State’s

collaborations: (i) Territorios de Cidadania (coordinated by the Federal Minstry of Agrarian Development): The project financed
improvement of two territorial plans to eliminate their “shopping list? design and to bring community demands into the plans; and (ii) Food
Acquisition Program (PAA) and National School Feeding Program (PNAE): The project organized groups of farmers to provide
food/agricultural products to both programs.

Rio Rural program and some water catchment committees using resources from water use charges.
The involvement of FUNBOAS (Fund for Good Practices in Water Micro-catchments) pioneered in
the area of financing SLM, adopting the Rio Rural methodology even though it was not located in the
same area. Today it channels 50% of resources collected in the Lagos Sao Joao catchment to foster
SLM designed to improve water quality and maintain hydrological function. The project also
supported PES piloting with small farmers in the São João River Basin - via its Basin Committee - led
by SEA with strong support from EMATER and SEAPEC, prior to approval of the PES Decree. The
Decree was transparently negotiated between the Government and civil society, using seminars and
joint coordination between the Secretariats of Environment and Agriculture as well as NGOs from the
PES Forum which is now defining priority areas, valuation criteria, monitoring methodologies and
institutional arrangements, while linking PES development to other sources of funding to expand its
coverage. The São João River Basin Committee is now paying farmers to provide environmental
services. In this case, the project also had an impact on State water resources management policy as
the Basin Committee adopted the PIDs and PEMs as one of their planning tools and the committee is
now paying upstream farmers for their provision of environmental services.

2.5      Subcomponent 1.2: Local Land Management Planning to be implemented by EMATER
and the Public Defender’s Office, would cover a planned 50 micro-catchments (subsequently
understood by the Bank and Client to be 40) and include: (i) formulation of PEMs; (ii) preparation of
PIDs from which would be selected certain proposals for financing as subprojects; and (iii)
participatory preparation of ECCs. PEMs would be collectively implemented by micro-catchment
beneficiaries, monitored by SER (the two regional offices of SEP).

Achievements:

       Participatory Rural Diagnoses (PRD) prepared;
       48 Micro-catchment Development Plans (PEM) prepared (120%);
       1,292 Individual Development Plans (PID) prepared (for GEF-financed farmers), based on a
        reduction of the 1900 PIDs targeted to 1,450 (of which 89% achieved);
       10 Statutes of Community Conduct (ECC) established (100%), supported by the State Public
        Defenders Office (DPGE).

2.6      Component 2: Support Systems for the Adoption of IEM/SLM Practices (US$8.80
million, 57.4% of total project cost) financed technical support to small farmers and other relevant
ecosystem managers at the micro-catchment, municipal and watershed levels to move from
conventional, unsustainable smallholder agriculture to sustainable livelihood activities which would
enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the agricultural landscape. It financed technical
assistance, investments, and targeted research demands identified in the Watershed Management
Strategies (WMS), PEMs, PIDs and PID-derived subproject proposals. GEF would finance
incremental resources to support the transition but once this transition was achieved, outputs from
those activities were intended to help ensure ongoing financial support to sustainable activities
designed to create environmental benefits at the local, regional and global level without further GEF
involvement, i.e., GEF would jump-start a process of boosting existing financial support programs and
establish a foundation for other self-sustaining financial mechanisms, e.g., Payment for Environmental
Services (PES). Notably, 70% of the cost of Component 1 would be financed by ongoing State and
Federal programs (Rio Rural, Moeda Verde and PRONAF).

2.7     Challenges during implementation: This component supported the adoption of IEM/SLM
practices. It faced a number of challenges including: (i) exceptionally weak institutions with little/no
prior experience with the project strategy or World Bank projects, inadequate technical and
operational resources, budget constraints and lack of priority within GoRJ’s tight fiscal space; (ii)
challenges inherent in the project’s multi-institutional and multi-sector integration strategy, combined
with a complex coordination, monitoring and decision-making structure, both vertical and horizontal;

                                                  29
and (iii) the need to integrate GEF resources with other official sources of co-financing (PRONAF,
Moeda Verde, State Rio Rural) and other co-financiers.

2.8     Subcomponent 2.1: Financial Support for Sustainable Natural Resources Management
provided technical and financial support to promote the shift to sustainable farming activities
mentioned above, financing subproject proposals for support services and environmentally appropriate
investments derived from the PEMs and PIDs. The sub-component comprised two activity streams:
(i) Activity 1 (not GEF-financed): small infrastructure (erosion control on rural roads and small
sustainable irrigation schemes) and productive systems in farms in project-supported micro-
catchments; (ii) Activity 2 (GEF-financed): transition to sustainable livelihood activities within the
IEM framework.

2.9      Incentives system: The grant-based incentives were demand-driven, based on the PEMs and
PIDs with the participation of municipal and regional decision-making bodies. Technical assistance
was delivered by EMATER and/or contracted technicians. EMATER financed staff salaries,
infrastructure, vehicles and other, while the GEF financed operational costs. Grants were up to
R$6,000 per beneficiary smallholder family and up to R$4,000 for other types of beneficiaries, later
increased to R$7,500 per family and R$5,000 for other types due to evidence of inflation-based
escalating costs for equipment, materials and labor. Applications were initially evaluated by the
COGEMs, endorsed, consolidated by municipality (local EMATER) and submitted to SEP for final
approval. Disbursement occurred against receipts/statements of expenditure (SOE) submitted by
beneficiary groups/individuals. Beneficiaries received/spent the approved subproject resources and
submitted statements of expenditure/accounts. They were expected to contribute about 20% of the
GEF financing for subprojects but in practice, their contribution was around 8% mainly because the
financing of subprojects supporting environmental practices was exempt from the beneficiary cost-
share requirement.

2.10     Integration of co-financiers: The GEF and other co-financiers followed essentially parallel
tracks except on the primary objectives which were the same in both cases. The main difference
between the GEF and other financing was the former’s more holistic approach, integrating the social,
economic and environmental sectors and vision, and supporting sustainability goals. The portfolio of
subprojects eligible for GEF incentives was larger while the focus of the other financing sources was
narrower, supporting mostly economic, environmental or cultural initiatives. However, to attract
financiers, besides the project resources, the entire methodological strategy was utilized and shared as
the guarantee of a set of socio-environmental best practices to be adopted by beneficiaries. While the
other co-financiers were not obligated to use these same tools, the fact that beneficiaries were
organized in COGEMs and/or possessed an instrument prepared in a participatory manner for planned
activities which were socially and environmentally balanced (the PIDs and PEMs), qualified
beneficiaries to access these other financing sources.

Achievements:

       Financed – with GEF and other co-financiers (mainly the State’s Rio Rural and Moeda Verde
        programs, and Federally-financed PRONAF) – implementation of an aggregate 2,728
        IEM/SLM subprojects (there was no subproject target per se, only an indicative estimate of
        4,400 proposals, from which a minimum 1900 subprojects – equal to the projected number of
        PIDs – would be financed);
       Of this total, 1,292 investments were GEF-financed, and 1,154 were solely co-financed
        (mainly PRONAF) under the Incentives Scheme, attending a total 2,254 families; and,
       These 2,254 families implemented IEM/SLM practices on about 31,650 ha of land.
       Provided technical assistance to support the implementation and maintenance of those
        subprojects in 48 micro-catchments; and,
       Leveraged some US$3.04 million of co-financing from public and private programs to
        support/complement these investment activities.
                                                  30
2.11    The project strategy of utilizing GEF resources incrementally to increase and improve existing
investments in sustainable agriculture was successful. This result was possible via the methodology for
preparing Individual Development Plans (PIDs) and Micro-catchment Executive Plans (PEMs)
whereby project technicians and beneficiaries, in a participatory manner, sought to integrate different
sources of counterpart funding to maximize and put into effect the PIDs/PEMs, attending in the
process at least one of the Lines of Support.

2.12     That said, the Rio/GEF was a pilot project which sought to demonstrate that investments
premised on equal weight between environmental, economic and social concerns are possible. It was
not assumed that the investments financed by other sources would necessarily adhere to the five
categories of investment, or be based on the PIDs/PEMs, since they already had their own objectives,
methodologies and instruments. Importantly, the project did not require them to conform. The
Rio/GEF with its participatory methodology of activities in micro-catchments (Participatory Rural
Diagnoses, PIDs and PEMs) initiated a process of integration of investments within micro-catchments,
whether derived from the State’s Rio Rural program, beneficiary resources or rural financing/credit.
The expectation is that project results will build awareness in beneficiaries and managers of financial
institutions to promote the educative benefits of rural financing, improving the overall quality of rural
investments and their greater sustainability.

2.13     Evidence suggests this process is underway: new lines of credit for sustainable agricultural
activities were recently established under federal policies, e.g., Low Carbon Agriculture (Agricultura
de Baixo Carbono – ABC) and PRONAF Sustentavel. Out of a total R$123 billion for Government’s
2011/2012 Agriculture and Livestock Plan, the ABC program has already logged demand of R$400
million from July 2011 to Januaary 2012. In the same period, R$65 billion were applied to agriculture.

2.14     Subproject categories/types: Subprojects eligible for grants - so-called incentives - fell into
five categories and all activities were intended to have demonstration effects and be representative of
one or more of the four major eco-systems in the project area. See table 2.15.1, which covers only
GEF-financed investments. Similar data was unavailable for co-financed subprojects.

Erosion and sedimentation control results:

2.15     Based on the project monitoring plan, telemetric monitoring stations were installed near the
outfall area of the three micro-catchments targeted for “complete? monitoring to identify possible
changes in hydrologic variables resulting from sustainable natural resource management practices

                                                   31
implemented by farmers with project support. Bearing in mind the pilot nature of erosion control
activities, adopted by a limited number of farmers, the effects on reduction of sediments could not be
detected due to the decision to instal hydro-sedimentology points on the micro-catchment outfall areas
intended for monitoring. To detect such changes in small areas, the installation of monitoring
equipment would have needed to be installed immediately adjacent to where the practices were
implemented (treatment areas). As a direct outcome, the Rio Rural/IBRD project has been installing
the equipment and structures associated with soil conservation subprojects in areas of the micro-
catchment where such subprojects/practices are concentrating.
2.16    Further, EMBRAPA/Soils recently reported some data on the concentration of sediments in
two of the project micro-catchments indicating a tendency to reduction throughout the project
execution period in these two micro-catchments. This tendency suggests that the practices introduced
to control erosive processes were effective. However, taking into account the project’s demonstration
character and the implementation of practices in localized areas, there was not the 50% impact
foreseen on the reduction of erosive processes and sedimentation. The following information is
derived from micro-catchments which showed some reductions.

Micro-catchment Brejo da Cobiça – Municipality of São Francisco de Itabapoana

2.17    In this micro-catchment, sustainable natural resources management practices were
implemented as follows: (i) 14 riparian forest recovery and conservation subprojects; (ii) 10 spring
protection subprojects; (iii) 4 pasture rotation subprojects; (iv) 3 crop rotation subprojects; and (v) 2
green/organic fertilizer subprojects. Data show a reduction of 26% in average values of sediment
concentrations and of 31% in the maximum values of sedimentation in this micro-catchment in the
period from 2009 to 2011 (Graphic 1).

2.19 Sub-component 2.2: Support to Adaptive Management Practices financed the adaptation of
existing soil management practices and adequate technological solutions for unsustainable land usage
identified by the farming community at the micro-catchment level. Activities included: improvement
and validation of practices for the integrated management of natural resources; adaptation and
validation of cropping, agro-forestry and pasture management systems to increase carbon stocks and
biodiversity; implementation of pilot units to improve the use of rural space and in buffer zones of
ConservationUnits.

Achievements:

                                                     Implemented and validated 13 adaptive research units on farmers’ land, in partnership with
                                                      and monitored/overseen by PESAGRO-Rio, designed to adapt existing technologies to varied
                                                      agro-ecological conditions in micro-catchments;
                                                     Principal themes studied were: pasture rotation, agro-ecological cultivation of tomato, organic
                                                      coffee cultivation, and subterranean dams;
                                                     Dissemination of results occurred using special field days (dias do campo), technical visits to
                                                      farmers and exchange of information among farmers at the research sites, publication of
                                                      expanded summaries through the Project Portal, and the presentation of results at seminars and
                                                      congresses;
                                                     Stemming directly from the Rio GEF experiences, seven long-term research units are being
                                                      maintained under the Rio Rural/IBRD project: Pasture Rotation (Itaocara, Miracema,
                                                      Quissama); the PAIS System or Integrated, Sustainable, Agro-ecological Production (Sao
                                                      Jose de Uba); Agro-forestry Systems (Cambuci); Alternative Controls of Fruit Pests and
                                                      Diseases (Cambuci); and Sustainable Fruit Culture (Itaocara).

2.20   The participatory research methodology included an evaluation of results with the
experimenting farmers. In this way, the adoption/otherwise by farmers was observable by the

                                                                                                33
responsible technician. The technologies introduced and evaluated following the advent of the
Research Units were adopted by farmers who then expanded from experimental areas to larger areas –
with some adaptations – at their own expense and risk. These included: (i) use of green fertilizer in
fruit cultivation; (ii) use of vermicompostagem on vegetables; (iii) semi-intensive systems of rustic
poultry production; (iv) the PAIS System (Integrated Sustainable Agriculture Project); (v) use of bio-
fertilizer in coffee and in vegetables; (vi) use of green fertilizer in manioc production; (vii) access to
the National School Food Program; (viii) use of the water from subterranean dams; (ix) agro-
ecological technologies for tomatoes; and (x) establishment of a corn seed bank.

Box 2.20.1: Adaptive Technologies Developed by the Project
     1. Introduction of green fertilizer: The introduction of Arachis Pinto sought to control the incidence of
     infestedplants and reduce the use of herbicides, and improve the protection and quality of the soil. The
     planting of Arachis Pinto was done using seedlings spaced at 0.35 meters by 0.35 meters. This plant was the
     cultivar selected to be introduced in caqui sub-systems because it presented certain favorable characteristics
     such as: easy management; capacity to promote soil surface coverage; promote the recycling of soil nutrients,
     making orchards self-sufficient in some nutrients; promotes excellent production of biomass; controls invasive
     species, avoids soil loss, and can be propagated by seedlings and seeds.
     2. Semi-intensive production system for Galinha Caipira: Some 60 birds aged 60 days, of the Label Rouge
     brand, were introduced on the property of each partner farmer. As part of the food restriction process
     associated with the semi-intensive system, it was stipulated that part of the conventional diet would be
     substituted by alternative rations obtained from farmers’ properties (left-over vegetables, banana leaves and
     stems, medicinal herbs and grasses, and freely available in parks. These parks were planned tomeasure 30 by
     20 meters, divided into four parts. These were adapted, forming just one park, without any division and with
     existing vegetation. The required food was established, according to production phases and the potential of
     the partner farmers.
     3. Establishment of varietal corn Seed Bank: The Seed Bank was carried out with the corn variety BE 106
     which is rustic and fully adaptable to diverse edafo-climatic conditions. As a rustic variety it is stable and
     adaptable. The first seeds produced were distributed during a field day with 29 interested producers – about
     600 kg were distributed between the farmers to form the second generation planted in the community.
     Farmers received guidance on how to preserve the seeds and the genetics of the variety in order to multiply
     production on their own properties.
     4. Introduction of vermicompostagem (worm composting) in the production of leaf kale: The use of
     humus as the main source of fertilizer for the leaf-kale subsystem was introduced. Worm compost is an
     organic fertilizer (humus) capable of improving the attributes of soil chemically (better retention and cycling
     of nutrients), physically (improved structure and formation of aggregates), and biologically (increased
     biological organisms). A suspended earthworm container formed from two rings of concrete with a volume
     of about 0.8 m3 aquired through the local construction industry. Each ring received 200 to 300 kg of manure
     and 25 liters of California red earthworms (Eisenia foetidae) acquired from a specialist source, which
     produced, each 45 to 60 days, 100 liters of worm-compost ready to be used in the field.
     5. Agro-ecological practices for tomato: In the tomato sub-system, alternative forms of controls of pests and
     diseases were introduced, carried out through the use of Bordeaux mixture (calda bordaleza), vegetable
     extracts,32 wrapping the stalks with glassine paper, and using home-made traps attached to the tomato plant
     with tape.
     6. Green fertilizer for manioc cultivation: Green fertilizers (Guandu and Crotalaria) were introduced into
     manioc sub-systems in consortia arrangements. The green fertilizers were seeded simultaneously with the
     manioc. The producer’s preferred system is a consortia in alternating lines, with Guandu.
     7. Alternative controls of pests and diseases in coffee: An alternative control for pests and diseases was
     introduced for coffee sub-systems. This occurred through the utilization of alternative mixtures among which
     were Agrobio, Bordeaux mixture, BMBio and Metabio. The bio-fertilizer Agrobio isproduced from fresh
     bovine manure, water, molasses and mineral salts in open containers. The Bordeaux mixture is a colloidal
     suspension, light blue, obtained by mixing a solution of copper sulphate with a suspension of natural or
     hydrated lime, also with nutritional effects and disease control. BMBio is a by-product which contains, in its
     formulation, spores of fungus Beauveria bassiana applied in powder form to the plant. It contains control
     agents such as fungi and bacteria which colonize the pathogens attacking the fields. Metabio is also a by-

      Fungicide made of copper sulphate, lime and water


                                                          34
 product which contains in its formulation fungus spores of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae,
 applied directly to the soil, thereby biologically controlling pests.
 8. Green fertilizer interspersed with manioc: The use of green fertilizer was introduced interspersed with
 beans in manioc production sub-systems cropped in simple rows – 1.0 m by 0.8 m and in double rows – 2.0 m
 by 0.8 m by 0.8 m with and without the fertilizer interspersed with the beans.
 9. Use of alternative protection in pimentos: Biofertilizers were introduced in pimento sub-systems
 reducing the use of agro-chemicals. The biofertilizer Agrobio is produced from fresh bovine manure, water,
 molasses and mineral salts in open containers. The same is the case with organo-mineral fertilization which is
 a mixture of organic composts complemented by mineral sources. With the greater supply of fertilizer in the
 soil, the organo-mineral is such that the farmer can reduce by 35-40% the source of nutrients, a significant
 reduction in production costs.
 10. Sustainable, integrated agricultural production (PAIS): An adapted PAIS system was introduced and
 evaluated based on the exploration/analysis of 17 cultivars including onion, cilantro, kale, carrots, lettuce,
 capsicum, peppers and arugula.
 11. Marketing of health foods from family agriculture to institutional markets: Family farmers were
 trained to participate in the Federal Government’s Food Acquisition Program (FAP). Data were collected
 concerning production and delivery for institutional markets.
 12. Subterranean dams: The subterranean dam is a technology for capturing rainwater from surface run-off
 as well as infiltrated water, to improve soil humidity/moisture content. The damming of water occurs in the
 soil profile, creating a reservoir or elevating the water table, preventing losses through evaporation. Use of the
 subterranean dam has positive environmental impacts such as the reduction of surface run-off and erosion, a
 strategic mechanism in areas suffering frequent dry period, which can reach 10 months in duration annually,
 affecting agro-livestock production as well as the supply of water for human consumption. The subterranean
 dam is an alternative for water capture and for increasing agricultural productivity of small and medium rural
 enterprises, mainly those which lack water for irrigation use.
 13. Silvi-pastoral systems: Despite the research project being initiated, the results were not evaluated or
 disseminated due to the sale of the property.

2.21     Long-term research units: The Rio/GEF also financed seven long-term research units, now
being maintained and concluded by the Rio Rural/IBRD project. These research units are testing:
sustainable management of dairy pasture; sustainable production of limes; agro-forestry systems; use
of alternative pest control in fruits; and adaptation of seasonal crops to the integrated agro-ecological,
sustainable production (PAIS) system.

2.22    Component 3: Organization and Capacity-building for Integrated Ecosystem
Management (IEM) (US$2.47 m, 16.0% of total project cost) financed training, education and
community engagement efforts to facilitate the formation and strengthening of rural organizations for
the self-management of natural resources. These activities were to complement productive and
marketing group activities fostered by the ongoing State Rio Rural and Federal PRONAF programs.
Direct beneficiaries were to be about 6,000 technicians, smallholders, rural youth and micro-
catchment residents, trained in natural resources management, and to participate in rural collective
undertakings to promote beneficiaries’ socio-economic development.

2.23 Sub-component 3.1: Community Organization entailed diagnostic studies of existing
community organizations and facilitating the development and implementation of pilot community
self-management activities focusing on the production and delivery of environmentally sustainable
goods and services.    An innovative, multi-disciplinary methodology - known as Incubation of
Sustainable Rural Enterprises (IRS) – was applied for strengthening local organizations through
collective action and self-management. Two rural incubator centers were planned within
Information/Communication Centers. 33 An interactive project Communication Plan was also
supported.



33
   The methodology is based on a World Bank award-winning program developed by the Technology Incubator for Popular Cooperatives
(ITCP) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro to establish viable and sustainable collective enterprises and networks.


                                                              35
Achievements:

       The EMATER-Rio team was trained to act as an incubator of collective/group enterprises
        within the micro-catchments, improving their delivery of ATER services to support
        community groups organizationally and in their capacity to conduct collective business
        activities/ventures;
       Community organizations were strengthened via the project’s adaptation of the incubator
        methodology for popular cooperatives of ITCP/COPPE/UFRJ to the rural environment
        (known as the IRS – Incubator of Sustainable Rural Enterprises);
       40 community organizations were created, adopting and implementing IEM/SLM strategies
        via the incubator mechanism;
       Incubator groups were strengthened through the implementation of a communication system
        between technicians and beneficiaries;
       The IRS resulted in the financing of some 588 small-scale agro-industrial ventures/subprojects
        in 24 municipalities, including: milk chilling tanks; beekeeping/honey production; crafts,
        seedling nurseries, manioc mills, fruit orchards, processed fruit products, dairy livestock, and
        confectionary production;
       Implemented one Telecenter to promote communication and market/organizational
        networking.

2.24 Sub-component 3.2: Training of Project Executors supported training and environmental
awareness efforts for project-related inter-sector and rural extension staff including management and
technical capacity building programs for some 420 staff.

Achievements:

       The project trained 370 technicians including local NGOs (185%) to improve their managerial
        and technical capacity to manage natural resources adequately and communicate such
        messages to micro-catchments residents;

2.25 Sub-component 3.3: Training and Environmental Education for beneficiaries to enhance local
capacity and increase support for sustainable NRM, complementing existing training by the base
programs in agro-processing, improved cropping, animal health and aquaculture; training for teachers
and support for environmental projects in schools; and, demand-driven technical training in the five
broad subproject investment categories.

Achievements:

       Trained 2,600 members of micro-catchment communities (87%) through environmental
        education;
       Provided training/environmental awareness-building to 5,730 members of the wider regional
        community (191%); and
       Conducted 20 environmental education programs (80%) through local schools.

2.26 Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.74 million, 17.5%
of total project cost)

2.27 Sub-component 4.1: Participatory Management of the Project supported technical assistance,
office equipment, administrative and operational aspects to ensure effective project implementation
and resources management; the Project management Unit (SEP); and, establishing the participatory,
consultative external project coordination structure (Coordination Forums) at State, municipal and
micro-catchments levels.

                                                  36
Achievements:

       The Project Executive Secretariat (SEP) was established as planned, supported by two
        decentralized Regional Executive Secretariats (SER).
       The coordination structure of COGEMs, COREM and CMDRs was successfully established
        and while quite complex, functioned well/as intended;
       The high level Project Steering Committee (the pre-existing State Council for Sustainable
        Rural Development – CEDRUS) was also kept regularly informed about project progress,
        results and performance in different municipalities. CEDRUS activities focused on integrating
        government/non-government institutions and initiatives in the health, education, culture and
        environment sectors.

2.28     Micro-catchment Management Councils (COGEM) and Regional Micro-catchment
Councils (COREM): To constitute the COGEMs, EMATER extension staff worked as “animators?
of a participatory process to identify the scope of stakeholders within a micro-catchment and to
promote the sense of common purpose and identity. Various groups congregated (women, youth,
cultural, dairy farmers etc) to form a pre-COGEM. Following a diagnostic process, each group
nominated their representative to form the COGEM. At least 80% of these groups had to be part of
the COGEM but there was no required minimum percentage of small farmers. The experience in
applying the methodology showed that generally, at least 70% of COGEM members were
beneficiaries (commonly men, women and young small farmers). In the case of the COREM, the PIU
identified and invited doe a public meeting the major actors in the NNWF region including public
institutionms (municipal, state and federal), trade unions, NGOs, universities and River Basin
Committees. Subsequently, participants divided into groups and elected representatives from the
various sectors and levels (one focal point and one alternate). COREM has 14 members/focal points
and 14 alternates. Overall, the COREM is 50% public sector and 50% private.

2.29     PEM and PID: The PEM consolidated community demands/needs across sectors (including
agriculture, infrastructure, environment, education, health and leisure) to facilitate the delivery of
solutions in each case. The project methodology included elements to strengthen community self-
management can now approach relevant programs to address key deficits using the PEM as a
community “business plan?, incrasing their access to public policies and resources. The project also
had a simplified version of the PEM (without physical targets and more qualitative) called the “PEM
vendavel? (saleable PEM) used by communities to approach potential donors in the public and private
sectors. SEP also has a role in assisting this integration with on-going programs and policies, e.g., in
some micro-catchments, the demands stemming from the PEM for the health sector were taken to the
State Secretariat of Health resulting in the training of health agents for rural districts to improve
services and increase their relevance in rural areas. Demands for sanitation services are also being
responded to by relevant state programs. In regard to the link between the PEM and the PID, project
managers provided (and still provide under the Rio Rural/IBRD) guidance to project technical staff
that the PID must reflect the demands of the PEM in those themes eligible for project financing. The
subproject screening and analysis criteria include a detailed analysis of a PID’s coherence/consistency
with the PEM. If they are not consistent, the PID can be (on occasion) returned to the farmer for
adjustment, but in general, the PID reflects a wide range of needs/proposed activities.

2.30 Sub-component 4.2: Monitoring and Evaluation financed the physical and financial
monitoring of the project, socio-economic and environmental monitoring in pilot micro-catchments
and overall project evaluation. GEF activities complemented the State’s Rio Rural monitoring
program in pilot micro-catchments and were to support: (i) continuous monitoring of the results of
project actions through established indicators; (ii) with CI-Brasil and SOS Atlantica, evaluate the
positive impacts of IEM on the increase inregional biodiversity and carbon stocks in agriculture and
livestock; (iii) support project planning and adjustments; (iv) provide essential data for the MTR and

                                                  37
final evaluations; (v) establish a database showing project evolution. Two full evaluations were
planned in addition to a baseline study.

Achievements:

            Baseline (2006) and Mid-term Review (FEALQ 2010) studies were conducted, as well as a
             final report by independent consultants which became the Client Competion Report
             (SEAPEC/SDS 2012);
             Within SEP, units were created linked to different themes/components to facilitate project
             decentralization and the assignment/allocation of responsibilities and activities. Each unit ad
             its own set of performance monitoring indicators to oversee the evolution of activities and
             correct and deviations. This arrangement permitted a greater project presence in the micro-
             catchments and strengthened the dialogue with local and regional co-management bodies
             (COREM, COGEMs and Municipalk Rural Development Councils (CMDRs), as well as
             with the mayors, partner institutions and direct executors/technicians;
            Comprehensive monitoring was conducted in three micro-catchments and participatory
             monitoring – very successfully - in the entire 48 micro-catchments (see Main Text, Section
             2.3);
            Comprehensive monitoring of soil use in micro-catchments indicated a decline in area of
             degraded pasture (especially in the Santa Maria/Cambioca – Sao Jose de Uba micro-
             catchment) and regeneration of vegetation especially in areas near springs and water-courses
             in the Brejo da Cobica – Sao Francisco de Itabapoana micro-catchment (see paras. 2.15 and
             2.16 above); and,
            The micro-catchment simulator methodology using the Universal Soil Loss Equation
             (USLE) was almost completed by project closing, designed to support the sustainable
             management of natural resources through the adoption by farmers of practices adapted to
             local realities – soil, climate, vegetation. An important function of this methodology is to
             simulate soil loss through erosion stemming from inadequate management, much of the time
             imperceptible to farmers. Using the USLE, cited frequently in specialist studies, published
             data was adapted to the areas where the project was active.

2.31 Sub-component 4.3: Project Dissemination financed the project information dissemination
strategy to share information both within and outside the project.

Achievements:
    Dissemination was local, regional and global through seminars, field days, the production and
       distributionof materials and distribution of press releases. Global dissemination occurred via
       the project-supported Project Portal (website) www.microbacias.rj.gov.br .

Results of dissemination activities included:

           114,000 copies of Rio Rural News were distributed to farmers and project stakeholders
            reporting events, activities, SLM items, best practices and resource mobilization opportunities
            for SLM; this bulletin attended to the very broad demand for information from people lacking
            access to the internet;
           Project Portal (see above) had some 43,000 visits and 137,000 page viewings. The number of
            site visits grew by 105% in the second year of the Portal’s availability;
           Brochures in accessible language for school distribution/other audiences were produced, and
            distributed through EMATER-Rio’s local offices, dealing with socio-environmental issues,
            sustainable development, and the flora/fauna of specific micro-catchments. The Portal was
            also uploaded with a virtual library of such material;
           Practical manual of operational procedures was produced to support technicians and field
            extension workers from the subproject initiation through results dissemination stages;

                                                      38
      A Visual Identification Manual was developed to establish a standardized usage of the “brand?
       Rio Rural/GEF and contribute to its rapid identification/recognition by strategic project
       stakeholders/public and dissemination of its key concepts. The Manual is available on the
       Project Portal;
      29 Technical Support Manuals were produced in three series, prepared in partnership with
       PESAGRO/Rio. The purpose of the manuals is to support technicians and stakeholders to
       prepare projects designed to incentivate sustainable natural resources management practices in
       micro-catchments, with suggested projects adhering to the five main categories of
       investments; and,
      As an incentive to mobilize communities to capture/leverage resources to execute activities
       defined in their Micro-catchment Development Plans (PEM), folders containing a resume of
       communities’ principal demands in three micro-catchments (so-called “Saleable PEMs?),
       folders were prepared containing a resume of principal demands/needs and basic information
       about each micro-catchment; their preparation was participatory, with micro-catchment
       residents contributing ideas and perspectives, and formulating local strategies; and;
      The project supported – through scholarships - research conducted by EMBRAPA/Soils with
       results presented at the 22nd Brasilia Soil Sciences Congress in Fortaleza. Studies were
       authored by research groups from EMBRAPA/Soils and graduate students from the Federal
       University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and Santa Ursula University, contributing to appropriate
       soil management and identification of local priorities for soil recuperation and conservation.

2.32 Project costs and financing: As shown in Annex 1 tables, total project cost was US$18.31
million, 122.47% of the appraisal estimate. The GEF Grant financed 36.3% of the project cost
compared to the appraisal estimate of 45%. Cost sharing differed significantly from appraisal: The
Recipient contribution was barely 57% of appraisal, while the Federal Government’s contribution
(mostly PRONAF) was over 400% the original estimate at US$4.80 million, chiefly due to the
declining US Dollar/exchange rate, but also because of high demand for PRONAF financing and
liberal flow of these funds nationwide. Contributions from beneficiaries and NGOs were about 28%
and 3.2% respectively, of their original estimates. The expected contribution of beneficiaries was
about 20% of GEF financing for subprojects (sub-component 2.1) but reached only 8% due mainly to
the exemption of the counterpart requirement in the case of financing for environmental practices.
The project was able to leverage about US$3.04 million in contributions from other sources. The
tables below show co-financing outcomes by principal source and component, and a breakdown of the
US$3.04 million from diverse contributors.

2.33     Adjustments to allowable subproject support: The ceilings on allowable subproject
support to beneficiaries were adjusted due to price inflation for inputs (materials, labor and equipment)
and exchange rate fluctuations. When the project was approved in December 2005, the ceiling per
farm family was R$6,000 and R$4,000 for other participating farmers. Of this value, family farmers
would receive 80% and other farmers would receive 40%. By 2008-9 when the project started to
release incentives financing to beneficiaries, evidence showed that the ceiling was no longer adequate
to implement the practices envisaged and an increase was needed. The ceiling was adjusted to
R$7,000 and R$5,000 respectively. Family farmers would receive a maximum R$5,600 (80%) while
the others would receive R$2,000 (40%). In 2010, a new adjustment was agreed with the Bank, with
the maximum for a family farmer increasing to R$8,750 of which they would effectively receive
R$7,000 (80%) while the others would get a maximum R$5,000 (corresponding to 40% of R$12,500).

2.34     Group investments were established in quotas with the value of a quota calculated by dividing
the total value of the enterprise/investment by the number of participants in the group. The quota for
project support to each group participant/member could not exceed the limit per beneficiary cited
above. The project support quota varied based on the composition of the group, with 80% for groups
of family farmers and 60% for groups comprising other types of farmers.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction:

3.1     Given the project’s demonstration/pilot nature, the PAD did not include an economic and
financial analysis but project design did include cost-effectiveness considerations to promote
maximum implementation effectiveness, replication and impact both within and outside the project
area. Thus, project activities would be fully integrated with complementary, ongoing, public and
private efforts including those to financially support improved production systems and supply of
technical assistance. Cost effectiveness considerations also drove the distribution of target micro-
catchments for development of environmentally and financially sound demonstrative models with
maximum representation of the diverse situations within the five targeted micro-catchments.
3.2      For this evaluation, direct economic impacts and positive environmental impacts were
considered in the case of productive subprojects and, positive, direct environmental impacts and
indirect economic impacts for environmental subprojects. According to GEF (GEF 2005) 34 , the
evaluation of environmental impacts is not simple due to the difficulty of quantifying such impacts
and relating them in a direct manner with the resources applied (especially those related to
biodiversity) suggesting the need to adopt a qualitative approach which would include cost-
effectiveness.
3.3     The subprojects examined by the evaluation, especially Rustic Poultry Production Kit (Kit
Galinha Caipira – 339 investments), water source protection (226 investments), and pasture rotation
(224 investments) were the most commonly demanded by beneficiaries. Another aspect to take into
consideration is the economic importance, in the case of pasture rotation, the social significance in the
case of kit galinha caipira and the environmental importance associated with the notorious scarcity of
water in drought periods in the two project regions, for the case of source protection subprojects. Table
1 below shows the 10 most-demanded subprojects.

Methodological approach:

3.4     The approaches taken into account were: (i) use of Internal Rate of Return (IRR) to evaluate
economic returns; (ii) use of the cost-effectiveness approach (GEF, 2005), to evaluate environmental
impacts. Each subproject was considered as a case study and certain results of environmental impacts
were extrapolated to the total number of such subprojects and resources applied/invested.

Criteria for selection of subprojects:

3.5       For the selection of subprojects, the following criteria were adopted: (i) number of
beneficiaries who demanded those subprojects and resources applied. The Rustic Poultry Kits (336
beneficiaries), Water Source Protection (226 beneficiaries) and Pasture Rotation (224 beneficiaries)
were the most frequently demanded and totaled the sum of R$ 1,991,140.65; (ii) subprojects
monitored and availability of information, especially for pasture rotation subprojects and water source
protection, for which the following elements were monitored: soil quality; degree of vegetative
covering; carbon sequestration, and productivity (pasture rotation); (iii) reconomic versus
environmental impacts, especially for rustic poultry kits and pasture rotation; (iv) potential positive
environmental impacts (for all subprojects selected) and negative (for rustic poultry kits). Honey
production subprojects, while not demanded in large quantity, but still within the 10 subprojects
receiving most of the resources, was selected both for its importance in relation to biodiversity
conservation and for the pollinization process for native vegetation species, and for its economic
interest.
Selection of farmers:
3.6       For the selection of farmers, within each subproject, the following criteria were used: (i)
farmers with pasture rotation and water source protection subprojects: availability of information from
participatory monitoring; use of available areas for biodiversity conservation (in the case of pasture
rotation) and utilization (or planning for the use) of water available in periods critical for irrigation;
(ii) in the case of kit de galinha caipira, the main criteria were the availability of information necessary
to conduct evaluations – economic and cost-effectiveness – of environmental impacts, as well as the
existence of results provided from the sale of eggs and use of waste; (iii) in the case of honey farmers,
the main criterion was the availability of information for an economic-financial analysis.

Methodology for calculation of Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and profitability:

3.7      Internal rate of Return: This involved the following calculations: (i) variable costs are
those whose values change as a function of a firm’s volume of production. For example: raw
materials and inputs used in the productive process. Variable costs increase as production increases;
(ii) fixed costs are those whose values remain the same whatever the firm’s volume of production.
This is so in the case for example, of rental of the factory, taxes, salaries, depreciation. This will be
charged at the same value whatever the level of production, including in the case of a factory which
produces nothing; (iii) cash flow has as its main objective a projection of incoming and outgoing
financial resources of the company in a determined period of time. In this case the flow will be the
result between costs and receipts which will serve to calculate the internal rate of return of the
investment; (iv) useful life of the project, to verify the maximum time in which it is possible to obtain
information. Year Zero means the moment when the investment is made and from the start of Year 1
one is going to obtain receipts and expenses for production; (v) Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of a
flow of cash is a mathematical goal which provides the real rate of interest in a financial operation,
understanding the values in their real time (present value) Cane fodder(see Table 4, for a pasture
rotation subproject, considered for this evaluation). The subprojects evaluated are on average three
years old and the times considered (k) vary as a function of the type of subproject, the average being
(a) pasture rotation subproject: average 8 years; (b) rustic poultry kit: average 5 years; and (c) honey
production: average 6 years.
3.8    Profitability: To calculate profitability, the gross income/return on the activity (cash flow)
and operational 44xpenditures were considered. The profitability was obtained by dividing the gross

Methodology for Carbon Sequestration:

3.9     The amount of carbon sequestered was calculated in a Participatory Research Unit (pasture
rotation subproject), in partnership with family farmers, beneficiaries of the Rio Rural/GEF project.
The methodology compares two pasture management rotation systems, that which uses fixed terms of
occupation and repose, and one which uses variable terms – Voisin Rational Pasture – and aims to
propose an agro-ecological solution for family farmers.
3.10    The sample collection period was weekly for the variable term system, and every 28 days for
the fixed-term system. Comparisons are based on averages obtained for each of the treatments, in the
respective periods. Average productivity in kg of Dry Material was obtained for the drying of green
material collected in random samples of 1.0 m2, in a force-ventilated stove, maintained at 58o C up to
constant weight. Soil organic material was calculated deducing the mineral fraction of Dry material
and its equivalent in Carbon was calculated based on an equation proposed by Oliveira & Millioli
(2005).
3.11    A hypothesis considered by the study is that well-managed pasture eco-systems contribute in
diverse ways to a sustainable environment, noting inter alia, an increase in the accumulated organic
matter in the soil.

Actual situation and possible results for the subprojects considered:

3.12     Presented below is a consideration of the situation before the project and the hypotheses of
results expected by the project, as well as a conceptual model for pasture rotation, rustic poultry kits
and water source protection subprojects, which were the most heavily demanded of those included in
this evaluation.
Pasture Rotation Subproject

(a) Previous situation (without the subproject): In the case of livestock the conventional system has
brought a cycle of soil degradation and consequently of water resources, and of reduced production as
a consequence of inadequate soil, water and pasture management. The cycle starts with land clearing
of vegetative cover in sloping areas with soils susceptible to erosion. From the over-grazing and
pisoteio of livestock occurs superficial “glazing? (soil compaction) which, associated with rain impact
and reduced filtration leads to erosion, impact on water resources and loss of production. To balance
such losses, the farmer increases the area of pasture, extending the degraded area within the micro-
catchment, thus closing the cycle.
(b) Actual Situation (with project): With the pasture rotation subproject, even though the cattle are
concentrated in smaller areas, a cycle of environmental recovery and milk production is initiated,
caused by: (i) increased vegetative cover from the resting of areas for pasture recuperation, and (ii) by
the concentrated waste load, associated with improvements in the pasture itself with the introduction
of species with greater potential to produce green mass. These aspects lead to a virtuous cycle with
increased productivity, improved soil quality, less erosion, less impact on water resources, less
extension of pasture for the same levels of production, releasing in this way areas for environmental
restoration, like for example, biodiversity conservation.
The project hypothesis, in relation to pasture rotation, was a sustained increase in production n: greater
production, with recuperation of soil and less area utilized. The major challenge was to convince
farmers to change their system of management and implement measures to preserve biodiversity in
areas released/set aside due to the implementation of subprojects (especially on river margins,
recharge areas and springs).
Rustic Poultry Production Kit (kit galinha caipira)

(a) Previous situation (without project): It needs to be considered that for the selection of regions for
project interventions, one of the criteria was the rural poverty index. The profile of families in these
conditions demanded practices with the possibility of utilization of small areas and in a short time to
get a return which ensured their subsistence, increased their food security and provided the possibility
of selling surpluses.
(b) Actual situation (with project): The benefits of the project practice were most notably: (i) use of
manure for crops (horticulture, fruticulture, coffee etc.), leading to a reduction of environmental risk
and sustainably increasing production; (ii) subsistence production and the possibility of selling
surpluses; (iii) the use of wastes implies a reduced dependence on synthetic fertilizers which present,
in addition to high cost, possible environmental impacts in specific situations. Due to the lack of both
economic and subsistence options of these families, there was very strong demand for the rustic
poultry production kit, leading to the project adopting it as an incentivating practice and, negotiating
so that beneficiaries would use the waste for fertilization of subsistence and economic crops,
minimizing the potential environmental risks associated with this activity.
It can be seen in Table 5 that the hypothesis initially suggested by the project – that beneficiaries
would utilize the waste as a source of fertilizer – was confirmed, since the environmental practice
most commonly used in conjunction with the poultry kit was organic fertilization. In visits to the field
to collect information for the project’s final evaluation, it was noted that beneficiary farmers are
still/already using the waste generated as a source of organic fertilizer.

The potential environmental risks are mainly: (i) soil erosion in the pens where the birds are kept, from
the removal of vegetative cover and consequent impact of rain drops/fall and surface run-off. This
risk, however, could be considered irrelevant due to the very small areas assigned to poultry pens; and,
(ii) transport of waste into water courses (in the case of inadequate management).
The project hypothesis for the rustic poultry kit was: attend the demand of micro-catchment residents,
offering a source of income with the possibility of using organic fertilizer, avoiding impact on the
environment. The major challenge was convincing beneficiaries of the importance of using waste as a
soil fertilizer, avoiding in this way the impact on the environemt (and especially on water resources),
besides the utilization of other associated environmental practices, to be implemented with project or
their own resources.
Water Source Protection Subproject

(a) Previous situation (without project): The vast majority of springs in the project area can be found
in pasture areas, unprotected, and permitting the direct access of animals. They have low vegetative
cover with consequent pollution of water from animal waste and gradual reduction in water quality,
especially in periods of drought.
The reduction in water quantity is effected by the pressure exerted on the area around the source re-
charge area by cattle stamping on the ground, causing modifications in soil attributes, especially soil
density, reducing infiltration and water flow and compromising the re-charging (recarga) of the
aquifer. This fact favors direct surface run-off, promoting gradual silting up of the spring.
In addition to this, the type of cover influences the process of interception and collection of
precipitation. In this case, cover in the form of forest, besides intercepting and retaining a large parcel
giving more time for infiltration, and as a consequence, re-loading humidity in the soil profile and
consequently the subterranean water table. It is worth remembering however, that the size of the
recharge area, the use of the soil and the state of preservation of spring recharge areas influence the
value and performance over time of the specific yields of same.
In the case of domestic consumption and animal watering, this situation leads to families depending on
neighbors to guarantee water and/or water capture in distant locations with consequent higher costs. In
the case of irrigation, the low availability in dry periods implies non-viability or diminution of
irrigation time and consequent reduced production.
(b) Actual situation (with project): With the protection of springs, the project hoped to achieve the
following results: (i) increase in the index of vegetative cover and in the diversity of species around
the protected springs; (ii) improvement in the quality and increase in availability of water, for the
different uses for which it was intended; (iii) increased awareness of beneficiaries and other residents
in the micro-catchments (through demonstration effects), about the need for protection of water
resources and biodiversity.

                                                    47
The project hypothesis was: recuperate springs and biodiversity through protective practices, with
positive impacts on the quantity and quality of water. The greater challenge was to convince potential
beneficiaries to open up/set aside one hectare to be dedicated to biodiversity and water resources
conservation.

Honey Production (Apicultura)

Honey production/beekeeping is an activity related directly to biodiversity and agri-biodiversity in the
micro-catchments, due to the role of bees in the generalized pollinization of vegetative species. They
also represent an important economic potential in two respects: (i) through the direct sale of their
products and by-products; and (ii) through the indirect gains from the action of bees in pollinization of
productive species.
The project faced the challenge of attending to the demand from the micro-catchments while at the
same time, stimulating new residents to adhere to this activity, because in addition to the issues noted
earlier, beekeeping represents a path for building awareness in producers regarding the non-
application of agro-chemicals because these can stop beekeeping/honey activities.           In addition,
beekeeping represents an important potential activity for organizing producers around honey
processing centers, stimulating the formation of small associations which could become future
cooperatives.
The Honey Kits are composed of an average 5 hives with an annual expected production of 125 kg of
honey.
Results observed:
Pasture Rotation
Economic results: In relation to milk production, it can be seen in Figure 4 that of the 10 subprojects
monitored via participatory monitoring there was an increase in 9 (90%), with an average increase of
80% in productivity. Only one subproject showed a slight reduction in productivity. The average
Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of projects evaluated by the case study was 59% and profitability ranged
from R$0.11 to R$0.48 for each Real expended/invested (see Table 6).

Environmental impacts (cost-effectiveness)

3.13     Specifically in the case of improved soil quality, evaluated based on organic material (g/dm3
e % M.O.) and nutrients in the surface layer (0 – 20 cm) of soil in six subprojects accompanied by
participatory monitoring over a three-year period, the following results were noted, when comparing
the third year with the baseline – when the practice was initially implemented: (i) increased organic
material in 66.6% of subprojects, with an average increase of 5.04 g/dm3 or 0.5%; reduced organic
material in 33.4%, with an average reduction of 2.07 g/dm3 or 0.2%; (ii) in the case of phosphorus and
potassium, 87.5% of subprojects had an increase, showing an average increase of 10.14 mg/dm3 for
phosphorus and 2.14 mmolc/dm3 for potassium.
There is no way to extrapolate these results for all subprojects since each area has its own specific soil
characteristics and each subproject had its own management system.
In regard to the liberation of areas for conservation, the case studies conducted indicate the release of
an average 1.5 ha per subproject, amounting to a total 336 ha within the project area, taking into
account that some 224 pasture rotation subprojects were approved in total. These areas have been
utilized primarily for the restoration of riparian forest (mata ciliar), protection of water springs and
protection of water resource re-charge (recarga) areas. Bearing in mind that about R$1.0 million were
invested in pasture rotation subprojects, there was a release of 0.336 ha for each R$1,000 applied.
In relation to carbon sequestration, evaluations conducted through participatory research, associated
with pasture rotation indicate the storage/sequestration in the soil of 80 t/ha and in the air about 5 t/ha.
Bearing in mind that some 224 subprojects were approved with an average area of 1 ha/subproject,
there was a storage totaling 19,040 tons, that is, 19 tons per R$1,000 applied, since the average value
of subprojects was R$ 4,506.23.
As 1.5 ha/subproject was released for biodiversity conservation (336 ha in total), carbon sequestration
in this area was 28.2 tons for each R$1,000 applied, so that the “carbon price? paid by the project
would be approximately R$ 35.00 per ton.
Rustic Poultry Production Kit (Kit galinha caipira)

3.14    Economic results: In regard to the socio-economic result, it was noted during field
interviews that a percentage of beneficiaries with the Rustic Poultry Production Kit are selling surplus
production of eggs in local markets/fairs and institutional markets such as the school lunch program.
The average Internal Rate of Return of subprojects evaluated by the case studies was 26.2% and the
profitability varied between R$0.52 and R$0.84 for each Real invested/expended (Table 7).

Environmental impacts (cost-effectiveness):

3.15     The case studies showed that the introduction of the rustic poultry kits provided an annual
production of 2,475 tons of organic fertilizer36 with a market value of around R$90.00/ton, resulting in
a total R$ 222,750.00. Bearing in mind that the project applied/invested approximately R$580,000.00
in this practice, the result indicates a return of R$0.40 per R$1.00 invested, just for the production of
manure (opportunity cost). Considering that the percentage of N, P2O5 e K2O in poultry manure is
respectively: 3.04; 4.70 e 1.89 (KIEHL, 1985)37, the 2,475 tons of manure are equivalent to: 75.2 tons
of Nitrogen; 116.3 tons of Pentoxide of Di-phopherus - P2O5 and 46.7 tons of Potassium Oxide - K2O,
it is possible to fertilize 247 ha of coffee, or 165 ha of fruits, or 82.5 ha of oil plants (based on average
data on dosage in the project regions).
As a positive externality, the reduced use of synthetic fertilizers contributed to a reduction in
environmental impacts in areas where raw materials are obtained for those same products.
Protection of water springs

3.16    With the protection of springs, important results were noted both by participatory monitoring
and by case studies conducted for this evaluation.
(a) Recuperation of native vegetation and of local biodiversity was noted in subprojects monitored by
participatory monitoring, where 9 subprojects were monitored and in all cases the recuperation of
native vegetation and species diversity were observed. Also, beneficiaries interviewed for the case
studies on the adoption of SLM practices: “The forest is growing and there are many new seedlings?.
(b) Increased availability of water: Increased water availability was noted in three subprojects of the
four monitored by participatory monitoring. Beneficiaries interviewed during preparation of the case
study also noted incrresed water availability: “The water is flowing more?; “When you protect the
spring, nature shows the difference rapidly?. “The water is extending more over the course of the
drought period?; “The water is increasing and it is cleaner?. “It’s normal even with the drought?.
(c) Utilization of water from protected springs: Two case studies were conducted on the utilization of
water from protected springs and the results showed:
(i) In the case study conducted in São Francisco de Itabapoana, the farmer utilizes the water for
irrigation of pineapple. According to the farmer, with increased availability of water from the
protected spring, it is possible to increase the irrigation period on one hectare leading to a production
increase of approximately 12% as a function of the extension of the irrigation period. This increase
represented 2,666 kg/ha with a value of R$0.85/kg representing a gain of R$2,261.10 or R$0.77 per
Real invested/applied by the project (considering that the farmer applied, in order to protect the spring
a value of R$2,330.00 of project funds and R$600.00 of counterpart financing.




36
    According to information from project technicians, 1 kit with 60 adult birds produces 20 kg of manure per day. Since some 339 kits were
financed, the daily production of manure is 6.78 tons or, 2,474.7 tons/year.

(ii) In the case study conducted in Campos dos Goytacazes, from the increase in water available from
the protected spring, the beneficiary farmers is planning to plant irrigated pasture. The farmer’s
expectation with irrigation of pasture is an increase of 5,300 liters of milk/year, compared with actual
production, without irrigation. Considering the value of R$ 0.75/Liter, the gain in Reais per year will
be R$ 3,975.00. In addition, in this area the farmer produces meat and the increase expected in
arrobas38/ano with irrigation will be 1.5. Considering the value of one arroba (15 kg) of $ 93.00, the
value per year will be R$139.50. Taling into account that some R$ 2,930.00 was invested in protecting
the spring, the results indicate a return of R$1.40 per Real invested (without considering the cost to
implement the irrigation system).
The project applied R$402,356.25, that is, an average value of R$1,780.34/subproject. With project
support some 226 springs were protected. Considering that each protected spring encompasses 0.75 ha
(according to the current Federal Forest Code, the protection area must cover a radius of 50 meters
around the spring), 169.5 ha were protected, that is to say 0.42 ha for each R$1,000.00 applied by the
project.
Even though carbon sequestration in the area of the project protected springs was not directly
measured, studies indicate the air storage of an average 1.5 tons/ha/year in forests in process of natural
regeneration.39. This average would give a sequestration of carbon in the order of 294.75 tons/year
associated with spring protection subprojects, that is, 0.73 tons for each R$ 1,000.00 applied by the
project.
In regard to water quality, while participatory monitoring has not adopted quantitative parameters
which could prove improvements in water quality associated with springs protection, results from
other projects indicate the improvements associated with the physical protection of springs and to their
isolation: Reduction of up to 89% in the presence of heat-tolerant coliforme bacteria in springs
protected by the Rio Grande do Sul Project (RS Rural).40
Honey Production (Apicultura)

3.17    Economic Results: Honey production kits comprise an average 5 hives and an expected
annual production of 125 kg of honey. The average Internal Rate of Return for subprojects considered
by this evaluation was 21.8% and profitability ranged from R$0.50 to R$0.90 for each Real
invested/applied (Table 8).

Environmental Impacts (cost-effectiveness):

3.18   A study conducted in Minas Gerais on the effect of pollinization by Apis mellifera and other
genus of bees in the productivity of coffee41 indicated that: “open pathways for the visit of pollinizers
produced a greater number of fruits per flower compared to pathways without contact with pollinizers,
demonstrating that pollinization is an important process in coffee productivity, increasing production
by 5% on average?. The study noted that the presence of Apis mellifera was 56% of total pollinizers.
3.19     The study also noted: “If we consider that on a property of one hectare, 4,000 coffee plants
can be planted, spaced at 2.5 m by 1 m and that a 5-year old coffee plantation produces on average
4,680 beans per plant (collection data), we would have a production of 18,720,000 beans
corresponding to 176.56 sacks of coffee. Thus, an average increase of 5% associated with pollinization
services in these areas means 8.8 sacks or more of coffee per farmer, per ha, when the forest is
maintained. If the market value of a sack of coffee is today, [2008] around R$245.00
(http://www.abic.com.br), a farmer has an asset of R$ 45,413.20 per year from coffee production.
Under these terms, the value of pollinization as an eco-system service for crops near native forests
would be about R$ 2,156.00 per hectare, per year?.
Conclusions:

3.20     From this evaluation it can be concluded that, from the subprojects analyzed by these case
studies, the economic results and positive environmental impacts are consistent with the initial project
hypothesis.
         In regard to economic results, the contribution of subprojects to the sustainable improvement
          of income in a direct manner (due to the increased productivity with low costs) and indirectly,
          by the opportunitry cost and cost-effectiveness of environmental impacts.

         In regard to positive environmental impacts, the important contribution to biodiversity
          preservation is notable, from the regeneration of native forest associated with environmental
          subprojects (such as protection of springs) and indirectly through the release of areas for
          preservation of biodiversity associated with productive subprojects, as in the case of pasture
          rotation. There are also important results observable in improved soil quality, from increase in
          organic material and nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium, carbon storage and
          increased water quantity and quality.

         Specifically in regard to the kit galinha caipira, the fact that organic fertilizer has been the
          most demanded subproject in association with the former indicates that beneficiaries are aware
          of the importance of the use of waste as a source of soil fertilization, providing environmental
          sustainability to this activity. The results of the case studies indicate that the introduction of
          this practice into beneficiaries’ routine was an important strategy for negotiating the project as
          a means of attending to demand from micro-catchment residents, gaining their commitment to
          environmental preservation.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     The evaluation team surveyed project beneficiaries, municipal authorities and Micro-
catchment Management Councils (COGEMs) in eight municipalities and micro-catchments in the
project area. In the case of beneficiaries, the process was organized but not structured, i.e.,
seeking to measure relative responses for data collection purposes; responses of COGEM
members were quantified. The scope of enquiry covered: (i) social organization; (ii) technical
assistance and rural extension (ATER); (iii) the productive and environmental aspects of
subprojects; and (iv) an assessment of the COGEMs.

Meetings with Beneficiaries

5.2       Social organization:

         Forms of local organization pre-existed the project - productive, religious and social - but
          in many cases were described as in difficulty or moribund. Opinion remained strong
          however, that organization was empowering and enabled, among other things, a solid
          front for representations to authorities and specifically, for accessing public/other
          resources and training, and more generally programs, projects and public policies.
         Beneficiaries viewed the COGEMs as a project-sponsored framework for achieving these
          same goals, with the added element of its environmental responsibilities. The COGEM,
          even with its specific project responsibilities, was seen as fundamentally a mediator
          between local groups and external agents and an instrument for variously, rescuing or
          reviving diverse local forms of organization/collective action.
         Limitations on the evolution of beneficiary/farmer associations and COGEMs tended to
          align around the logistical difficulties encountered by farmers in attending physically, and
          time aspects, considered more a reflection of their underlying lack of interest.
         COGEMs initially encountered skepticism due to farmers’ inability to understand the
          project methodology and the manner in which resources were transferred, reinforced by
          past experiences with rural credit and public programs. This disbelief, along with the
          protracted period before resources actually reached farmers (2009), plus COGEM
          members’ difficulties in physically monitoring/overseeing beneficiaries, were factors
          which weakened farmers’ adherence to their Council.
         Even so, farmers viewed the COGEM as a training instrument, a conduit to information,
          to accessing technical assistance and to learning new environmental and
          agricultural/livestock practices.
         Farmers’ believed that the future of COGEMs depended on efforts to stimulate farmer
          participation, more regular meetings, and reorganization of some COGEMs, interpreted
          as farmers’ demand that the project continue. (Such demand was formally presented at
          two regional forums of COGEMs in late 2011).
         The overall conclusion from farmers’ opinions was that the COGEMs remained at an
          early stage of development, with potential to organize and catalyze local groups but
          lacking detail as to their future form and function.

5.3       Technical assistance and rural extension (ATER):

         In half the micro-catchments surveyed, EMATER-Rio was one among several technical
          assistance providers which included the Brazilian Service for Support to Small Business
          (SEBRAE) and the Ministry of Integration; municipal mayors; commercial agricultural


                                                  55
          input and other private providers. Interaction between Rio-GEF and other programs,
          projects and public policies was common.
         Farmers were aware of the benefits of partnerships, in part to allay their concerns about
          their micro-catchments, their future and the likelihood of another project;
         Farmers observed that the Rio/GEF provided three major benefits in relation to technical
          assistance services: their improvement; their incorporation of environmental concerns;
          and, farmers’ greater access to these services per se;
         The project was an opportunity for farmers to have closer relations with EMATER/Rio
          technicians, while at the same time demanding better quality and more intensive services.
          Losses (e.g., in Kit Galinha and seedlings subprojects) were seen as indicative of fragile
          services needing improvement, and also needing greater engagement of farmers in such
          processes. In other cases, the presence/involvement of the ATER technician was
          fundamental to the credibility of the new practices being promoted;
         In many cases, farmers had had little if any contact with ATER services and the Rio/GEF
          was their first experience; this initial contact was critical for their sense of future access
          to training, and new projects/initiatives and to their growing concerns about and ability to
          judge ATER quantity and quality and demand better.

5.4       Subprojects: Productive and Environmental

         The project’s “interface? with environmental concerns was a constant in all micro-
          catchments surveyed; riparian forest restoration, protection of water sources and access
          to information on the Forest Code were specifically mentioned as innovations;
         The COGEM was described as an instrument for environmental action and as stimulating
          environmental awareness and innovation;
         Future demands of farmers interviewed stressed sanitation, water quality and quantity,
          and garbage management. The project was seen as having notable impact in the latter via
          the separation of organic waste for composting and its subsequent use for fertilization.
          Septic tanks and sanitation systems were stressed for future programs/projects;
         Farmers in many micro-catchments had grasped the importance and urgency of the
          project’s environmental goals more broadly, while in others, farmers’ still-fragile
          engagement was evident;
         Farmers especially noted the increases in productivity and income generation stemming
          from Kits Galinha Caipira and the crop rotation investments; farmers were well aware of
          the relationship between the new practices adopted under Rio/GEF and their improved
          productive situation, e.g., drying equipment associated with coffee cultivation; pasture
          rotation and forage equipment associated with better milk production;
         Farmers saw the project as improving local conditions and promoting farmers’ decisions
          to remain in rural areas and not migrate; this was cited as needing more intensive
          action/additional projects to reverse the broader tendency to migrate.

Meetings with the COGEMs:

5.5       Social organization:

         Among the 25 municipalities where meetings were conducted with COGEMs, 64%
          related difficulties in organizing social groups including the total absence of local
          organizations such as associations and cooperatives. Only six municipalities had prior
          experience with such organizations and only four reported good farmer participation;


                                                   56
         Nine municipalities 36%), among those reporting previous failings, said there were now
          both associations and coops. Local social organization had increased with farmers
          participating and the COGEM was described as a motivating element; and,
         Some 14 municipalities (56%) stressed the need for strengthening of COGEMs and other
          forms of social organization, seen as intermediaries in securing new resources for the
          micro-catchments.

5.6       Technical assistance and rural extension (ATER):

         In 12 of the 25 municipalities (48%), ATER services had not existed prior to the project;
          at the time of the consultations with the COGEMs, such services were freely available in
          10 municipalities and still being established in the remainder.
         Some 36% of COGEMs reported no partnership arrangements prior to the Rio/GEF.
         Eight municipalities expressed lack of confidence in the grant-based nature of a
          Rio/GEF-type project, (presumably its sustainability in terms of ongoing resources or
          lack of understanding that it was a demonstration/pilot operation);
         There was a general sense that the quality and quantity of ATER had improved, and that
          more intensive services were needed, along with training;
         The project was seen as a mechanism for greater access to and intensification of ATER,
          directly linked to and the avenue to satisfying demand for continuation of environmental
          activities, greater organization of beneficiaries, their training, improved local productive
          activities and access to other projects and programs.

5.7       Subprojects: environmental and productive:

         About 40% of COGEMs stated that environmerntal awareness did not exist priot to the
          project. Many problems were cited: indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals and random
          disposal of containers; lack of garbage collection; poor or no sanitation and poor water
          quality/quantity;
         The project had increased environmental awareness in 84% of municipalities surveyed;
          36% noted better water quality, attributed to source protection activities; 68% favorably
          evaluated activities in re-forestation, soil conservation, use of organic fertilizer, reduced
          use of agro-chemicals, and activities to inculcate safe disposal of chemical containers.
          Municipalities noted the positive, motivating role of the COGEMs in these outcomes;
         88% of municipalities surveyed called for the continuation of environmental awareness-
          raising and SLM activities and for carrying through on the Community Conduct Statutes
          (ECC);
         Municipalities recalled past practices prejudicial to soil conservation, to sustaining small
          farmers on the land, to adequately feeding livestock and to dairy production;
         Some 56% of surveyed municipalities reported that diversification of production (Kit
          Galinha, Honey Kit, fish farming, seedling production, and fruit cultivation) as well as
          new techniques for fertilization, esterqueira and pasture rotation were associated with
          increased farmer incomes;
         The project’s role in introducing and intensifying the subject of the environment was
          acknowledged; via actual on-the-ground practices and through the promotion of
          environmental conservation; demand appeared strong for a continuation of such
          activities;




                                                  57
Conclusions

      Social organization, successful productive and environmental outcomes and access to
       technical assistance were the most noted achievements acknowledged by both
       beneficiaries and the COGEMs;
      The potential for scaling up these successful activity streams was widely confirmed.

A. Executive Summary of Borrower Completion Report (Informal Translation)


Project Description
7.1      The project “Integrated Management of Agro-ecosystems in the North-Northeast
Fluminense (Rio Rural/GEF)? was a demonstration effort and considered the water micro-
catchment as a the unit for planning, interventions and monitoring, stimulating the adoption n of
approaches to the Sustainable Management of Natural Resources (MSRN) and Integrated
Management of Eco-systems (MIE)42 in productive processes, with a view to integrating global
efforts to conserve critical eco-systems.
7.2    The project was developed by the State Secretariat for Agriculture and Livestock of Rio
de Janeiro (SEAPEC), through its Superintendency for Sustainable Development (SDS). The
World Bank was the implementing agency through Credit Agreement nº TF 054999 signed
between the World Bank and the Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro. According to the
PAD, the total projected investment was US$14.95 million, of which US$6.75 million financed
by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), US$6.31 million from the State Government, and
US$1.89 million from co-financiers. The project had four components and 10 subcomponents. It
became effective in late 2005 and closed at end-November 2011.
7.3     The central problems requiring solution, to which the project sought to contribute were:
land degradation, reduced availability and quality of water resources, and loss of biodiversity, the
consequence of deforestation of primary forest for charcoal production, expansion of family
agriculture and planting of extensive pastures. Associated with the degradation of eco-systems
was the impoverishment of the populations in the micro-catchments and consequent rural exodus.
7.4      The Project Development Objective (PDO) was “promote an integrated eco-system
management (IEM) approach to orientate the development and implementation of sustainable
natural resources management practices (MSRN) in the North and Northeast regions of the State
of Rio de Janeiro. The Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) were: (i) confront threats to
biodiversity of global importance; (ii) reverse soil degradation in agricultural landscapes; (iii)
increase carbon sequestration; and (iv) increase awareness at all levels regarding the adoption of
an IEM approach to natural resources management.
Methodology

7.5      The methodology is based on evidence from the concept and design of the project, its
implementation and effects, results and impacts, as set out in the Log Frame, and conducted in a
participatory manner, seeking to build a consensus concerning what was achieved and the lessons
learned. Specifically from the point of view of beneficiaries, the methodology was divided into
two parts: the first is developed based on field work conducted in January 2012 when interviews
were done with beneficiaries in eight selected micro-catchments; the second part is based on
material produced by the representatives of the COGEMs during municipal meetings of those
Councils in December 2011.

     Equivalent to Sustainable Land Management (SLM) and Integrated Eco-system Management (IEM) respectively.



                                                             60
7.6      The economic-financial and cost-effectiveness evaluation of the project’s environmental
impacts took the following methodological elements into account: (i) use of the Internal Rate of
Return (IRR) to evaluate economic results; (ii) use of the cost-effectiveness approach (GEF,
2005), to evaluate environmental impacts. Each subproject was considered as a case study and
some environmental impact results were extrapolated for all subprojects and the resources applied.
The evaluation considered the following types of subprojects: (i) Pasture Rotation, 6 subprojects;
(ii) Kit Galinha Caipira, 4 subprojects; (iii) Water Source Protection, 2 subprojects; and, (iv)
Honey Production, 4 subprojects, a total of 16 subprojects.
Project Implementation

7.7      Project implementation was influenced by various factors which affected the flow of
planned activities, some of which were under the control of the management team, of which the
following were notable: (i) initial difficulties provoked by delays in the release of counterpart
resources motivated in part by the fact that the project was initiated between one State
administration and another. The final and initial periods of governments are characterized by
scant budget resources, both on the part of the outgoing administration in its final year, and the
new administration which needs time to internalize the project and “adopt it? in its policy agenda
and financial priorities. Associated with this delay, the Bank’s release of GEF resources only
occurred one year after project effectiveness; (ii) the US$/Real relationship was unfavorable by
around 40% during project execution, prejudicing the achievement of targets initially proposed;
(iii) some targets were very ambitious and the absence of procedures to revise them during
implementation influenced what was actually achieved; (iv) other factors such as methodological
innovation, complexity of the institutional structure/framework and delayed internalization of the
project both at the local and institutional levels and even the time needed to prepare project
execution teams also influenced to varying levels the implementation of distinct components of
the project. Even when these initial difficulties had been overcome and the project was launched,
the period remaining, including the extension phase, was too short to consolidate all the expected
results both from the perspective of innovative mechanisms as well as results and impacts at the
micro-catchment level (MIE/MSRN).
Monitoring and Evaluation System

7.8      Complete monitoring: The monitoring and evaluation system was implemented in a
complete form (including technical, environmental and socio-economic indicators) in three
micro-catchments representative of the project regions, and in a participatory form in all micro-
catchments benefited. It generated important results, noting in particular, the monitoring of
biodiversity where the best results occurred such as: (i) monitoring of pollinizing species
(especially bees and wasps); (ii) importance of the presence of forest remnants associated with
pollinizing species (bees and wasps); (iii) identification and study of forest re-birth in the
monitored micro-catchments and their importance for biodiversity preservation; (iv) production
of brochures on flora and biodiversity in monitored micro-catchments, for public dissemination;
and (v) publication of documents and studies and participation in events to divulge project results
and biodiversity monitoring. However, some deficiencies needed to be overcome, especially in
cost-benefit information, greater participation of beneficiaries and greater and more rapid
feedback of information to the micro-catchments. These aspects led to an evaluation of complete
M&E as Moderately Satisfactory, according to GEF criteria.
7.9      Participatory monitoring: Parallel to complete monitoring a system of participatory
monitoring was designed to be implemented in all project micro-catchments. This was designed
so that the actors directly involved in the project at the local level (beneficiaries, COGEM and
technical executors) could supervise/accompany project results of subprojects through quasi-

                                                61
quantitative environmental and socio-economic indicators, and simple data collection tools. In
contrast to complete monitoring, which proved to be high cost and low return of information
especially for soil and water, participatory monitoring demonstrated itself as a highly useful tool.
The information generated permitted the detection of important subproject results which were
fundamental to give sustainability to cost-effectiveness evaluation of environmental impacts of
the project and economic results, such as: (i) soil quality; (ii) availability of areas for biodiversity
conservation associated with pasture rotation; (iii) availability of water associated with water
source protection subprojects; and, (iv) milk/dairy production. Aspects to be improved in
participatory monitoring relate to the need for greater dissemination and use of information
generated to motivate and mobilize residents of micro-catchments.
Project Results

7.10     In many aspects, the project was unique in the regions where it was operational, most
notably in the following: (i) the process of planning and intervention in water micro-catchments;
(ii) establishment of a local management structure (COGEM), providing empowerment and
introducing transparency; (iii) establishing innovative mechanisms such as incubators, telecentros
and other; (iv) integrated actions with environmental entities, NGOs and partners of SDS which
contributed to the creation of the PSA decree.

7.11     Apart from the creation of the law in question, there was continuity in the discussion
which resulted in contributions to the State Climate Change Plan. This initiative is a lead in to
the Rio + 20 which will occur in June 2012. In addition, there is an effort to make sure that good
agricultural practices can be linked by the Project Executive Secretary to the mitigation of the
effects of climatic change.

7.12     In this vein, a partnership was signed in 2009 between the Committee for Sao Joao Lagos
Committee and the Rio-Rural Program, resulting in the implementation of the Fund for Socio-
environmental Best Practice (FUNBOAS). FUNBOAS, created by Committee in 2007, is a
mechanism for remunerating farmers who contribute to the conservation of the regional
environment. A large part of the funds resources are derived from charges for water usage in the
municipalities of the Lagos Region and the objective is to gain the commitment of rural producers,
managers and other social actors with conservation and sustainability policies. Since its creation,
the Good Practices Fund has ransferred R$60,000 to 25 collective projects and six individual,
using the methodology of planning, mapping and selection criteria of the Rio Rural Program. The
projects are included in the PIDs (Individual Development Plans) and the PEMs (Micro-
catchment Development Plans). Activities incentivated by the Fund include rural sanitation, local
road repairs, agro-forestry systems, protection of water sources and riparian forests, pasture
rotation, coffee processing and the fencing of Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs). For the
implementation of individual projects, farmers receive R$5,000 and technical assistance.

7.13     Throughout the project’s development, as results were emerging, important local
initiatives were being developed/coming on stream within the institutional/government sphere,
derived from project results and demands, of which the following are noted: (i) establishment of
Special Nature Protection Reserves (RPPN) in the Municipality of Varre-Sai; (ii) adoption of
GEF criteria in Catchment Committees. At least one committee is supporting activities in a
micro-catchment in its area, replicating the project methodology; (iii) more dynamic municipal
councils with new roles; (iv) creation of the PSA Decree incorporating project experiences; (v)
training of COGEMs enabled improvements in formal micro-catchment associations (leadership
renewal), and administrative overhaul; and (vi) through the incubator methodology, structured
business groups were established.

7.14     Within the institutional sphere, EMATER held a public bidding to assign new technicians
to the project. It was found, during interviews with technicians when the case studies were being
prepared, that there had been change in the perception in relation to planning and the manner for
conducting rural extension activities in communities. There was more proactive activity using the
project methodology. Still in the institutional area, the project promoted the incorporation of
participatory research into PESAGRO’s routines, improving EMATER’s technical assistance
strategy for community organizations through the creation of IRS. The activities of public and
private institutions, government and non-government, in promoting sustainable development of
rural areas were improved (DPGE, INEA, CI, SOS Mata Atlântica, Secretariat for Health,
Secretariat of Education, etc.).

7.15     Among the main impacts and positive aspects of the project, the following are noted: (i)
improved governance from the integration of multi-sector institutions (health, education,
environment, DPGE) and by strengthening local organizations (municipal councils, associations,
COGEMs, etc.); (ii) self-management of natural resources – increase in the perception of farmers,
women and young people for local, regional and global environmental problems, and of the
adoption of integrated management practices (IEM and SLM) in productive systems; (iii)
technological innovation – micro-catchment simulation – supporting decision-making for
sustainability; (iv) financial sustainability – leveraging of public and private resources and design
of a system for financial sustainability; (v) inclusion of biodiversity conservation in the agenda of
services provided by farmers/productive units and integration of project activities in the State
PSA Program; (vi) contribution to reducing threats to biodiversity of global importance through
the generation and dissemination of knowledge about the Atlantic Forest of the North-Northwest
Fluminense and environmental services provided by the project to productive systems; (vii)
participatory construction of commitments assumed collectively by rural communities adopting
the micro-catchment and not rural properties as the best and most balanced mechanism for
environmental conservation/management (ECC); (viii) potential for integration of conservation
activities in carbon markets; and, (ix) insertion in/integration with public policies.
Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives (GEO)

7.16     The achievement of the Global Environmental Objectives (GEO) and project
Development Objectives (PDO) was satisfactory, even though some targets associated with these
were not fully achieved, due to the factors noted earlier which influenced project implementation.
In regard to the Key Indicators associated with the project objectives, there was an achievement
level averaging 104%; in 47% of the indicators, the achievement exceeded 100%. The erosion
reduction indicator (besides being over-dimensioned) was not monitored in subprojects associated
specifically with soil conservation practices, where there was assuredly a reduction in erosion
especially associated with the construction of rainwater capture facilities and surrounding canals,
based on reports by farmers visited (and especially in coffee fields). The target related to
implementation of sustainable, biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices which improved the
stability of the soil structure were partially reached, in part because they were over-dimensioned
in relation to the resources available to support such activities, and due to the demonstration
nature of the project.
7.17     The following results related directly with project objectives, should be noted: (i)
biodiversity conservation generating knowledge which was disseminated and supported the
implementation of concrete activitiespromoting the IEM approach through the adoption of
sustainable practices in rural areas, generating environmental services, conservation of small
forest fragments, among others; (ii) recuperation of water resource recharge and riparian forest
areas, and water source protection, with positive impacts on water resources; (iii) adoption of a
management system which led to improved soil quality – physically, chemically and biologically

                                                 63
and to carbon storage; and, (iv) improved income and quality of life of micro-catchment residents
beneficiting from the project.
Results by Component

7.18     Considering the resources programmed by the PAD, Component 1 applied 142.31% of
the resources projected and reached on average 80% of programmed targets. Component 2
applied 101.52% of programmed resources and reached an average 86% of its expected physical
targets. Component 3 applied 62.02% of expected resources and reached an average 131% of
targets, while Component 4 applied 119.69% of resources and reached an average 125% of
targets. Execution between components was heterogeneous, however, reallocation of resources
and adjustments to activities permitted optimal use of resources and balanced expenditures.
7.19    Results of the components were reached in a differentiated manner, having been
influenced at different levels by the factors affecting implementation; thus, components
dependent on external resources (credit) had greater difficulty in achieveing their targets due to
the unfavorable US$/Real relationship. The failure to review targets also affected results to
different extents.
Partnership Strategy

7.20     To strengthen the project’s institutional platform/base, partnerships were established at
the municipal, state, federal and international levels, with governmental and non-governmental,
multi-sector agencies such as: EMATER, PESAGRO, State Secretariats of Health, Environment,
Education and Economic Development, Public Defender’s Office, the State Center for Data
Processing, municipal Secretariats of Agriculture and Environment, EMBRAPA, INEA, Water
Catchment Committees, producer associations, cooperatives and NGOs. Worth noting is the
innovative partnership with international environmental NGOs. This initiative promoted
improvement in conservation strategies and the more efficient application of resources and
scientific knowledge to effect conservationist activities in private areas.
7.21     Even within a complex institutional environment, with limited experience of the project
methodology and bearing in mind the pilot character of this initiative in the regions of
intervention, the management team adequately led the process, conducting an ever-improving
institutional integration and with other initiatives and programs to be continued under the Rio
Rural/BIRD. Even so, the lessons learned from this and other projects indicate the need to
establish agreements and responsibilities of each partner institution as early as the design stage
and preparation stage of the project, including specific targets and resources.
Beneficiaries’ Evaluation of the Project
7.22     From visits and direct interviews with beneficiaries: (i) in the total micro-catchments
studied, references were made to three dimensions within which the project would be acting:
social organization, environmental and productive; (ii) from all interviews conducted, it can be
said that the Rio Rural/GEF is considered by interviewees as an instrument for intervention in the
environment; (iii) apart from the panorama encountered, the activities of Rio Rural/GEF can be
considered as, similar to social organization, promoters of the urgency of the environmental
theme in the micro-catchments, due mainly to the association between the project and the micro-
catchments; (iv) the Rio Rural/GEF project was noted as an instrument of intervention capable of
promoting improvement in local consitions, considering its environmental and productive
activities, which would stimulate the permanence of the farmer in his rural setting.
7.23   In regard to the results of municipal evaluations of COGEM members: (i) the Rio
Rural/GEF project can be considered as a mechanism for accessing and intensifying technical


                                               64
assistance, this directly linked and one of the possible pathways to carry out the demands
presented, such as: continuity and intensification of environmental activities, increased
organization of farmers, their training, improved local productive activities and access to other
projects, programs and public policies, as well as the continuity of Rio Rural/BIRD; (ii) in regard
to the present situation with the Rio Rural/GEF, the increased environmental awareneness was
evident in 21 municipalities (84% of the total surveyed); (iii) for the future, 22 municipalities
(88% of the total surveyed) expect/hope for continuity of environmental awareness-building and
sound use of natural resources, and asked for more activities of an environmental character; (iv)
references to the results of productive activities were made in meetings with the COGEMs,
through their association with increased income of beneficiary farmers.
Economic-Financial Evaluation and Cost-effectiveness of Environmental Impacts

7.24      From this evaluation it was concluded that, based on the subprojects analyzed by the four
case studies, the economic results and positive environmental I mpacts are consistent with the
initial project hypothesis.
7.25     In regard to the economic results, one notes the contribution made by the subprojects to
the direct, sustainable improvement in income (from increased productivity with low costs), and
indirectly from the opportunity cost and cost-effectiveness of environmental impacts. In regard to
the positive environmental impacts, one notes the important contribution to preservation of
biodiversity, from the regeneration of native forest associated with the environmentaql projects
(as in the case of protection of springs) and indirectly through the release of area for biodiversity
preservation associated with productive subprojects, as in the case of pasture rotation. One can
also observe other important environmental results such as improved soil quality from increased
organic matter and nutrients such as phosphorus and potassium, storage of carbon and increased
availability and quality of water.
Performance of the World Bank and Counterpart

7.26     The performance of the World Bank during preparation and appraisal of the project was
Satisfactory, despite changes in project management. The supervision process of the Bank was
satisfactory. Ten supervision missions were conducted over the five years of project execution
and in the period of project extension. Interventions by the supervision team at times and on
themes crucial to project execution were opportune.
7.27     The performance of the State Government was considered satisfactory, because there was
political will to support the preparation and implementation of the project. Even with the election-
derived changes of government, the project management team (SEP and SER) was maintained,
which was fundamental to the project’s not suffering any loss of continuity and changes to its
basic path.
7.28     Project management, through its structure was satisfactory and achieved its goals within
its established responsibilities, leading to timely actions and driving the project to its completion.
Maintenance of the same team throughout the project was a positive factor which contributed to a
permanent flow of activities. Another notable factor in the activity of SEP was the establishment
of management centers (nucleos) responsible for the large project themes, facilitating supervision
and guiding the execution teams.
7.29    The performance of executing institutions was also satisfactory with the actions of
EMATER and PESAGRO fundamental to the results obtained by the project due to their
evolution throughout project execution and their ability to overcome institutional difficulties in
terms of the availability of technical personnel and institutional structure.


                                                 65
Financial Execution

7.30     Based on PAD data (2005), for its execution the Rio Rural/GEF project had US$6.75
million of GEF resources and US$6.31 million in State Government counterpart. These resources
were distributed among the components and subcomponents and categories of expenditure. Some
98% of total available resources were applied to the project, demonstrating the project’s ability to
overcome problems encountered in the initial phase of the project, since up to 2008 only 25% of
project resources had been used. The qualification of mechanisms of supervision and control
over project activities and adjustments to technical and administrative procedures, aligned with
political will, permitted the project to overcome difficulties in aligning and making compatible
State structures and procedures with those of the Bank. Extension of the project for one year,
besides contributing to achieving most project targets and project objectives, permitted the
project’s financial performance to improve.
7.31   The State Government counterpart resources projected by the PAD at appraisal were
around US$6.31 million. During project execution some US$8.43 million, reflecting the
importance of the project to the State Government.
7.32    In regard to execution by component, considering the resources programmed in the PAD,
Component 1 applied 142.31%; Component 2 101.52%; Component 3 62.02%; and Component 4
119.69%. Execution among components was heterogeneous but, as noted above, reallocation of
resources and adjustments to activities permitted optimal use of project resources and balanced
expenditures.
7.33      The value of co-financing foreseen by the PAD was US$ 1.89 million, provided from
diverse sources. In practice, co-financing resources amounted to approximately US$3.0 million.
It should be noted that at the time of preparation of this report, a portion of these resources was
still being applied to project activities. Exceeding by 59% the co-financing initially programmed,
demonstrates the great capacity of the project to leverage resources, its replicability and
efficiency in integrating with other initiatives and state and federal public policies, contributing to
greater financial sustainability.
Lessons Learned

7.34    From the lessons learned, the following should be noted:
(i) The fundamental need to plan for the guaranteed provision of counterpart resources and their
release in a continuous/smooth and timely manner to permit the implementation of diverse
activities;
(ii) The need to seek greater synchronization between the time expended in State administrative
routines with that of the agricultural calendar, because delayed relaease of resources, which may
be tolerable for non-agricultural activities, can in the case of agricultural activities mean the loss
of a whole year due to the seasonality of production cycles;
(iii) The use of methodologies which favor participation, such as the DRP, is of fundamental
importance for the identification, discussion and prioritization of problems and demands
guaranteeing in this way greater permanence in the adoption of the practices implemented;
(iv) During the planning and design stage of the project, there needs to be adequate time to define
in a realistic manner, the targets, schedules and periods, providing greater implementation
efficiency and avoiding exhaustion and loss of interest;
(v) The system of monitoring and evaluation is an integral part of the project’s day to day
operations and as such should generate, in a participatory manner, the information for timely
decision-making to facilitate management and to support local planning, cost-effectively. Neste

sentido o monitoramento participativo foi um importante aprendizado do projeto a ser
incorporado no Rio Rural/BIRD;
(vi) The motivational role, more than executive, the use of methodologies which favor
participation, the pre-eminence of the project’s technical strategy and consistency with project
objectives are indispensable attributes for greater success of technical assistance and rural
extension.
