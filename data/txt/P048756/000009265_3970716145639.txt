Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project seeks to prepare selected infrastructure sectors - ports, power, telecommunications, highways and the postal
service - for privatization and concessioning, within a sound legal and regulatory framework. Achieving this obje -tive will
contribute to the Government's goals of improving the efficiency of infrastructure service provision and widening service
coverage. To accomplish this objective, the project will provide technical assistance to draw up regulations for existing
sectoral legislation and develop new legislation where required; strengthen regulatory agencies and sectoral ministries
charged with overseeing the infrastructure sectors listed above; restructure and prepare for privatization entities within these
sectors; and strengthen the ability of the Government to manage and implement the program of privatization and
concessi innM    the infrastructure sector.

3. Benefits and target population:
If the outputs of the project are correctly utilized and implemented, then the major benefits from the project would be: (i)
improved operating efficiency of entities providing infrastructure services, and the introduction of competition where
practicable; and (ii) the attraction of private sector capital to fund expansion of service provision, and improvements in
quality of service, above and beyond that which could be provided by public sector resources. Successful implementation
would benefit persons who directly receive infrastructure services, and the wider economy, through better service provision
and increased coverage.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 1997-2001
Executing agency
Office of the Commissioner for Modernization of the Executive Branch (OCMEB). During 1996 the new Govermnent
began a broad program of public sector modernization, encompassing privatization and concessioning of infrastructure
services and reform of public administration, among other aspects. The broad range of the program being undertaken
convinced the Government that a coordinating mechanism was needed to assist in deciding the timing of privatizations and
concessioning, provide financial and technical support and to facilitate cross-fertilization between sectors. In addition, it
was recognized that support needed to be developed for the concept of increased private sector participation in the provision
of infrastructure services, both within the Congress and the wider public. Therefore, in November 1996 a Governmental
Accord (No. 493-96) was issued establishing the Commissioner for Modernization of the Executive Branch. The role of the
Commissioner is to implement policies and strategies both for increasing private participation in infrastructure and for
public administration modernization and coordinate support from donor agencies and other sources of financial aid for the
programs. The Commissioner reports directly to the Vice-President of the Republic. A separate Governmental Accord (No.
494-96) establishes a Committee for Modernization of the Executive Branch, chaired by the Vice-President and consisting
of the Ministers who chair the major cabinet committees. This committee is advisory in nature, and provides guidance to
the Commissioner and sets the broad policy objectives governing the program.
Project coordination:
OCMEB. In terms of implementation, a series of privatization committees (Comit6s Especificos de Desincorporaci6n -
CEDEs) are being established which will coordinate the technical work in each sector, headed up by a sector coordinator.
These report to the Commissioner, who will take the main decisions based upon their work. The CEDEs will serve as the
basis for coordination with the sectoral Ministries and line agencies. For example, the CEDE in charge of ports
privatization will include, as representatives, the managers of the ports of Santo Tomas de Castilla and Quetzal, but will be
headed by a sector coordinator picked by the Commissioner and who forms part of his staff. This structure is designed to
preserve the current level of participation from each sector, but allow the Commissioner to exercise the overall coordination
function. The Project Implementation Plan (PIP), which has been appraised by the Bank and found satisfactory, describes in
more detail the structure of the executing agency.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements:
Project accounts will be maintained by OCMEB. It will maintain records and accounts which reflect, in accordance with
standard accounting practices, the operations, resources and expenditures for each project activity. The accounts will be
consolidated annually to provide a single financial statement for the project as a whole, with supporting documentation
being made available to Bank missions and independent auditors as required. For expenditures incurred on the basis of
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs), all records evidencing such information must be retained by OCMEB until at least one
year after the Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account is
made. Project records and accounts, including the SOEs, will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate
accounting principles consistently applied by auditors acceptable to the Bank, with tenns of reference for auditors and
reports approved by the Bank. The Bank's Financial Accounting, Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH) published
in January 1995 would be used by the auditors in accordance with the Bank's existing guidelines. Audit reports will be
furnished to the Bank within four months after close of the Government's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangL.nents:
Monitoring of project implementation will be undertaken by the OCMEB, in its capacity as coordinator of the privatization
program. Success in achieving the benefits described in Section 3 above will be monitored by responsible agencies in the
sector such as the regulatory agencies, as well as line ministries e.g. MEM, MCTPW. The Bank will participate in
monitoring project implementation through supervision missions. Starting on July 1, 1997, OCMEB will provide to the
Bank an annual plan of work. In addition, OCMEB will provide to the Bank twice yearly reviews of progress over the past
six months, commencing January 31, 1997. Annual reviews of the project will commence February 28, 1998.

5. CAS objective(s) supported by the    Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 1445 1-GU,
project                                   May 30, 1995
The CAS stresses the need to improve the efficiency of public service provision, as well as to increase the coverage of basic
infrastructure services, and the need to involve the private sector in the provision of these services. The proposed project
would assist in attracting private sector capital to expand service coverage, and private sector expertise to improve the
efficiency of service delivery. In addition, it would help establish market structures where competition could develop (in
sectors where this is feasible) and strengthen regulatory bodies charged with overseeing these sectors.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Power Sector: In the power sector, the percentage of the population with access to electricity is only 41%, the lowest in
Central America. Both INDE and EEGSA are in a poor financial position, due to the Government's inability to increase
tariffs in the recent past (see below). EEGSA has therefore accumulated debts of over US$ 100 million to its main supplier,
INDE, and INDE itself also faces liquidity problems and is in arrears to the Government, mostly as a result of EEGSA's
inability to pay INDE for electricity received. As a result, there is little public financing available for an electricity
investment program. Labor productivity in the sector is low: INDE's customer-to-employee ratio, at approximately 80, is
half that of other power utilities in Central America. At present, there are over 400 MW of privately financed power plant
in operation in Guatemala, selling to the state-owned distribution company, EEGSA, which serves the greater Guatemala
City Metropolitan Area as well as to INDE.
Congress approved legislation to reform the power sector on October 16, 1996. This law built on earlier Bank support for
power sector reform under the now closed Economic Modernization Loan (3533-GT). It: (i) creates a new regulatory body
for the sector (the Comisi6n Nacional de Energia Electrica, CNEE), thus separating the regulatory from the policy roles
(the latter remaining with the MEM); (ii) requires the unbundling of vertically-integrated companies into the separate
activities of generation, transmission and distribution; (iii) determines which tariffs are to be regulated, establishes the broad
principles by which this will be done and gives the CNEE the duty of fixing tariffs; (iv) establishes the principle of equal
access to transmission and distribution grids; and (v) creates a wholesale market. Although for legislative reasons, the
CNEE is established as a dependency of the MEM its members are selected by the President from lists proposed by three
different groups, it sets its own budget and has its own source of income (a levy on retail sales). The CNEE is expected to
be established by mid-April 1997, and has to issue its first ruling on tariffs by May 15, 1997. Over the recent past, the
Government has repeatedly been blocked by the Constitutional Court in its attempts to increase power tariffs, on the
grounds that the correct procedures for setting prices were not being followed. The new legislation, which clearly vests the
power to set tariffs with the CNEE and sets out the procedures to be followed should make it possible to survive any future
constitutional challenges.
Ports Sector: In the ports sector, productivity in Guatemala is estimated to be 50% of international standards. Puerto
Santo Tomas de Castilla, the main port on the Atlantic coast, in particular suffers from overmanning, with a labor
productivity only half of that of Puerto Quetzal (the main port on the Pacific coast, which is of comparable size to Santo
Tomas). In addition, operations at Santo Tomas de Castilla have been affected by inadequate levels of maintenance of
equipment and corresponding low availability of equipment. Operations at the other major port, Barrios, are operated by the
private sector under a 25 year contract, while at Puerto Quetzal, some services are also provided by the private sector. In
September 1996 the Government dismissed the boards at Quetzal and Santo Tomas de Castilla and replaced them with
administrators chosen by the Minister for Communications. This action has improved management at the ports and has
helped to initiate the process of concessioning.
Telecommunications Sector: All telecommunications services in Guatemala, with the exception of cellular services, are
supplied by GUATEL, a state-owned enterprise. Guatemala has only 350,000 lines in operation for a population of over
10 million, one of the lowest densities in Latin America. It also has a poor employee to line ratio, which at over 20 is
substantially higher than the average in Latin America. The quality of service is low with call completion rates of only 37%.
Tariffs were recently rebalanced, with a six-fold reduction in intemational calls and a corresponding increase in local calls.

Legislation was passed on October 17, 1996 establishing a regulatory agency (Superintendency for Telecommunicacions, or
SIT) and setting out the framework and the principles by which interconnection and services will be regulated. The SIT is
already functioning and has approximately 30 staff. As with the CNEE, it has budgetary autonomy, although the
Superintendent of SIT enjoys somewhat less functional autonomy from the Minister of MCTPW than does his CNEE
counterpart. To some extent this reduction in autonomy is offset by the relatively detailed provisions in the law which limit
the amount of discretion that can be exercised by the regulator and hence by the MCTPW seeking to influence the
regulator's decisions.
Posts: The postal entity, DGCT, also suffers from overstaffing, and is in an extremely weak financial position, with losses
estimated at US$1 million over the first half of 1997. Guatemalans lack a reliable postal service; to obtain delivery private
couriers are used. Some of the smaller couriers make use of the DGCT's facilities and staff on an informal basis.
Roads: The Government is planning a major expansion in public investment in the roads network, in part to improve rural
infrastructure in line with obligations under the Peace Accords. The Government is seeking to use private finance to expand
the main highways network on routes which are currently congested and would represent an attractive financial proposition
for private developers; the use of private funds will reduce the burden on public resources for investment in roads.
Government Strategy: The Government has recognized that to accelerate the pace of economic growt, and to spread the
benefits of this growth, it will be necessary to improve the quality of infrastructure service provision and to widen the
coverage of these services. It therefore has an over-arching strategy for the infrastructure sectors of introducing private
sector management and ownership wherever possible, introducing competition in service provision where this is feasible,
and transforming the Government's role from one of service provider to one of regulator and policy-maker. In addition to
the sectors mentioned above, the Government is in the process of reforming the civil aviation sector, with a view to
increasing private sector participation. Its initiatives in infrastructure are part of a wider program of reform, which
encompasses modernization of the public sector (including tax, customs and public administration reform) as well as reform
of the hydrocarbons sector and the promotion of foreign investment in Guatemala.
The Government's Legislative Strategy
To enact its reform program, the Government has embarked upon an ambitious legislative program. The existing legal
framework allows the concessioning of activities and the contracting out of services by both the central government and the
autonomous public entities. Specifically, the Ley de Contrataciones governs, inter alia, the concessioning of activities and
the contracting out of services by the public sector. On March 5, 1997, Congress approved an amendment to this law that
pennits, inter alia, the sale of shares of autonomous public sector entities such as GUATEL. Since GUATEL's organic law
does not establish the framework to sell its shares, the Ley de Contrataciones was amended to govern this process in a
supplementary fashion. Under Guatemalan law, legislation which creates or dissolves an autonomous Government agency
requires a two-thirds majority in the Congress. The Government's legal strategy has been designed to allow it to achieve its
objectives whilst using legislation that requires only a simple majority for approval by the Assembly, because the ruling
party is presently able to muster only a simple majority. The Telecommunications Law and the Electricity Law were
designed to be passed by a simple majority. Due to the nature of the law, the amendment to the Ley de Contrataciones was
also passed with a simple majority. The Bank has been informed by local counsel that it is likely that opponents of the
privatization of GUATEL will file a constitutional challenge to the use of the Ley de Contrataciones to sell shares in
GUATEL on the grounds that since it is modifying GUATEL's organic law, such a modification needs a two thirds
majority for approval in Congress. Although local counsel has informed the Bank that the Government's legal strategy
towards the privatization of GUATEL has a strong basis in law, there exists nonetheless a possibility that the Constitutional
Court could rule that the use of the Ley de Contrataciones for such a purpose is unconstitutional. If this were to occur, then
the Government's plan would be to continue to open up the telecommunications market to competition, via the
implementation of the recently-passed telecommunications law. The technical assistance to be provided under the proposed
loan would play an important part role in helping establish an open telecommunications market in Guatemala. The contract
for the investment bank to assist in the preparation of GUATEL for its privatization is being financed by the Borrower.

Country: Guatemala                                       Project Title: Prvate Participation in Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan
In the power sector, there exists a legal framework to undertake the bulk of the work envisaged under the proposed loan. In
particular: (i) the privatization of EEGSA does not require any additional legislation, because it is a sociedad anonima in
which the Government owns 93% of the shares, and it is in fact proceeding at present with the sale of its two thermal power
stations; and (ii) the establishment of the CNEE and the implementation of the wholesale market are permitted under the
new sector legislation. However, local counsel has advised the Bank that although it may be possible to use the amended
Ley de Contrataciones for the restructuring of INDE, additional legislation may be needed. Therefore the part of the
Bank's loan related to the preparation of INDE for its restructuring (costing approximately US$200,000) would not be
disbursed until the Borrower has demonstrated to the Bank that there exists a satisfactory legal framework to carry out this
restructuring.
It is expected that the new electricity sector legislation will allow the Government to increase electricity tariffs, and
overcome the legal impediments to price increases that have occurred in the past in Guatemala. In the absence of a tariff
increase, it would be difficult to privatize EEGSA, and it could also be argued that if the Government is unable to place the
sector on a sustainable financial footing, there would be little point in developing the wholesale market and strengthening the
regulatory agency. In the event that there were successful legal challenges to the tariffs proposed by the CNEE, then the
Government would review whether there were alternative ways of overcoming these, given the existing legal framework and
any feasible modifications. In this instance, the Bank and the Government would also review the power sector component of
the project and take whatever action is necessary.
Since at present the Government's party seems relatively disciplined and cohesive, the Government is confident that
legislation requiring a simple majority can be readily approved by the Congress. Establishment of the regulatory entities for
the posts and ports sectors would only require a simple majority. As with the power and telecommunications regulators,
such entities would be established as dependencies of line ministries and, therefore, might to some extent enjoy less
autonomy than would have been the case had they been established as truly autonomous entities with a two-thirds majority.
Nonetheless, with a sufficiently clear definition of budgetary sources, regulatory discretion and appointment and dismissal
of regulators, a satisfactory regulatory framework could be established working within the Government's legislative
constraints.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strtegic choices:
The main strategic choice made by the Government is that to address the problems of efficiency of service provision and
coverage identified in Section 6, it wishes to make use where possible of private sector expertise in management and of
private sector funds for investment in service expansion. Its goal is therefore to establish in these sectors a legal and
regulatory framework that will encourage private sector participation. In the case of the telecommunications and power
sectors, the Government has established the legal framework; its task is now to implement this. In others, such as ports,
civil aviation and posts, the Government is embarking upon the process of developing such a framework. Given the
magnitude of the Government's reform program, it is seeking assistance from donors not just in terms of policy advice but
also in financing the cost of the technical assistance required.
The proposed project will therefore assist in the following areas: (i) preparation of entities for privatization and
concessioning in the power sector (EEGSA), ports sector (ports of Santo Tomas de Castilla and Quetzal),
telecommunications (GUATEL), and posts (DGCT); (ii) identification of viable opportunities for concessioning the
construction (and maintenance) of new highways; (iii) restructuring of INDE; (iv) providing training and equipment to
strengthen the regulatory agencies in the power, ports, telecommunications and postal sectors; (v) developing new sector
legislation where required and produce the secondary legislation and regulations for existing sector legislation; and (vi)
strengthening the ability of the Government, through the executing agency, to manage and implement the program of
privatization and concessioning.
Other elements of the reform program will be assisted by separate operations - provided by other donors, in the case of IDB
which is developing a project to assist in reform of the civil aviation and hydrocarbons sectors and to promote foreign
inward investment in Guatemala, or by other operations under preparation by the Bank (see Section 9).

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
Initially, the Government considered an umbrella TA loan from the Bank, which would have covered aspects of public
sector modernization, tax reform and infrastructure privatization. Both the Bank and the Government subsequently decided
that this would be difficult to manage and implement, and therefore the project was unbundled into separate operations, of
which the proposed operation is the first.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Past experience with privatization and restructuring of infrastructure shows the importance of winning the support of the
legislative body and the public in general. Therefore, the coordination component of the project will play a vital role in: (i)
building a consensus on the need for infrastructure reform; and (ii) ensuring consistent and transparent treatment of
concessioning and privatization. As elsewhere, experience in Guatemala also shows the need to reduce the opposition of the
trade unions and affected workers through: (i) participation in share offerings; and (ii) the provision of satisfactory
severance payments.
The main lessons from countries which have successfully implemented major privatization programs, such as Bolivia, Peru
and Argentina are that: (i) the process needs to be directed by a single unit, and there needs to be close coordination of
efforts across sectors, to ensure that there is proper sequencing of privatization initiatives and that there is cross-sectoral
learning in privatization efforts; (ii) there need to be transparent mechanisms for the award of bids; and (iii) there need to be
clearly defined legal and regulatory frameworks for each sector.
More generally, successful Bank technical assistance projects require: (i) strong Government commitment to, and ownership
of, the project; (ii) adequate preparation, including preparation of terms of reference up-front; and (iii) very close
supervision during implementation. The Government's commitment to the program of private sector participation in
infrastructure appears strong (see Section 11). Terms of reference for work to be undertaken during the initial phase of the
project have been drawn up and are part of the Project Implementation Plan. In addition, experience with TA projects in the
field of infrastructure privatization and regulation shows that there is a need for flexibility in project design to provide the

Government with resources to deal with unanticipated issues that arise during the execution of the privatization program.
The cross-sectoral component of this loan includes an allocation of funds to pertit this.
Finally, recent Bank experience in Guatemala has also underscored the necessity to have a clear understanding of the
existing legal framework in the sectors in which the Bank is working, as well as an appreciation of legal risks (a recent case
being the difficulties encountered in increasing electricity tariffs in Guatemala, see Section 6). An independent legal opinion
was contracted by the Bank to obtain an understanding of the existing legal framework relating to infrastructure in
Guatemala at present, and the feasibility of the proposed project objectives (see Section 6 and the assessment of risks noted
in Sections 21 and 22).
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The strength of the Government's comnmitment to increasing private participation in the infrastructure sectors is shown by:
(a) recent actions taken to improve management and speed up the process of concessioning in the ports; (b) the recent
passage by the Assembly of legislation to provide a legal and regulatory framework for the power and telecommunications
sectors and the passage of the amendment to the Ley de Contrataciones; and (c) the initiative, under the office of the Vice-
President, of modernization of the Executive Branch. A Comnmissioner was appointed to oversee this work in a Presidential
Decree issued November 28, 1996 (see Section 4). The breadth of commitment throughout the Government is extensive,
including the line Ministries, in addition to the group established under the Vice Presidency, as well as the heads of
GUATEL, EEGSA and NDE.
12. Value added of Bank support: The Government of Guatemala values the Bank's worldwide experience in
infrastructure privatization and modernization, not only in terms of the sector-specific issues, but also on the overall
coordination of such programs. The Bank's presence also lends international credibility to the transparency of the process,
which may lead to greater competition in bids, and better bid packages.

Fiscal impact
The project is expected to have a substantial, positive, fiscal impact, with the proceeds from privatization and concessioning
to be used for the reduction of domestic debt and for social investment in line with the Government's obligations under the
Peace Accords.
Benefits from debt write-down: The Government has indicated that in the order of 50% of the proceeds from the sale of
GUATEL and EEGSA will be used to write down domestic debt. Although at this stage there are no precise estimates of the
revenues to be expected from the sale of these two companies, or from the concessioning of Puerto Santo Tomas de Castilla,
it is estimated that receipts could be as much as US$700 million. This figure will of course vary depending upon the final
arrangements for concessioning and ultimately the market's valuation of the companies. On a conservative assumption that
US$250 million of privatization proceeds are used to write down domestic debt in 1997 and 1998, then the Government
would save over US$150 million through reduced interest payments.
Benefits from using privatization proceeds for social investment: Guatemala is a country with large unmet social needs,
and the recent signing of the Peace Accords gives the present Government even greater impetus to address these needs.
Investment requirements to meet these needs are estimated to be in the order of US$2.4 bilion to the year 2000, of which
approximately US$1.1 billion is to be provided by the Guatemalan Government as counterpart funds. Assuming, therefore,
that US$250 million of privatization proceeds are used for debt write-down, then the Government may be able to use as
much as US$400 million, the remainder of the proceeds, to contribute towards the investment program. This would
represent one third of the required funds and would mean that the Govermment is in a much stronger position to provide
counterpart funds to match those provided by other donors, including the World Bank. It should also be noted that, if the
Government did not have available the US$400 million from privatization proceeds but instead had to finance this through
borrowing on standard terms for US dollar commercial loans available to Guatemala, it would have to pay around US$140
million in interest rate payments on this amount.

As part of the privatization and concessioning program, some reduction in work-force will be required. It is estimated that
the cost of the severance payments may reach as high as US$40 miffion, of which at least half would be required for
GUATEL. Although these payments represent a negative fiscal impact, they are not large relative to the expected
privatization proceeds. The reduction in transfers from surplus-eaming state enterprises to the central Government (chiefly
GUATEL) would represent a negative fiscal impact. GUATEL currently pays 45% of its net earnings to the central
Government. However, this may to some extent be offset by receipts of corporation tax levied on the privatized GUATEL
and from increases in receipts of WA (the value-added tax) paid both by GUATEL and by competitors, through the
anticipated service expansion. The overall fiscal impact of the program is therefore expected to be positive.

15. Technical Assessment:
Although the tasks to be undertaken under this program are demanding, they are feasible for a country such as Guatemala.
Substantial input from international consultants with experience in the privatization and restructuring of infrastructure
sectors and in the creation and establishment of regulatory institutions will be required. At the same time, the appointment of
coordinators for each sector from the local counterpart tearn should ensure that there is sufficient local participation. It
should be noted that the design of market structures and regulatory agencies in Guatemala is being undertaken bearing in
mind the particular circumstances of the country, rather than by simply borrowing the experiences from elsewhere without
adaptation.
. 44................................................. ....................................................................................................................................................................................
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agency:
The office of the Commissioner for Modernization of the Executive Branch has been established and is in the process of
being staffed. A Director for the private participation in infrastructure program has been appointed, as has a Technical
Director to assist in the implementation of the work program. Key administrative staff have been appointed, as have sector
coordinators. The project implementation structure is designed to utilize staff from the MEM, the MCTPW, and their
respective dependencies (regulatory agencies, sector institutions etc.). This should ensure that full use of available sector
knowledge is made. Nonetheless, there is little in-country experience in the design and implementation of a program for
increased private sector participation in the infrastructure sector and therefore attention to the performance of the executing
agency will be a key focus of the Bank's supervision missions. A condition of effectiveness is that the executing agency
(OCMEB) shall be staffed to the Bank's satisfaction; this shall be gauged by whether qualified personnel have been hired to
fill the positions in the executing agencies structure outlined in the PIP.
Project management:
The Project Management structure should be sufficiently strong to coordinate the program, and it should coordinate wel
with the sectoral agencies. To reduce delays associated with procurement, hiring and paying of consultants, a procurement
agent is being contracted to manage this aspect of the project (see Annex 6). This arrangement has worked relatively
successfully in other projects in Guatemala, in most cases using UNDP as a procurement agent. The executing agency has
the capacity to handle some of the initial contracts but a contract with a qualified procurement agent will be signed 3 months
after effectiveness.
17. Social Assessment:
As part of the privatization and concessioning program, there will be a need to shed excess labor. Current labor legislation
in Guatemnala allows for the dismissal of workers at state-owned entities in connection with concessioning and privatization;
it also stipulates that employees must receive a severance payment equal to one month's pay for every year worked.
Consultation and agreement on an appropriate package will be undertaken as part of preparation for privatization and
concessioning. As part of the GUATEL privatization, there is an agreement that the workers will receive a percentage of
the shares, although the precise proportion of this has yet to be determined. This form of accommodation is likely to be
pursued in other privatizations and concessions, if the circumstances are appropriate. For the road concessioning
component, a social impact assessment will be undertaken, and any social impacts arising from the proposed road would be
resolved prior to construction.

The proposed privatization of power, ports and highways construction raises the question of whether (i) there are existing
environmental issues to be addressed; and (ii) there are adequate guidelines and systems in place to monitor compliance with
these guidelines. Therefore, given the need to provide both environmental audits of facilities to be concessioned and
privatized, and to establish clear guidelines and regulations relating to environmental impacts, the project will fund
environmental assessments for the ports and power sectors, to be undertaken prior to the concessioning and privatization of
these facilities. In addition for the highway concessioning program will fund environmental impact assessments for schemes
to be considered for concessioning, and in addition, any environmental mitigation measures will be included as obligations in
the concession agreement granted to the developer.

20. Sustainability: The Government's program of infrastructure privatization is aimed at improving the efficiency of
service delivery in these sectors, through competition and by fostering private sector ownership and operation. The loan will
assist in this process, and the achievements should be sustainable if: (i) there is macroeconomic and political stability,
meaning that Guatemala will be a relatively attractive place to foreign investors; and (ii) concessions and market and
regulatory structures are designed in such a way that are sufficiently attractive to potential private sector operators and give
incentives for efficiency, investment and competition. The prospects for (i) have improved dramatically after the signing of
the Peace Accords in December 1996, and (i) wil be assured by the technical assistance   tt eproject itsefw  !upport

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Privatization has in the past been a controversial issue in Guatemala, with unions, threatened by these actions, mobilizing
support against such measures among the public and in the Congress. The recent amendment to the Ley de Contrataciones
(see Section 6 above) was contested fiercely by the opposition parties, but was approved rapidly by the Legislature. In
addition, there will be a need to shed excess labor and this has to be handled delicately. Estimated severance payments are
not large relative to the expected privatization receipts, and therefore the issue for the Government is one of managing cash
flow through appropriate bridge-financing. The project includes a public information campaign to build consensus around
the benefits of the private participation in infrastructure program. The need to maintain public support highlights the need
for transparency in the privatization and concessioning program.
It can be expected that sector legislation relating to restructuring infrastructure sectors and increasing private sector
participation will attract challenges in the Constitutional Court (see Section 6). It is the Bank's assessment that the risks are
highest in the case of (i) the privatization of GUATEL, using the amendment to the Ley de Contrataciones and (ii) the
power sector, with regard to the new tariffs to be established by CNEE and to the unbundling of INDE. The Government's
legal strategy has been designed to minimize the possibility of success of these legal challenges, and an independent local
legal assessment contracted by the Bank indicates that this strategy has a firm legal foundation and therefore that the
chances of this legislation surviving such constitutional challenges is high. Nonetheless, the risk of such challenges remains.

Guatemala Private Participation in Infrastructure TAL
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - US$1.8 million
Ports
Of the three major ports in operation in Guatemala, one, Puerto Barrios, is privately-operated under a 25 year
contract granted by its owner, FEGUA. Stevedoring and bulk sugar operations at Puerto Quetzal are also
operated by the private sector, under arrangements whereby the port authority provides the equipment used in
the operating processes. At present, none of the operations at Puerto Santo Tomas de Castilla are concessioned
to the private sector. The bulk of the work under this component will be concentrated on the last two ports, in
particular Santo Tomas. The port authorities would be transferred into "landlords", responsible for certain basic
actions but leaving operational activities to the private sector. The precise delineation of risks and
responsibilities between the private sector and the port authorities would be developed during the initial phase of
work on the concessioning strategy. The Govermnent also intends to introduce as much competition as possible
in each port; for example, at Quetzal, the port layout allows at least three separate areas to be concessioned.
To allow the Government's objective of concessioning out ports to be attained, the following steps were
identified by Bank staff during preparation and by a port privatizations expert hired by the Guatemalan
Government (see Annex 7):
(i) the development of a concessioning strategy, to establish the division of risks and responsibilities between the
Govermment and the private sector port operators;
(ii) the development of a new sector law for the ports sector, to provide the legal framework needed for the
regulation of the sector;
(iii) the development of a sound cost base at each of the ports to be concessioned; at present the Government has
a very poor knowledge of operating costs at the ports, and better information will be required at each port to
allow the details of the concession document to be developed;
(iv) an assessment of the quality of land access to the ports to determine if there are any major constraints at
present; it is anticipated that this study could be undertaken by local consultants;
(v) the undertaking of an environmental assessment study for the ports sector, to assess current environmental
liabilities and to provide norms for future operations: the former will be an essential step in undertaking any
concessioning; since Guatemala wishes to become a signatory of MARPOL, the latter will, at least on the port-
side, reflect the obligations of signatories to this treat-. It should be noted that since this will be a sectoral study
it will also cover Puerto Barrios;
(vi) the detailed design of the concessioning documents; and
(vii) the provision of training, and technical assistance to the port authority to allow it to properly undertake its
new regulatory/oversight role. This will include training in technical (including supervision of the
environmental impacts) and regulatory issues, and a coastal management study at Puerto Quetzal.
In line with the work program identified, the proposed project will fund the following activities under this
component (shown, along with estimated amount):
Cost analysis of port operations: US$240,000.
Study of land access to ports: US$20,000.
Concession design and organization of concessioning process: US$340,000.
Development of new sector law for the ports sector: US$90,000.
Study to develop strategy for minor ports: US$40,000.
Sectoral environmental assessment for ports sector: US$370,000.
Training for Port Authority staff: US$300,000.
Coastal management study: US$400,000.



Project Component 2 - US$0.7 million
Road Concessioning:
The Government recently signed with a private developer a contract for the construction and maintenance of an
alternative route to the Palin-Esquintla road. The contractor will recover their money with tolls levied on road
users. The Government wishes to expand this program, but wishes to review world experience to see how road
BOT concessions have been structured, and which model will be best for Guatemala. Following this piece of
strategy work, the Government wishes to identify tNw o options for detailed feasibility study. This work would
include environmental and social impact assessments. the latter identifying any required strategies to deal with
resettlement where applicable. Finally, the project w ould support the development of model concession and
bidding documents.
The project would therefore fund the following activities under this component (shown, along with estimated
amount):
Development of strategy for road concessioning: US$50,000
Evaluation studies of selected candidate routes, model concession and bidding documents: US$650,000.
Project Component 3 - US$4.7 million
Electricity:
As noted in Section 6 of the PAD, in October 1996 the Congress approved legislation reforming the power
sector. The work program proposed under this project will implement the reforms contained in this legislation,
and assist in privatizing the distribution assets of EEGSA.
The new power sector law creates a wholesale market for the power sector. Implementation of this will require a
large amount of technical assistance to establish the dispatch and operating rules for this market This process
has been initiated under the Bank's existing PHRD grant for the sector (see Annex 8) which has begun to
develop the principles under which the market will operate. Assistance will also be required for developing the
regulations governing transmission and distribution use-of-system charges. The power sector law also obliges
INDE to vertically separate its generation, transmission and distribution components. Therefore, a study
evaluating the major options in this field will be undertaken, with an allowance for funds to assist in the
implementation of these recommendations once the company is vertically separated.
The government wishes to privatize the distribution of electricity as the first step in divestiture of state-owned
assets. Although EEGSA is the major distributor, INDE also has some distribution functions. The Government
therefore faces the question of whether and how to combine INDE's distribution assets with EEGSA, and into
how many companies EEGSA should be divided before sale. The study examining INDE's restructuring (see
above) will provide a strategy for INDE's distribution business. A second study will provide a valuation of
EEGSA's assets as well as the strategy for privatization. Finally, funds will be provided for the preparation of
EEGSA for privatization, including if applicable its division into separate companies.
A substantial training component for the CNEE (and to a lesser extent the MEM) is included in the project. It
should be noted that the CNEE will face a demanding burden of work in implementing the new market structure,
which will include accommodating the privatization of EEGSA and the separation of INDE at the same time.
This training component will therefore include: (i) providing a general advisor on regulatory issues who can
assist the CNEE to frame responses to particular issues as they emerge; in this context it is anticipated that such
an advisor might spend one week per month in Guatemala during the first year; (ii) facilitating contacts between
the CNEE and regulators in other countries who have recently confronted similar issues; and (iii) providing
funds for specialized assignments. It is anticipated that this training program will be contracted out as a single
component to allow ease of implementation and supervision. In addition, this program will provide training to
the MEM to enhance its ability to monitor the environmental aspects of the sector.
In addition, a sectoral environmental assessment for the power sector will be undertaken to audit existing
environmental liabilities and provide norms relating to future operations in the sector.
Bearing this work program in mind, the project will fund the following activities under this component (shown,
along with estimated amount):



Provision of consultant services to establish wholesale market:US$ 1,000,000.
Detailed study for restructuring of INDE: US$600,000.
Implementation of this study, including the separation of the generation, transmission and distribution
businesses of INDE:US$200,000.
Strategy for privatization of EEGSA, valuation and inventory:US$600,000
Assistance in developing bidding documents and in sale process:US$500,000
Provision of training and equipment to establish regulatory body (CNEE) and strengthen planning capabilities of
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM):US$600,000
Development of detailed regulations governing wheeling charges and other aspects of regulation:US$850,000
Sectoral environmental assessment for power sector: US$400,000
Project Component 4 - US$5.0 million
Telecommunications:
As with the electricity sector, the Congress approved in October 1996 legislation that made sweeping changes to
the sector. A regulatory agency, SIT, was established, and is now in operation, headed by a full-time
Superintendent. The initial burden of its work is in providing authorizations to new entrants, but it will soon
need to confront complex interconnection issues in a multi-carrier environment while overseeing a privatized
GUATEL which will enjoy substantial market power for the foreseeable future.
Given these identified needs, a substantial program of training and technical assistance for the SIT is envisaged,
in particular to help with some of the economic regulation issues which will arise, which is where the SIT is
itself weakest. This training component will therefore include: (i) providing a general advisor on regulatory
issues who can assist the SIT to frame responses to particular issues as they emerge; in this context it is
anticipated that such an advisor might spend one week per month in Guatemala during the first year; (ii)
facilitating contacts between the SIT and regulators in other countries who have recently confronted similar
issues; and (iii) providing funds for specialized assignments. Technical assistance in the field of economic
regulation will be needed to develop the interconnection rules established in the law. Additional assistance will
be required in the development of the numbering plan.
The SIT plans to auction the radiospectrum during 1997. For this, it will need technical assistance in the
development of the auctioning process, the purchase of software to allocate frequencies based upon the bids
received, the preparation of a frequency register and related tasks. This work will also include the purchase of
software to provide the database of frequencies but will not include monitoring equipment. It is anticipated that
the Borrower will fund the contract for assistance in the privatization of GUATEL.
In addition, the Government is establishing a rural telephone fund which will subsidize service expansion in
rural areas. This fund will be started with money from the proceeds of the auction of the radiospectrum. Under
this project it is proposed to include technical assistance which will include: (i) the definition of the internal
procedures and regulations for administering the fund; (ii) definition of the criteria to be used in the
technical/economic evaluation of proposed projects; (iii) the undertaking of economic analysis in accordance
with (ii) above; and (iv) the prioritization of projects using the results of (iii).
The project will therefore fund the following activities under this component (shown, along with estimated
amount):
Provision of training to regulatory body: US$355,000
Preparation of GUATEL for privatization: US$2,000,000
Assistance in development of detailed regulations for the part of the telecommunications law relating to
radiospectrum allocations and use, design of auction process, assistance in auctioning process and similar
technical assistance: US$1,039,000
Purchase of software for auctioning of radiospectrurn, maintaining database of frequencies: US$1,565,000.



Project Component 5 - US$1.6 million
Postal Services:
The Government wishes to reform the postal sector in three stages: firstly, establish a new sector legislative
framework providing the CNCT (Comisi6n Nacional de Correosy Telgrafos, the proposed regulatory body for
the postal sector) with regulatory responsibilities and defining which postal services are to be regarded as
competitive; secondly, improving the quality of the basic postal service through a hybrid management/technical
assistance contract; and finally, concessioning out the operations of the postal service to a private operator. A
draft law is already ready and it is anticipated to be approved by the time the project is effective. The project will
therefore fund the development of regulations to this law. The project will also fund the proposed
management/TA contract for the postal services, anticipated to last in the order of 18 months. Finally, the
project will fund the development of the concessioning documents for the postal service. Relatively little funds
have been anticipated for this specific component because the bulk of the technical work (providing a cost basis
for concessioning, the technical details of the concessioning agreement) will be undertaken during the
management/ TA contract. Therefore additional funds will be provided for the development of the legal
document based on this technical work. Finally, a training component is included for the CNCT. This will
include financing regular visits from a general advisor 'on regulatory issues, facilitating contacts between the new
agency and postal regulators in other countries (e.g. Argentina) and providing funds for specific issues.
The project will fund the following activities under this component (shown, along with estimated amount):
Development of regulations for law establishing legal framework for postal sector: US$55,000
Development of concessioning strategy and documents for concessioning: US$35,000.
Technical assistance and management contract for DGCT: US$1,162,200
Training for staff of CNCT in regulatory role: US$3 50000.
Project Component 6 - US$3.8 million
Cross-sectoral activities:
The cross-sectoral component of the project will fund activities related to project management, a public
information campaign and provide contingency funds for additional privatization needs. In terms of project
management, it is anticipated that the project will fund the following activities: (i) the cost of the procurement
agent to be hired under the project (which has been estimated at approximately 4% of the project amount); and
(ii) the cost of the implementing unit, including the cost of the CEDEs and adNisors to the implementing unit as
well as miscellaneous operating costs. Also noted as an auditable contribution bv the borrower are the costs of
staff involved in ministries and line agencies in the restructuring and privatization process; this component will
be funded by the borrower. A public information campaign, consisting of programs directed at the public at
large, particular groups within Guatemalan civil societv and at potential investors, will also be funded under the
project.
The project will fund the following activities under this component (shown, along with estimated amount):
Funding for public information campaigns and study. promotion and dissemination of investment opportunities:
US$950,000
Funding of implementing unit: US$860,000.
Funds for additional privatization requirements:USS 1.000,000.
Procurement Agent: US$455,000.
External auditing costs: US$100.000.
Cost of counterpart staff in line ministries, regulatory agencies relating to infrastructure privatization and
restructuring (funded by Borrower): US$470,000
The above cost estimates exclude contingencies of 5%. used to arrive at the figure for total project costs.

Guatemala Private Participation in Infrastructure TAL
Fiscal Impact Calculation
The Government's program of concessioning and privatizing infrastructure service provision has not been
designed with fiscal goals in mind, and the main benefits are expected to come from improved efficiency and
competition. Nonetheless, the project is expected to have a substantial, positive, fiscal impact with the proceeds
from privatization and concessioning to be used for the reduction of domestic debt and for social investment in line
with the Government's obligations under the Peace Accords.
Estimates of Privatization and Concessioning Revenues.
Revenues from privatization will largely come from the sale of shares in GUATEL (planned for 1997), with the
sale of shares in EEGSA (planned for 1998) being the next most important source of revenue. At this stage, there
has not been a market-based valuation of either company (i.e. an estimate of what investors would pay given their
forecasts about potential profits taking into account the legal and regulatory framework, the strength of
competition, and the current state of the physical assets and human resources of the company). Although sale
proceeds for similar companies elsewhere.in the Latin American Region can provide a guide as to the value to be
expected, these may not be readily applicable to Guatemala. GUATEL is being privatized without any form of
transitory statutory monopoly, whereas virtually all privatizations of telecommunications companies in Latin
America included such a monopoly. EEGSA is being privatized against a history of low tariffs and therefore its
sale price may be somewhat discounted by an appreciation of the levels of political risk.
An estimate of the market value of GUATEL can be derived from comparisons with privatizations of
teleconmunications companies elsewhere in Latin America. The price paid per line installed has been around
US$2500 in recent transactions (e.g. CRT in Rio Grande Sur). In the case of GUATEL, a more conservative
estimate is necessary, as the company is being privatized in a completely liberalized market environment.
Therefore, assuming that US$1500 is the value per line, given that there are 400,000 lines then the total market
value would be US$600 million. The Government intends to privatize EEGSA but not the assets of INDE. No
thorough valuation of EEGSA's assets has been carried out under this project, but it is expected that the company
would fetch a market value of around US$ 100 million.
At Santo Tomas, the sale of equipment is estimated to bring in the range of US$1.5 million. The concession itself
is estimated to be worth approximately US$35 million (based on an annual net profit to the concessionaire of US$4
mnillion over a 25 year period at a 10% discount rate). No estimate of the increase in revenue is provided for the
concessioning of the remainder of the activities for Puerto Quetzal. Concession revenues from the postal services
are likely to be low and have not therefore been estimated. This brings the total receipts from privatization and
concessioning to over US$700 million.
Benefits from Debt-Write Down
The Government has indicated that in the order of half of the proceeds from privatization would be used for debt
reduction (with the remainder being used for investment in social infrastructure). The savings from debt write-
down, using proceeds from privatization and concessioning, will depend on (i) the proportion of proceeds that are
used; and (ii) the timing of these write-downs. On a conservative assumption that US$250 million of privatization
proceeds are used to write down domestic debt in 1997 and 1998 then the Government would save over US$150
million through reduced interest payments, against a base case where no privatization receipts are used for debt
write-down (see table below).
Interest Rate Payments US$ million
1997   1998   1999   2000   1997-2000
Base Case Interest Rate repayments   141.0  101.4  65.1   33.2   340.7
US$250 mn reduction of which:        131.7  29.1   27.9   0.0    188.8
20% in 1997, 80% in 1998
Net Savings                          9.3    72.3   37.2   33.2   151.9
The estimates of interest rate payment savings were made based upon average interest rate terms for bonded
domestic debt, with amortization payments guaranteeing a minimum rollover of bonded debt. Debt service
estimates were based on the present level of bonded debt.



Benefits from using privatization proceeds for social investment
Guatemala is a country with large unmet social needs, and the recent signing of the Peace Accords gives the
present Govermment an opportunity to address these needs. Investment requirements to meet these needs are
estimated to be in the order of US$2.4 billion, of which approximately half is to be provided by the Guatemalan
Government. Assuming therefore that US$250 million of privatization proceeds are used for debt write-down,
then the Government would be able to use over US$400 million of the remainder to contribute towards the
investment program, representing one third of the required funds. Therefore the program of privatization and
concessioning means that the Government is in a much stronger position to provide counterpart funds to match
those provided by other donors, including the World Bank. It should also be noted that, assuming the Government
did not have available the US$400 million from privatization proceeds but instead financed this through debt on
standard terms for US-dollar denominated loans, it would pay around US$140 million in interest rate payments
over this period on this amount. This estimate of the cost of interest payments is based on maturities of 4 years
with a 3 year grace period, and a fixed nominal annual interest rate of 8.5% (average terms for US dollar
denominated commercial loans in Guatemala).
Cost of Severance Payments
As part of the privatization and concessioning program, some reduction in work-force will be required. Estimates
of the cost of severance packages for the agencies to be affected under the proposed project have been provided by
the borrower and are as follows: (i) GUATEL - US$38 million, to be paid in 1997; (ii) Puerto Santo Tomas de
Castilla - US$13.9 million, to be paid in 1998; (ii) Puerto Quetzal - US$3.3 million to be paid in 1998; and (iv)
DGCT - US$2.6 million to be paid in 1999. The figures for GUATEL represent an estimate of the severance
payments required for all workers; the Borrower has indicated to the Bank that the Government is not likely to
fund all of this, and that approximately 50% of the figure for GUATEL should be assumed for the purposes of
estimating the fiscal impact. Therefore, it is estimated that the cost of the severance payments may reach as high
as US$40 million, of which at least half would be required for GUATEL. Although these payments represent a
negative fiscal impact, they are not large relative to the expected privatization proceeds.
Net Impact on Taxes and Transfers
A further negative fiscal impact would be a reduction in transfers from GUATEL to the central Government.
GUATEL currently pays 45% of its net earnings to the central Government. Part of this would be recouped from
corporation tax levied on the privatized GUATEL. However, there would be an offsetting increase in receipts of
IVA (the value-added tax), through the anticipated ser-ice expansion. In addition, it is also expected that tax
would be generated by other companies entering the other infrastructure sectors covered by the project.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement of consultants would be done according to the provisions of the "Selection and Employment of Consultants by
World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997) and of goods according to the provisions of the " Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD Loans" (January 1995, revised in January and August 1996). For complex time-based assignments and for contracts
based on a lump sum price, such contracts will be based upon the standard form of contract for consultants' services issued
by the Bank, with such modifications thereto as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no relevant standard contract
documents have been issued by the Bank, other standard forms acceptable to the Bank shall be used. As noted in the project
description, a procurement agent would be hired to expedite project implementation. The administrative expenses would be
paid with loan proceeds directly to the procurement agent.
Table A of this section shows the project costs by procurement arrangements. International competitive bidding procedures
(ICB) shall be used for the purchase of equipment under the project, with contracts for goods where practicable being
grouped into bid packages of US$150,000 or more equivalent. Goods estimated to cost US$25,000 equivalent or more but
less than US$150,000 equivalent per contract may be procured using National Competitive Bidding (NCB), up to an
aggregate amount of US$500,000. Goods estimated to cost less than US$25,000 equivalent per contract may be procured
through national or international shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000. For consultants, prior review will be
needed for the terms of reference only for contracts belowv US$100,000 for firms and below US$50,000 for individuals.
Contracts over US$600,000 will also be subject to review by the Bank of the Borrower's technical evaluation of proposals.
Consultants services may be procured, where appropriate, using the following techniques: Quality and Cost Based (QCBS),
Quality Based (QBS), Selection based on Consultants Qualifications (CQ), up to an aggregate amount of US$1,500,000 and
by contracting with individual consultants, up to an aggregate amount of US$1,500,000. Requirements of prior review of
other contracts for consulting services and goods are summarized in Table B.
Disbursement
The Government through the implementing agency vwill request an initial disbursement to be deposited with the
procurement agent. The procurement agent will make payments directly to consultants and suppliers. Expenditures for
individual contracts of goods and services, for which prior review by Bank is not required, will be disbursed against
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). For expenditures incurred on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) all records
evidencing such information must be retained by OCMEB until at least one year after the Bank has received the audit report
for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal from the Loan Account is made. Applications for withdrawals will be sent by
the Borrower to the Bank based upoII the anticipated payments schedule (based upon the corresponding procurement plan)
in each semester; these applications will be advanced to the procurement agent. Full documentation for all contracts
requiring Bank's prior review will be submitted. Disbursements, representing mainly expenditures under short term
technical assistance, will be made over a period of four years, the average for technical assistance projects in the Latin
American and Caribbean region. Since the privatization program has already commenced, retroactive financing not to
exceed US$1.3 mn (10% of the loan amount) would be applied to finance eligible expenditures made after January 13, 1997
but no more than a year before loan signing.
The allocation of loan proceeds is provided in Table C of this section (see Table C).

developed with funding from USAID and supported under the Bank's Economic Modernization Loan
(3533-GT). 2. PHRD grant for the proposed Power Sector Restructuring Project is assisting in the
following activities: (i) a diagnostic of the wholesale market for electricity and (ii) preparation of some of
the general regulations for the electricity law. The proposed TAL will fund the implementation of (i) and
(ii) and the development of the specific regulations for the law. The Ministry of Energy and Mines, has
prepared a chronogram of activities required to implement the new sector structure, and has in addition
created subcommittees to work on the different components of the restructuring work. Bank staff have
participated in the development of this program.
Telecommunications: The Telecommunications Law approved on October 17, 1996 was prepared using
USAID funds. Identification of the components to be included in the radiospectrum component of the
project was undertaken by a consultant, Edward Farrell (funded by the Bank) in conjunction with the
Superintendencia de Telecomunicaciones.



Postal Sector: Legislation is being prepared which will legalize many currently-provided courier services
and establish a comprehensive legal framework for the sector, fimded under the PHRD Grant for the
proposed Public Sector Modernization Project.
Ports Sector: The Guatemalan Government hired an international ports expert to develop an initial
strategy paper for the ports sector. This paper was produced in December 1996 and was reviewed by Bank
