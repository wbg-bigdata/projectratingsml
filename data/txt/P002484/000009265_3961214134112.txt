PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
SOMALIA
SEMI-MECHANIZED RAINFED AGRICULTURE PILOT PROJECT
(Cr. 1774-SO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Agriculture
Pilot Project (SMRAPP) in Somalia, for which Credit 1774-SO in the amount of SDRI 0.6
million (US$13.4 million equivalent) was approved on March 31, 1987, and made effective on
November25, 1987.
2.    The Credit was never formally closed because of the civil war in Somalia which forced
project operations to be suspended. A total of SDR3.59 million equivalent to US$4.81 million
was disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on June 30, 1992. The undisbursed balance
of SDR7.01 million was cancelled on June 30, 1995. A contribution in terms of food aid
equivalent to US$10,000 was provided by WFP under the Food For Works Project in Somalia.
3.    The PCN was prepared by the staff of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (CP)"
and the Agriculture and Environment Operations Division (AF2AE), Eastern Africa Region and
reviewed by Ms. S. Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE and Mr. S. Agarwal, Project Advisor, AF2.
In view of the absence of government authority in Somalia, comments on the PCN could not be
sought from the Borrower. Comments from WFP have not been received.
4.    As it was not possible to visit the country, preparation of this PCN was carried out as a
desk review in Washington, on the basis of the materials in the project files and discussions with
Bank staff who were involved with the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
SOMALIA
SEMI-MECHANIZED RAINFED AGRICULTURE PILOT PROJECT
(Cr. 1774-SO)
INTRODUCTION
1.    The Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Agriculture Pilot Project (SMRAPP) was a continuation
of the pilot semi-mechanized rainfed (SMR) farming trials started in 1981 at Kurtun Waarey and
Sablaale settlement farms, financed under the Drought Rehabilitation Program (DRP) (Cr. 623-
SO). After the closure of DRP in September 1984, the trial phase remained incomplete. The
SMR technology had shown potential for expanding rainfed farming in Somalia, but it was noted
that its use on settlement farms had relied heavily on Government support and involvement,
which would hinder further development because of limited replicability.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.    The objectives of SMRAPP were to: (i) further refine and improve SMR farming
technology through on-site adaptive research and trials; (ii) develop an independent and self
sustaining organizational structure to manage the SMR activities for replication elsewhere in
Somalia; and (iii) within the pilot area, increase crop and livestock production and incomes.
Total project cost was estimated at US$15.0 million.
3.    Project Changes after Appraisal. Changes in project design after appraisal were
modest. The only significant change was in the institutional framework. At appraisal, it was
envisaged that the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be converted into an independent
corporation by the second year of implementation. At negotiations, it was agreed that the PIU
would remain unchanged until the mid-term review, at which time its status would be reviewed.
4.    Evaluation of Project Objectives. The objectives of the project were generally clear. As
it was a follow-on activity, it took advantage of the existing settlement Farm Management Units
(FMUs) where promising trials and some managerial skills were developed and lessons of
experience gained under DRP. The implementation plan was carefully prepared: a full 8-year
period was allowed to confirm the technology and develop the new organizational structure; the
areas for expansion of new FMUs were already identified at project preparation; and the
programs and guidelines for organization and management were sufficiently developed at project
appraisal.
5.    However, less attention was given to verify that the intended beneficiaries would be
willing or able to apply the discipline, particularly regarding the weeding regime, required for the
success of the SMR technology.



-2 -
6.   In addition, the adoption of a single operational model for the management of SMR
farming activities appeared to be a weakness. Other alternatives for testing the technology in a
different organizational context, such as large scale private farming, small scale farming, or some
combination involving private mechanization services, could have been more fully explored. The
plan to develop four new FMUs by the second year of the project was ambitious.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
7.    The project had a promising start in mid-1987, but it then encountered a number of
difficulties. The security situation in Somalia began to deteriorate in mid-1988. The insecurity
eventually spread to most parts of the country, escalating into civil war in January 1991, when all
remaining project activities ceased. The effective implementation period of the project was,
therefore, only about three years, of which only one year was in relatively peaceful conditions, in
comparison with the planned period of eight years Therefore, there was only a limited
achievement of objectives.
8.    Some physical objectives were partially achieved. Although there were delays, some
equipment was procured and some infrastructure completed. About 1500 ha of land were cleared
(about 30% of the appraisal target), but the settlement program was not initiated.
9.    Only a few research activities/trials were carried out, but useful results were not
generated before the deterioration of security conditions forced a halt to project activities. Thus
the objective of developing SMR technology for large-scale production could not be achieved.
Although technically sound for the climatic and soil conditions of the project area, the SMR has
remained unproven for Somalia, and further investigation would be required. Although cost
recovery from beneficiaries was initiated, full cost recovery was not achieved.
10.   The main means of achieving the institutional development objectives, as provided in the
SAR, included the establishment of PIU and FMUs, and provision of infrastructure, equipment,
vehicles, and training of project staff. Most of these objectives were achieved to a varying
degree but with delays, which hampered implementation. Although the PIU was established
promptly, project management initially was considered inadequate by supervision teams but
improved belatedly. Some skills were built up through limited overseas training as well as
through informal and on-the-job training, although most of these skilled personnel left the
country soon after the government fell. The implementation of agricultural support service
activities and studies suffered delays, mainly as a result of inadequate coordination between PIU
and the other implementing agencies. The PIU built on previous efforts in the existing FMUs
through support and provision of services to existing farmers, but no new farmers were settled.
Little progress was achieved in M&E. Although a socio-economic baseline survey was
conducted, the data were not analyzed due to shortage of staff and problems with fimding
arrangements. Performance of the Wildlife Department (WD) of the Ministry of Livestock,
Forestry and Range, was generally satisfactory. The environmental study was conducted, and a
plan formulated for the implementation of mitigatory measures.



11.   Economic Analysis. At appraisal, in view of the pilot nature of the project, the economic
analysis assessed the viability of future expansion to full scale production of a total of twelve
FMUs envisaged under this and the follow-on project. Assuming other benefits (fuelwood,
fodder and livestock) remained unchanged, ERRs of 12% and 15% were expected to be achieved
through modest increases in crop yields of 6.5% and 19.5%, respectively, on 14,400 ha of
cultivated land with a cropping intensity of 67%.
12.   Due to lack of information, no attempt has been made to re-evaluate the economic
viability of this project However, based on limited production data, the actual average crop
yields in pre-project (1982-1987) are 20%-50% lower than the appraisal estimates, while the re-
estimated crop yields in "with project situation" are about 15%-20% lower than those estimated
at appraisal, as shown below:

b/ Re-estimated by the supervision mission in April 1988, taking into account partial
crop failures of I year in 4 for the guu season and I year in 3 for the der season.
13.   Farm Incomes. At appraisal, projected incomes also appear to have been somewhat
optimistic. Farmers' annual net cash incomes from crops at full development were expected tc
increase by over 100% from So. Sh. 245,000 to So. Sh. 621,000 in 1988 prices (before cost
recovery), and by 35% from So. Sh. 245,000 to So. Sh. 331,000 in 1988 prices (net of cost
recovery). Although the net cash incomes from crops and livestock were estimated at appraisal!,
no re-estimation was carried out on the incomes from livestock by the supervision mission. For
crops only, yields and incomes re-estimated by the supervision mission were substantially lower
than the appraisal estimates for both "with" and "without" project. (Crop yields are indicated in
the table above.) In 1988 prices, the re-estimate for crop income "with" project was only
So. Sh. 176,000 (before cost recovery) and So. Sh 74,000 (net of cost recovery). However, these
were only initial results, and it is impossible to predict how incomes would have developed in the
absence of civil war.
14.   Actual Project Costs and Financing. Data on actual project costs were not available.
Based on the disbursements of the IDA Credit and the WFP's food aid assistance, total project
expenditures at the time project operations were suspended in January 1991 were estimated at
US$5.36 million, or 36 percent of the project cost of US$15.0 million estimated at appraisal.
2/  So.Sh.591,800 before cost recovery and So.Sh.430,800 net of cost recovery.



- 4 -
The IDA Credit financed US$4.81 million, about 90% of total expenditures, while food aid from
WFP amounted to US$10,000. The remaining US$0.54 million (10%) was contributed by GOS.
15.   Project Sustainability. Because of the outbreak of civil war and the destruction of
institutional and physical infrastructure, the question of sustainability cannot be addressed.
However, significant improvements in project management, measures to raise the awareness and
interest of farmers (such as greater participation), and effective cost recovery, would have been
needed to achieve a reasonable level of sustainability. Whether the institutional framework
would have evolved enough to foster these improvements is an open question.
16.   Performance of Bank and Borrower. Managerial and financial weaknesses on the
Borrower side emerged during early implementation, although some improvement was noted
prior to the cessation of project activities. Performance of the Bank throughout the project cycle
was generally satisfactory. However, expectations on crop yields and cost recovery appear to
have been somewhat optimistic, and insufficient attention was given to farner involvement.
Greater attention also might have been given to a menu of options for the introduction of SMR
technology. Supervision missions were effective in the early diagnosis of the difficulties
associated with the SMR system, and a decision was taken to postpone new settlements until the
cost recovery issue was investigated. Advice provided concerning enhanced consultation with
farmers was sound.
FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
17.   Since the project was disrupted by civil war, no plan for future operation was needed.
Project experience was very limited, but it could serve as something of a foundation for the
continued adoption of SMR technology after the war.
18.   The major lessons learned over the short duration of project implementation are:
(a)   a centralized approach is likely to encounter difficulties in securing farmer
participation; increased participation in selection of land for individual cultivatiox
and in planting decisions might generate a greater response;
(b)   the use of a menu of options in a pilot project of this nature might facilh.ze tht
identification of approaches most viable under local conditions; and
(c)   cost recovery may need to be phased in as the benefits of the technology are
demonstrated.
