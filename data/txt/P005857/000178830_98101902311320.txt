WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:       People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
Amount:         $1.2 million.
Terms:          Repayable in 10 years, including 3 years of grace, through
semi-annual installments with a service charge of three-
quarters of one percent per annum. The credit would be
refinanced under any credit the Association might grant
later for the execution of a project defined under the
proposed studies.
Project
Description:  The project consists of studies to assist the Government in
(i) the preparation of water supply master plans for the two
largest urban agglomerations, Aden        and Mukalla; (ii) the
assessment of potential water resources in other populated
areas of the country; and (iii) the elaboration of the first
construction phase of projects for the improvement and ex-
pansion of water supply services in the areas under consider-
ation. The project also includes technical assistance to the
Government for the formulation of appropriate administrative
structures and financial policies for the national water
authority, the Public Water Corporation (PWC), a comprehensive
tariff study, and the procurement of equipment and materials
required for the studies. A total of 140 man-months ($7,700
per man-month) of consulting services is required. The proj-
ect presents no special risks.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IDA
TO THE EXECUT:IVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
YEMEN FOR A WATER SUPPLY ENGINEERING
AN) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit of $1.2 million to the People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen to finance the foreign exchange cost of a Water Supply Engineering and
Technical Assistance Project. In accordance with the normal procedures for
credits of this type, the proposed credit would have a term of 10 years with
three years of grace, but would be refinanced under any credit that the Asso-
ciation would grant later for the execution of a project defined under the
proposed studies.
PART I - ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "Memorandum on the Economic Position and Pros-
pects of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (1231a-YDR) dated October
11, 1976 was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 29, 1976.
An updating mission visited the country in February/March 1978 and its report
is under preparation. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
Development Objectives and Constraints
3.        PDRY became independent in 1967.  Establishing effective government
administration, particularly in the outlying regions where central authority
had traditionally been weak, and reviving a severely depressed economy became
principal objectives of the new regime in the short term. The sudden loss of
expatriate administrators, the termination of British budgetary support and
the closure of the Suez Canal, made these tasks extremely difficult. As the
Government succeeded in overcoming the immediate problems of administration
and economic consolidation, it set out to broaden its economic and social
objectives aimed at diversifying the narrow base of the economy, strengthening
the national cohesion of a traditional tribal society, satisfying basic needs
of the population, and achieving a more equitable distribution of income.
4.        The Government clecided to achieve its objectives through increasingly
comprehensive economic and social planning, consistent with its socialist
objectives. This approach was supported by major structural and institu-
tional reforms, the key eLement of which was the establishment of a strong
and effective public sector. The reforms were initiated with the nationali-
zation of foreign properties in 1969 which brought the bulk of the modern

Report for the Wadi Hadramout Power Project, distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 1, 1978.

service sector in and around Aden (banking, insurance, shipping, trading)
under government control. Subsequent investment in manufacturing, power
and mineral exploration has given the public sector a dominant influence
over industrial act-ivities. Two agrarian reform laws enacted in 1968 and
1970 respectively have fundamentally changed the land tenure conditions.
Sharecropping and absenteeism of privileged landowners, which had been the
main features of the area's traditional feudal system, were abolished and
individual ownership of land was limited to a maximum of 8 ha in irrigated
and 16 ha in rainfed areas. Simultaneously, new farm organizations - pro-
duction cooperatives and state farms - were created to facilitate the intro-
duction of modern cultivation and marketing techniques.
5.         Private enterprises were allowed to exist, mainly in trade, handi-
craft and to some extent in manufacturing. But the private sector was given
a subsidiary role and private entrepreneurs were expected to follow the lead
of the public sector. Cooperation between public and private entefprises is
encouraged in some areas, such as light industries, and a limited number of
joint ventures are now active. Foreign private investors have been encouraged
to participate in oil and mineral exploration.
6.         In 1971 the Government launched its first development plan, covering
the three-year period of 1971/72-1973/74. The strategy of that plan reflected
the priorities spelled out above by focussing on (a) employment creation
through a major public spending program; (b) diversification of the economic
structure by investing in the commodity producing sectors, i.e. agriculture,
fishing and industry; (c) strengthening the country's national and economic
cohesion through establishing a basic road network; (d) providing urgently
needed education and health services to all population groups; and (e) redress-
ing a skewed income distribution by improving the living conditions of the
rural and urban poor while at the same time rigorously limiting higher incomes.
The current Five-Year Plan (1974/75-1978) pursues similar objectives as the
first plan, giving even greater emphasis to investment in agriculture, industry
and the social sectors.
7.         In pursuing its development objectives the Government faces formid-
able constraints, the most important ones being limited natural resources,
shortage of foreign exchange, and insufficient technical and managerial skills.
A harsh climate severely limits the area available for cultivation, although
substantial increases in agricultural output could be achieved through higher
yields, and by substituting cash crops for subsistence agriculture. The
narrow domestic market and few known raw materials limit the scope for indus-
trial development. These constraints are compounded by the rugged topography
which creates severe difficulties for internal communications resulting in
increased domestic transport cost. Returns on investment will therefore not
come easily and will require considerable effort and human skills.
8.        Lack of adequately trained manpower is another major constraint.
Before independence, the country depended largely on expatriate technicians
and managers most of whom left after independence. The Government has tried



- 3 -
to fill the gap with bilateral and multilateral technical assistance, including
UNDP which maintains a large program in PDRY. In addition, again with foreign
assistance (including IDA), a large education and training program was launched
and in recent years has become increasingly technically oriented. Supported
by scholarships for higher education abroad, the country is now generating
a growing flow of technically trained people who could gradually reduce the
shortage of skilled manpower.
9.        PDRY's economy is heavily dependent on imports.  Having little in-
dustry of its own and a limited agricultural potential, all capital goods,
most intermediate products and a large amount of foodstuffs and other consumer
goods have to be purchased abroad. Its own exchange earnings - mostly from
workers' remittances and services - cover only part of the import bill (average
of 65 percent during 1976-77), the difference being financed largely through
foreign aid. As the economy continues to develop, import requirements are
likely to grow further notwithstanding a certain amount of import substitution.
Increasing the country's exchange earnings thus becomes an urgent need.
Government Expenditure and Financing
10.       The withdrawal of British forces in 1967 and the closure of the Suez
Canal in the same year, left the modern service-oriented economy in and around
Aden with an approximately 30 percent smaller regional income, an extremely
low level of investment (about 3 percent of GNP) and roughly 20,000 people
unemployed (about one fourth of the urban labor force). Foreign exchange
earnings fell by two-fifths while the discontinuation of British budgetary
support reduced government revenue by more than half.
11.       To revive the depressed economy the Government relied primarily on
public spending. Through its Three-Year Plan and the current Five-Year Plan
public investments were increased from US$4 million in 1970 to an estimated
US$113 million in 1976. 1/ In relative terms they rose from about 2 percent
of GNP in 1970 to 24 percent in 1976. The allocation of investment funds was
determined by the above-mentioned priorities (paragraph 6) and appears to
have been well chosen: more than half of all public sector investments during
the current Plan period (1974/75-77) went to the commodity producing sectors
with agriculture and fishing receiving 37 percent, industry 13 percent and
mineral exploration 7 percent. A large share (25 percent) was invested in
transport and communication facilities (mainly roads) while the remaining 18
percent was spent for social services. The sharp increase in public invest-
ment was accompanied by a major expansion of current government spending on
education, health and other public services which, during the first half of
the 1970s, more than doubled in real terms.
12.       To sustain the massive increase in public spending the Government
had to make a major effort in mobilizing financial resources. With the low
1/   Preliminary data from the Ministry of Planning indicates that public
sector investment expenditures increased further to about US$165 million
in 1977.



- 4 -
per capita income and little real growth during the earlier part of this
decade, there were definite limitations on raising domestic resources even
though rigorous austerity measures were taken to contain personal incomes and
consumption.
13.       The principal instrument used in mobilizing domestic resources was
taxation and containment of Government employee salaries. New taxes were in-
troduced and tax collection improved. As a result, total government receipts 1/
rose from a level of 12 percent of GNP in 1969/70 to 25 percent in 1976. In
a country with a large subsistence sector and a per capita income of about
$280 in 1976, this would have been difficult to exceed. Government employee
salaries were reduced twice, in 1968/69 and in 1972/73. Notwithstanding
these efforts, domestic resources remained insufficient to cover all public
expenditures.
14.       To supplement the insufficient domestic resources, the Government
turned for help to friendly nations and international agencies. Increasing
amounts of foreign aid were provided, largely by socialist countries, and more
recently by Arab nations. In addition, PDRY received support from regional
and international organizations, including IDA and the IMF. The exact amount
of all foreign resources put at the disposal of the country is not known since
some of the commodity aid has not been recorded either in the budget or in the
balance of payments. But, on the basis of identifiable aid, it is estimated
that aggregate disbursements rose from an average level of some $8 million per
annum during 1969/70-1971/72 to about US$150 million in 1977.
Economic Growth
15.       Public investment and current government spending had a large impact
on the level of economic activity. Urban unemployment, a major problem after
independence, has been virtually eliminated. As private per capita consumption
was rigidly contained by severe austerity measures, much of the increase in
public sector demand benefited the poorer population groups in the form of
additional incomes through employment.
16.       Overall growth, although slow in the initial years, accelerated sig-
nificantly towards the mid 1970s. Social and institutional changes slowed
down domestic production during the early 1970s. Private sector activity in
trade and other services which provided a major share of GDP at the time of
independence, declined perceptively as the Government gave priority to the
development of a strong public sector. In addition, growth was also held back
by the time lag between investment and output in the public sector. These
difficulties have, however, been overcome and the average growth rate of GDP
at constant prices increased from about 3 percent per annum during 1970-73 to
an average of about 6 percent during 1974-76.

Agr. iiLuAV.  Lncluding fibheries) is still the most important sector
in PDRY's economy employing about 45 percent of the labor force and contri-
buting 22 percent to t:,,e CT) in 1976.  Growth in this sector has averaged some
4-6 percent p.a. during 1910-76 largely because of the vigorous expansion
in fish production (over 10 percent p.a.). The fisheries subsector was
stimulated by export opportunities and new investments - partly financed by
IDA - in modern boats, fishing gear and storage facilities. Agricultural crop
output has grown more slowly, although major gains were made in the production
of vegetables and fodder crops. The livestock subsector has grown much more
rapidly with the introducticon of modern poultry and dairy production. How-
ever, agriculture and fisheries still offer considerable scope for further
expansion and the Government is determined to utilize the potential of the
sector.
18.       Substantial economic growth has been experienced in other sectors,
e.g. manufacturing, construction and transport. The manufacturing sector
(excluding Aden refinery) is still small - less than 7 percent of GDP in 1976
- but has been growing at a rate of 10 percent p.a. since 1969. Import
substitution has been the main thrust of the Government's industrialization
policy with emphasis being given to food processing, textiles and construc-
tion materials. In May 1977, the Government reached agreement with British
Petroleum (BP) to take over the large Aden refinery which had been operating
at only a fraction of its capacity. Technical assistance is being provided by
BP and the refinery has started to process, on a commission basis, crude from
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya and other oil countries. Throughput is expected
to expand substantially which should give a major boost to PDRY's industrial
production. Another growth sector has been construction; its share in GDP
rose from 1 percent in 1969 to 9 percent in 1976 as public investments revived
the local construction industry which had suffered severely after independence.
The reopening of the Suez Canal in 1975 has led to a sharp increase of activity
in the Port of Aden which also benefitted from the congestion in the Ports of
Hodeidah in YAR and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.  As a result, a substantial volume
of cargo is now being unloaded at Aden and transported mostly by land to YAR,
and by sea on traditional crafts to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf.
Foreign Payments and External Debts
19.       The rapid expansion of the public sector, especially the growth in
investment, has induced a considerable flow of additional imports. This trend
was, however, partly offset by austerity measures which sharply curtailed
imports of non-essential consumer goods. In addition, the increase in local
production of foodstuffs and manufactured goods has apparently permitted a
certain amount of import substitution. The volume of imports appears, there-
fore, to have grown relatively slowly until the mid-1970s. Notwithstanding
the constraint on the volumie of imports, there has been a rapid increase in
import value, due to the sharp rise in international prices, especially during
1974. The value of imports has more than trebled since the beginning of the
decade from an average of US$89 million per annum during 1970/71 to an estimated
US$346 million in 1977. Besides the devaluation of the US Dollar, this mainly
reflects price increases for foodstuffs and petroleum products and the growing
capital goods imports necessitated by the country's ambitious development



- 6 -
program. The growth in import value has placed a heavy burden on PDRY's
foreign exchange budget, all the more so as the country exports relatively
little and thus benefits only marginally from price rises in the world markets.
20.       Indigenous exports have been able to cover only a minor share of
the import bill. In 1977 they were estimated to be about US$29 million or
some 8 percent of commodity imports. More important than commodity exports
are PDRY's invisible earnings which are dominated by workers' remittances.
The latter declined sharply in the early 1970s but are recovering rapidly -
they increased from US$56 million in 1975 to US$115 million in 1976 and an
estimated US$180 million in 1977. This has been due mainly to rising labor
demand and wage levels in the oil surplus countries, but also been influenced
by a change in Government policy which offers higher interest rates to non-
resident depositors in PDRY's banks and allows private ownership of dwellings
for the use of the owner and his family.
21.       Rising import prices have, however, created a serious shortfall in
PDRY's exchange balance. Total exchange earnings, which in 1969 and 1970 were
still adequate to pay for all imports, covered only about 60 percent of the
import bill in the last three years. As a consequence, the balance on goods
and services showed a rising deficit which amounted to US$114 million in 1977.
A large part of the growing current deficit was financed by foreign aid. As a
result of recent changes in Government policy workers' remittances could
potentially grow further in the future thus helping to ease PDRY's chronic
foreign exchange shortage.
22.       The heavy inflow of foreign resources led to a rapid accumulation
of PDRY's external public debt even though part of the aid was given in grant
form. Total debt outstanding including undisbursed as of end 1977 amounted
to US$432 million, of which US$241 million was disbursed. Bilateral sources
account for 80 percent of total external debt, with Arab Governments and Funds
providing the bulk (US$125 million), followed by USSR (US$97 million), China
(US$60 million), and other (largely Eastern Bloc) countries (US$57 million).
Multinational aid came from the Arab Fund (US$55 million) and IDA (US$38
million). The terms of these loans are concessionary with an average weighted
interest rate of 1.5 percent, grace period of 6 years, and maturity of 24
years, giving a grant element of more than 60 percent.
23.       The soft terms and the recent nature of PDRY's external debt resulted
in relatively small service obligations so far. Debt service payments at the
end of 1977 were only US$1.5 million, about 0.7 percent of total exports of
goods and services (including workers' remittances). However, PDRY's debt
service obligations are projected to increase steadily through 1983. This
will exert additional pressure on the already strained balance of payments.
Therefore, in view of the above and the limited resources of the country, the
Bank's assistance to PDRY should continue to be on IDA terms. For the same
reasons, local cost financing by IDA is justified.
24.       In 1969, under Nationalization Law No. 37, the Government national-
ized most of the foreign-owned enterprises (mainly banks, insurance companies
and port services), but not the refinery and bunkering facilities in the port.



This Law provided for compensation in the form of 20-year Government bonds
bearing interest of 2 percent. Twenty-five percent of the net annual profits
of all these nationalized companies were to be used for servicing these bonds.
In response, some of the foreign banks which were nationalized froze substan-
tial Yemeni deposits which they had transferred abroad. Immediately after the
promulgation of Law No. 37, the Government appointed a British firm of account-
ants of international repute to audit the accounts of all the nationalized
companies and evaluate their assets. The audit report was submitted to the
Government in September 1971. Settlements have since been reached with three
of the foreign companies involved, and contacts with others have been main-
tained with a view to reaching mutually acceptable settlements. The Govern-
ment has indicated to the former owners of nationalized oil companies that in
reaching settlement on their claims it was willing to consider the possibility
of accelerating the redemption of bonds to be issued as compensation. Further-
more, it has invited them to invest in exploring ventures in PDRY. Dialogue
with debtors have, however, been very slow since they have only recently re-
sponded to the Government's efforts to settle claims. The Government professes
its desire to reach a mutually satisfactory solution with all claimant compa-
nies, and has expressed its willingness to consider such settlement outside
the terms of the 1969 Nationalization Law. It is also considering becoming
a member of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.
PART II - WORLD BANK OPERATIONS 1/
25.       To date, the Association has had eight operations in PDRY, for a
total IDA commitment of $44.2 million. In addition, the Executive Directors
considered a $5 million credit for a power project on June 13, 1978. PDRY
joined the Bank in 1969 and IDA in 1970, but is not a member of IFC. Assis-
tance to PDRY commenced in 1971 and after a hiatus of about two years (February
1976 to February 1978) because IDA funds allocated to PDRY for this period had
been committed more rapidly than envisaged, resumed again in 1978. Of the
present total IDA commitment, about 47 percent (US$20.3 million) was for assis-
tance in building up physical infrastructure and strengthening institutions in
the transportation sector, through the provision of three highway credits and
a credit for the rehabilitation and modernization of the Aden port. One of the
highway projects was successfully completed in December 1975. An engineering
credit was refinanced under the credit for the Second Highways (Mukalla-Saywun
road) project now under way. Agriculture (including fisheries) employs about
45 percent of PDRY's labor force and contributed about 22 percent to the
country's GDP in 1976. A:Lthough the cultivable area is severely limited by
difficult terrain and harsh climatic conditions, the potential for increasing
agricultural output through use of improved inputs and modern practices is
considerable. IDA has assisted in the development of agriculture and fisheries
through the provision of four credits amounting to US$17.3 million or about

President's Report for the Wadi Hadramout Power Project, distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 1, 1978.

40 percent of total commitments. The first fisheries project was beset by
cost overruns and as a result a supplementary credit was approved in FY75 to
provide the additional financing needs. Two agricultural credits approved in
FY76 and FY78 respectively focus primarily on increasing yield through the
introduction of modern inputs and cultural practices in Wadi Hadramout and
Wadi Tuban. An IDA credit of US$5.4 million approved in FY75 for an education
project will assist in alleviating the problems of inadequate facilities and
shortage of suitably qualified teachers. Annex II contains a summary state-
ment of IDA Credits as of April 30, 1978, and notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
26.       The Association's lending program in PDRY aims mainly at supporting
the Government's long-range economic objective of broadening the base of a
service-oriented economy centered around Aden, by developing the productive
capacity of the other sectors of the economy and promoting investments in the
outlying regions. Efforts have been directed towards projects in the trans-
port sector, which would not only help to integrate the disparate regions of
PDRY, but, more importantly, link production areas with the main markets.
Other sectors where the Association has assisted and will continue to assist,
are in the fields of education and training and in agriculture, including the
key fisheries subsector. Technical assistance and institution-building will
continue to be an integral feature in the Association's projects in PDRY.
27.       Future operations are both in the preparation and study stages.  A
follow-up Agricultural project in Wadi Hadramout is expected to result from
an ongoing study by consultants financed under the first Wadi Hadramout proj-
ect. A Second Fisheries project (based in a remote region of PDRY) is also
being prepared for possible lending in future years. Studies to prepare a
Third Highway project are included under the ongoing Second Highway project.
As in the recent past, the costs of future projects are expected to be sub-
stantially higher than the funds the Association can provide to PDRY. There-
fore, efforts will be continued to encourage other development agencies to
join the Association in the financing of suitable projects. The Association
has, between FY71 and FY78, successfully played a catalytic role through its
projects in securing about $35.7 million of cofinancing from other aid donors
(UNDP $0.7 million; Kuwait Fund $15.3 million; and the Arab Fund $19.4 mil-
lion), thus assisting in increasing the inflow of development aid to the
country.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
Background
28.       Located in the south-western corner of the Arabian Peninsula,
PDRY occupies an area of 338,000 km2 and extends nearly 1,100 km along the
Gulf of Aden. It is a semi-arid land of rugged configuration and hot climate
with temperatures reaching 400C in summer. The mean annual rainfall does
not exceed 500 mm in the coastal areas; it is less in the interior. The
country is divided into six governorates or provinces. Only one third of



- 9 -
the estimated total population of 1.7 million, which is growing at an average
annual rate of 2.7 percent, can be considered urban. Almost half of the
urban population is concentrated in Greater Aden, the nation's capital and
largest urban agglomeration. The second largest city, Mukalla, has a popula-
tion of about 50,000. More than two thirds of the total population live in
the first, third and fifth governorates, the three provinces covered under the
proposed project. About 10 percent of the total population is nomadic.
Water Resources
29.       PDRY relies essentially on underground water resources for its
supply, as few perennial water streams exist in the country. There are seven
major catchment areas which drain into eleven wadis of which the most impor-
tant are the Hadramout with a drainage area of 114,000 km2, the Bana with
15,500 km2 and the Tuban with 7,200 km2. Since 1970 various studies of the
major groundwater aquifers have been made by FAO. IDA has also assisted in
this area by financing a study of the underground water resources in Wadi
Hadramout as part of an agricultural project (Cr. 615-YDR). The study now
underway is scheduled for completion by the end of 1978. The recently
approved Wadi Tuban Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 768-YDR) also
includes a water management study of the aquifers in Wadi Tuban Delta. In
some regions, specially in the coastal areas, the groundwater resources are
being overexploited. As a result, there is a gradual intrusion of sea water
into the aquifers causing a continuing deterioration in the quality of avail-
able fresh waters.
30.       Public water supply systems exist only in six locations of PDRY:
Aden, Mukalla, Lahej, Dalah, Ghail-Bawazir and Shihr (see map). Potable water
for Greater Aden is extracted from the Wadi Tuban aquifer at three wellfields
known as Bir Nasir, Sheikh Othman and Bir Ahmed. The water quality at Bir
Nasir, farthest from the sea coast, is good, while it is poor in the two other
places due to the high salt content. The combination of the salinity and high
temperature of the waters at the collection points (37 0C) is causing corrosion
of the pumping equipment. The other towns are supplied with groundwater of
fairly good quality. The Wadi Tuban groundwater aquifer is also extensively
used for irrigation.
Service Levels
31.       Only 20 percent of the total population is provided with public
water supply services. About 80 percent of the population in Greater Aden
and less than 40 percent in the other towns have direct access to public water
systems. The total per capita consumption averages 131 liters/day in Aden.
It is only 60 liters/day in Mukalla. This consumption, however, is not con-
sidered adequate even in Aden where the presence of important industries with
high water consumption considerably reduces water allocation for domestic
use. It is estimated that the average household in Aden consumes less than
10 m3/month (less than one-third of average consumption observed in countries
with similar climate) which is very low for such a harsh dry climate.



- 10 -
32.       In the rural areas, water sources are unsanitary, generally consist-
ing of open shallow wells and highly contaminated ponds. Villagers often
spend a whole day to reach the nearest well to fill a few goat skins of water.
With the assistance of bilateral agencies, the Government has been implement-
ing a program of construction of wells in the rural areas, which is progres-
sively reducing the distances travelled to fetch water. The UNDP has extended
assistance in this sector by installing about 45 watering points in the
Northern desert region of the country.
Sewerage
33.       Collection and disposal of sewage and solid wastes in PDRY are
the responsibility of municipal authorities. Only five of the eight towns
forming Greater Aden are equipped with waterborne sewerage systems which serve
about 40 percent of the metropolitan population. The remaining population
in the country uses septic tanks, dry pits and other archaic methods of night
soil collection.
34.       The present sanitary conditions in PDRY are alarming.  Schistoso-
miasis, enteritis and other diarrhoeal diseases appear to be major health
problems. About 65 percent of hospitalized patients are under treatment for
waterborne infectious and parasitic diseases. For outpatients enteritis and
diarrhoeal diseases represent the highest incidence (37/1,000), with 96
percent of the cases reported in the three governorates covered under the
s.tudies. Enteritis and other diarrhoeal diseases are the first leading cause
of infantile death.
Institutional Arrangements
35.       The Public Water Corporation (PWC), the national water authority,
which was established in 1970 by Law No. 19 and placed under the supervision
of the Ministry of Local Affairs, was until recently responsible for the
planning, construction and operation of public water supply systems in the
country. Following a recent reform of the administration, the newly elected
local councils were given the responsibility for the operation and maintenance
of all local services including water supply and sewerage. However, PWC is
continuing to operate the water supply systems, while its future relations
with the local councils are being further examined. During project appraisal
a review of the sector organization was carried out. The Association intends
to further discuss the reorganization of the present set-up, in particular the
future role of PWC in sector operations in the course of implementing the pro-
posed project. The Association will recommend strengthening PWC which appears
to be the proper authority for channelling future IDA credits to the sector.
Sector Program
36.       Prior to the country's independence in 1967, public investments in
water supply and sewerage were confined to Greater Aden. Since then no major
water supply and sewerage works have been executed by PWC which has expe-
rienced serious operational difficulties resulting from the characteristics
of the water sources, the bad conditions of the distribution networks and



- 11 -
scarcity of financial resources. In Aden the sewers have been corroded by
septic sewage and in some instances have collapsed causing blockage of the
sewage flows. The wastewat,ers in Aden are discharged without treatment
into the harbor. The final engineering design of sewerage in the towns
of the three governorates involved in the proposed project has already been
completed. The Government is now in the process of defining a first con-
struction stage followed by the preparation of tender documents for the
selected works. The Governiment is expecting the Association to include a
sewerage component in the Water Supply project that may ensue from the pro-
posed credit. There are plans for building experimental oxidation lagoons
in the industrial area of Aden.
37.       A number of water supply projects with an estimated cost of US$8.5
million has been planned by PWC. About 60 percent of this cost is expected
to be spent during the current Five-Year Investment Plan (1974-1978). One
of the objectives of the Plan is to undertake the feasibility study of water
supply and sewerage projects to be included in the next Five-Year Plan
(1979-1983). The proposed engineering credit (Part IV below) would partly
cover the cost of these studies. Also, PWC is planning to set up branches
during the next Plan in eight more towns.
Constraints to Sector Development
38.       The lack of adequate financial resources is the major constraint
to an accelerated development of the sector. Lacking the necessary funds,
the Government had until now given priority to the development of agricul-
ture and industry. Between 1968 and 1976 investments in potable water supply
amounted to only $9 million (about $5 per capita), and was financed with
Government loans and PWC's accumulated reserves. PWC has not, however, been
able to generate sufficient funds from its operations to finance its main-
tenance and expansion works, mainly because of both low tariffs and the small
percentage of the population served outside of Greater Aden. The Government
had in the past sought to keep the water tariffs low, due to the social
character of these services. The water rates which average $0.70/1,000
gallons in Aden and about ';2.10/1,000 gallons in other towns (compared to
$1.26/1,000 gallons in Yemen Arab Republic, and $0.90/1,000 gallons in Jordan),
have remained unchanged in the last ten years. The municipalities responsible
for the sewerage services in Greater Aden do not at present levy any charges
for these services.
39.       The Government's deep involvement in defining the financial
objectives for the sector have stifled all initiatives by PWC's management
which nevertheless is conscious of the shortcomings of the company's finan-
cial policies. Water supp:Ly services in Greater Aden are reasonably well
managed, although there is no standby capacity and much of the system needs
to be renovated urgently. Needed improvement works have in the past been
postponed because of the lack of foreign exchange funds to pay for imported
materials. Services and water quality control in the other towns are poor.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
40.       The proposed engineering credit of US$1.2 million would be the Asso-
ciation's first operation in the sector. The project was identified in
October 1977 and appraised in March 1978. Negotiations were conducted with
the Government and PWC in June 1978. The project areas are shown on the map
attached to this report. There is no separate appraisal report for this
project.
Objectives of the Project
41.       The proposed studies are aimed at formulating a phased program of
works to meet the urban water needs in Greater Aden and Mukalla up to the
year 2000 as well as preliminary design for the smaller town of Laboos.
Potential sources for the supply of water to these towns would be investigated
and a long-term program for the collection and rational use of these resources
would be recommended to PWC. In addition to these technical aspects, a review
of PWC's administrative and financial policies would be undertaken and ways to
improve them and strengthen PWC's management capability would be set forth. A
comprehensive tariff study for PWC would also be undertaken under the project
and alternative water rates capable of ensuring PWC's financial viability
would be evaluated. The examination of a national tariff structure to alle-
viate the existing financial burdens of some of the small provincial towns,
where rates are much higher than in Aden (para. 38), would also be undertaken.
Project Description
42.       The proposed project would include:
(i) a survey of the existing water supply systems in Greater Aden
and Mukalla;
(ii) the formulation of an immediate program for improving water
supply services in the study area;
(iii) the elaboration of master plans to meet water supply demands
in Aden and Mukalla up to the year 2000;
(iv) preparation of a first construction stage in Aden and Mukalla
and tender documents for the works included in this stage;
(v) the assessment of water resources potential for the
Mukalla/Fuwa/Ghail-Bawazir/Shihir/Khir areas;
(vi) preliminary engineering design of water supply for the
Laboos area;
(vii) formulation of administrative structures and financial
policies for PWC;



- 13 -
(viii) a comprehensive tariff study; and
(ix) the supply of equipment and materials for carrying out the
above studies.
Project Execution
43.       PWC would be responsible for the execution of the project which
would be carried out by qualified engineering consultants under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.02 (a), Development
Credit Agreement). The terms of reference for the studies were approved by
the Association which also found acceptable the consulting firm selected by
PWC to carry out the studies. It is estimated that by September 1979 the
studies would be advanced enough to define a project with its estimated costs.
Detailed design of this project and contract documents for the works would be
completed by March 1980. D)uring execution of the studies PWC will submit the
consultants' interim and draft final reports for the Association's review
and comments which should be taken into account before finalizing the reports
and recommendations therein (Section 3.02 (c) and (d), Development Credit
Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
44.       The estimated total cost of the project is $1.5 million (YD 0.5
million) with a foreign exchange component of $1.2 million (YD 0.4 million)
or 80 percent of the total costs. A summary of the cost estimates follows:
Item                                      Local      Foreign      Total       %

45.        Since the estimates are based on consultants' recent proposals which
are considered fairly accurate (para. 43), only a 10 percent increase in costs
has been allowed for physical contingencies. The unit prices and base sala-
ries are assumed to increase annually by 7 percent during the execution of the
studies. It is estimated that the studies would require 140 man-months of
consulting services at an average cost of $7,700 per man-month (including
subsistence and transportation).



- 14 -
46.       The proposed credit of $1.2 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the studies. The balance of $0.3 million representing the
local cost of the project would be provided by the Government. No UNDP funds
are available for this project and the Government does not have sufficient
foreign exchange resources to cover the full cost of the studies. The credit
would be made to the Government and would have a term of 10 years including 3
years of grace, but would be refinanced under any credit that the Association
would grant later for the execution of a project defined under the proposed
studies.
Procurement and Disbursement
47.       Equipment and materials required for carrying out the studies
would be procured through quotations from at least three suppliers in member
countries of the Bank or in Switzerland. The credit would be disbursed
against 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the proposed project. The
estimated schedule of disbursements is as follows:
IDA FY and Half                   1979/I       1979/II      1980/I      1980/II

The closing date of the credit would be September 30, 1980.
Project Justification and Risk
48.       The Association's support for the project would enable PDRY to take
the first steps necessary to address the urgent needs for correcting the
present defective sanitary conditions of its main urban centers. The proposed
studies would help the Government define its priorities in the sector and an
appropriate investment program of water supply and sewerage works aiming pri-
marily at improving PDRY's sanitary conditions (para. 34). They would also
provide the Government with viable alternative financial policies for sector
development and with data and recommendations necessary for appropriate
planning and sector organization. The project would further assist in
strengthening PWC's technical capability through its association with the
consultants in the execution of the studies. The proposed project presents
no special risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.

50.       Features of the Development Credit Agreement of special interest
are summarized in Annex III.
51.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
52.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution
Cr. No. 370-YDR - Fisheries Project: US$3.5 Million Credit of April 12, 1973;
Effective Date: February 14, 1974; and $1.6 Million Supplementary Credit of
February 6, 1975; Effectiveness Date: April 29, 1975; Closing Date: December
31, 1978.
Due to delays in finding a suitable Project Manager, the original
credit became effective only on February 12, 1974. Since then, project imple-
mentation on the whole has been proceeding satisfactorily. A supervision mis-
sion in June 1974 reported that price and physical contingencies included in
the project were insufficient to cover increases in project cost, which were
mainly due to both foreign and domestic inflation. Since the scope of the
project could not reasonably be reduced and no other sources of financing were
available, the Association agreed to a supplementary credit of $1.6 million to
cover the increased foreign cost of the project. Civil works on the construc-
tion of shore facilities ait Mukalla and Shihr are nearing completion and in-
stallation of refrigeration and processing equipment has begun. Fifty-three
of the 100 fishing boats financed under the credit have been completed in
local shipyards and contracts for the remaining forty-seven have been placed.
Twenty-six completed boats have been retained by PCFW and the rest delivered
to fishing cooperatives.
Cr. No. 494-YDR - Education Project: US$5.4 Million of July 12, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: February 5, 1975; Closing Date: September 30, 1979.
This credit will assist the Government in making qualitative improve-
ments in the educational system and meet priority manpower needs. Implementa-
tion is proceeding satisfactorily but is about 18 months behind appraisal
estimate due to (i) initial delays in declaring the credit effective and in
the negotiations of contracts with UNESCO and the consultant architects and
(ii) more recent delays arising from curricula revisions affecting design
completion.
Cr. No. 560-YDR - Second Highway Project: US$15.5 Million Credit of June 20,
1975; Effectiveness Date: September 17, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
This project, financed jointly with the Kuwait Fund for Arab Eco-
nomic Development, comprises (a) construction of 358 km of roads between the
Wadi Hadramout agricultural area and the coast, which were prepared under
Credit 240 and Engineering Credit S-12; (b) economic and engineering studies
for 320 km of roads (Nagabah-Ataq-Nissab-Beihan-Alayn); (c) purchase of main-
tenance equipment and spares; (d) technical assistance to the MPW, including
fellowships for MPW staff abroad; and (e) re-financing of Engineering Credit
S-12. Since international competitive bidding for the construction element
of the project did not liead to an acceptable bid, arrangements have been made
for the works to be carried out by a government construction unit which is
assisted by the UK Crown Agents. Construction and road maintenance equipment



- 22 -                    ANNEX II
Page 3 of 3
have been procured and construction of the Mukalla-Ashir-Sayun roads (358 kim)
started in March 1976 is making satisfactory progress with approximately 33
percent of the civil works completed. Consultants to implement the technical
assistance component have been appointed and the overseas training program is
about to begin with the placement of 4 Yemeni engineers in a British university
and fellowship for another in West Germany.
Cr. No. 584-YDR - Aden Port Rehabilitation Project: US$3.2 Million Credit
of September 8, 1975; Effectiveness Date: February 3, 1976; Closing Date:
September 30, 1979.
The project which is being cofinanced by the Arab Fund for Economic
and Social Development will assist the PDRY Government in rehabilitating the
port of Aden to reattract traffic passing through the reopened Suez Canal.
The Project provides for (a) floating equipment; (b) cargo-handling equipment;
(c) workshop equipment, spares and stocks; (d) diving team equipment; (e)
navigation, mooring and communications equipment; and (f) technical assis-
tance. The procurement consultant provided under the technical assistance
component of the project has completed the preparation of the tender documents
and orders for equipment financed under the Credit have been placed. Those
financed under the Arab Fund are now being reviewed. The two cost accountants,
a marine engineer and a training advisor are in the process of being recruited.
Cr. No. 615-YDR - Wadi Hadramawt Agricultural Project: US$7.0 Million Credit
of April 22, 1976; Effectiveness Date: September 16, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1979.
The project aims at increasing agricultural production on about 8100
ha of irrigated land in the Wadi through the adoption of improved cultural
practices and the provision of agricultural equipment and supplies, construc-
tion of feeder roads and extension services. It also includes provision of
a date packaging plant and a rural water supply component. Progress on the
project has been slow because of the difficulties encountered in locating
suitable expatriate candidates for the position of Project Manager, Irrigation
Engineer and an Extensionist. The Project Manager and the Irrigation Engineer
have been appointed and are now on site. The appointment of the Extensionist
is expected soon. Orders for agricultural machinery have been placed and
tender documents are being prepared for agricultural supplies.
Cr. No. 768-YDR - Wadi Tuban Agricultural Project: US$5.2 Million Credit
of March 22, 1978; Effectiveness Date: July 20, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
The project seeks to increase water use efficiency and raise agri-
cultural production and farm income in Wadi Tuban through the use of modern
inputs and improved practices. It provides for credit to cooperatives and
state farms, construction of feeder roads, a village water supply scheme
and improved irrigation system; a water management study; an agricultural
policies study; and technical assistance and training. The expatriate
project manager financed under the project has been appointed and is now
in the field. The Government has substantially completed negotiations with
the Arab Fund which is cofinancing this project for an amount of $6.2 million.
The Credit is not yet effective.
