^ANDWK ND RECOMOENDATION OF TME PRESIDNT
Or TRE INEIRMATIONAL DEVELOPKEWT ASSOCI&TION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TEE DEDOCRTIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANUK
FOR A GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for
SDR 38.5 million (US$49 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The
proposed credit, on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity, would help
finance the upgrading of substandard schools, measures to strengthen school
system management, and assistance in developing education sector policy.
2.       Background.  Over the past two/three decades, Sri Lanka has placed
a high priority on the provision of basic education. The school system was
expanded during the 19609 and '70s to provide almost universal access to
primary education. The effect has been achievements well in excess of those
attained by countries of similar income levels, with adult literacy and
primary school enrollment rates both approaching 90X. The Government's
overall policies and strategy in the sector are sound; however the rapid
expansion of the system has resulted in declining quality and the emergence
of strains on the management and service delivery systems.
3.       At a broader level, the output of the educational system does not
match the country's manpower requirements. An excessive emphasis on
academic training rather than technical and vocational skills has
contributed to many secondary and post-secondary graduates remaining
unemployed. Although this is largely a consequence of slow growth in
employment opportunities, and other labour market imbalances, there is a
need to analyze education needs, reform curricula, and adjust the mix
within academic streams and between formal and non-formal education, in
order to reduce expenditure on redundant training.
4.       At the primary and secondary levels, the school system falls under
the control of the Ministry of Education, Cultural Affairs, and Information
(MOECAI).   To date the education system has been excessively centralized,
resulting in weak local management. The Government is currently
undertaking a major decentralization effort: (a) changing from a system of
Districts (covering 300 schools each) to smaller units called Divisions
(100 schools each) as the basic unit of school administration; and (b)
devolving responsibility for education to Provincial Councils as part of a
broader program of devolution. However, most Divisional offices have not
been established, and the relative roles of Provincial Ministries of
Education is still evolving. Supporting the decentralization process and
strengthening the capacity for local level management will be key elements
of the proposed project.
5.       Apart from over-centralization, the system suffers from a number
of other management weakenesses. Firstly, with the expansion of the system
increased management responsibilities have fallen upon staff drawn from the
teaching service, who have neither the requisite supervisory skills nor
management experience. Secondly, the lack of frequent supervision is a
major problem which contributes to poor performance and morale, and low



- 2 -
levels of teacher utilization. This latter problem is due in part to weak
local-level management, and in part to teachers' conditions of employment,
which allow excessive casual leave. Thirdly, although teacher supply is
adequate at the moment, there is an emerging problem of insufficient
teacher training capacity for the future. The Government recognizes this
and is currently considering its options. Finally, the system of
educational planning and development needs strengthening, especially if
MOECAI is to provide critical support to the Provinces.
6.       The institutional weaknesses are exacerbated by the poor quality
of school facilities and lack of supplies. Schools constructed during the
expansion phase were often built to minimal standards, so that many are now
badly overcrowded, and lack such basic facilities as toilets, water
supplies, and furniture. At the same time, slow real growth in recurrent
budgets has resulted in inadequate materials and maintenance, to the point
where Sri Lanka now spends less than tne equivalent of US ten cents per
student per year on classroom supplies and materials. The net effect of
all of these considerations is that the productivity of good basic
investments in education could be enhanced significantly by fairly modest
additional expenditure for facilities, materials, and management
improvements.
7.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  To date IDA has had limited
involvement in the education sector with two construction industry training
projects. The proposed project would represent the extension of a broader
sector dialogue started under an Education Sector Review in 1985. IDA's
strategy is to initially provide financial support for general education,
while encouraging to the Government improve school system management, and
to develop a longer term sector strategy. As a first step on this support
IDA has already provided a US$250,000 Project Preparation Facility (PPF).
In addition to the PPF. IDA's financial involvement will allow Government
to accelerate the upgrading of substandard schools, and encourage support
the provision of adequate recurrent funds to general education.
8.       Other donors are supporting various initiatives in higher
education and training; the Asian Development Bank is finalizing a sector
review, and both ADB and IDA are consulting with each other on their
proposed support.  The Bank Group brings to the rroJect ite experi;ace Of
general education policy in other developing countries, as well as its
expertise in assisting management and institutional development in the
education sector.
9.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would address a number
of policy issues affecting the efficiency of the broader eduication sector,
and would strengthen the school service delivery system. It would improve
teaching conditions and reduce disparities between schools; and support an
institutional development process aimed at: (a) improving school
management systems; (b) facilitating the transition to Provincial
administration; (c) strengthening the institutional capacity of MOECAI to
undertake sector analysis and planning; and (d) assessing the linkages
between job-market demands and education and training needs, in order to
start the process of adjusting the mix of education and training programs.

10.      Project Description.  The project will consist of (a) upgrading
substandard schools by providing classrooms, water supplies and toilets,
and the rehabilitation of buildings (including those damaged in recent
flooding); (b) management strengthening, including development of
Divisional and local management structures, intensification of school
supervision, development of administrative and personnel procedures, and
management training for principals and supervisors; (c) increased provision
for maintenance and material inputs (furniture, equipment, supplies); (d)
strengthening the planning unit in MOECAI; and te) a study of linkages
between manpower requirements and education system outputs, and development
of a plan to adjust the scope and types of post-school training.
11.      The total project cost is estimated at US$75 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$10.3 million (14Z). Cost details
and the project financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. The
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Sri Lanka are attached as Schedules C and D respectively.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7918-CE, dated October 27, 1989 is being
distributed separately.
12.      Agreed Actions.  In line with the sectoral issues outlined above,
the Government has agreed to: (a) complete a detailed analysis of its
education strategy and its linkages with employment needs by June 30, 1991,
and to review the findings with IDA and develop an action program by
December 31, 1991 for implementing reforms; (b) complete a study of the
causes of, and possible remedies for, sub-optimal teacher utilization by
December 31, 1990, review the results with IDA, and prepare an action plan
to improve teacher use satisfactory to the Association by June 30, 1991;
(c) specific criteria for investments under the infrastructure component,
which would involve directing expenditures to less-developed schools, and
restricting them to high priority items; and, (d) by December 31, 1990,
prepare and review with IDA a plan for increasing teacher training capacity
to adequate levels by the mid 1990's. Agreement has also been reached that
the Government will ensure the provision of sufficient local resources tot
(a) increase the supply of classroom consumables to an agreed minimum
level; (b) to sustain an on-going program of rehabilitation and
maintenance; and, (c) to provide sufficient staff for Divisional offices
and management training.
13.      BenefitR. The principal benefit of the project will be better
quality basic education tor dkLldren at primary and secondary schools
through: (a) improved teacher attendance and perfo=sance due to increased
supervision and better management; (b) better conditions for teaching and
learning, due to relief of overcrowding, and provision of basic facilities;
and (c) improved teacher morale and performance due to provision of
adequate classroom supplies and teaching aids. In the medium term the
project will also allow the Government to provide better educational
opportunities with limited resources through improved management and
planning. In the long run it will support a better match between
educational outputs and job-market opportunities, thus limiting redundant
training expenditures, and reducing time spent waiting in unemployment.



- 4 -
14.      Rsks   The principal risks are that the management development
will not be effective, that the Government may fail to act on education
strategy reforms, or that sufficient local financing may not be avaLlable.
The first will be handled by including the establishment of a unit to
support implementation of the management component; the second by sustained
dialogue on education planning, and inclusion of legal agreements on the
preparation of an action plant and the third by specific commitments on
counterpart funding. At the country level there are risks associated with
the security situation, and institutional disruption associated with the
devolution of responsibility to Provincial Councils. It is judged that the
project can be implemented effectively at the current level of civil
unrest. The project has been designed to take account of, and facilitate,
the transition to Provincial administration.
15.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.
