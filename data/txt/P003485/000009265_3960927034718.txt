MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE JIANGXI PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of China is submitted for
approval. A proposed credit for SDR 44.7 million (US$61.0 million equivalent)
would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and vould help finance
the expansion and improvement of the highway network.
2.        Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. The most serious transport need is for dramatically
expanded road capacity, especially in rural areas where increased agricultural
and small-scale industrial production have created an urgent demand for better
farm-to-market transport services. Road transport will also face a growing
share of the demand for passenger transportation from the increasingly mobile
population. In the railway subsector, the network capacity has severely
hampered delivery of energy supplies (i.e. coal), and even with recently
initiated investments in rail line electrification and new line construction,
it will take several years to alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas
and coastal cities. China also needs to substantially expand its port and
waterways facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth capacity and container handling capacity. China's Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes all these sectoral needs. By the end of
the plan period, freight traffic is projected to be 452 higher than in 1985,
and passenger traffic 60? higher, with a disproportionately greater share of
the increase falling on road transport. To meet these needs, substantial
investments are envisioned, especially in highway network expansion, new rail
lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing rail lines, and more
berths at coastal ports. The Plan also proposes to secure efficiency gains in
transportation from operational improvements; these include the development of
integrated transportation networks, in particular for coal transportation and
for import/export trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Plan envisions significant institutional changes in the
sector, including an extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises and delegating authority to
local managements. The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives
for development of the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with
financial and technical assistance. Four railway projects (Loans 2394-CHA,
2540-CHA, 2678-CHA/Credit 1680-CHA and Loan 2968-CHA) are assisting the
expansion of capacity on key routes and the manufacture of electric
iocomotives, passenger coaches and signalling equipment. Four port projects
(Loans 2207-CHA, 2689-CHA, 2907-CHA and 2977-CHA) will effect improvements at
Tianjin, Shanghai, Huangpu and Dalian Ports. The four Bank Group financed



.2-
highway projects in China (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA, Loan 2811-CHA/Credit
1792-CHA, Loan 2951-CHA/Credit 1917 CHA, and Loan 2952-CHA) involve the
construction and improvement of national, rural roads and the first expressway
in China.
3.        While all the transport modes in China are in urgent need of
expansion and modernization, road transport presents the most difficult
challenge. Road freight traffic has been increasing at about 17? per annum
from 1980 to 1986 mainly due to the burgeoning market economy, and passenger
traffic is growing at about 15? per annum. Road congestion was already a
serious problem in the early 1980s, and near major cities has now grown worse.
Increased road capacity is urgently needed. Furthermore, of the approximately
962,800 km in 1986 only some 22,000 km, or 232, have asphaltic or concrete
pavement. These pavements are generally of poor quality; most have exceeded
their design life and are deteriorating rapidly with the increasing traffic.
Accordingly, the highway mode is receiving increased attention under the
Seventh Five-Year Plan (SFYP). The SFYP for the highway subsector is to
upgrade at least 80,000 km of existing road, and to construct about 60,000 km
of new roads of which 9,000 km would be class II standard and 1,580 km would
be Expressway or Class One standard roads.
4.        The main objectives for highwa7 development in the 1980s are to
provide adequate capacity in the heavily congested corridors, to upgrade and
improve the existing network, and to expand the network in remote rural areas.
The proposed 113km Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway and the new Nanchang Bridge are
part of the plan for high standard road investment in Jiangxi Province. The
proposed program for evaluation of the existing road pavements in Jiangxi and
the preparation of strengthening and maintenance management programs serve the
objective of upgrading and improving the existing poor quality and low
standard paved road network. There is also an urgent need in the province for
more modern techniques in the planning, design, construction and maintenance
of roads.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supports the government's
objectives and initiatives for development of the transport sector with both
financial and technical assistance to remove the transport bottlenecks
impeding economic growth. The strategy for the Bank's involvement in the
highway subsector is to meet the most urgent needs of road network expansion
and to support a program of studies on key issues. Bank's involvement in the
highway subsector, particularly in terms of policy, institutional and
technical matters under the first and second projects, aims at helping to
modernize the subsector, by bringing the Bank's experience to bear on the
problems and by expediting the introduction of advanced technology to solve
them; ongoing studies in these projects cover important problems related to
roads financing, road safety, road congestion, the methodology for evaluating
existing road pavements and maintenance management. The proposed project,
besides helping to alleviate congestion on this most congested corridor of
Jiangxi, one of the relatively less developed provinces in China, would
continue Bank's support in these matcers and encompass tasks related to road
pavement strengthening and planning.

6.        Project Obiectives.  The existing Nanchang-Jiujiang hivhway and two
existing bridges crossing Gan River into the city of Nanchang are now heavily
congested. The proposed highway would help expand transport capacity in this
important corridor between the provincial capital of Jiangxi and the inland
water port at Jiujiang. The proposed bridge would help complete the link and
channel long distance through traffic from the new highway around the already
congested Nanchang City. The project would also address the following
specific policy, institutional and technological objectives: (a) improvement
of road and urban traffic planning techniques; (b) evaluation of existing
paved roads and preparation of a pavement strengthening and maintenance
management program; (c) assistance to modernize design, construction, and
materials specifications and contract documentation; (d) supporting the
province's change to competitive bidding for civil works and developing the
institutional capacity for supervising civil work construction; (e) carrying
out a road safety program; and (f) assistance in staff training.
7.        Proiect DescriDtion.  The Jiangxi Provincial Transport Department
(JPTD) and the Nanchang Municipal Government (NMG) would be responsible for
carrying out the project under the overall supervision of the Jiangxi
Provincial Government. The project would include: (a) construction of a new
113-km highway between -,anchang and Jiujiang; (b) construction of a double-
deck, six-lane bridge across the Gan River at Nanchang, with a total length of
1,932 m including east and west approach structure; (c) construction or
improvement of about 6 km of access roads connecting the new bridge to the new
highway; (d) consulting services to help train JPTD and NMG staff in the
supervision and quality control of the highway and bridge construction;
(e) preparation of a program for pavement strengthening, betterment and
maintenance; (f) assistance to JPTD in improved road planning, by preparing a
computerized Road Data Bank; (g) staff training; and (h) equipment for road
management, operation and maintenance.
8.        Schedule A shows the estimated project costs and financing plan.
Schedule B shows procurement methods and estimated disbursements. Schedules C
and D show a timetable for project processing and statement of Bank Loans, IDA
Credits and the IFC operations for China, respectively. Maps showing the
Jiangxi Provincial Transport Network, the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway, and the
Nanchang Bridge are attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7430-CHA, is
being distributed separately.
9.        Action Agreed.  Agreement was reached during negotiations with
Jiangxi Province to: (a) implement in Jiangxi Province the findings of the
road safety st-idy done by Ministry of Communications (HOC) under the first
Bank's highwa/ project (Loan 2539/Credit 1594); and (b) carry out the road
pavement evaluation, road data bank, and staff training programs according to
terms of reference and timing agreeable to the Association. During
negotiations assurances were obtained from Jiangxi Province that resettlement
under the project would be done in accordance with the plan agreed with the
Association.

10.       benefits.  On many sections of the existing road, traffic already
exceeds capacity and congestion is a serious problem leading also to
increasing accident rates. Economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected mainly from vehicle operating cost savings due to: (a) distance
saving; (b) road quality improvement; and (c) congestion and accident
reduction. The ERR for the Nanchang-Jiujiang Highway investment would be 30%
and for Nanchang Bridge would be 38%.
11.       Risks.  There are no major risks foreseen in the project.  JPTD had
hired a Chinese-American engineering joint-venture consulting firm to help
prepare bid documents for the proposed road. The US Federal Highway
Administration has assisted in the review of the design of the new Nanchang
Bridge. The Danish aid agency DANIDA has helped in the review of the design
of the highway and in the ,preparation of bid documents for the highway and the
bridge. Construction of the new highway and bridge would be supervised by
joint teams of local engineers and foreign consultants.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit to China
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

/b As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Notes: 1) The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
2) Since the date of this Statement (September 30, 1988) two loans have been approved:
Ningbo and Shanghai Ports for $76.4 million, and Xiamen Port for $36.0 million.
