MAURITIUS
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Mauritius is a group of islands in the Indian Ocean  of about
2,000 km2 in area, half of which is cultivable. It is a middle-income
developing country with a GNP per capita in 1981 of US$1,340. Almost 90%
of arable land is under sugar cultivation, the dominant product of the
economy. With 940,000 people in 1981, the main island is rather densely
populated. Concerned about the pressure of a growing population, the
Government has applied a pragmatic family planning policy, and brought down
the population growth which is now about 1.4% per year. Basic needs are
extensively covered through Government programs. Medical care and
education are largely free. There are subsidies on basic foods, selective
control over consumer prices, and minimum wage regulation. Dire poverty
has been virtually eliminated.
1.02      Standards of health care are comparable to those in other
countries with similar income levels but life expectancy is higher (65
years). Infant mortality is only 3.5%1/. However, during the last few
years a resurgence of water-borne diseases has been recorded (typhoid,
schistosomiasis, enteritis and other diarrheal diseases), attributed to the
recent deterioration of the water supply systems which provide only
intermittent supply in many areas of the island.
Water Resources
1.03      Water resources are generally abundant throughout the year.
Average yearly rainfall increases from 1,500 mm in the eastern coastal
plains to 5,000 mm in the high central plateau and decreases to 900 mm in
the western coastal plains. Yearly potential evapotranspiration decreases
from 2,000 mm in the coastal plains to 1,400 mm in the high plateau. The
overall difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration is largely
positive. Water flows from the mountains and the central plateau through a
highly ramified hydrographic system and through the aquifers found in the
porous rocks of the island's younger volcanic formations.
1.04      A comprehensive study of all water resources and their most
effective utilization to meet the long-term needs, financed by Fonds d'Aide
et de Cooperation (FAC) of France, was completed in October 1981. The
study shows that water sources and storage capacity developed to date for
potable water are generally sufficient to avoid starting any new major
investments like dams and reservoirs, until about 1986.
1/ Average infant mortality is 10.2% in Madagascar, 2% in Europe and 1.5%
in North America.

Legislation and Sector Organization
1.05      All surface or groundwater is state-owned.  Rights to use water
are controlled by a department of the Central Water Authority (CWA), the
proposed Borrower (Chapter IV) a parastatal organization created in 1971.
CWA is preparing a lWater Rights Register. The consolidation of existing
fragmentary legislation into a modern Water Act still needs to be
finalized. In some areas, conflicts exist about water rights among large
raw water consumers such as sugar industries, for irrigation and milling,
and hydro power stations. However the existing conflicts do not involve
potable water supply, and there are no legal obstacles to Bank lending for
a water supply project.
1.06      All matters relating to water, including inventory and
investigation of water resources, economic allocation of water, development
and operation of water supply systems for domestic, industrial, commercial
and irrigation purposes and water quality control are the responsibility of
CWA.  Created under the CWA Water Act in 1971, CWA started operations only
in 1973 by taking over the Water Development Branch of the Ministry of
Works and the water undertaking of the Municipality of Port-Louis. CWA's
Board, called the Central Water Board, is under the Ministry of Energy and
Internal Communications (formerly Ministry of Power, Fuel and Energy). CWA
is set up as a parastatal organization, but in fact, authority and
responsibility are not delegated from the Ministry to the Board and to
CWA's management as normal for a parastatal utility. Matters which should
be dealt with at the ministerial, Board and General Manager levels are
needlessly delayed by indecision and external interference. CWA's
management does not fully exercise the authority delegated to it. Lack of
confidence in CWA led the Government to appoint successive different
interministerial committees, but as they had no clear terms of reference
this has only demoralized management and staff and led to inefficiency,
lack of discipline, and labor unrest. Recommendations for the granting of
more autonomy to CWA were made in 1978 by a management consulting firm,
Coopers and Lybrand (UK), financed by theOverseas Development
Administration (ODA). However, no steps have been taken to date and
probably should not be until confidence has been restored to CWA's
management and staff and they have demonstrated their ability to conduct
operations efficiently0  It is hoped that mid-1985 may be an appropriate
time for raising the autonomy issue, when the substantial technical
assistance provided by a French water supply company (Ccmpagnie Generale
des Eaux) under a FAC grant and a Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE) loan (para 4.04) and improvement of the quality of service aimed at
by recent African Development Bank (AfDB), CCCE projects and the proposed
Bank project would have had opportunity to succeed.
1.07      Under the existing CWA Acts sewerage would eventually become the
responsibility of CWA. However, no steps have been taken to date to
transfer sewerage from the Ministry of Works, and the transfer probably
should not occur until CWA performance has substantially improved.
1.08      The supply of irrigation water and the charges for the service
are CWA responsibilities.  Recently, an irrigation autho-ity has been
established in connection with the Northern Plains Irrigation Project.
Within this project area, the new authority distributes the water which it
purchases in bulk from CWAo

Levels of Service
1.09      Water Supply.  The main island has three main water supply
systems: (1) the Port Louis system serving the capital city and the
neighbouring industrial areas, (2) the Mare aux Vacoas system which serves
the principal urban areas of Plaines Wilhelms in the center of the island
and rural communities on the west coast, and (3) the District system which
serves the smaller communities and rural areas on the remainder of the
island. Of the 940,000 people living on the main island, 99% have access
to piped water supply,44% through 94,000 piped connections, 50% through
1,200 standpipes (one to four families) and 2,000 public fountains and
about 5% through private systems owned by sugar estates. Industries,
Government entities and commerce are supplied through 9,000 piped
connections.
1.10      The total volume of domestic and industrial wacer sold annually
is about 50 million m3, about 85% being sold for domestic consumption. The
average domestic water consumption, about 126 liter/capita/day (lcd), is
adequate but in many areas service is interrupted daily for various
reasons: inadequate water production facilities, but more often inadequate
storage capacity and distribution facilities, burst pipes which are often
not deep enough in the ground, and inadequate pressure in distribution
pipes in high level areas. During supply interruptions,air is sucked into
the network and prevents the water meters from operating properly. Back
siphonage could occur and this presents a permanent risk of network
contamination and health hazards.
1.11      Prior to the establishment of CWA, water had been provided as a
public service with no intention of recovering costs and thus created an
image of water as a cheap, or free, commodity. In 1974, and again in 1979,
the Government attempted to increase potable water tariffs to recover the
full cost of service but, in face of public opposition, the tariff
increases were reduced, giving the consumers the impression that they can
unduly influence Government's policy tariff increases, particularly in view
of the inadequate service. However, the tariff increases as reduced were
substantial (para. 5.01), and in January 1982, under colenders' pressure a
moderate tariff increase of 20% was obtained (para. 5.04). Increases in
non-payment of bills, illegal connections and tapping of water mains with
plastic hoses and wooden plugs show how public discipline has deteriorated.
112      Al1 three distribution systems suffer from very high water
losses, mostly in the urban areas and, on average, thirty-five percent of
the island's water produced is unaccounted for (paras. 3.04 and 3.07 iii).
About half is due to physical losses (pipes not repaired and overflows from
poorly operated reservoirs), and the other half to water consumed but not
sold (undermetering, under estimation of water supplied through unmetered
connections, and illegal connections).
1.13      Sanitation.  About 53% of the total population are estimated to
be served through public sewers. About 20 housing estates are served
through their own sewer systems. The rest of the island is mainly served
through individual sanitary facilities (septic tanks and pit latrines).
There are several public sewer systems, two in Port Louis, where about 54%
of the population is served, and two in the urban areas in the center of



- 4 -
the island (Plaines Wilhems) where the level of service is about 44%.
Sewerage planning, operatiDn and maintenance need to be improved. A severe
sewerage problem, which is not being addressed effectively, is excessive
infiltration of storm water and ground water into the sewer systems which
were designed to collect waste water only.  In both systems, the number of
illicit stormwater connections is high. This increases operating expenses,
overloads facilities and encourages premature investment to expand
capacity. Sewerage costs are covered mainly by the Government general
budget, only 3% being recovered from the connected population through a
sewerage tax based on the rental value of houses. Under a covenant in the
Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project (para. 1.22), the Government
agreed to carry out a sewerage tariff study and exchange views with the
Bank on a proposed tariff structure which would progressively reduce
subsidies on sewerage services. Maintenance of septic tanks is often
inadequate, many tanks are blocked and polluted water leaks into the
ground.
Sector Objectives and Strategy
1.14      The Government's objectives for water supply are (1) to supply
water to the entire population and meet the future demand resulting from
the population growth, (2) to improve the quality of service by provision
of permanent instead of intermittent service, and (3) to make CWA
financially self-sufficient. To carry out its objectives the Government is
mobilizing external aid to assist the financing of CWA's investment
program, and obtaining technical assistance from France to improve CWA's
management. Both Government and the population in general would accept
tariff increases coupled with an efficient water supply.
1.15      The Government has no special objectives for sanitation except to
improve the standards of service.  It intends to have a subsector study
carried out and a Master Plan for all the island prepared by consultants in
order to establish clear development priorities. Aid agencies are being
approached to finance this study.  In the meantime a detailed Master Plan
for the Plaines Wilhems area will be prepared under French bilateral aid.
Sector Development
1.16      The appointment in November, 1972 of an engineering consultant
(John Taylor and Sons) by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) led
to the preparation of a development program for water supply and of
feasibility studies related to the first two stages of the development
program. The program emphasized mainly the development of water production
facilities (treatment plant, reservoirs and transmission mains) rather than
leak detection and rehabilitation of the existing networks. From FY77 to
FY81 CWA invested an average of Rs 50 million per year, financed by the
Government and external aid, from ODA, AfDB, CCCE and the Government of
India. Past water supply investments in Mauritius have not been made in an
orderly fashion with respect to timing, relationship with other works and
revenue producing potential. Generally, there has been little centralized
coordination and control of the planning and implementation of water
resource development. Part of the reason is CWA's limited capacity for
planning control, record management and liaison with its consulting



- 5 -
engineers. Another key contributing factor has been the tendency to tailor
projects to the funds available and the types of contracts favored by the
consulting engineers and the sources of finance (Government or bilateral
aid) regardless of whether the tailored project met the highest priority
needs 'nr could even fulfil more liinited objectives.
1 o17     CWA's proposed investment program for FY82-89 (Annex 1, page 1)
is based on the Master Plan for water resources (para. 1.04) carried out
recently by the joint consulting firms SIGMA2/ (Mauritius) and SOGREAH3/
(France). It concerns mainly water supply works and emphasizes the
rehabilitation ,f existing networks, recuction of unaccounted for water and
construction of works with the highest revenue producing potential by
optiLuizing the capacities of the existing tacilities.  It was estinratec to
cost about US$166 million equivalent with major expenditures occurring at
the buginning of the invesLment periou.
1.18      OWA's proposed investment program is appropriately tocussed but
is too ambitious and somewhat unrealistic with regard to CWA's
implementation capacity, the status of preparation of some projects, the
timely availability of foreign aid and the relative shortage of local
funds. The appraisal mission estiaated that GWA would ornly be able to
invest about US$104 million equivalent during FY82-89, with major
expenditures occurring at the middle of the investment period (Annex 1,
page 2).
1.19      The FY80-86 sanitation investment program of the Ministry of
Works concerns only the development of the Port-Louis and Plaines Wilhems
sewer system at a total estimated cost of US$27 million equivalent. The
development of the Port-Louis systems is being financed by AfDB and would
be completed by FY84. Studies have been made for extensions to the Plaines
Wilhems systers hut funds have not yet been identified for their
construction. In Mauritius, waste water treatment is generally not a
priority compared to water supply; however, postponement of necessary
investmeints would endanger the quality of surface and especially
groundwater cs sources for domestic consumption.  The Government should
extend its efforts to provide sanitation particularly by investigating the
possibility of low cost technulogy.
Sector Constrainits
1.20      On thie water supply side, the major constraints to sector
development are managerial, political and financial. Management arn  staff
efficiency ana organiizational arrangements are inadequate and neea to be
strengthened by provision of external technical assistance and
implementation of a substantial training program. Once CWA's management
performance has been improved, further improvements could be obtained by
the granting of more autonomy to CWAe  CWA Lneeds to be established on a
financially sound basis, recovering all costs so that it can provide
adequate service and make timely investments to meet the increased demand

for water. Given that the majority of the population have access to water
and can afford to pay an economic price, the constraints are capable of
being easily removed. External financing would then be easier to obtain
once Government policies are changed.
1.21      On the sanitation side, the major constraints are financial and
institutional. Sewerage revenues are currently inadequate to meet
operating expenses including depreciation, and revenues should be
increased. Sewerage revenues would be better based oln water consumed than
on the rental value of housing. The capability of the Ministry of Works
for operating and maintaining the sanitation systems needs to be
strengthened.
Previous Bank Involvement
1.22      In 1978, a water tariff study and a water rights legislation
study were carried out under the WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program. As a
result, water tariffs were increased by about 400% and a new Water Act has
been drafted. The Bank has also been involved in the sector through the
Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project (LN 1926-MAS) presented to the
Board in November 1980 and including a US$1.9 million component for
rehabilitation of sewerage, drainage, and water supply component for four
Central Housing Authority (CHA) estates, and a US$0.7 million component for
solid waste management for Port-Louis.
II. POPULATION, WATER SUPPLY SERVICE AND DEMAND
IN THE PROJECT AREAS
Location - Special Features
2.01      The project areas (Maps IBRD No. 16208R - 16211) comprise
sixty-two different Central Housing Authority (CHA) estates scattered over
the island, the Triolet area in the northern part and the Mont-Blanc area
in the southwestern part of the island and the Mare aux Vacoas area.
2.02      The sixty-two housing estates (Annex 2, paras. I & 2) of the
project area include about 5,800 houses and 38,300 inhabitants. Under
crash programs the houses were built to rehouse the victims of the major
cyclone "Carol" in 1960 and "Gervaise" in 1975 and to house poor people
under the recent "Low-cost Housing Program". The programs were executed
with limited funds, with the result that normal infrastructure works were
either completely omitted or kept to a bare minimum. Houses were
originally leased tor a minimal charge but now the policy is to sell them
with a long repayment period of 40 years. Currently 83% of the houses have
been sold to occupants.
2.03      The Triolet area includes Triolet itself, one of the biggest
villages in Mauritius, and five smaller surrounding villages. The area's



-7 -
population totals 17,600 inhabitants, composed of relatively poor4J ana
absolute poor5/, mainly ot Indian origin, engaged in major production,
processing and small marnufacturing activities (as market garaeners, sugar
estate laborers, sugar refinery workers), the tourism industry (as
employees of nearby  seaside hiotei resorts), ana as artisans and traders.
2.04       The Mont-Blanc area consists of the villages of Mont-Blanc,
Surinam, Eon Courage and Choisy with a total population of 26,000. The
socio-economic background of the Mont-Blanc and Surinam population is
similar to that of Triolet, while Bon Courage and Choisy are inhabited
mainly by very poor people of African origin (sugar estate laborers,
seasonal workers, fishermen).
2.05       The area served by the Mare aux Vacoas (MAV) system includes most
of the urban centers of the island, namely the Plaines Wilhems towns as
well as certain fringe development in Port Louis and in the rural areas of
Moka and Black River. The total population living in the area is estimated
at 370,000. The area absorbs an overspill of population from Port Louis
where there is a shortage of land available for urban development.  The
rmain economic activities comprise commerce, industry, education, tourism
and health services.
Existing Water Supply SvsteDls
(Annex 2 and Maps IBRD No. 16208R - 16211).
2.06       Water distribution pipes exist in 90% of the ClA estates but the
sulpply is inadequatc.  It does not satisfy ti.e deiaarnd and in nianiy places
pipes have been broken by people trying to obtain more water.
2.07       Triolet is supplied by the Northern District subsystem consisting
of the Plair,e des Papayes service tank, onle borehoLe ana a distribution
network. Production facilities are adequate for the time being and do not
neea to be extended before 1990.  however, the distribution network is in
poor condition and cannot cope with the present demand. As a result, the
water supply is intermittent in most parts of tne area. Losses in the
network are high (50% of water produced) and the network needs to be
strengthened and repaired.
2.08       The Mont-Blanc distribution network is connected to the District
Water Supply System but is normally supplied by its own production
facilities consisting of two river intakes and a filter plant of
3,700m3/day capacity. The production facilities are operating below
capacity but demand is not satisfied because the capacity of the
distribution system is inadequate. Hence, the quality of service is very
bad and certain areas (Choisy, Baie-du-Cap) can rarely be supplied with
water.
2.09       The Mare-aux-Vacoas (MAV) water supply system presently derives
about 74,800 r'13/day of water from the iIAV semi-natural lake, and about
4/ Household income of less than Rs 1,230/i,onth (US$112) in 1982.
5/  ho,usehold income of less tthan Rs 860/rooitth (US$78) in 1982.



51,000 m3/day from 23 boreholes and wells, in the Curepipe aquifer. Water
from the lake is treated in La Marie in a slow sand filter plant. Water is
distributed either by gravity or by pumping. The water supply system is
subject to several problems. Water production capacity cannot meet the
current demand. Groundwater pumping stations are not working efficiently
and do not allow increased pumping from the supplies normally available
during the rainy season. The 26 service reservoirs total 46,100 m3 giving
only 9 hours storage at the 1980 average production rate. The proportion
of unaccounted for water is high (40%). Consumers are only intermittently
supplied because of the inadequate capaciLties of the different elements of
the water supply system (production facilities, treated storage reservoirs,
trunk mains and distribution networks) and the poor condition of mains and
distribution pipes in the project area.
Population Served and Standards of Water Supply Services
2.10      The table below summarizes the data on population served through
public water supply and present standards of services in the various
project areas (Annex 3).

Total Population                     452,10-           100
The above table shows that the distribution system covers nearly all the
population, but in most areas supply is only interaittent.  In about 1,540
houses of the CHA estates, one tap located in the middle of a central yard
is being shared by four families. While most people served by public
standpipes travel reasonable distances for their water (100 m or less), a
few have to transport water 300 m or more.
2.11      The table below summarizes the quantities of water currently sold
to various types of consumers and by various standards of service (Annex
3). It shows that volume per capita sold to owners of individual
connections is low, which is the resull: of an inadequate capacity in the
distribution system, intermittent supp:Ly and a large amount of unaccounted
for water.

following table:

The figures are based on data included in pre-feasibility studies prepared
for this project (para. 3.05).  The table shows that the growth of domestic
demand would be more the result of the improvement in the standard of
service than of population growth. The project's main objective is to
rehabilitate and strengthen the water supply systems in areas already
inhabited, rather than extend the systems in areas to be developed.
Accordingly, the rate of population growth in the project areas is less
than the current growth rate for all the island (1.8%). Over the 1980-1990
period standards of service would improve substantially but stay within
reasonable limits.

system will be met, with finance from several sources. In the Port Louis
water supply system the extension of La Narie Treatment Plant and the
construction of several transmission mains and rEs-rvoirs would be
completed under an ongoing project assisted by AfDB. Distribution networks
in the Vallee Pitot, Tranquebar and Pailles-Guibies areas would be
extended, and equipment and pipes to improve the Port Louis system would be
supplied under a third Credit by CCCE signed early 1982. In the Mare aux
Vacoas water supply system, the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds agreed early
1982 to finance the improvement of the surface water pumping plant of La
Marie, the reinforcement of trunk mains, the increase of distribution of
storage capacity by 42,000 m3, leak detection, and rehabilitation and
extensions of the distribution network including private connectmons and
provision of new meters. Finally throughout the island, a small project
financed by USAID would finance distribution reticulation and private
connections in about 42 CHA estates out of a priority list of 104 CHA
estates. The project proposed for financing by the Bank would cover
priority works in the Districts' water supply system, complement the
project financed by the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds in the Mare aux Vacoas
system by improving and reinforcing the part of the system related to
groundwater resources, and complete the project assisted by USAID by
covering the 62 remaining CHA estates. Although the proposed project would
complement the projects mentioned above, it is separate from them and would
provide the expected benefits even if implementation of the other projects
is delayed or suspended. However, because the technical assistance
provided under the third CCCE Credit is a key factor for the institutional
building objective of the proposed project, the Bank would reserve the
right to suspend its loan disbursements if CCCE suspends its Credit.
3.04      Improvement of CWA's efficiency would be mainly obtained by
provision of substantial technical assistance financed by FAC and CCCE,
leak detection equipment, mechanical and meter repair shops financed by the
Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds, and training, a leak detection program, meter
spares and maintenance equipment financed by IBRD. At negotiations the
Bank obtained assurances from the Government in a form of a policy
statement on its political commitment to develop the sector, including
strengthening CWA management, and allowing CWA to charge appropriate
tariffs. The Government agreed to carry out a plan of action in accordance
with a timetable acceptable to the Bank. This plan is set out in a
schedule to the Loan Agreement. Points to be covered in the plan are given
in Annex 5.
3.05      Progress on the three key points mentioned above allowed an
appraisal of the proposed project which was made in October 1981, based on
pre-feasibility studies executed by SIGMA-SOGREAH, and Sir Alexander Gibb
and Partners (UK).
Project Objectives
3.06      The project constitutes the Bank's contribution to the aid
agencies efforts in improving CWA's efficiency (para. 3.03). Its
objectives are, in conjunction with projects financed by other agencies, to
improve (a) the capabilities of CWA's management and staff, (b) CWA's
operations, and (c) the quality of service to the consumers. This would
remove the main obstacle to public acceptance of higher tariffs and would



- 12 -
allow the granting of more autonomy to CWA (para. 1.06) so .hat it could
regulate its own affairs more efficiently.
Project Description
3.07      The project would improve and expand water supply facilities in
62 Central Housing Authority (CHA) estates, in the Triole. and Mt. Blanc
subsystems and in the groundwater pumping schemes of the vKare-aux-Vacoas
systen.  It would also include supply of spare parts and equipment for C1A
as a whole, implementation of a training program and prov-sion of
consulting services (details are given in Annex 6b) It w;ould comprise:
i)  Supply and ii,stalLation of pumping equipnIe;ot for about 13
grounclwater pumping stations ana one booster station;
ii)  Conistruction of pumping stations, including new boreholes anc
reservoirs in tte ground water pumpiing sLations of the
liare-aux-Vacoas system.  Construction1 of tcl distribution
reservoirs, each of 6,000 ti3 capacity, in 'cts Mare-aux-Vacoas
system, one reservoir of 1,000 m3 capacity and two smaller
reservoirs in the Mt. Blanc subsystem;
iii)  Leak detection works in tne Triolet and Mt. Blanc subsystems;
iv)  Supply and laying of pipes to rehabilitate, strengthen and
extend the distribution networks in Triolet. Mt. Blanc and 62
different CHA estates and to supply the two new distribution
reservoirs in the Mare-aux-Vacoas system.
v) Supply and laying of about 6,700 new metered household
connections in part of the CHA estates and irl the Triolet and
Mt. Blanc subsystems;
vi)  Civil works for site offices and reservoir keepers' quarters
in the Triolet and Mt. Blanc subsystems;
vii)  Supply of spare parts for water meters, of about 9
vehicles and miscellaneous equipment;
viii)  Development of an in-service training progra-m to address,
initialiy, priority trsining areas, supply of training
equiprent and provision of training consultant services;
ix)  Provision of engineering consultant services to carry out
hyarogeo±Ggicai studies of ttie Curepipe aqu,ler, to carry out
the detailed design studies of the project in the
Mare-aux-Vacoas and District systems and s-u-pervise
construction of the project in all the project areas.

3.09      The base cost estimates are expressed in January 1983 prices.
The appraisal mission based them on data which were in SIGMA-SOGREAH's
pre-feasibility reports, Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners' detailed design
reports and CWA's updated cost estimates provided at the time of
negotiations (October 1982) when more than 50% of SIGMA-SOGREAH detailed
design was completed. Unit costs are based on contracts for recent
projects.
3.10      The contracts for engineering services are estimated at Rs. 13.24
million (January 1983 price level) and would require about 180 man-months
of consultants' services. The average man-month cost (including salary,
costs, fees, international and local travel and subsistence) is US$6,700.
Expert training services estimated at about US$110,000 would require about
18 man-months at an average man-month cost of about US$6,100 (all costs
incluceci).
3.11      Physical contingencies of 10% have been addec to tl,e base costs.
Price contingencies amount to 22 .4% of the total of the base costs and
physical conitingencies.  They are basec on tthe following inflation rates:
1963   1984 to 1986   1987
Local inflation                 15%        15%          15%
InternatioLial infiationi        8%       7.5%           6X
The divergence between local and international inflatiorn rates is not
expected to be compensated by regular and predictable adjustments in the
exchange rate. Therefore the overall project cost has been estimated using
the exchange rate ruling in October 1982 of US$1=Rs 11. If the
differential rate of inflation were to be compensated regularly by
adjustment of the rate of exchange, the US$ equivalent of total project
costs would be reduced by about 7%.
3.12      Materials and equipment imported directly for the project will be
exempt from custom duties and import taxes. Local costs include custom
duties and import taxes on materials (cement etc.) and equipment (earth
moving etc.) purchased locally by contractors, registration fees on
contractors' vehicles etc. Taxes included in the project cost are
estimated at about Rs. 16 million or about 8% of total project cost.
Project Financing
3.13      The project financing plan is indicated below:
US$ million    %
IBRD Loan + Fee                               12.20       73

18.22



- 15 -
3.14       The Bank's loan would finance about 73% of total project costs
excluding taxes, which is equivalent to 100% of the foreign costs (direct
and indirect), about 33% of the local costs excluding taxes and tte Front
End Fee.
Project Imiplementation
3.15       CWA would be responsible for implementation of the proposea
project and, once completed, tor its operation and mainitenarnce.  C14A's
Chief Engineer, Planning & Design Division would administer and oversee the
construction ot tne project witn the assistance of consulting engineers.
He would coordinate the project among several CXA aepartments, monitor
progress and provide regular progress reports to CWA's General Manager and
the Bank.
3.16       Through our Project Preparation Facility an advance of US$140,000
equivalent was approved in January 1982 to speed up complementary
hydrogeological studies of the Curepipe aquifer and for detailed
engineering design in the Mare-aux-Vacoas system and Triolet and Mt. Blanc
subsystems. In June 1982 CWA have appointed SIGMA-SOGREAH as engineering
consultants under conditions acceptable to the Bank to carry out these
studies. To carry out detailed design for water supply in the CHA Estates
which is a high priority component, CWA appointed Sir Alexander Gibb &
Partners, financed by local funds. Detailed design was completed in
December 19, 1981 and bids were received in May 1982. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that for supervision of the project construction,
CWA would retain engineering consuLltants whose qualifications, experience,
and conditions of employment are acceptable to the Bank.
3.17       CWA's training program (Annex 11) will be implemented by a CWA's
training section to le establishec, within its personnel departi.ent.  During
negotiationis assurances were obtained that CWA would retain the assistance
of experts wnose qualitication, experierice ana conditions of emrl(uYLsent are
acceptable to the Bank to implemenit its training program.
3.18      According to the implementation schedule (Annex 8) netailen
designs would be practically completed by January 1983. Ail bids woula be
called by August 1983 and all major contracts could be awarded by December
1983,  Construction of the project would be substantially completed by
December 1987, except for some minor items which might still be
outstanding. The project completion date is set at June 3U, 1988. This
extended construction period has been taken into account in the cost
estimates and the Bank Loan disbursement schedule.
Procurement
3.19       Works:  The construction of pumping stations, reservoirs and
pipes totalling US$12.8 million including contingencies would be procured
by ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Construction of service
connections and the construction of small buildings, totalling US$1.3
million including contingencies, would be implemeinted through contracts of
less than US$0.5 million scattered throughout the island and are not likely
to interest foreign bidders. These works would be procured through local



- 16 -
competitive oidding procedures, as defined in CWA's F'inancial Orders, which
were found at appraisal to be satisfactory to the Bank, and in which
foreign bidders have tthe opportunity to participate. Leak detection works,
totalling US$0.23 million, including contingencies, would be carried out on
force account by CWA with the assistance of consulting engineers. CWA's
force account work would not be financed by the Loan.
3.20      Goods:  Pumps, generators, vehicles, spare parts and tools,
totalling US$1.5 million including contingencies, would be grouped in
appropriate bidding packages and procured by ICB in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a preference
in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty whichever is the lower.
Miscellaneous items of equipment, in packages less than US$50,000 and
totalling US$0.4 million approximately, would be procured under local
competitive bidding, procedures, which were found at appraisal to be
satisfactory to the Bank.
3.21      Contract Review:  All bidding packages for works estimated to
cost over US$500,000 equivalent and bid6.ing packages for goods over
US$100,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of
procureLTent cocurentationi resulting in a coverage of about 86% of thie total
estimated value of works contracts and about 81% of goods contracts. The
balance of contracts wouic be subject to random review by the Bank
after contract award.

3.23      The forecasts of annual project expenditures are shown in Annex 7
for each project area. Loan disbursement may occur much later. The
schedule of Loan disbursements (Annex 9) is based on the country-wide
disbursement profile for Mauritius. The region-wide disbursement profile
for the sector is not considered appropriate for Mauritius where
implementation capacity is higher than in the rest of the RegionO The
profile was adjusted to account for an implementation period of six months
less than average and for exceptional early disbursements (para. 3.24).
The proposed closing date would be'June 30, 1989. Any unused balance of
the Loan after completion of the project could be used, subject to the
Bank's approval, for further water supply works closely related to the
project.
3.24      The PPF advance for preparation of the project (para. 3,16) would
be refinanced from the proposed Loan. Retroactive financing of up to
US$1.2 million is recommended to cover the foreign exchange costs of the
supply and laying of distribution pipes needed to supply the housing
estates and the supervision of construction of this component after June
10, 1982 (para. 3.16).
Health and Environmental Aspects
3.25      By providing sufficient piped water to people in project areas,
the project is expected to reduce the incidence and risk of diseases
attributable to lack of safe and adequate water. The increase in water



- 18 -
supplies would lead to an increase of waste water. In most of the project
areas where the population density is relatively low and the soil generally
permeable this is acceptable, but in some CHA estates of the Plaine Wilhems
area, there may be some problems in the future which would be looked into
in the detailed waste water Master Plan to be prepared (para. 1.15).
IV. THE BORROWER
4.01      The Borrower and project implementing agency would be the Central
Water Authority (CWA) of Ilauritius.  In adaition to supplying potable water
througlhout the country, (WA tpara. 1.u5-1.06) is expectea to formuiate and
execute policies and plans for all aspects of the management of water
resources, to grant rights for the use of water, and to aevelop arna operate
water systems for irrigation purposes. it is also implicit in the 1971
Water Act which governs operations, that GWA wili take over the sewerage
branch of the Ministry of Works, but so far CWA has not assumed any
responsibility tor sewerage disposal (para. 1.07).
CWA's Organization ana Mlanagement
4.02       CWA's Board (para 1.06) consists of a Chairman, representatives
of eight Government Departments, the Chief Agricultural Officer, the
General Manager of CEB, the General Manager of CWA, three representatives
of the sugar industry, one representative of general industry, and one
representative of the consumers.  The Chairman of the Board and the
unofficial members are appointed by the responsible Minister, originally
the Mlinister of Finance but since 1974, the Mlinister of Power, Fuel and
Energy (MPFE). CWA's Board is too large (17 persons) and includes too many
representatives of the users and not enough people with management
experience. The organization chart is given in Annex 10.
4.03      The CWA Act provides the Minister in charge with wide powers.
The Minister is authorized to approve: all contracts above Rs 100,000
(US$10,000) in value; the appointment and terms of employment of all
officers and staff; all uorrowings and budgets; and all CWA policy
decisions. Excessive interference in daily operations has made CWA's Board
largely ineffective, and has discouraged GWA's rianagement, which has been
unable to function properly (para. 1.06).
4.04      From February 1982, CWA is receiving substantial technical
assistance under French aia.  The tAC and CCCE are provicing a permanent
management adviser for two years and a team of experts on short term
missions representing 30 manmonths over a 3-year period, to study UWA's
organizational problems, identify solutions, establish priorities and help
CWA to set up an efficient organization by the end of FY84.  The agreed
recommendations will be implemented in several phases involving periodic
visits by experts for one or two months. During negotiations CWA agreed
to inform the Bank of the study's findings, and to be consulted on the
recommendations before they are implemented.
4.05       When management has been reorganized and the action plan (para.
4.15), has been implemented, both of which are expected to restore CWA's

4.01      The Borrower and project implementing agency woulci be the Central

throughout the country, UWA tpara. 1.U5-1.06) is expectea to forrauiate and

Water Act which governs operations, that CWA will take over the sewerage
branch of the Ministry of Works, but so far CWA has not assumed any
responsibility for sewerage disposal (para. 1.07).
CWA's Organization and Ilanagement
4.02       CWA's Board (para 1.06) consists of a Chairman, representatives
of eight Government Departments, the Chief Agricultural Officer, the
General Manager of CEB, the General Manager of CUA, three representatives
of the sugar industry, one representative of general industry, and one
representative of the consumers. The Chairman of the Board and tte
unofficial members are appointed by the responsible Minister, originally
the Minister of Finance but since 1974, the Mlinister of Power, Fuel and
Energy (MIPFE). CWA's Board is .too large (17 persons) and includes too many
representatives of the users and not enough people with management
experience. The organization chart is given in Annex 10.
4.03      The CWA Act provides the Minister in charge with wide powers.
The Minister is authorized to approve: all contracts above Rs 100,000
(US$10,000) in value; the appointment and terms of employment of all
officers and staff; all borrowings and budgets; and all CWA policy
decisions. Excessive interference in daily operations has made CWA's Board
largely ineffective, and has discouraged CWA's rianagemeent, which has been
unable to function properly (para. 1.06).
4.04      From 1-ebruary 1982, CWA is receiving substantial technical
assistance under French aic.  The kAC and CGCE are provi&ing a permanent
management adviser for two years and a team of experts on short term

- 19 -
operating efficiency, more autonomy could be granted to the CWA Board ana
management along the lines recommended in the Coopers and Lybrand's report
(para. 1.06) in order to improve CWA's efficiency further.
Personnel and Training
4.06      In February 1982 CWA had a staff of 2,173 out of 2,842
established positions. One half of these are in unskilled grades. A
summary of manpower distribution by main occupational groupings including
staff vacancies, is given in the appendix to Annex 11. The work force is
relatively stable, attrition is low and one half of the complement of
non-professional technical staff from works officers to assistant tradesmen
have been employed for more than fifteen years of consecutive service with
the Ministry of Works and CWA. The key manual staff are the 154 tradesmen
all of whom hold a national public service trade test certificate. In many
cases, however, the trade test certificate is inappropriate for the work
performed for CWA. Moreover, the trade skills standards were established
twenty years ago and have not been updated or revised in line with current
industrial practice. In 1981 about .200 assistant tradesmen were referred
to the national Stanaing Board for Trade Testing. Of this number only
twenty five percent were successful in meeting trade test standards. The
supervisor grading structure is excessively hierarchical and positions are
fillea solely on the basis of seniority. Supervisors have negligible
responsibility for planning and organising work and are untrained for this
role.
4.07      On the basis of the total number of staff employed per thousand
consumers served, or per thousand connections to the water distribution
system, CWA is currently overstaffed. An accurate estimate of the extent
of overemployment is difficult to ascertain without considerable
rationalization of the staffing structure accompanied by a detailed
manpower planning analysis. However, this requirement will be addressed in
the Action Plan (para. 4.15). Standards of work and the organization and
supervision of preventive maintenance systems require to be improved. CWA
suffers not from a shortage of staff, but from a shortage of suitably
motivated and appropriately trained staff. Currently, limited overseas
training is provided for engineers and a few ad-hoc short courses for
assistant tradesmen are provided at one of the local industrial trade
training centers.
4.08      Under the proposed Loan, part of the surplus capacity of the
Development Works Corporation's (DWC) skills training centers would be
converted and equipped to provide training in CWA job-related skills.
Provisions will be made to upgrade, furnish and equip existing CWA
accommodation for use as a small conference/seminar facility for in-house
training. Management development assistance to CWA is expected to be
provided through a UNDP-financed project designed to improve managing
skills in the planning, operation and control of departmental functions.
The UNDP project period woula be 1983-1i96 and the UNDP contribution would
be $160,000. The Bank financed training component will include the
establishment of a small training section within CWA's personnel
department. The main elements of the training component are detailed at
Annex 11.

Accounting and Audit
4.09      CWA s accounting systems are commercially oriented and maintained
manually with the exception of the billing and the payroll systems, which
have been comDuterized since 1975. Studies are underway to computerize the
general accounting system which is expected to be completed by the end of
FY83. CWA's finance division is headed by a competent chief accountant and
is staffed with qualified and experienced staff.  However, since 1979 the
finance aivision has been faced with considerable arrears of work because
of (a) a change in the computer system in 1979; and (b) changes in the
tariff level and structure that occurred successively in 197Y and 1980 and
which were later withdrawn, leading to refunds to consumers that caused an
immense amount of unscheduled work. As a result, the audit of the 1979
accounts was completed only in October 1981 while those of 1980 and 1981
were not completed until mid-1982. The books and accounts are generally
adequate but do no-L include project and job cost accounting; consequently
financial and construction cost reports are not produced with any
regularity. Some improvement could therefore be made in the accounting and
management information system. The CCCE management advisory team
(para. 4.04) iincludes a finance expert to advise CWA in this regard. CCCE
have also commissioned a review of CWA's books, procedures and finances by
a French auditor which began early 1982.
4.10      CWA maintains a plant register based on historical acquisition
costs with depreciation calculated on the straight line method. For the
purpose of rate of return calculations CWA agreed to revalue its fixed
assets in operation annually using as index the fixed capital formation
deflator or such other method of valuation agreeable to the Bank.
4.11      CWi- has an internal audit division which reports directly to the
General Manager. The external audit arrangements are satisfactory and
audits have been carried out by De Chazal Du Mee Company, the Mauritius
associate of Coopers and Lybrand, the international accounting firm.
During negotiations CWA agreed that that its accounts would continue to be
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that annual
financial statements and audit reports would be available to the Bank
Within nine months tor the 1982 accounts and six months of the end of each
fiscal year thereafter.
Insurance
4.12      Insurance cover in the past has been meagre because CWA has
operated on the lines of a government department rather than as an
autonomous parastatal organization. However, a review of insurance
requirements is being undertaken and CWA will adjust insurance cover as
necessary after considering any recommendations. arising from the review.
Management Systems
4.13      At present CWA has no long term planning.  Investments have been
made on an ad hoc basis as sources of finance were available. CWA has a
planning department which is beginning to operate effectively under a
competent Chief, who is an expatriate. The department will be responsible



- 21 -
for updating and incorporating extended time horizons in the long-term
development plan recently prepared by consultants (para. 3.03).
4.14      CWA'S billing system is not soundly based, half of the estimated
94,000 meters currently installed do not work properly and intermittent
water supplies in many areas of the island cause air to pass through
meters which upsets the accuracy of meter readings. CWA was therefore
forced in July 1980, to abandon billing based on meter readings for
domestic consumers and to adopt a new system based on a flat rate of Rs 20
per month per water point (tap, handbasin, toilet, etc.). Also due to poor
billing, one of the interministerial committees (para. 1.06) instructed CWA
early in 1981, to stop disconnection for non-payment of bills.
Consequently, outstanding accounts for water consumption increased from 4.5
months billing at the end of FY80 to 6 months at the end of FY81. Prior to
negotiations of the proposed project the Government allowed CWA to restore
disconnection as the penalty for non payment of bills and during
negotiations CWA agreed that by no later than June 30, 1984 it will ensure
that such penalty is enforced within two months of billing.
Action Plan
4.15      In an endeavor to ensure that full operating and organizational
efficiency is achieved by the end of FY84, during negotiations CWA agreed
to implement a proposed plan of action (para. 3.04) which details the
actions necesssary to achieve more efficiency.  These major critical events
comprise inter alia, reversion to billing based on meter reading and
ensuring that consumer billing records are accurate. Full details of the
Action Plan are given in Annex 5.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
5.01      CWA's past performance has been characterised by recurring annual
deficits ranging from 301% of gross revenue in 1974 (the first full year of
operation) to break even in FY80 following a 400% tariff increase but the
authority was again in deficit in FY81. The situation arose from
Government's reluctance, partly because of poor quality of water services
to most of the population, to increase tariffs to a level needed to make
CWA into a financially viable institution and its willingness to provide
CWA with both operating and capital expenditure subsidies required to cover
deficits. CWA in FY81 sold an estimated 50 million m3 of potable water and
about 40 million m3 6/ at average prices of about Rs 1.37/m3 and Rs
0.042/m3, respectively. Sales of water for irrigation are not expected to
grow as extension of the irrigation areas would be balanced by a move from
overhead to surface irrigation, reducing the quantity of water needed to
irrigate the same area. Revenue from irrigation was Rs 1.7 million in
FY81, an insignificant amount compared to the revenues of Rs 74.1 million
for potable water for the same year.
6/ Figures are approximate only because of metering problems.



- 22 -
5.02        Government provided Rs 175 (US$17.5) million i-n -he period
FY75-81 or an annual average of Rs 25 (US$2.5) million, s operating
subsidies, and  Rs 261 (US$26.1) million over the same period for capital
expenditures.  Agreement with the IMF in FY81 precluded furher operating
subsidies and an awareness now exists that adequate tarif'fs need to be
charged to consumers to cover operating costs, debt service and to finance
a reasonable portion of capital expenditures.
5.03      The policies followed, although restricting funis availability
for needed capital expenditures, maintained CWA in a reaso-ab±e financial
position until the end of FY81 as shown by the summarized balance sheets
for the past three years which follow (detailed statemen:s are in Annex

5.04      Early in FY82, despite the fact that the Gove;-.^ment offered no
operating subsidies it refused to allow CWA to make the required tariff
increase of 20%. However, in December 1981 the GovernmenL realized that
AfDB, CCCE, KFAED and IBRD would not Drovide financial assistance until
tariffs were increased and therefore levels were raised b7 an average of
20% from January 1, 1982. Potable water tariffs effective January 1, 1982
are indicated in Annex 12, Appendix 1. Following this -ar_ff increase and
the increases anticipated for the years through FY85 (para3. 5.06 and
5.C7), CWA's financial position, alt ->gh tight should be manageable.

Financing Plan and Tariffs
5.05      Capital expenditures for the period FY82 through FY89 required to
meet CWA's development program, are estimated at Rs 1,338 (US$122) million
at current prices, including interest during construcLQon.  CWA proposes to
borrow Rs 312 (US$28) million or 23% abroad, Rs 658 (US$60) million or 49%
would be provided by Government by way of loans and mainly some equity
contributions, and Rs 373 (US$34) million or 28% would be self-generated by
CWA.
5.06      The financing plan assumes that tariffs would be increased, on
January 1 and July 1 of each year, by about 15% for FY83, 23% for FY84, 33%
for FY85, to approach the long term marginal cost of water (para
6.05),equivalent to an 8% rate of return on average revalued net fixed
assets in operation which approximates the opportunity cost of capital in
Mauritius of about 7%.   The latest tariff increase (20%) was on January
1982. During negotiations, Government confirmed that CWA will increase
tariffs by 15% on January 1, 1983 and on July 1, 1983 which will enable CWA
to achieve an operating ratio of 95% for FY84 (para. 5.09), and that CWA
will continue to adjust tariffs at six monthly intervals thereafter to
achieve an operating ratio of 80% in FY85 and rate of return of not less
than 8% for FY86 and beyond. CWA's financing plan for the eight year
period is summarized below:

5.07      Based on the assumptions incorporated in the financing plan
annual increases in CWA's average tariff level/m3 for potable water FY82
through FY89 are estimated as follow:

5.08      Tariff levels in constant prices are estimated to increase until
FY86, the year following fulfilment of the Action Plan when the economic
price for water is achieved (para. 6.05). Thereafter average prices
decrease slightly in real terms, indicating that CWA will have reasonably
improve defficiency, which is reflected in the almost constant real prices
to consumers for FY86-89. Tariff levels for irrigation water are expected
to increase at about the same rate as for potable water.
5.09      Public resistance has arisen in the past to tariff increases
because of CWA's inability to provide adequate water supplies. On two
occasions in the past decade, announced tariff increases have been
withdrawn following a public outcry, and the population now has the
impression that Government's policy can be unduly influenced with regard
to water tariffs. Without an efficient 24-hour-a-day water supply, full
economic pricing is difficult to justify. During negotiations Government
agreed as part of the Action Plan (para. 3.04 & 4.15), proposals for tariff
increases adequate to achieve operating ratios in FY83 of 115%, in FY84
95%, and in FY85 80% which would provide CWA with the funds needed to
operate effectively. An 8% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation for FY86 and each year thereafter would be appropriate as it
approximates to the opportunity cost of capital in the island and the
tariff levels derived approximate the economic price of water (paras. 5.06
and 6.05). Even at the increased tariff level of FY86 (averaging Rs
1.85/m3 at 1981 prices level), water needs would be affordable since a
family of five consuming 50 lcd would have to pay Rs 14/month which
represents only 1.1% of the household income a family at the relative
poverty level and 1.6% for a family at the absolute poverty level (para.
2.03).
Future Operations and Financial Position
5.10       Forecast income statements, funds flow statements and balance
sheets, FY82 through FY89, are given in Annex 13-15, and the assumptions
used in their preparation are detailed in Annex 16. Water sales for
potable water are expected to increase from an estimated 50 million m3 in
FY81 to 91 million m' 7/ in FY89, at an annual average growth rate of
7.8%. Irrigation sales are expected to remain at the FY81 level of about
7/ Mission estimates based on CWA's feasible investment program (Annex 1).



- 25 -
40 milLion m3 (para. 5.01) with revenues increasing from Rs 1.7 million in
FY81 to about Rs 7 million in FY89. Total revenues are estimated to
increase trom Rs 77 (bUS7.0 million) to Rs 481 (US$49.U) million over the
same period or at an average annual rate of 26%, while operating expenses
will increase from about Rs 79 (US$7.2) to Rs 305 (US$27.8),  'Yb1-89, an
average growth rate of 18% p.a. The higher revenue growth rate compared to
the growth of operating expenses, reflects the real price increases
required to reach the economic price of water in FY86.
5.11      The financial position would improve substantially in the eight
year period. Instead of having to borrow all local capital costs from the
Government as in the first half of the period, CWA would be able to
generate all local funds requirements from about FY87 when borrowing from
the Government would cease, except for the onlending of foreign aid. In
the latter years of the forecast period, assuming that tariffs were
increased in line with inflation, surplus funds would be generated as the
need for large capital expenditures diminishes, following rehabilitation of
the system. A decision could then be made whether to make CWA liable to
income/corporation tax or provide part of the local costs of sewerage
expansion.
Capitalization
5.12      CWA's aebt/equity ratio would fall from a maximum of 57/43 in
FY85 to 35/65 by FY89, a satisfactory position. No difficulty would be
encountered by CWA in servicing debt for government loans both past and
future and aninual debt service ratios woula be greater than 1.5 for
kY85-89. However, to safeguard the position, during negotiations CWA
agreed not to incur any loan if internal cash generation tor the year prior
to the incurrence, were less than 1.5 times maximum future debt service on
all loans including the loan to be incurred, unless Bank shall otherwise
agree.
Liquidity
5.13      The current ratio is estimated to increase from a minimum of 1.5
in FY83 to 4.8 by FY89. Work in progress at end FY81 includes about Rs 55
(US$5.0) million of excess materials which would be utilized for the
construction program by end FY86. Inventories through the forecast period
are estimated at about 1% of revalued gross plant. The cash position will
be tight through FY83 but CWA has bank overdraft facilities available for
emergencies and the position would be rectified by FY84.
5.14      Receivables for water bills were the equivalent of about six
months water revenue at the end of FY81. However at the time of
negotiations, CWA had reduced the outstanding amount to less than four
months' billing. At negotiations CWA agreed to take appropriate steps,
including enforcement of disconnection penalty, to further- reduce the
outstanding billings to not more than three months billings.

VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
6.01      The project would satisfy the water supply demands in the project
areas (paras 2.12 and 2.13). Combined with the project financed by the
Kuwait and Abu Dhabi funds in the Mare aux Vacoas area, it would, up to the
year 2000, provide safe water to about 79,000 additional people, improve
the service to about 446,000 people, increase domestic consumption by
49,800 m3/day , and meet the needs of commerce, industry and government
whose water consumption would be increased by about 7,600 m3/day.
6.02      More generally, all water supply consumers would benefit from
CWA's improved management and staff capabilities to be brought about by the
project's training component and from CWA's improved operations to be
brought about by the project's leak detection program, provision of meter
spares and maintenance equipment. Through its financial covenants the
project is expected to lead towards institutional effectiveness which
should benefit not only CWA's consumers but all tax payers in the country.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      The consultants and CWA have selected the most economical
alternatives to meet the water demand in the project areas, The approach
selected was to maximize the use of past investments by improving existing
distribution system efficiency (by decreasing unaccounted for water through
leak detection programs and network rehabilitation) and improving existing
groundwater pumping stations (increase of pumping stations efficiency
mainly through the use of pumping equipment better adapted to changes in
aquifer levels and yields and to changes in downstream water demand).
Detailed alternatives have been considered with different network lay-outs,
size of pipes and shape of storage tanks. Alternatives were compared by
analyzing discounted capital and operation and maintenance costs.
Sensitivity of the results to discount factors, variations in cost and
demand have been examined, and the most economic alternatives chosen.
Internal Rate of Return and Pricing Consideration
6.04      The internal rate of return is the discount rate at which the
present value of capital, operating and renewal costs, excluding taxes and
shadow pricing foreign exchange at 120%, are equal to the present
value of the water revenues attributable to the investments over the
economic life of the project. The internal rate of return (IRR) is 3.73%
using the projected average selling price of Rs 1.85/m3 in 1986 (discounted
to 1981 price level)which is based on the covenanted annual rate of return
of 8% on revalued net fixed assets in operation in FY86.
6.05      The long term marginal cost of supply for the project areas is
estimated at Rs 2.65/m3 using an opportunity cost of capital of 7% in real
terms. The marginal cost is above the existing average selling price for
CWA as a whole of Rs 1.55/m3 and also above the projected average tariff at
about the middle of the decade of Rs 1.80/m3, discounted to 1981 price
level, (based on an 8% rate of return on net fixed assets in operation);



- 27 -
the reasons for this situation are: (1) some of the existing assets in the
CWA system are fully depreciated; (2) standard tariffs apply throughout the
island and water supplies outside the project area relate mainly to
Port-Louis where larger economies of scale exist; and (3) portions of the
investments in the project areas are for rehabilitation and they will not
generate incremental revenues but help to maintain existing revenues.
Although low, the rates of return are acceptable because they provide
adequate funds to enable CWA to be financially viable including the
possibility of paying income/corporation tax (para. 5.11) in the latter
half of the current decade. The rates of return would be higher if
additional health and environmental benefits were quantifiable and could be
included in the calculations. The rates of return are sensitive to a 10%
increase in costs or a 10% reduction in water revenues by about 1.6%
(details of the calculations are given in Annex 17).
Impact on Poverty Group
6.06      The poverty group served by the project is estimated at 134,000
(30% of the total population presently living in the project areas), based
upon the assumption that all of the population served either through public
standpipes or not served at all, are below the relative poverty threshold
(Rs 1230 per month at 1982 price levels).  It is estimated that in 1990,
about 32,000 of the poverty group would be served through public standpipes
and the remainder would be served through private connections.Thus poverty
group consumption is projected at about 24% of total domestic consumption
for that year8/. The urban poverty component of the project is
consequently 30% according to the number of people served, and 24%
according to the volume of water distributed.
Project Risks and Merits
6.07      The main project risks relate to delay which may occur during
engineering and construction of the project because of CWA's poor
management capacity, poor motivation of its staff, external interference
and the Government delay in taking decisions. CWA's limited implementation
capacity has been taken into account in the project implementation schedule
which provides for some delays. The use of consulting engineers for
engineering studies and supervision of the project construction, the
management technical assistance provided under the third CCCE loan
(para. 1.06) and the improvement in service brought by recent AfDB and CCCE
projects, should play an important role in improving morale and efficiency
in the sector and avoiding more delays than already envisaged in the
implementation schedule.
6.08      The project risks appear moderate compared to the substantial
benefits which are expected from its implementation (paras. 6.01 and 6.02).
8/ Poverty group consumption is estimated in 1990 at 22,800 m3/day out of
a total domestic consumption of 95,500 m3/day.



- 28 -
Monitoring
6.09      During the implementation of the project, CWA will monitor
critical indicators through bimonthly and semi-annual reports (Annex 18).
Within six months of project completion, CWA will prepare a project
completion report on the basis of an outline agreed with the Bank.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government
and CWA on the following:
a) CWA would continue to use the technical assistance provided
under the third CCCE Credit (para. 3.03);
b) Government would carry out an Action Plan to restore CWA's
full operating efficiency (paras. 3.04 & 4.15);
c)  CWA would employ engineering consultants satisfactory to the
Bank for supervision of the project construction (para.
3.16);
d) CWA would employ experts satisfactory to the Bank for
implementing the training program (para. 3.17);
e) The Bank will be consulted on the recommendations of the
reorganisation study before these are implemented (para.
4.04);
f) For rate of return purposes CWA would revalue annually net
fixed assets in operation (para. 4.10);
g) CWA's accounts would continue to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and annual audit reports and
accounts would be sent to the Bank within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (para. 4.11);
h) Water tariffs would be increased by at least 15% on January
1, 1983 and July 1, 1983 (para. 5.06). Operating ratios of
95% and 80% would be achieved for FY84 and FY85 respectively;
ana a rate of return of 8% on average revalued net fixea
assets in operation would be earned for FY86 and subsequent
years (para. 5.09);
i)  Bank agreement to the incurrence of any loan would be
obtained if cash generation for the previous year was below
1.5 times maximum tuture debt service on the loans incurred
(para. 5.12);
j) Outstanding accounts would not exceed the previous three
months water revenues after negotiations (paras. 5.14 and
7.01 (c)).



- 29 -
7.02      With the above agreements, the project would be suitable for a
Bank financing of US$12.2 million equivalent available to CWA for 17 years,
including a 4 year grace period.

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Existing Facilities
CHA Estates
1.        Existing Water supply facilities in the CHA Estates vary
according to the periods they were constructed. After the passage of
cyclone "Carol" in 1960, Housing Estates were located wherever land was
available, sometimes quite far away from existing water supply lines. In
urban areas, every group of four families was provided with one tap and in
rural areas, one public standpipe for every group of 20 families when water
was readily available from an existing nearby distribution line. In the
absence of such facility, there was no water supply at all. After the
passage of cyclone "Gervaise" in 1975, existing housing estates were
extended, when adjacent land was available, and existing water supply
facilities were extended to the new residents. In new housing estates,
house purchasers were responsible for connection to the distribution
system.
2.        Presently, 10% of the housing estates have no service at all, 48%
are served through public standpipes, 12% are served through yard
connections shared by four families and 30% are served through private
connections. Even for those served, the water supply is inadequate, and
queues in front of public standpipes are long.  In some areas to avoid
walking long distances, residents make holes in nearby water mains, extract
water and plug the holes with pieces of wood. In other areas, residents
break pipes to obtain more water, often causing the whole system's
collapse.
Triolet
3.        Triolet is supplied by the Northern District subsystem consisting
of the Plaine des Papayes service tank, one borehole which is shared by the
Pilot Scheme of the Northern Plains Irrigation Project, ar±d a distribution
network. The villages of Pointe aux Piments, Trou aux Biches, Bon Air and
Solitude are served via the distribution main of Triolet. Production
facilities are adequate at present and do not need to be extended before
1990. However, the distribution network is inadequate and innefficient and
cannot cope with the present demand and, as a result, water supply is
intermittent in most parts of the area. Losses in the network are high and
reach 50% of production. The network needs to be strengthened and
repaired
Mont-Blanc
4.        The Mont-Blanc water supply subsystem forms the southwestern part
of the District Water Supply System; however, it can operate independently.
The subsystem is composed of two river intakes, a spring, a filter plant,
trunk mains, service tanks and a distribution network.

Page 2 of 2
5.        The Mont-Blanc filters are being fed from two river intakes
(Riviere des Gablets and Riviare des Patates) located at a distance of
about 8 km and from the Fowdar spring in Mont-Blanc. The filter plant
capacity is 3,700 m3/day. The filtered water is stored in Mont-Blanc
reservoir (675m3 capacity) which in turn feeds Bon Courage and Surinam
service tanks, each with a capacity of 450 m3. The Mont-Blanc reservoir
has an insufficient storage capacity. Surinam service tank serves a rural
area but is also connected to the distribution network in the town of
Sanillac. There is no immediate problem in the service area of this tank.
6.        The Mont-Blanc service tank serves Chamouny and Chemin Grenier
and feeds Bon Courage reservoir. The distribution system lies between
altitudes 190 m and 30 m, and is, therefore, subject to high variations in
pressure. The service area of Mont-Blanc tank would be better if limited
to an altitude about 80 - 85 m and if a new source to serve the lower
portion were created. The pipeline which feeds Bon Courage reservoir
serves Beau Champ and St Felix areas en route but requires to be enlarged
in order to meet the demand until the year 2000.
7.        The Bon Courage reservoir serves the coast.  It receives an
average of 530m3/day whilst the total demand (losses included) is about
800in3/day. The supply is interrupted 17 hours/day on average. The
distribution network is in a poor state because the pipes are too small and
leak heavily. Water rarely reaches the extreme portion of the distribution
pipeline at Choisy and Baie du Cap.
Mare aux Vacoas
8.        The Mare-aux-Vacoas (MAV) water supply system presently derives
about 74,800 m3/day of water from the MAV natural lake, the capacity of
which has been increased by damming the outlets and by about 51,000 m3/day
from 23 boreholes and wells in the Curepipe aquifer. Water from the lake
is treated in La Marie with a slow sand filter plant and distributed either
by gravity or by pumping. Surface water resources can no longer meet the
requirements of the networks and the Curepipe aquifer and a better
maintained distribution system should supply an increasing portion of the
daily consumption. Ten groundwater pumping stations are makeshift
installations, which are inefficiently and dangerous. They are unable to
increase their pumping from the aquifer during the rainy season, when the
water table is high, with the result that such surface water in the MAV
lake is lost instead of stored. Two existing boreholes (Highlands and
Stanley) are not properly equipped. Four pumping stations pump directly
into the network, four into service tanks, and two into the La Marie filter
plant. The 26 service reservoirs total 46,100 m3, giving only 9 hours
storage at the 1980 average production rate. Unaccounted for water is high
(40% of water produced). There are intermittent supplies to the consumer
because of inadequate capacities of the different elements of the water
supply system (production facilities, treated storage reservoirs, trunk
mains and distribution pipes in the project area).

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CWA's Training Needs and Training Program
1.        CWA's training needs were assessed in detail by two experts from
the UK National Water Coumcil's (NWC) Training Division in May 1978. CWA
was unable to obtain funds to implement NWC's training recommendations
other than to arrange for assistant tradesmen to receive short course
refresher-type training at the Industrial Trade Training Center at Beau
Bassin. This training was ad hoc and more relevant to domestic plumbing
installations than to pipework skills applicable to a water supply
distribution system. The NWC training recommendations were largely
confirmed during a biref study of "CWA's Problems" financed by CCCE and
prepared by an expert from Compagnie Generale des Eaux in March 1981.
Neither the CCCE study nor the NWC assessment quantified the training needs
identified, but both recommended, nevertheless, that CWA should convert
existing workshop accommodation for use as an off-the-job skills training
facility for manual technical grades. Examination of existing CWA workshop
and depot facilities has confirmed that none are suitable for this purpose.
2.        Analysis of CWA'S staffing levels and training needs indicates
that, allowing for the large number of unskilled staff (labourers,
watchmen, etc.) and staff whose training needs are not water-related
(drivers), the balance of existing technical staff, excluding engineers,
whose training needs cannot be met from the existing education and training
sector, amounts to about 750 staff. The breakdown of this group is as
follows:
Job Title                       In Post          Sanctioned

ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 3
One ialf of the complement of the non-professional technical staff have
been employed for more than fifteen years on water supply operations.
Staff attrition is primarily through retirement. One fifth of the existing
staff will retire over the next ten years at an average rate of 45 per
year. Taking these factors into account the resultant estimated training
load, while substantial, is not execessiver.
3.        Training in basic manual and trade skills will be provided
off-the-job using surplus training capacity available at the Development
Works Corporation (DWC) skills training centers. One of these five
centers, (total capacity 200 training places), will be partially converted
and appropriately equipped to provide basic and refresher training in
skills related to the operation, construction, extension, inspection,
repair and maintenance of water supply production and distribution systems
and plant, including techniques of leak detection and prevention.
Follow-up on-the-job training will be provided by works overseers,
inspectors and foremen who will receive training for this role. Skills
upgrading in general trades such as wood and metalwork, electro-mechanical
and building construction will be provided from the existing range of DWC
short modular courses.
4.        The training of CWA medium level technical, administrative and
clerical staff currently comprising about 43U people will be providea
mostly in-house. Existing CWA accommodation will be furnished and equipped
with audio-visual training aids to provide a modest lecture/seminar
facility for about twenty persons. The program will focus upon orientation
training, inter-departmental communication and relationships and small
group training in the management and administrative procedures to. be
introduced unaer the Action Plan (para. 4.15). It is anticipated that the
UNDP-financed training program for managerial staff will be incorporated
into one overall staft training program. In the event the training of
managerial staff is not provided through bilateral or multilateral
arrangements, the training program financed under the proposed project
would be extended in order to ensure the training of this staff category.
5.        A small training section comprising one training officer and two
training assistants/instructors will be established within the personnel
department. The aim will be to identify suitably motivated and reasonably
experienced existing CWA staff to man this section. No formal programs are
currently available in Mauritius to train instructors and full-time
training specialists. The designate training staff will therefore undergo
thorough training in the diagnosis of training needs, the design, planning,
administration, delivery and validation of training programs both
off-the-job and on-the-job, in an appropriate overseas training
institution.
6.        The development of CWA'S manpower planning and training
capability and the implementation of the first phase of a CWA training
program (1984-1986) woula require the assistance of a training expert with
substantial and appropriate water sector experience. About 18 man-months
of expert assistance would be financed under the proposed bank project.
This assistance would be provided through short term missions over a three
year period commencing with the establishment of the CWA training section.

8.        If effectively organized and administered the proposed CWA
training system should succeed in accressing the priority and peak training
needs of the Authority within the project period. However, although some
leveling-off can be anticipated there is i ttle doubt that the continued
institutional development of CWA will require the permanent support
services of a training section or unit.

WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions in the Financial Projection
Revenues
1.        Average tariff levels has been assumed to increase by 15% for
FY83, 23% for FY84 and 33% for FY85, the average annual rates of increase
required to reach the total revenue in FY86 that will yield a rate of
return of 8% for that year on revalued net fixed assets in operation.
Other revenues which mainly arise from profits on installation and interest
receivable, have been assumed at the real level for FY81, increased by the
assumed annual inflation rate of 15% thereafter.
Operating Expenses
2.        Operating expenses including personnel expenses are based on
forecasts produced by CWA at negotiations and appear reasonable.
Depreciation
3.        An annual average rate of 3.5% straight line has been used,
applied to revalued gross fixed assets in service.
Capital Expenditures
4.        Capital investments comprise the expenditures estimated by the
consultants but modified by the mission, needed to carry out CWA's
development program through FY89, escalated at the following rates:
1982      1983       1984-86       1987-89
Local                 15%        15%         15%           15%
Foreign                9%         8%        7.5%            6%
Borrowings
5.        Assumed borrowings are in accordance with Annex 14 and the
assumed terms for the loans are given in Annex 15.
Current Assets
6.        Receivables for water bills have been assumed as equivalent to
four months water revenue for FY82 and three months for each year
thereafter. Other receivables have been assumed to increase with inflation
at the same rates as operating costs.
Inventories
7.        Inventory levels have been assumed at 0.9% of revalued gross
assets in service each year, the FY81 percent level. Rs 55 million of



- 62 --
ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 2
materials awaiting installation which were included in Work in Progress at
end FY81, are assumed to be used in the development program through FY88.
Cash
8.        Working cash has been assumed at the aggregate of: 12% of cash
operating; 5% of construction; 50% of debt service; less 4.2% of revenue.
Payables
9.        Payables have been assumed at 1.5 months cash operating expenses,
and 50% of interest as the greater portion of debt service is payable
annually.
Consumer Deposits
10.       Security deposits from consumers have been forecast to increase
at the same rate as domestic consumers - 2% for FY82, 5% for FY83-85 and 2%
thereafter.
