WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                      Central Water Authority (CWA)
Guarantor:                     Mauritius
Amount:                        US$12.2 million including capitalized front-end fee
Terms:                         17 years, including 4 years grace at the standard
variable interest rate.
Project:                       The project's objectives are to improve the
capabilities of CWA's management and staff, the
efficiency of CWA's operations, and the quality of
service to consumers, and to reduce unaccounted-for
water. The project would improve and expand water
supply facilities in the Mare-aux-Vacoas, Triolet
and Mt. Blanc areas and in 62 housing estates
scattered over the island. It would also include a
training component and supply of spare parts and
equipment for the CWA.
Benefits:                      The project would satisfy the water supply demand
in the project areas. Combined with the project
financed by the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds in the
Mare-aux-Vacoas area, it would provide safe water
to about 79,000 additional consumers and
improvement of service to about 446,000 consumers.
More generally, all water supply consumers would
benefit from CWA's improved management and
operations.
Risks:                         The main project risks relate to delays which may
occur during engineering and construction of the
project because of CWA's limited implementation
capacity.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
CENTRAL WATER AUTHORITY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MAURITIUS
FOR A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Central Water Authority (CWA) with the guarantee of Mauritius, for the
equivalent of US$12.2 million to help provide financing for a water supply
project. The loan will be for 17 years, including a 4-year grace period at the
standard variable interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled Recent Developments and Prospects (No.
2962-MAS) dated May 26, 1982 has been distributed to the Executive Directors.
Following the publication of this report a new Government was elected on June
11, 1982. Discussions with the new government indicate a strong interest on the
part of the Government to continue and strengthen the Bank Group's program of
project work and economic advice. Country, social and economic data sheets are
provided in Annex I to this Report.
3.        The 1981 population estimate for Mauritius was 957,000, of which
940,000 resided on the main island. The country has an area of about 2,000
square kilometers, just over half of which is cultivable. The population
density of the main island is 506 per square kilometer. Despite significant
expansion of other sectors since the early 1970s, sugar production continues to
utilize about 90 percent of the cultivable area. With a GNP per capita of about
$1,340 in 1981, Mauritius enjoys a standard of living comparable to that of a
middle-income developing country, including high standards of nutrition, health
care, and general education, exceeding by far the standards of neighboring
countries. The adult literacy rate is over 84 percent, life expectancy is about
65 years, and basic needs are extensively covered. The current population growth
rate is estimated at 1.4 percent.
4.        At the beginning of the 1980s the Government of Mauritius faced severe
financial difficulties which resulted from a combination of excess demand in the
aftermath of boom and bust in the country's dominant economic activity, sugar;
decelerating growth in industry and tourism; a decline in the rate of domestic
and foreign private investment; high and rising debt service obligations
incurred both on non-project borrowing and borrowing to finance a much-increased
public sector investment program; and rising import prices, especially for
energy. In recognition of the serious economic consequences which would result
from failure to stabilize the financial situation, the Government embarked on a
program of fiscal, monetary and balance of payments measures supported by three



- 2 -
successive IMF stand-by arrangements (October 1979, September 1980, December
1981) accompanied, notably, by devaluation of the rupee of 30 percent in October
1979 and the 20 percent exchange rate adjustment of September 1981. Following
discussions and negotiations between the Mauritian authorities and the World
Bank, which began in mid-1980, an IBRD loan was approved on May 26, 1981, in
support of a program of structural adjustment, which was set forth in the
statement of Development Policy prepared by the Government in April 1981.
5.        In December 1981, the IMF approved a Standby Agreement of SDR 30
million, to be released in four tranches. The first two tranches have been
drawn, the third depended on a mid-term review initially scheduled for June
1982. Because of the elections this was not held until November 1982. The
review was successfully completed early November 1982 allowing release of the
third tranche.
6.        The adjustment program which was developed took into account the
following considerations: the Government would have to ensure continued
strength of the productive sectors, in particular the sugar industry, which had
in recent years not been investing adequately. However, sugar production could
not grow fast enough to provide the necessary export earnings or government
revenues. A broad-based growth policy was therefore needed, placing emphasis on
industrial production and exports, on agricultural production other than sugar
so as to reduce food imports, on tourism, and on developing alternative energy
sources. The adjustment program also provided for a restructuring of the public
sector investment program, a reduction in investment in housing and improved
efficiency in certain aspects of public expenditure (education, tea, development
works).
7.        In this context, the Government has implemented a number of measures
in the productive sectors in the past two years, which have established favor-
able initial conditions for attracting and promoting investment in new manufac-
turing activities, encouraging export processing, and reducing the country's
reliance on imported energy. Institutional machinery has been set up and
studies are in progress to rationalize the sugar industry, to evaluate options
for agricultural diversification, and to remove constraints to further develop-
ment of tourism. A crucial part of the Government's adjustment and stabiliza-
tion program has been a wage policy intended to reduce inflation and to keep the
prices of labor-intensive exports competitive by moderating increases in nominal
wages. In each of the past three years public sector and minimum wage rates
have increased substantially less than the cost of living and, most recently, no
increase in public sector wages has been accorded following the September 1981
exchange rate adjustment. Real wages have thus declined substantially since
mid-1979.
8.        However, some politically difficult issues remain to be addressed,
while in addition, in 1980 and 1981, factors beyond the Government's control
(cyclones and drought, adverse movements in the exchange rate, introduction by
one of Mauritius' major trade partners of a voluntary quota on imports of one of
Mauritius' most dynamic exports: knitwear) had a negative impact on Mauritius'
economy. Thus to safeguard future creditworthiness, to maintain the confidence
of domestic and foreign investors, and to ensure access to a level of foreign
financing adequate to support even modest growth during a period of structural



- 3 -
transformation, the Government will need to strengthen its effort to compress
aggregate demand and imports, to improve its foreign exchange reserve position,
and to move with determination to implement action programs in the productive
and foreign exchange earning sectors of the economy.
Current Economic Situation
9.        The economic performance of 1980 was extremely disappointing.  Cyclone
damage reduced the sugar crop by 30 percent from its level of 1979. The impact
of the shortfall was transmitted immediately to the rest of the economy, and
there was a sharp contraction of economic activity. With the exception of
tourism and government services, all sectors of the economy registered a signi-
ficant decline. In 1980 GDP was about 8.8 percent lower than in 1979. Economic
recovery in 1981 did not compensate for the decline of 1980. Sugar production
recovered but was still below normal because of a drought in the early part of
the year. The good performance of non-sugar manufacturing, which benefitted
from the success of knitwear exports-to new markets and a shift in domestic
demand towards locally produced goods, was offset by the decline in construction
activity resulting from higher costs for materials and credit restraints. On
the demand side, gross capital formation continued to follow the declining trend
initiated in 1978, largely as a consequence of the successive losses incurred by
the sugar industry in 1979, 1980, and 1981.
10.       The slowdown of economic activity was associated with a decline in
employment. Employment surveys in September 1980 and March 1981 indicated
successive reductions in the number of jobs. Registered unemployment in
September 1980 increased by 9,000 over 1979 and has continued to increase
sharply.
11.       Government current account balances for 1979/80 and 1980/81 continued
to show a deficit. The Government's success in reducing the 1979/80 deficit to
only about one third of the 1978/79 deficit was short-lived since the bad sugar
crop, the 1979 devaluation, and lower sugar prices in FY 1981 tended to depress
exports and government revenues. The current fiscal deficit for 1980/81 was
about the same magnitude as in 1978/79. With continued growth of government
expenditure, the overall deficit increased from 10.8 percent of GDP in 1979/80
to 12.8 percent in 1980/81.
1982 Outlook
12.     The new Government which took office in June 1982 has taken a number of
actions to prompt economic recovery and lay the basis through structural reforms
for longer term development. The economic outlook for 1982 points to an
economic recovery which will provide an opportunity for the Government to
improve its financial situation and its foreign exchange situation. The
anticipated increase in sugar output is expected to more than offset the
depressed price level on the free market. This improved situation is likely to
be reflected in the rest of the economy. The Government has resisted the
temptation to increase spending and has maintained the momentum of the
adjustment efforts undertaken in 1980 and 1981, limiting import growth and
reducing the balance of payments deficit. Unfortunately net government



revenue depends on taxes on imported goods. The decline in imported goods had a
direct impact on government revenues which fell below expectations and the
Government deficit could not be reduced as anticipated.
Prospects for 1983 - 1986
13.       The economy is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 3.5
percent over the period 1982-86.  This scenario assumes the continuation of the
adjustment efforts and a series of policy changes at the sector level. It also
assumes a substantial effort on the part of the international community to
maintain aid levels and a continuation of IMF assistance. The investment rate
in 1982 needs to be held to 24 percent, in line with the proposed demand
management policies and anticipated foreign financing, to help restore a sound
financial position for future development. In the later years of the period the
investment rate should decline to about 17 percent, reflecting in particular a
shift away from investment in construction.
14.       A compression of budgetary growth and an increase in the consolidated
domestic revenues of the Government are necessary conditions for the Govern-
ment's ability to finance a level of public investment about 20 percent less
than that in the Public Sector Investment Program. If the government were to
improve income tax collection, and to introduce new taxes (such as an ad valorem
sales tax and a tax on urban and rural property), this would permit government
revenues to grow on average by about 6 percent a year in real terms while
implying only a modest increase in the tax/GDP ratio from 22 percent in 1980/81
to 24 percent in 1983/84. Restraining the growth of current expenditure to
about 3.5 percent per year in real terms could be achieved by continuing in
1982/83 and 1983/84 the Government's present policy of compensating wages and
salaries for only part of the inflation in the previous year, reducing
significantly the subsidy on rice and wheat flour in 1982/83 and continuing to
reduce it over the next five years, and reducing expenditure on private schools,
while providing enough resources for government purchases of goods and services
and other current government transfers to increase in line with the projected
growth of GDP in nominal terms.
15.       Under these conditions the Government current account balance would
begin to show a surplus by 1982/83 and the overall Government deficit would
decline from 13 percent of GDP in 1980/81 to about 6 percent of GDP in 1985/86.
This amount of deficit is compatible with the amount of gross external borrowing
that Mauritius is likely to obtain from project financing as well as
from direct balance of payments support. The rest would have to come from
domestic sources, i.e., borrowing from the banking system and from profit
transfers from public enterprises. This overall program will undoubtedly call
for continued discipline but is very much in line with the Government's present
commitment to provide the financial framework to support structural reforms.
Creditworthiness
16.       The Government's borrowing program, together with the effect of the
supply-side measures in the adjustment program to increase exports, imply a debt



service ratio rising to about 15 percent by 1985 and then declining slightly by
the end of the decade. Many developing countries have experienced higher ratios
than this. Nevertheless, government recognizes that the present level
represents a warning, for the following reasons: (i) Mauritius is an open
economy where exports account for almost 40 percent of GDP; (ii) Mauritius is
heavily dependent on a single export crop for which prices fluctuate on the
world market, and production is affected by cyclones; (iii) Mauritius no longer
has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to face the eventuality of a major
cyclone; and (iv) any growth in the debt service ratio as rapid as the one
recently experienced requires careful attention. Given the Government's
recognition of the problem, and its determination and demonstrated ability to
follow a program of structural adjustment, complemented by continued standby
programs with the IMF, and assuming continued dynanism in its major export
earning industries, Mauritius is creditworthy for the Government's borrowing
program.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       To date Mauritius has received five IDA credits and thirteen Bank
loans (including one loan on Third Window terms) totalling $136.7 million, to
help finance projects in industry ($39.5 million), power ($22.0 million), the
port ($13.6 million), agriculture and rural development ($9.4 million), urban
development ($15.0 million), education ($22.2 million) and structural adjustment
($15.0 million). The most recent loan approved by the Executive Directors was
for $6.0 million for the Sixth Line of Credit to the Development Bank of
Mauritius (Ln. 2164-MAS). An IFC loan for hotel construction was approved by
the IFC in 1981, but was subsequently cancelled because the sponsors decided to
postpone the project. IFCGis at present considering other proposed investments.
18.       The Bank plans to support the Government's program of structural
adjustment with a lending program which emphasizes the transfer of resources
through non-project aid and technical assistance through economic and sector
work. The program will also continue to concentrate on supporting the
Government's strategy of economic diversification and employment creation
through the development of industry, energy, and necessary infrastructure to
meet the needs of growing industrialization. We intend accordingly to
participate in projects designed to improve and expand public infrastructure and
related institutions.  A road maintenance project is under preparation.  We may
also support the Government's educational reforms through a third education
project, depending on steps taken by government to strengthen its program of
technical education and training.
19.       Implementation of current projects is generally satisfactory.  On the
other hand, the first rural development project had mixed succes in achieving
its objectives, while the tea project, also recently completed, encountered
problems caused by falling international tea prices, inadequacies in project
management and equipment, and lack of interest from smallholders in taking over
tea plots. A project follow-up unit is being established in the Ministry of
Economic Planning and Development, under the IFAD-financed Small-Scale
Agriculture Development Project: this unit should lead to improvements in



project implementation. By and large, Mauritian implementing agencies are will
able to handle project responsibilities. Annex II contains a summary statement
of Bank Group operations in Mauritius as of September 30, 1982, as well as notes
on the status of ongoing projects.
20.       Mauritius' disbursement performance has been reasonably close to the
Bank-wide average. The inclusion of the rapidly disbursed first SAL, signed on
June 12, 1981, effective on June 24, 1981, completely disbursed by January 7,
1982, led to a substantial increase in the average in FY82.
21.       Four audit reports on projects in Mauritius have thus far been
prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department. Report No. 2101 of June 20,
1978 on the first line of credit made to the Development Bank of Mauritius (Cr.
313-MAS) showed that the project had made a valuable contribution to development
of the Mauritian economy. Report No. 3761 of December 31, 1981 on the Tea
Development Project (Cr. 239-MAS) discussed the problems encountered by the
project (para. 19), and concluded that it had not been successful, especially
because of the institutional difficulties arising from the agency created in
connection with the project, the Tea Development Authority. Report No. 4008 of
June 28, 1982 on the Coromandel Industrial Estate (Cr. 411-MAS) concluded that
general objectives of the project had been met, i.e., facilitating industrial
development and employment generation through provision of serviced sites;
however, specific targets on investment and employment were not achieved. In
addition financial performance of the industrial estate has to date been
significantly below expectation. A fourth report on the Rural Development
Project, Report No. 3988 of June 22, 1982, was critical of the design of the
project particularly the failure of its few productive elements.
III. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
22.       Water resources in Mauritius are generally abundant throughout the
year. Average yearly rainfall increases from 1,500 mm in the eastern coastal
plains to 5,000 mm in the high central plateau and decreases to 900 mm in the
western coastal plains. Water flows from the mountains and the central plateau
through a complex hydrographic system and through the aquifers found in the
porous rocks of the island's younger volcanic formations. All surface or
groundwater is state-owned. Water use is regulated by a department of the
Central Water Authority (CWA), the proposed Borrower. In some areas, conflicts
exist about water rights among large raw water consumers such as sugar
industries, for irrigation and milling, and hydro power stations. However the
existing conflicts do not involve potable water supply, and there are no legal
obstacles to Bank lending for a water supply project.
Water Supply
23.       Water supply in the island has developed as three main systems:  (1)
the Port Louis system serving the capital city and the neighboring industrial
areas, (2) the Mare-aux-Vacoas system which serves the principal urban areas of

Plaines Wilhems in the center of the island and rural communities on the west
coast, and (3) the District system which serves the smaller communities and
rural areas on the remainder of the island. Of the 940,000 people living on the
island, 99 percent have access to piped water supply, 44 percent through 94,000
piped connections, 50 percent through 1,200 standpipes (one to four families)
and 2,000 public fountains, and about 5 percent through private systems owned by
sugar estates. Industries, government entities and commerce are supplied
through 9,000 piped connections. All three distribution systems suffer from
very high water losses, mostly in the urban areas.  Thirty-five percent of water
produced is unaccounted for, about half of which is lost due to leakage, and the
other half is consumed but not billed (under-metering, under-estimation and
illegal connections).
Sanitation
24.       About 53 percent of the total population is estimated to be serviced
by the public sewerage system. About 20 housing estates have their own sewerage
systems. The rest of the island depends mainly on individual sanitary
facilities, such as septic tanks and pit latrines. There are several public
sewerage systems, two in Port Louis, where about 54 percent of the population is
served, and two in the urban areas in the center of the island where the level
of service is about 44 percent. Sewerage planning, operation and maintenance
need to be improved. In both systems, the number of illicit stormwater
connections is high. This increases operating expenses, overloads facilities
and encourages premature investment to expand capacity. Sewerage costs are
covered mainly by the Government's general budget, only 3 percent being
recovered from the serviced population through a sewerage tax based on the
rental value of houses.
Sector Organization
25.       CWA has responsibility for all matters relating to water including the
exploration for and inventorying of water resources, development and operation
of water systems for household, industrial, commercial and irrigation. Under
the existing legislation CWA also has responsibility for sewerage. However, no
steps have been taken to date to transfer sewerage from the Ministry of Works,
and it is agreed that the transfer should not occur until CWA's overall
management performance has substantially improved. The supply of irrigation
water and the charges for this service are CWA responsibilities. Recently, an
*             Irrigation Authority has been established in connection with the Northern Plains
Irrigation Project. The water purchased in bulk from CWA is distributed in the
project area by the Irrigation Authority.
26.       The Ministry of Energy and Internal Communications (formerly Ministry
of Power, Fuel and Energy) is responsible for the sector. The Ministry retains
tight control over the activities of the CWA because of its weak managerial
performance, its broad responsibilities and its dependence on the government
budget for operating subsidies. In 1978 the management consulting firm of
Coopers and Lybrand (UK) made recommendations that the Government reinforce
CWA's autonomy. This was not done, because of the need to first strengthen
CWA's management and improve its finances. In an endeavour to improve operating



- 8 -
and organizational efficiency by the end of FY84, CWA has agreed to introduce a
number of institutional, financial, technical and administrative measures, in
accordance with a timetable set out in an Action Plan agreed with the Bank
(Schedule 5, draft Loan Agreement).
27.       CWA has a staff of about 2000, half of which are in unskilled grades.
Compared to other water utilities, CWA is currently overstaffed, but the extent
of overemployment would be difficult to estimate without considerable
rationalization of the staffing structure accompanied by a detailed manpower
planning analysis. CWA has agreed to prepare a manpower plan by August 31, 1984
(Schedule 5, draft Loan Agreement). In order to improve CWA's efficiency FAC
and CCCE are providing substantial technical assistance with the objective of
establishing an efficient organization by the end of FY84. CWA will consult
with the Bank on proposals for reorganizing or changing its administrative
procedures and organizational structure before introducing changes (Section
4.02, draft Loan Agreement). Technical assistance is a key factor for the
institution building objective of the proposed project, and CWA has agreed to
continue the technical assistance presently in place or make other satisfactory
arrangements for its continuance (Section 4.01 (b), draft Loan Agreement).
Investment Program
28.       CWA's investment program for the period 1981-86, of which the Bank
financed project is an integral part, is being financed by the Caisse Centrale,
the Abu Dhabi and Kuwait Funds, the AfDB, USAID, and FAC. Financing of the
program was coordinated at a meeting held under the auspices of the CCCE in
Paris in July 1981 at which the Bank, the Kuwait Fund, and the AfDB were
represented. The agreements concerning financing of the various components of
the program were based on a Master Plan for Water Resources proposed by the
consulting group SIGMA-SOGREAH.
29.       In the Port Louis water supply system the extension of La Marie
Treatment Plant and the construction of several transmission mains and
reservoirs would be completed under an ongoing project assisted by AfDB.
Distribution networks in three areas would be extended, and equipment and pipes
to improve the Port Louis system would be supplied under a third credit by
CCCE. In the Mare-aux-Vacoas water supply system, the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi
Funds agreed in early 1982 to finance the improvement of the surface water
pumping plant, rehabilitation of the distribution network, leak detection
equipment, and mechanical and meter repair shops.  USAID is financing
distribution and household connections on some 42 housing estates. The Bank
project would complement the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds and the USAID projects,
but is not dependent on them in terms of implementation or expected benefits.
Because the CCCE loan would finance technical assistance for the CWA, the Bank
would reserve the right to suspend loan disbursements if CCCE were to suspend
its Loan and no alternative sources of financing were available (Section 6.01
(b)(ii), draft Loan Agreement). This is the only cross-default provision
linking the Bank financing with that of one of the other lenders to CWA.

Sector Objectives and Strategy
30.       The Government's objectives in the water supply sector are (1) to
improve the supply to ensure total coverage and meet future demand, (2) to
improve the quality of service by provision of continuous instead of
intermittent service, and (3) to make CWA financially self-sufficient. This
strategy is consistent with the public sector investment program agreed in the
context of the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL-I) based on rehabilitation and
improvement of necessary infrastructure to meet the needs of growing
industrialization and tourism. To carry out its objectives the Government is
mobilizing external aid to assist the financing of CWA's investment program, and
obtaining technical assistance from France and UNDP to improve CWA's
management.
31.       In the sanitation subsector the Government's main objective is to
improve the standard of service. It intends to have a sanitation subsector
study carried out and a sanitation Master Plan for all the island prepared by
consultants in order to establish clear development priorities. Aid agencies
are being approached to finance this study. In the meantime a detailed
sanitation Master Plan for the center of the island will be prepared under
French bilateral aid. Under the Urban project (see para. 33) the Government
agreed to carry out a study of the costs of investments in and operation and
maintenance of its sewerage system so as to develop an appropriate tariff
structure.
Bank Group Involvement and Strategy
32.       Since 1973 the Bank has had a continuous dialogue with the Government
and CWA on the subject of water supply and project financing. The Bank posed
three conditions for Bank appraisal of a project: first, Government commitment
to a sound water tariff policy; second, preparation of a meaningful investment
program; and third, preparation of a plan to strengthen CWA. In 1978, a water
tariff study and a water rights legislation study were carried out under the
WHO/IBRD Cooperative program. By 1981, sufficient progress towards meeting the
Bank's conditions had been made to allow appraisal to take place. Furthermore,
the policy that CWA should eventually become financially self-sufficient
appeared to have taken root. The water tariff has been increased several times
since 1974, the latest increase of 20 percent having been introduced at the
9              beginning of calendar 1982.
33.       The Bank has also been involved in the sector through the Urban
Rehabilitation and Development Project (Ln. 1926-MAS) of December 9, 1980 which
includes a $1.9 million component for rehabilitation of sewerage, drainage, and
water supply for four Central Housing Authority estates, and a $0.7 million
component for solid waste management for Port-Louis. The implementation of
these components by CWA has been proceeding satisfactorily. All major civil
works contracts have been awarded and the project is expected to be completed on
schedule.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The project was prepared by the Central Water Authority, with
assistance from the consultants SIGMA-SOGREAH financed by CCCE, and Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners (UK) financed by CWA.  It was appraised in October
1981. Negotiations were held in Washington from October 12 to 15, 1982. The
Mauritian delegation was led by Mr. Khodadeen Sumodhee, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Energy and Internal Communications. A report entitled "Mauritius,
Water Supply Project, Staff Appraisal Report" (No. 3878-MAS, dated November 17,
1982) is being distributed separately. A map, IBRD No. 16208R, showing the
projects areas, is attached.
Project Objectives and Description
35.       The project forms part of the CWA 1981-86 investment program.  Its
objectives are, in conjunction with projects financed by other agencies, to
improve the capabilities of CWA's management and staff, the efficiency of CWA's
operations, and the quality of service to consumers. The project would improve
and expand water supply facilities in the Triolet and Mt. Blanc subsystems and
in the groundwater pumping schemes of the Mare-aux-Vacoas system and in 62
Central Housing Authority (CHA) estates. It would include supply of spare parts
and equipment for CWA as a whole, implementation of a training program and
provision of consulting services. It comprises the following components:
(i)  Supply and installation of pumping equipment for about 13
groundwater pumping stations and one booster station;
(ii) Construction of pumping stations, including new boreholes and
reservoirs in the groundwater pumping stations of the Mare-aux-
Vacoas system. Construction of two distribution reservoirs, each
of 6,000 m3 capacityS in the Mare-aux-Vacoas system, one
reservoir of 1,000 m capacity and two smaller reservoirs in the
Mt. Blanc subsystem;
(iii) Leak detection works in the Triolet and Mt. Blanc subsystems;
(iv) Supply and laying of pipes to rehabilitate, strengthen and extend
the distribution networks in Triolet, Mt. Blanc and 62 different
CHA estates and to supply the two new distribution reservoirs in
the Mare-aux-Vacoas system;
(v)  Supply and laying of about 6,700 new metered household
connections in part of the CHA estates and in the Triolet and
Mt. Blanc subsystems;
(vi) Civil works for site offices and reservoir keepers' quarters in
the Triolet and Mt. Blanc subsystems;



- 11 -
(vii) Supply of spare parts for water meters, supply of about nine
vehicles and miscellaneous equipment;
(viii)  Development of an in-service training program to address,
initially, priority training areas, supply of training equipment
and provision of training consultant services;
(ix) Provision of engineering consultant services to carry out
hydrogeological studies of the Curepipe aquifer, to carry out the
detailed design studies of the project in the Mare-aux-Vacoas and
District system and to supervise construction of the project in
all project areas.
Financial Management
36.       CWA's past performance has been characterized by recurring annual
deficits reaching from 301 percent of gross revenue in 1974 (the first full year
of operation). CWA broke even in FY80 following a 400 percent tariff increase,
but the Authority was again in deficit in FY81. The situation arose in part
from government's reluctance to increase tariffs to a level needed to make CWA
into a financially viable institution as well as its willingness from FY75-81 to
provide CWA with both operating and capital expenditure subsidies required to
cover deficits. Agreement with the IMF in FY81 precluded further operating
subsidies and an awareness now exists that adequate tariffs need to be charged
to consumers to cover operating costs, debt service and to finance a reasonable
portion of capital expenditures. However, in December 1981 the Government
realized that AfDB, CCCE, Kuwait Fund and IBRD would not provide financial
assistance until tariffs were increased and therefore tariffs were raised by an
average of 20 percent from January 1, 1982.
37.       In an Action Plan agreed with the Bank (para. 36) CWA has undertaken
inter alia to revert to billing based on meter reading. Government has
confirmed that CWA will increase tariffs by 15 percent on January 1, 1983 and on
July 1, 1983 which should enable CWA to achieve an operating ratio of 95 percent
for FY84, and that CWA will continue to adjust tariffs at six-monthly intervals
thereafter to achieve an operating ratio of 80 percent in FY85 and a rate of
return of not less than 8 percent for FY86 and beyond (Section 5.05 (a), draft
Loan Agreement). Government has also provided assurances that it would take all
measures necessary to assist CWA in carrying out its Action Plan and in making
the required tariff adjustments (Section 2.01 (b), draft Guarantee Agreement).
38.       The 8 percent financial rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation for FY86 and each year thereafter would be appropriate as it
approximates the opportunity cost of capital in the island and as the tariff
levels derived approximate the economic price of water. For the purpose of the
financial rate of return calculation, CWA will revalue fixed assets in operation
annually using a method of valuation acceptable to the Bank (Section 5.05 (d),
draft Loan Agreement). Even at the increased tariff level of FY86 (averaging Rs
1.85/m3 at 1981 price levels), water needs would be affordable since a family of



- 12 -
five consuming 50 lcd would have to pay Rs 14/month which represents only 1.1
percent of the household income for a family at the relative poverty level and
1.6 percent for a family at the absolute poverty level.
39.       Receivables for water bills were the equivalent of about six months'
water revenue at the end of FY81. Therefore, in order to improve its liquidity
position, CWA has taken action to reduce the outstanding amount to less than
four months' billing, thereby fulfilling a condition of negotiations, and will,
starting in FY83, keep outstanding customer accounts for water below
the equivalent of three months' billings (Section 5.06 (a), draft Loan
Agreement). Moreover, to assist CWA in meeting this target the Government has
allowed CWA to reintroduce disconnection as a penalty for non-payment of bills.
By June 30, 1984, CWA will ensure that such penalty is enforced within two
months of billing (Section 5.06 (b), draft Loan Agreement).
40.       CWA financial projections show it should be able to service debt
incurred to date and to be incurred in carrying out its investment program,
provided that costs are controlled and tariffs are increased in a timely
manner. However, to safeguard the position, CWA would not incur any loan if
internal cash generation (gross revenue less operating expenses but before
provision for depreciation of assets, interest and other charges on debt) for
the previous year was below 1.5 times maximum future debt service on all loans
including the loan to be incurred (Section 5.04, draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
41.       With base cost estimates expressed in January 1983 prices, the total
cost of the project is estimated at $18.2 million, including taxes and some
import duties amounting to about $1.4 million, and the Bank front-end fee of
$0.2 million. The foreign exchange component is about $9.3 million. An
allowance of 10 percent was used for physical contingencies. Price
contingencies are estimated at 22.4 percent of total base costs including
physical contingencies. They are based on an annual 15 percent local inflation
rate and an international inflation rate decreasing from 8 percent in 1983 to 6
percent in 1987. The divergence between local and international inflation rates
is not expected to be compensated by regular and predictable adjustments in the
exchange rate. Therefore the overall project cost has been estimated using the
exchange rate prevailing in October 1982 of US$1=Rs 11. If the differential
rate of inflation were to be compensated regularly by adjustment of the exchange
rate, the US$ equivalent of total project costs would be reduced by about 7
percent.
42.       The proposed Bank loan of $12.2 million would finance 73 percent of
total project costs excluding taxes. The Bank contribution would finance 100
percent of the foreign costs including the front-end fee, and about 33 percent
of the local costs, excluding taxes and import duties. Local cost financing is
justified given the country's severe foreign exchange shortage and the
Government's efforts in cooperation with the Bank and the IMF to control public
expenditure and improve the balance of payments.



- 13 -
Project Implementation
43.       CWA would be responsible for implementation of the proposed project
and, once completed, for its operation and maintenance. CWA's Chief Engineer
for Planning and Design would administer and oversee the construction of the
project with the assistance of consulting engineers financed from the loan.
44.       A Project Preparation Advance, US$140,000 equivalent, was approved in
January 1982 to finance supplementary hydrogeological studies and the detailed
engineering required for this project. For this purpose CWA appointed
SIGMA-SOGREAH to be the engineering consultants. To carry out detailed design
for water supply in the CHA Estates which is a high priority component, CWA
appointed Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, financed by local funds. Detailed
design was completed in December 1981 and bids were received in May 1982 for
construction supervision. CWA would retain engineering consultants in
accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines on consultants published in August
1981 (Section 3.02, draft Loan Agreement).
45.       Under the proposed loan, training in manual and trade skills for
non-professional staff will be provided using surplus training facilities
available at the Development Works Corporation (DWC) centers. One of these five
centers (total capacity 200 training places), will be partially converted and
appropriately equipped to provide basic and refresher training in skills related
to the operation and maintenance of water supply production and distribution
systems and plant. Follow-up, on-the-job training will be provided by works
overseers, inspectors and foremen who will receive training for this role.
46.       Management training for CWA is expected to be provided through a
UNDP-financed project (for which the Bank is executing agency) designed to
improve managing skills in the planning, operation and control of departmental
functions. The program will be implemented by the Bank-financed training
component, which will include the establishment of a small training section
within CWA's personnel department. Staff selected to operate this training
section will follow an overseas training program acceptable to the Bank and
include training in the diagnosis of instructional needs, design and
administration of training programs. CWA would retain the assistance of experts
whose selection, qualifications, experience and conditions of employment would
be acceptable to the Bank to help it carry out the training program (Section
3.02, draft Loan Agreement).
f
47.       According to the implementation schedule, major works would be
tendered by August 1983 and the contracts awarded by December 1983.
Construction would be substantially completed by December 1987, except possibly
for some minor items. The project completion date is set for June 30, 1988 and
the Closing Date at June 30, 1989.



- 14 -
Procurement and Disbursements
48.       Except as indicated below all procurement for civil works totalling
$12.8 million, including contingencies, and for goods totalling $1.5 million,
including contingencies, would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Domestic
manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or the
import duty, whichever is the lowest. Civil works contracts of less than
$500,000 equivalent for the installation of service connections and the
construction of small buildings may be procured in accordance with local
procurement procedures which allow foreign bidders the opportunity to
participate. These regulations, as defined in CWA's "Financial Orders for
Tenders", were obtained at appraisal and were found to be satisfactory. Such
contracts shall not in the aggregate exceed $1.4 million equivalent.
Procurement of equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less and
which cannot be grouped into contracts of greater value may be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
examined and found to be satisfactory to the Bank; provided, however, that such
contracts shall not in the aggregate exceed $400,000 equivalent. Leak detection
works totalling $230,000, including contingencies, would be carried out on force
account by CWA with the assistance of consulting engineers.
49.       The Bank loan would be disbursed as follows:  (i) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local expenditures ex-factory and 65
percent of local expenditures ex-store on materials and equipment (excluding
pipes) and vehicles; (ii) 60 percent of total costs for pipes; (iii) 40 percent
of total costs for civil works; (iv) 100 percent of total costs for
consultants services; (v) recovery of the cost of the Project Preparation
Advance; and (vi) front-end fee. Retroactive financing of up to $1.2 million is
recommended to cover the foreign exchange costs of the supply and laying of
distribution pipes needed to supply the CHA estates and the supervision of this
component's construction after June 10, 1982 and prior to the date of the Loan
Agreement (Schedule 1, para. 4, draft Loan Agreement).
Accounts, Audit and Reporting
50.       CWA's accounting systems are commercially-oriented and maintained
manually with the exception of the billing and the payroll systems, which have
been computerized since 1975. Studies are underway to computerize the general
accounting system which is expected to be completed by the end of FY83. CWA's
finance division is headed by a competent chief accountant and is staffed with
qualified and experienced staff. However, since 1979 the finance division has
been faced with considerable arrears of work because of (a) a change in the
computer system in 1979; and (b) the changes in the tariff level and structure
that occurred in 1979 and 1980 but which were later withdrawn, leading to
refunds to consumers that caused an immense amount of unscheduled work. As a
result, the audit of the 1979 accounts was completed only in October 1981, and
those of 1980 and 1981 in mid-1982. CWA's accounts would be audited
annually by auditors acceptable to the Bank and CWA would furnish such accounts
to the Bank within six months after the end of each fiscal year (Section 5.02,



- 15 -
draft Loan Agreement). Within six months after project completion, CWA would
prepare and submit to the Bank a project completion report (Section 3.04 (e),
draft Loan Agreement).
Health and Environmental Aspects
51.        By providing sufficient piped water to people in project areas, the
project is expected to reduce the incidence and risk of disease attributable to
lack of safe and adequate water. The increase in water supplies would lead to
an increase of waste water.  In most of the project areas where the populaton
density is relatively low and the soil generally permeable this is acceptable,
but in some CWA estates of the Plaine Wilhems area, problems may be expected and
these are to be studied in a detailed waste water Master Plan being financed for
that area by French bilateral assistance (see para. 31).
Justification, Benefits and Risks
52.        The project would satisfy the water supply demands in the project
areas. Combined with the project financed by the Kuwait and Abu Dhabi Funds in
the Mare-aux-Vacoas area, it would, up to the year 2000, provide safe water to
about 79,000 additional people, improve service to about 446,000 people, allow
an increase in domestic consumption by 49,800 m3/day, and meet the needs of
commerce, industry and government whose water consumption is expected to
increase by about 7,600 m3/day. More generally, all water supply consumers
would benefit from CWA's improved management and operations. Through its
financial covenants and the Action Plan the project is expected to improve
substantially CWA's institutional effectiveness which should benefit CWA's
consumers.
53.        At an opportunity cost of capital of 7 percent in real terms, the long
term marginal cost of supply for the project areas is above the existing average
selling price for CWA as a whole; it is also above the average tariff projected
in the mid-80s, discounted to 1981 price levels. The reasons for this situation
are: (1) some of the existing assets in the CWA system are fully depreciated;
(2) standard tariffs apply throughout the island and water supplies outside the
project area relate mainly to Port-Louis where larger economies of scale exist;
and (3) portions of the investments in the project areas are for rehabilitation
and they will not generate incremental revenues but help to maintain existing
revenues.
54.        With shadow pricing of foreign exchange at 120 percent, the project's
internal rate of return is 3.7 percent using the projected average selling price
in 1986 discounted to 1981 price levels. Although low, the internal rate of
return is acceptable because it provides adequate funds to enable CWA to be
financially viable when taken together with the revenues from more prosperous
areas of the island. An economic rate of return incorporating all benefits
would be significantly higher, as a result of major public health and
environmental benefits from the project which are difficult to quantify.



- 16 -
55.       The main project risks relate to delays which may occur during
engineering and construction of the project because of CWA's limited
implementation capacity. The use of consulting engineers for engineering
studies and supervision of project construction, the management technical
assistance provided under the third CCCE loan and the improvement in service
brought about by recent AfDB and CCCE projects, should play an important role in
improving morale and efficiency in the sector and avoiding delays in
implementation.  The project risks appear moderate compared to the substantial
benefits which are expected from its implementation.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CWA, the draft Guarantee
Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank and the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
57.       Features of special interest are referred to in Section III of
Annex III of this report. A special remedy is included to allow the Bank to
suspend in the event that funds for technical assistance for the strengthening
of CWA's management cease to be available and no alternative sources of
financing are found.
58.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Status of Projects in Execution as of September 30, 1982 1/
Loan No. 976-MAS      Port Project:  US$10.0 million Loan of April 12, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: June 13, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Loan No. 1339-T-MAS: Revised Port Project: US$3.6 million Third Window Loan of
December 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: July 27, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The main elements of the project have been completed including the
construction of three deep water berths, two transit sheds and open storage areas.
As a result of this increased capacity the port is now operating without congestion.
Physical execution is proceeding well. Construction work is well advanced on the
administration workshop and fire-station buildings and they are expected to be
commissioned by September 1982. Port operating equipment has been procured and cargo
handling operations have improved. Technical assistance financed under the project
has had beneficial effects on the administration of the Mauritius Marine Authority.
The closing date was extended by one year in order to finish construction of the
administration building and to complete dredging works.
Loan No. 1481-MAS    Fourth Development Bank Project:  US$7.5 million Loan of August
29, 1977; Date of Effectiveness; October 6, 1977; Closing
Date: December 31, 1982.
The loan provides financing for the term foreign exchange needs of medium-
and large scale industrial, tourism and agro-industrial projects. The loan is fully
committed.
Loan No. 1543-MAS    Second Education Project:  US$15.2 million Loan of April 26,
1978; Date of Effectiveness: August 8, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The Project Unit continues to operate satisfactorily. Construction of 12
of the 15 Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) have been completed. The remaining three,
where expansion and upgrading are involved, are expected to be completed in
mid-1983. All 15 schools are in operation, although some have not yet attained full
capacity. Constrution of the additions to the Mauritius College of Education and the
Mauritius Institute of Education are expected to be completed in April 1983.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are being
encountered and the action taken to remedy them. They should be read in this
sense and with the understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced
evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
The construction of a building for the Ministry of Education may be deleted and funds
used for improvement of primary schools.  This proposed modification is under
review.   After substantial delay, the reorganization of MECA is now completed.
Educational objectives are expected to be substantially achieved upon completion of
the project. Project closing may have to be postponed by 18 to 24 months to finalize
the project.
Loan No. 1548-MAS    Power Transmission Project:  US$15 million Loan of April 26,
1978; Date of Effectiveness: January 23, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
The project consists of construction of 66-kV and lower voltage
transmission/distribution lines and substations; construction of a system control
center; consulting services and training. Almost all material and equipment have
already been ordered except for some distribution material and equipment.
Construction is progressing satisfactorily at various sites in the country to
construct substations and powerlines and the control center included in the project.
The project is satisfactorily on schedule and the original project cost estimate has
not changed. Studies for long range power planning, reorganization of CEB (Central
Electricity Board), energy sector planning and CEB training have been completed, and
recommendations of these studies are being implemented by the CEB.
Loan No. 1789-MAS    Fifth Development Bank Project:  US$6.0 million Loan of January
23, 1980; Date of Effectiveness: April 30, 1980; Closing
Date: December 31, 1983
The Project assists the Development Bank of Mauritius in financing directly
or through Mauritian-owned commercial banks the foreign exchange component of loans
and investments in industry, agro-industry and tourism. It also helps cover the
foreign exchange investment needs of artisan and small-scale enterprises. Because
clients of commercial banks were reluctant to use refinancing due to fear of the
foreign exchange risks, the $2.0 million earmarked for the purpose have been
reallocated to DBM's general lending operations; $0.5 million from the $1.0 million
earmarked for SSEs was also reallocated to the same category, because the level of
DBM's SSE approvals was less than anticipated.
Loan No. 1926-MAS   Urban Rehabilitation and Development Project:  US$15.0 million
Loan of January 8, 1981: Date of Effectiveness: May 5, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The Project will assist the Government in implementing a change in its
policy for providing housing in the public sector, including a reduction in overall
Government expenditure on housing, and redirection from building rental units at
subsidized rates, to provision of housing credit for lower income groups. It will
also strengthen institutions responsible for urban planning, development and
maintenance. The project includes (a) an integrated housing development at a site
(La Tour Koenig) near Port Louis, housing credit and establishment of a physical
planning unit in the Ministry of Planning; and (b) traffic management and

rehabilitation of urban services, to be funded by the Saudi Fund for
Development. Project implementation has started and is progressing
satisfactorily. Implementation of civil works is progressing with all major
contracts awarded. The project is expected to be completed on schedule by June,
P              1984.
Loan No. 2164-MAS        Sixth Development Bank Project:  US$6.0 million Loan of
June 30, 1982; Date of Effectiveness: September 22,
1982; Closing Date: December 31, 1988
The Project has two main purposes: (i) to finance studies of the
industrial and financial sectors, to be carried out by Government with the aid
of consultants, intended to develop policies and institutional arrangements
conducive to growth of industrial production and exports; and (ii) to assist DBM
in financing the foreign exchange component of loans and investments in
industry, agro-industry and tourism, including the foreign exchange component of
investment by small-scale enterprises. Disbursements have already started.
