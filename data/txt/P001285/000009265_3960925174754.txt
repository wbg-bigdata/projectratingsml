SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Kenya
National Extension Proiect (Credit 1 387-KE)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Kenya -
National Extension Project (Credit 1 387-KE)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office.
The project succeeded in introducing the Training and Visit (T&V) methodology
in the Kenyan extension service. Adoption of basic improvements in agricultural practices
has been widespread within the project area. Thus, the project outcome is considered
satisfactory even though implementation was affected by organizational changes within
the Ministry as well as procurement and disbursement difficulties. The Government has
greatly exceeded the staffing estimated as necessary at appraisal. This led to serious
funding difficulties for operational support, thereby placing the sustainability of the service
in doubt. The ongoing National Extension Project 11 (NEP-II) expects to address
organizational deficiencies including poor extension-research linkages.
The Project Completion Report provides an adequate record of implementation.
The project is expected to be audited together with NEP-II upon its completion.

NATIONAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1387-KE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the National Extension Project in
Kenya for which Credit 1387-KE, in the amount of SDR 13.9 million (US$15 million
equivalent), was approved on June 14, 1983. The credit closed on June 30, 1991, three and a
half years behind schedule. A total of SDR 12.2 million (88%) was disbursed. The last
disbursement was on November 27, 1991, after which an undisbursed balance of SDR 1.7
million was canceled. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) also
provided financing of US$6 million equivalent.
The Agricultural Operations Division, Country Department II, Africa Region prepared
Parts I and III; the Borrower provided Part II.
Preparation of this PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the
Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and
the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA
NATIONAL EXTENSION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1387-KE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.    The objective of the project was to achieve sustained increases in agricultural production in 30
of Kenya's 41 districts through the reorganization and strengthening of the agricultural extension
system and the improvement of linkages between research and extension. The project was based on
the methodology and lessons learned from successful Training and Visit (T&V) projects in other parts
of the world and on a pilot effort initiated in two districts in Kenya, and was seen as the first phase of
a multi-phased effort.
Implementation Experience
2.    The project was implemented generally in accordance with the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).
The T&V system was implemented with some variations to conform to local conditions. Both
orientation and in-service training were carried out as planned. The merging of the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Livestock Development (MOLD) in 1984 resulted in the
project covering livestock as well as crop extension, which continued even after the two ministries
were re-divided in 1987. The reorganization of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) had
a disruptive effect on research-extension linkages. The number of incremental staff hired under the
project far exceeded appraisal estimates, giving rise to problems with financing non-salary operating
costs. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) was not carried out systematically, with the result that the
impact of the new extension system could not be accurately measured. There were initial problems in
procurement of vehicles which impeded project implementation, and most of the project funds
allocated for equipment and civil works were not utilized. The project was substantially completed
three and a half years later than estimated.
Results
3.    The project introduced the T&V system of extension management that ensured regular visits
by extension staff to farmers, organized reporting and supervision at all levels of management, and
provided regular bi-weekly and monthly in-service training for extension staff. New technologies and
innovations have been extended to small farmers, and studies have shown yield increases for maize,
beans and potatoes. The project was phased into the 30 districts as planned. Stronger linkages
between research and extension were encouraged, although these deteriorated during the latter part of
the project.



- iv -
4.     The Bank recently conducted its own evaluation of T&V extension in Kenya. 1/ The
report, still in draft, contained results of a sample survey of seven districts that are agriculturally
important and centers of population. The analysis concluded that there was a high payoff to the past
investments in T&V based extension in Kenya and that the adoption rates of the simpler technologies
were high. The key constraint identified by sample farmers was their inability to pay or obtain credit
for inputs, including labor. The report also emphasized the importance of having female frontline
extension workers where there was a high proportion of female farmers.
Sustainabil-ity
5.     The advances made in improving agricultural practices at the farm level appear to be
sustainable, based on the level of farmer acceptance and adoption. The institutional structure
introduced in the project has by and large been accepted by the Borrower and is also likely to be
sustained, albeit with some further assistance under the second phase project. The project is not
financially sustainable at the current level. Whether the extension system can be financed from
Government revenues in the future depends on progress made in implementing macroeconomic
reforms.
Lessons Learned
6.     The following lessons learned from the experience under NEP I have been incorporated in the
follow on project NEP II (Cr. 2199-KE):
(a)   Flexibility in project design is important. When it became apparent that the traditional T&V
system of working with contact farmers was not working in the Kenyan context, the project
design was modified to focus on contact groups. Women farmers, in particular, benefitted
from this modified approach.
(b)   Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the information produced must be in a form useful to
managers at central and district levels.
(c)   Practical measures, such as formal agreements and financial arrangements between the
research and extension establishments, are needed to forge links between research and
extension to ensure effective transfer of technologies to, and feedback from, farmers.
(d)   After the departure of the consultants recruited to assist with project start-up, the project
suffered increasing administrative and procurement problems. It is important to have a strong
management team in place in the implementing agency to supervise activities throughout the
life of the project.
(e)  IDA accounting and auditing procedures were not clearly understood by the project
authorities, which led to problems in receipt of audited accounts. Such procedures should he
clearly stipulated in the project documents and understood by all parties.

Back2round
1.    Agriculture employs 70 percent of Kenya's work force, provides most of the nation's food,
serves as the main source of raw materials for the industrial sector, and accounts for 65 percent of
export earnings and roughly 30 percent of GDP. Smallholder agriculture accounts for approximately
75 percent of production and 85 percent of agricultural employment.
2.     Agricultural extension is one of the key services provided to smallholder farmers in Kenya.
By the early 1980s it was clear to the Government of Kenya (GOK) that the general agricultural
extension system in place since before Independence was ineffective. It was poorly organized and
supervised, linkages with research were weak, and staff lacked motivation and initiative. In late
1981, GOK sought the assistance of the Bank in launching an agricultural extension pilot project in
Kericho and Nandi Districts based on the Training and Visit (T&V) system of extension management.
Success with the pilot prompted the Government to promote a national T&V agricultural extension
project. In September 1982 a preparation report was submitted to the Bank for approval. The project
was appraised in February 1983, approved in June 1983 and became effective in December 1983.
Project Obiectives and Description
3.     The project was conceived as the first of a multi-phased effort to introduce the T&V system
throughout the crop extension service and was seen as a basic reorganization of the extension service
in the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). 1/ It was to be introduced in 30 of Kenya's 41 districts,
covering the main arable areas with over 95 percent of the country's population. The 11 districts not
included in the project are mostly in the semi-arid and arid zones and predominantly pastoral. Seven
districts had joined the T&V system in November 1982, bringing to nine the number of districts
incorporated during the pre-project period; the remainder were to be phased in over the life of the
project. Other project objectives were to reorganize and strengthen Kenya's agricultural extension
system and improve linkages between agricultural research and extension.
1/ When the project started, livestock was under a separate Ministry of Livestock
Development (MOLD) and was not included in the project. MOLD was merged with MOA
in 1984, and livestock extension was added to the project. The ministries were separated
again in 1987, but the project continued to support livestock extension.

(a)    provision of about 750 incremental staff;
(b)   investments in transport, office equipment, and audio-visual aids;
(c)    construction of modest offices at the district and location levels;
(d)    provision of incremental operating costs, travel allowances, vehicle operating costs
and extension materials;
(e)   training of extension staff at different levels;
(f)    strengthening adaptive research and improving research- extension linkages;
(g)    technical assistance; and
(h)    monitoring and evaluation.
Project Design and Organization
4.    The project design was based on the successful pilot project in two districts which assessed
the T&V system of extension under field conditions in Kenya. It was supported and understood by
the Borrower. The project concept was innovative in that it involved the reorganization and
restructuring of the major activity of MOA -- extension services -- by introducing new methods of
providing extension advice and managing extension staff. The scale of the project was large, but it
was phased into the districts according to an agreed plan.
5.    The results of the pilot project demonstrated that successful implementation of the T&V
system could be attributed to several factors, key among which were the provision of training and the
timely provision to extension staff of transport and allowances. The project incorporated these
features. However, while training was generally carried out according to plan (para. 20), deviations
from the original project design caused by overstaffing and consequent lack of funds for non-salary
expenditures adversely affected the provision of transport and prompt payment of allowances (paras.
10-1 1).
Proiect Implementation
6.     Two unforeseen major reorganizations within the Government affected project performance.
The first was the merging and subsequent re-division of MOA and MOLD. During the pilot phase
(which began in 1982) and the initial phase of the project, the reformed extension system involved
only MOA and covered farming enterprises mainly related to crop production. In 1984, MOA and
MOLD merged, and the project expanded its activities to include livestock production. In 1987, the
combined ministry was once again divided into two. Thereafter, the extension system was vertically
divided into separate agriculture and livestock extension services, resulting in costly duplication of
effort and creating some degree of confusion at the field level. To provide a smooth transition, IDA
agreed, as an interim measure, to support the incipient extension service in MOLD. However, when
it became apparent that MOLD was setting up a parallel extension system, IDA suspended
disbursements to MOLD and called for the integration of the MOA and MOLD frontline extension
teams. This created resentment towards IDA from MOLD. The original decision to support MOLD.



- 3 -
and the subsequent decision to suspend disbursements were logical at the time, but in hindsight had a
detrimental effect on IDA-MOLD relations which is only now beginning to be resolved.
7.     The second major upheaval was the removal of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute
(KARI) from MOA to the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MRST). During the first
few years of project implementation, contact between extension and research staff was reasonably
good. The separation of KAR1 from MOA, however, caused a disruption in the linkage between
research and extension; participation of research staff in monthly workshops dropped off, and
coordinating bodies functioned on a sporadic basis. A lack of funds for research aggravated the
situation and further hindered the development of technologies suitable for smallholder use in different
agro-ecological zones. Support has been provided under the Second National Agricultural Extension
Project (NEP II, Cr. 2199-KE) to reestablish and strengthen the linkages between extension and
research.
8.     The mid-term review found that the contact farmer concept was not working as well as had
been envisaged, and attendance of neighboring farmers during farm visits by extension staff had
dropped off. The concept was therefore modified to focus on groups, and efforts were made to create
contact groups to increase the number of farmers exposed to extension activities. This approach
proved successful, particularly in reaching women farmers, and is being continued under NEP II,
with particular emphasis on women groups.
9.     The number of incremental staff hired under the project was 4,070, compared to about 750
estimated at appraisal. Most of the increases were in Technical Officers (TOs) (incremental staff was
about 950 more than the 545 planned) and frontline extension staff (FLS) (incremental staff was about
2,200 more than the 58 planned). 2/ Some of this increase was valid: the number of beneficiaries
had increased 3/ and, towards the end of the project period, two districts were split into four, which
required more staff. Much of the recruitment, however, was a result of political pressure on MOA
to absorb all graduates from the pre-service training institutions. In addition, there was a tendency
for each technical division in MOA to increase the number of FLS working directly for it, resulting in
increased and unnecessary hiring of staff into the service.
10.    The numbers of staff dramatically increased MOA's wage bill and severely curtailed the
portion of its recurrent budget available for non-salary operating expenditures in the later years of the
project. This meant that while the frontline staff could continue their farm visits and relay extension
messages to farmers, they did not always receive transport allowances or inputs necessary to enable
them to hold field days and demonstrations. A staff deployment study is being carried out under NEP
II; in the meantime, GOK agreed that new hiring at MOA and MOLD was to be consistent with
staffing norms being developed under the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Operation II (ASAO II, Cr.
2204-KE).
11.    The purpose of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system was to provide regular and
current information on the efficiency and effectiveness of the extension delivery system. The system
2/ The ratio of TO:FLS, which had been expected to decrease from about 1:6 to 1:8, instead
rose to about 1:4.
3/ At the time of appraisal the estimated number of farm families in the project area, based
on a 1979 census, was 1.7 million. The estimate at the end of the project was 2.9 million.



- 4 -
design was intended to build up the capacity of MOA to implement and use M&E as a management
tool. The central Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (MEU) at headquarters was to be in charge of
coordinating and disseminating work done by district staff, and the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)
agreed to incorporate an extension question in its bi-annual farm surveys. MEU did coordinate the
work of district-based enumerators, who conducted appropriate farmers' surveys of adoption rates and
yields in 1984. However, subsequent surveys done by extension staff were rejected by management,
who criticized them for being "too little, too late." 4/ The surveys covered only nine out of 30
districts and the results were available only after six months -- too late to affect the next season's
implementation strategy. The design of the surveys was also too comprehensive, resulting in lengthy
and not easily readable reports. Further surveys were curtailed for several years. One district did
undertake several ad hoc surveys to understand why farmers did or did not adopt specific
recommendations, and the results were found useful by district management. Overall, however,
management-oriented monitoring and evaluation activities were not implemented to the extent
planned, and CBS only once included extension questions in its surveys.
12.    The neglect of M&E was not due to problems of competence among technical staff, but rather
to a lack of support and interest on the part of central management because the information was not
presented in a useful and timely fashion. There was also a lack of "ownership" at the district level of
information requests from central authorities. In addition, M&E staff at all levels were faced with
conflicting requests on their time, and with a lack of transportation. In retrospect, the approach was
correct but difficult to implement without a firm commitment from managers at all levels. It was also
difficult for the central Monitoring Unit to provide the leadership and supervision required by
managers and field staff without some intermediary level of responsibility at the provincial level; this
was recommended at the mid-term review, but not implemented. Improvements in the system,
including sensitizing management to the importance of M&E results, reallocating district staff to
provincial M&E teams, strengthening the central MEU, and carrying out specific impact assessment
studies, are planned under NEP 11.
13.    Delay in the procurement of vehicles was one of the major bottlenecks in project
implementation and resulted in slow start-up of project activities. Due to personnel problems in
MOA, procurement of the first lot of vehicles took three years to complete; by mid-1988, as much as
60% of annual budget allocations for vehicles and 40% for equipment had not been utilized and
reverted to the Treasury. Procurement of vehicles was subsequently combined with tenders for the
Animal Health Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1758-KE) and thereafter procurement accelerated (see Table
4). Bicycles proved to be more popular with extension agents than motorcycles, which were more
expensive to buy and required maintenance and spare parts which were not available in up-country
areas.
14.    Very little equipment was procured. In 1987 tenders were issued for procurement of cameras
and equipment, but the bids were considered too high and no further action was taken. As a result,
only about 25% of the funds allocated for equipment were actually spent on equipment; the remainder
were either lost (reverted to Treasury) or reallocated to other categories. The construction of offices
and training facilities was not considered a priority under the project, and the civil works component
was modest; in the event, only a fraction of the civil works planned was undertaken, and no IDA
funds allocated for this purpose were used. Procurement at the district level was generally more
efficient than at headquarters; virtually all funds allocated to the districts annually for operating costs
4/ Mid-term Review Report, July 1988



- 5 -
were spent. The administrative capacity in MOA to handle procurement is being strengthened under
NEP II.
15.   The project was substantially completed three and a half years later than estimated in the
Credit Agreement, mainly due to initial delays in procurement (para. 13). The estimated total project
cost at completion was US$ 24.5 million, about 86% of appraisal estimates. Three of the five major
risks foreseen at appraisal did not materialize to any great extent: that the initial momentum might
diminish and the extension reform not be fully adopted and permanently institutionalized; that
agreement on maize pricing and marketing policies might not be forthcoming; and that the pace of
introducing the new system might not be as rapid as expected. The other two risks - of budget cuts
and generation of adequate research findings - did transpire. Budgetary allocations were consistently
below appraisal estimates. While the budget of some categories was not spent due to procurement
problems (para. 13-14), the allocation for recurrent expenditures was far from adequate, although
these did improve in the latter years of the project. Due in part to the reorganization of the research
system (para. 7), research did not concentrate sufficiently on technologies appropriate for
smallholders.
16.    Accounting and auditing procedures were not clearly stipulated in the project documents, and
IDA procedures and requirements were not properly understood by the project authorities. Audit
reports were not submitted, and IDA eventually suspended disbursements under statements of
expenditure. Audit reports on IDA statements of expenditure, covering the six years to June 30,
1989, were finally submitted in 1990; however these were qualified since the Auditor General's audits
were based on MOA's Appropriation Accounts and not actual project accounts. After several
meetings with the project authorities and the Auditor General's office, IDA decided in early 1991 to
conditionally accept these audited statements of expenditure for the six years and resume
disbursements under SOEs. Under NEP II, proper arrangements were made in the design of
accounting procedures to ensure that project accounts would record all expenditures from all sources
of project funding. As a condition for effectiveness of NEP II, GOK submitted final audited
statements of expenditure under NEP 1.
Proiect Results
17.   The project succeeded in reforming the agricultural extension service in Kenya, with the
adoption and acceptance of T&V as the national system. The project was phased into the districts as
planned, with all 30 districts being incorporated by 1985. In general, implementation was strong at
the field level. New technologies such as row planting, inter-cropping of maize with beans, fodder
cultivation and improved pest and disease control were successfully extended to small farmers.
Innovations such as zero grazing and wider use of fertilizer were introduced. Many women groups
successfully set up horticultural nurseries and poultry keeping.
18.    Two early studies (1983 and 1984) showed yield increases of 28% for maize, 80% for beans
and 84% for potatoes. From 1985 to 1988 (the last year for which figures are available), yields
continued to show a steady increase, aided by improvements in maize pricing and marketing policies
introduced by GOK under ASAO 11, which provided incentives to farmers to increase production ot
maize. This trend can also be partially attributed to the strengthened extension system; extension",
role cannot be quantified more explicitly, however, because of the weaknesses in the M&E system
(paras. 12-13).



19.   The Bank recently conducted its own evaluation of T&V extension in Kenya. 5/ The
report, still in draft, contained results of a sample survey of seven districts that are agriculturally
important and centers of population. The analysis concluded that there was a high payoff to the past
investments in T&V based extension in Kenya. It showed that around 70-75 percent of the sample
farmers indicated adopting the spacing, planting and seed technologies, and 63 percent the use of
fertilizer, although the proportions adopting the more complex technologies amounted to only 10
percent for both chemical use and stalk borer control and 22 percent for topdressing. It also showed
that the differences in adoption rates between farmers from male-and female-headed households were
also insignificant, except for fertilizer. The key constraint identified by sample farmers was their
inability to pay or obtain credit for inputs, including labor. The report also emphasized the
importance of having female frontline extension workers where there was a high proportion of female
farmers.
20.    The project significantly improved the training provided to extension staff. About 90% of the
bi-weekly training sessions for frontline staff (an integral part of the extension service) took place as
scheduled, despite occasional problems due to inadequate operational budgets. Monthly training
sessions for subject matter specialists (SMSs) were also well attended, and, together with the over 300
specialized short courses offered in such subjects as home economics, horticulture and coffee
husbandry, upgraded the competence of SMSs. Participation of research staff in the monthly
workshops, however, declined during the latter part of the project, due to the reorganization of
research and to lack of funds (para. 7). Some 45 staff received further degree training.
21.    There were an estimated 1.7 million farm families in the project area (30 districts) at the time
of appraisal, all of whom were expected to benefit from the project. The number of beneficiaries at
project completion was estimated at almost 2.9 million farm families - the total number of families
then living in the project area.
Proiect Sustainability
22.    Project sustainability can be judged on three levels. Financially, the extension system is not
yet sustainable at the current level, and further assistance will be required under the second phase
project. Whether the system could be financed from Government revenues in the future depends in
part on progress made in implementing macroeconomic reforms and on controlling hiring within
financially feasible limits. The advancements made in improving agricultural practices at the farm
level appear to be sustainable, based on the level of farmer acceptance and adoption. The institutional
structure introduced in the project has by and large been accepted by the Borrower and is also likely
to be sustained. Some modifications are necessary, however, and these will be taken up under NEP
II.
IDA Performance
23.   IDA assisted the Borrower in implementing a pilot project in two districts prior to preparation
and appraisal of NEP I, so that the lessons learned could be incorporated into the project design.

October, 1992.

IDA then invested substantial resources in supervision: a District Agriculture Officer who had
implemented the T&V system in one of the two pilot districts was hired by the Resident Mission in
Nairobi to supervise the project on a continuous basis; another staff member at the Resident Mission
supervised the project on a half time basis; and nine formal supervision missions and a mid-term
review were conducted. This investment in supervision resources (almost 3:1 ratio compared to
project generation) proved worthwhile and helped keep the project on track.
24.   IDA's efforts at donor coordination were mixed. Coordination with IFAD, the project
cofinancier, was satisfactory, but there was little cross-fertilization or exchange of ideas with other
donors. Under NEP II, MOA and MOLD will jointly host semi-annual meetings of donors involved
in extension projects and reptesentatives from different agricultural ministries to share implementation
experiences and encourage complementarity of activities.
Borrower Performance
25.   The Borrower's project management was weak. Key posts in MOA covering field
supervision, training and administration were not adequately filled, impeding effective project
implementation. One undesirable side effect of IDA's close and continuous supervision was that
MOA did not develop the manpower and skills necessary to adequately supervise the project, and
came to rely too heavily on information from IDA. Information on the effectiveness of the extension
system was desultory because of the low priority given to monitoring and evaluation. Accounts and
statements of expenses were poorly maintained.
26.    Communication at the field level between MOA and MOLD was quite good; there was,
however, little effective communication at the national level among the ministries involved - MOA,
MOLD and, latterly, MRST - in designing and implementing extension services, which made it
difficult to establish and strengthen the linkages necessary for running an extension system. In future
projects involving different ministries, communication should be institutionalized as part of the project
design, as has been done under NEP 11.
Project Relationship
27.   IDA had a positive relationship with MOA, and the openness of communication helped both
parties resolve issues rapidly and successfully. The relationship with MOLD was more problematic.
After initially supporting the MOLD extension service through this project, IDA stopped
disbursements when it became apparent that MOLD was establishing a parallel extension system for
livestock production (para. 6). This soured relations between IDA and MOLD and made it difficult
to resolve the issue of parallel extension; this issue is being followed up under NEP II.
28.   IDA's longstanding relationship with IFAD, which cofinanced the project, is strong, and this
project was no exception. IFAD was represented on the appraisal team, on two supervision missions
and the mid-term review.
Consulting Services
29.    A technical assistance team was engaged for the initial 30 months of project start-up. The
contract was not renewed, and GOK made a policy decision to reduce its dependence on expatriate



- 8 -
technical assistance. Expatriate consultants were thereafter engaged only on a short-term basis for
specific subjects for which local expertise was not available. The credit amount allocated for
consulting services was accordingly reduced.
Project Documentation and Data
30.    The legal agreements were adequate. The SAR provided a useful framework for IDA and the
Borrower during project implementation. It was somewhat difficult to get the data relevant to the
preparation of the Project Completion Report from the Borrower. In some cases the data exists but is
decentralized at the district level; in others, it has not been collected in the format necessary for the
PCR. This may be partly due to the fact that reporting requirements were not properly established at
the beginning of the project period, and to the weakness of the M&E system (para. 11).
Lessons Learned
31.    The following lessons learned from the experience under NEP I have been incorporated under
NEP II:
(a) Flexibility in project design is important. When it became apparent that the traditional T&V
system of working with contact farmers was not working in the Kenyan context, the project
design was modified to focus on contact groups. Women farmers, in particular, benefitted
from this modified approach.
(b) Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the information produced must be in a form useful to
managers at central and district levels. It is also important to involve District Agricultural
Officers in the planning and implementation of monitoring and evaluation activities, to
develop a sense of "ownership" among staff who are expected to contribute to and use the
results.
(c)   Practical measures, such as formal agreements and financial arrangements between the
research and extension establishments, are needed to forge links between research and
extension to ensure effective transfer of technologies to, and feedback from, farmers.
(d) After the departure of the consultants recruited to assist with project start-up, the project
suffered increasing administrative and procurement problems. It is important to have a strong
management team in place in the implementing agency to supervise activities throughout the
life of the project.
(e)  IDA accounting and auditing procedures were not clearly understood by the project
authorities, which led to problems in receipt of audited accounts. Such procedures should be
clearly stipulated in the project documents and understood by all parties.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Following are the borrower's comments on Part I:
PARAGRAPH 2
The Pilot Project in the two districts Nandi and Kericho was actually launched in March 1982.
PARAGRAPH 3
a)    Ten districts joined the T & V system in November 1982 bringing to 10 the number of
districts incorporated during the pre-project period which were actually in the first phase
of the project.
b)    The project objectives in the reorganization of the extension service in the MOA were
basically to ensure that:
L.           Farmers were visited regularly by extension staff using well defined work
programs which could be evaluated. This introduced accountability in
staff performance.
ii.          Raise the technical knowledge and skills of extension staff for better
transfer of technical recommendations.
iii.         Bridge the gap between research and extension.
iv.          And all the above would improve farmers productivity and overall
agricultural production.
PARAGRAPH 6
Overstaffing if any was never experienced in the technical cadre.
PARAGRAPH8
The lack of research participation was mainly due to lack of adequate funds and less emphasis of
extension work by researchers.
PARAGRAPH 9
The group approaches, other than women groups, also included Rural Youth Clubs and farmers
field days.
PARAGRAPH10
Recruitment of FLS was not dependent on political pressure as these officers were admitted into
the Government Training Institutes with the objective of rendering their services in the
agricultural sector.
