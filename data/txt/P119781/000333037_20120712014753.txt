F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The development objective of the DPL program was to support the GoM in implementing
its program of reforms aimed at improving the financial, environmental and social
performance of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco. The first DPL (DPL1)
supported the key foundations of the Government‟s reform program, to establish an
enabling environment for an integrated and affordable municipal solid waste system. The
second DPL (DPL2) supported capitalizing on the momentum gained during the first
operation while deepening the reforms at the regional and municipal levels.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The PDO was not revised. The indicators were, however adjusted between DPL1 and
DPL2 (see below).

(a) PDO Indicator(s)
The indicators for the DPL program were set out in the program document for DPL1, but
some adjustments were made and targets values for most indicators only fixed in the
program document for DPL2. No distinction was made in the program documents
between PDO indicators and intermediate indicators

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Sector context
1. At the time of appraisal, Moroccan cities hosted about 60% of the total country
population and were characterized by rapid growth 1, and further suffered from
several forms of environmental degradation. Since independence, Morocco‟s
municipal solid waste (MSW) services had been defined only in terms of “cleanliness?,
with the main focus on waste collection and limited attention and resource allocation to
waste disposal. This had led to significant negative economic, environmental and social
impacts. However, an understanding of Solid Waste Management (SWM) as comprising
environmental, social and economic aspects was emerging, based on improved analytical
foundation. A report prepared under the Mediterranean Environment Technical
Assistance Program (METAP) had estimated costs of overall environmental degradation
in Morocco at over 3.7 percent of GDP (2003), and the cost of sub-standard SWM
practices alone was estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP, well beyond its regional peers2.

2. The solid waste sector faced issues on virtually all fronts, due to its historic
neglect, including: (i) a weak legal and institutional framework, constraining effective
governance of the sector; (ii) poor cost effectiveness of services, with doubtful long-term
financial sustainability; (iii) the urgent need for integrated and modernized MSW
management systems, to mitigate negative economic, environmental, and social impacts
of the existing systems; and (iv) missed opportunities available under international
climate change mechanisms i.e. the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), while
supporting the global effort in climate change mitigation.

3. Due to its impacts on the quality of life, public health, environmental and natural
resources, and vital economic activities such as tourism, SWM was established as a
top priority by the government. Government initiated the development and reform of
the sector through the enactment, in December 2006, of the first Solid Waste Law (Law
28-00), establishing the fundamental principles and key rules to govern the sector and
forming the foundation for sector policy. The law had two key objectives: to establish
integrated and affordable SWM systems and to mitigate negative impacts of the sector on
public health and the environment. More specifically, the law (i) established the
institutional framework for SWM; (ii) required the development of solid waste master
plans at the national, regional, and municipal level; (iii) established cost recovery
principles, including the “polluter pays? principle and user fees (redevances); (iv)
introduced sanitary landfills as the standard for final waste disposal and requiring
regulations establishing landfill norms and standards; (v) introduced regulations for

hazardous waste management; and (vi) established a system to monitor compliance with
the law.

4. The government also prepared and approved a national municipal solid waste
management program (Programme National de Déchets Ménagers et Assimilés –
PNDM). The PNDM resulted from strong inter-sectoral collaboration and dialogue
between the key ministries concerned. The PNDM was adopted by the newly appointed
government in its program announced in October 2007, as a 15-year, 3-phase program
with a total estimated cost of US$4.3 billion3. Effectively launched in 2008, it set out
objectives for the modernization of SWM, in particular expanding and professionalizing
collection services, modernizing disposal practices and promoting recycling activities.
The reform program overlaying the PNDM targeted three areas of reform: (i) enhancing
the governance of the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and institutional
measures designed to establish a clear framework for the sector, eliminating overlap
and/or gaps in the policy-making, regulatory, and operational structure; (ii) improving the
sustainability of the sector through the introduction of financial mechanisms and
incentives for municipalities designed to support the sustainability of investments and
services; and (iii) mainstreaming social and environmental considerations into the
planning, implementation, and operations of MSW services and investments. The PNDM
included specific targets for the municipal waste sector, including: collection coverage
increasing from 70 percent to 90 percent by 2021; 100 percent use of sanitary landfills in
urban areas by 2021; the closure and/or rehabilitation of 300 open dumps; and sorting of
20 percent of recyclable materials.

Macroeconomic context
5. At the time of appraisal of DPL1, Morocco featured sound macroeconomic
fundamentals. The economy was characterized by macroeconomic stability, solid
growth, low inflation and declining unemployment, a strong external position, and sound
fiscal balances. The economy had been undergoing a structural shift featuring faster
growth in nonagricultural output and strong growth was estimated for 2008, with the
global economic downturn only having a moderate impact in Morocco. Inflation was
expected to edge up to 3.9 percent in 2008, while unemployment would be around 9.7
percent. The current account was expected to run a small temporary deficit in 2008 and
the government produced a fiscal surplus for the second year in a row. Revenues were
buoyant and total government debt was projected to slightly decline.

6. The medium term outlook had Morocco expected to preserve macroeconomic
stability and moderate to high growth, but the Moroccan economy remained
vulnerable to adverse domestic and external shocks. Despite the world recession, the
external position was expected to remain sustainable in 2009 owing to gains in the terms

 The total cost breaks down to 33 percent for investment, 62 percent for operation, and 5 percent for
technical assistance. Local governments would support the brother part of cost (73 percent), while new user
fees, landfill charges and other fees and taxes foreseen by Law 28-00 would contribute 12 percent of cost.
The government would finance about 9 percent of the PNDM, with the rest to come from donor support
and carbon finance.

                                                   -2-
of trade, regardless of a fall in workers‟ remittances and tourism receipts. The fiscal
stance should also remain sustainable. A comprehensive public debt sustainability
analysis showed that the fiscal framework was robust to downside risk in the medium
term and that budgetary financing needs should remain restrained in the short run.

7. At the time of appraisal of DPL2, and despite the global economic crisis, growth
performance in Morocco had been good. Data for the first half of 2010 showed that the
economy was recovering from the moderate effects of the global economic slowdown.
The government had implemented a stimulus package to support the income of the
population and help the most affected sectors. Public finances continued to be well
managed despite the impact of the global crisis on the budget. Data on budget execution
over the first 9 months of 2010 showed that the annualized budget deficit was contained
to around 3.4 percent of GDP. Sound fiscal management helped further reduce the
government‟s debt. The government and the Central Bank showed continued
commitment to fight inflation. The external position remained solid and monetary and
exchange rate policies remained appropriate.

8. Morocco was in a better position to maneuver with less damage through the
moderate effects of the global crisis, while being in a position to benefit from the
recovery of the world economy, due to sound macroeconomic and fiscal policies, as well
as efforts to improve sector productivity and competitiveness. Growth prospects in the
medium term were positive and sound macroeconomic policies would help contain
inflation at low levels. After a temporary higher estimated deficit in 2010, the fiscal
stance was projected to remain sound over the medium term, with fiscal deficits around
the targeted threshold of 3 percent of GDP. The financing needs stemming from the
higher budget deficit in 2010 and declining deficits over the medium term would be
easily financed through domestic market as well as from increased drawings on external
loans.

9. The government’s debt strategy was to diversify financing sources and take on a
greater proportion of external financing. A comprehensive public debt sustainability
analysis showed that the fiscal framework was robust to downside risk in the medium
term. The external position was expected to remain sustainable over the medium term.
Balance of payments financing requirements did not constitute a serious concern given
the sound economic fundamentals, the country‟s low external debt stock, and the ample
foreign reserves. In sum, Morocco‟s macroeconomic framework remained adequate and
sustainable in the medium term. The government‟s commitment to maintain momentum
of reform effort supported robust prospects of investment, growth, and employment.

Rationale for Bank intervention
10. The Bank had been supporting the government with technical assistance over a
number of years, and was well positioned to accompany the government in its sector
reform program. Engagement between the Bank and Morocco on SWM had steadily
strengthened and deepened since 2002 through dialogue and technical assistance, in large
part through METAP. In parallel with the preparation of the DPL series, the Bank
provided the sector with technical support and advisory services for the implementation

                                          -3-
of the PNDM, including support for (i) the identification of priority areas for technical
and financial support to municipalities as well as eligibility criteria; (ii) the design of an
appropriate system to channel this support to municipalities committed to reform of the
sector; (iii) the development of a private sector participation (PSP) strategy in the solid
waste sector; and (iv) the development of a CDM programmatic project in the municipal
SWM area. Continued Bank support was deemed necessary to help the government in the
process of promoting an enabling environment for the solid waste sector, particularly
towards improving its financial, environmental and social performance. The support was
a natural extension of the preceding policy dialogue and advisory role of the Bank, and
would reinforce the government‟s manifested reform willingness.

11. The MSW Sector Development Policy Loan was requested by the government to
support the implementation of policy reforms and programs in the solid waste
sector. An overall agreement was reached with the government on the scope of the
reforms supported under the proposed operation. The DPL program consisting of two
single tranche operations of Euro 100 million each was developed under the umbrella –
and in support – of the government‟s reform program in order to ensure full ownership of
the process, actions and outcomes. It was the first DPL operation Bank-wide in the solid
waste sector and the first Bank operation in this sector in Morocco.

12. The government requested support from the Bank in the light of recent policy
developments in this sector, which the Bank responded favorably to, although the
solid waste sector was not specifically identified in the 2005 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS). It was becoming increasingly clear that managing municipal waste
under a “business-as-usual? approach would not only negatively affect quality of life,
public health, and environmental and natural resources but would also jeopardize the
development of many sectors, particularly tourism. Further, the DPL would contribute to
achieving the CAS‟s first strategic objective of improving competitiveness and business
climate by stimulating partnerships between the private sector and LGs and by increasing
Morocco‟s competitiveness as a tourist destination. It would also contribute to the second
strategic objective of increasing access to basic services by poor and marginalized groups,
as these improved services would cover the urban poor and support social inclusion of
informal waste workers. In addition, the DPL program would contribute to the cross-
cutting CAS objective of improving public governance.

13. In terms of macro-economy, the projected disbursements of the Municipal Solid
Waste Sector DPL would help meet the government’s objective of diversifying
financing sources as well as provide financing on more favorable terms. This, in turn,
would support the government‟s strategy of fiscal consolidation. During the above CAS
period, the Bank would cover a total financing gap of US$300 million to US$350 million
per year over the projection period. The lending approach was consistent with the CAS
recommendation on the use of policy lending instruments under a results-framework
approach.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)
14. The development objective of the DPL program was to support the government
in implementing its program of reforms aimed at improving the financial,
environmental and social performance of the MSW sector in Morocco. The first DPL
(DPL1) was to support the key foundations of the government‟s reform program, to
establish an enabling environment for an integrated and affordable municipal solid waste
system. The second DPL (DPL2) would capitalize on the momentum gained during the
first operation while deepening the reforms at the regional and municipal levels.

15. The specific benefits expected from the implementation of the reform program
and from the 15 year-PNDM supported by this DPL program were: (i) improved
environmental and social conditions which would result from the progressive elimination
of the existing uncontrolled dumpsites and construction of sanitary landfills; (ii)
enhanced access to waste collection services for the urban poor; (iii) reduced cost of
waste landfilling resulting from more cost-effective planning regulations and standards;
(iv) more efficient use of resources allocated to the solid waste sector and better targeted
public subsidies to the sector; and (v) growth and job creation resulting from the creation
of small and medium enterprises, the promotion of recycling and integrating informal
actors such as waste pickers.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
16. The PDO was not revised, but some of the indicators were adjusted from DPL1
to DPL2. The indicators for the DPL program were presented in the program document
for DPL1 and were slightly revised for DPL2 in line with the evolving context and
lessons learned under DPL1, and baselines and targets were set for most indicators in the
program document for DPL2. See Datasheet for details.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
17. The policy areas supported by the program corresponded to the overlying
program for the PNDM and built on the momentum gained through the
introduction of the Law 28-00 and PNDM: (i) sector governance, (ii) sustainability,
and (iii) social and environmental considerations.

Policy Area 1: Governance
18. Improving governance of the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and
institutional measures designed to establish a clear framework for the sector, and
eliminating overlap and/or gaps in the policy-making, regulatory, and operational
structure. Reform measures in this area were intended to address fragmentation and
legacies that affect policymaking and effective implementation. Policy actions aimed at
(i) policy planning and coordination in the sector through the establishment of the
National Commission (Commission Nationale – CN) as a policy and strategic planning
coordination body for the PNDM; (ii) defining the eligibility and allocation criteria for
government subsidies to support municipal SWM operations and investments in an
equitable, transparent, and cost-effective manner; (iii) strengthening the regulatory
framework through the enactment of executive regulations for SWM planning and for
standard and norms for disposal facilities; (iv) improving competition, transparency, and

                                            -5-
accountability of SWM PSP schemes by improving the quality of standard bidding and
contracting procedures and strengthening the capacity of respective LGs; and (v)
developing appropriate communications and public awareness programs. Responsibility
for the implementation of these reforms rested primarily with the Ministry of Interior
(MoI, as LG oversight Ministry) and the Ministry of Environment (MoE, former SWE),
with the CN-PNDM serving as the main coordination entity.

Policy Area 2: Sustainability
19. Improving the sustainability of the sector through the introduction of financial
mechanisms and incentives for municipalities to improve their SWM systems. The
government recognized that sustainability of the municipal solid waste sector was critical.
Sustainability factors include: (i) short, medium, and long-term financial sustainability;
and (ii) improved municipal capacity to plan and manage SWM services; including
regular monitoring and evaluation of sector performance. Policy actions included: (i)
government subsidies to support the PNDM; (ii) supporting the municipalities to
mobilize additional financial resources under the Clean Development Mechanism
(CDM); (iii) completion of a feasibility study on long-term financial sustainability; (iv)
strengthening the legal framework to promote inter-municipal cooperation; and (v)
implementation of a national capacity-building program in SWM.

Policy Area 3: Social and Environmental Considerations
20. Mainstreaming social and environmental considerations into the planning,
implementation, and operations of solid waste services and investments. The
government was committed to promoting environmentally and socially sound disposal
facilities. Given the existing situation in terms of final disposal and the huge potential
social and environmental impacts, the primary focus of this aspect of the reform program
was to: (i) support the implementation of environmentally and socially sound disposal
facilities; and (ii) improve the social and working conditions of waste-pickers, whose
livelihoods would be affected by closure of existing dumpsites. Policy actions included:
(i) enactment of EIA-related decrees toward effective implementation of the EIA Law;
(ii) operationalizing the EIA system; (iii) preparation and implementation of a multi-year
plan (Phase I of the PNDM) focusing on municipal waste disposal; and (iv) preparation
and implementation of a program to improve social performance of solid waste
management.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)
21. The policy areas remained unchanged for the duration of the DPL program.

1.6 Other significant changes
22. One indicative trigger for DPL2 was not completed (namely signature of a circular on
user fees for municipal waste) and did not figure in the final policy matrix for DPL2. This
change is discussed in section 2.2. There were no other significant changes.

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)
23. Both DPL1 and DPL2 were single-tranche operations, which disbursed on
effectiveness. The strong government commitment to the reform program and measures
supported by the DPL programmatic series, combined with the timely completion of the
specific measures negotiated as prior actions have resulted in disbursement of the two
operations in the program as foreseen or earlier.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation
25. Strong government commitment and ownership throughout program
preparation and implementation was the primary success factor. The DPL program
built on home-grown reforms, stemming from the recognition of the magnitude and
bearing of sector problems on a range of wider economic, social, and environmental
issues. The enactment of Law 28-00 and its operationalization through the PNDM was
further built on a sound analytical basis, to which the Bank had contributed strongly, and
which made it possible for the Bank to accompany the government in a series of
programmatic DPLs, without using sector investment lending as a first step to gain sector
knowledge. In addition, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and MoI have provided stable and
strong leadership and oversight from the outset of the DPL program and ensured the
active participation and coordination between all ministries and agencies involved in the
program. On this basis, the Bank was able to act as catalyst for enhanced inter-ministerial
collaboration, providing more visibility to the program and helping to turn the
willingness to advance sector reforms into concrete actions and results on the ground.
Key government and Bank staff saw the DPL program through from preparation of the
first DPL in the series to completion of the last, which allowed for a continuity of
leadership and vision through the entire program.

26. A link was made from the national to the local level through signing of
conventions/MoUs between the government and LGs and strong coordination with
donor interventions directly targeting LGs. The MoUs clearly set out the priorities for
reform as well as the accompanying technical and financial support to LGs, enabling the
Bank to accompany the program of reform all the way to the local level, where reforms
are concretely implemented to improve services. Other donors, especially GIZ, supported

                                                       -8-
measures that complemented the DPL program through SWM capacity building directly
to LGs (see Annex 4 for details on support from other donors).

27. Issues regarding subsidy allocation criteria popped up along the way, but could
be largely resolved by clarifying the criteria in a procedures manual. At the outset of
the program, the allocation criteria for funding were not clear enough to allow the MoI to
allocate financial support based on objective criteria. The development of a procedures
manual assured that the criteria were shared by everyone4. The combination of upstream
technical review of funding proposals by additional experts hired to the Program
Management Unit (PMU), hosted by the Directorate of Water and Sanitation in MoI
(responsible for oversight of LGs activities), this assured equal treatment of all LGs.

28. The design was robust, incorporating mutually reinforcing, but not
interdependent, elements of sector financing, for which the synergies are continuing
to be developed. The DPL program focused on state and LG budgets, carbon finance,
SWM fees, and eco-taxes. Some of these elements took longer than expected to take off,
but the sound analysis of LG finances feeding into program design allowed sufficient
flexibility in implementation that this did not affect the success of the program.

29. One indicative trigger for DPL2 was not completed, but this did not affect the
overall program outcome, namely signature of a circular by the Minister of Interior on
the application of Article 23 of Law 28-00 on user fees for municipal waste. This was
largely due to delays in finalizing a donor-funded study to identify tools and actions for
mobilizing new revenue sources needed to meet this objective. The government remained
fully committed to continue working towards the objective of long-term financial
sustainability of the sector. Additional analytical work is being finalized and adopted, and
in particular will assess options for introducing distinct user fees established under the
solid waste Law 28-00, which would complement general LG revenues.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Design
30. The design, under DPL1, of the M&E system for the DPL program, was focused
on a mix of outcome and output-related indicators, covering the three policy areas
of the DPL program and centered on the program’s matrix of actions and
performance indicators. The DPL M&E system was closely aligned to key outcomes
expected from the PNDM. A shortcoming was the lack of baseline and targets for a
number of indicators defined for DPL1, but the indicators were refined during
preparation of the DPL2 and relevant targets set or adjusted. The PMU would be
responsible for collecting data to track progress towards indicator targets, but the MoE, as
Chair of the CN-PNDM, would also follow progress regularly.




4
 PNDM support eligibility criteria related to land ownership, feasibility study, EIA, inter-communal
aspects, and social action plans were also published on the Environmental Department website. A
maximum of 30 percent of each investment could be contributed by the government through the PNDM.

                                                -9-
Implementation
31. Implementation was based on supervision missions by the Bank and allowed
monitoring of the program’s implementation. The CN-PNDM met regularly to
approve the PNDM annual work programs and follow up on implementation, but
delegated actual management of the reforms supported by the DPL program to the
relevant ministries: the MoF, MoI and MoE. The government was active and focused on
the areas critical to the DPL program‟s prior actions. A substantial review was carried out
in July 2010 to assess the implementation of measures supported by DPL1&2.

32. During implementation of the PNDM, it became apparent that the PMU did not
have sufficient capacity to assure regular monitoring of indicators for the DPL
program, which were a subset of indicators for the PNDM. This was due to inherited
institutional weaknesses at implementing coordination arrangements among government
agencies. To mitigate this shortcoming, two experts were hired to assist the PMU in
following up on PNDM implementation and processes requests for financial support.
Towards the end of PNDM Phase I, this facilitated a more regular follow up on the
indicators, i.e. through production of quarterly monitoring reports for the PNDM and
better definition and methodology for data collection, including for the indicators in the
DPL policy matrix. The government commissioned an independent external evaluation of
the PNDM Phase I, which would help identify areas for improvement, both in terms of
program implementation and in terms of M&E.

Utilization
33. The use of indicators for the DPL program suffered from the shortcomings
described above, but PNDM M&E is being improved. As a result of the delayed
clarification of the M&E framework for the PNDM, results for a number of indicators for
the DPL program were only available during the ICR mission, showing underutilization
of indicators to manage the PNDM for results. Room for improvement remains, both in
terms of M&E implementation and utilization for the PNDM, supported by the DPL
program, but with the improvements in PMU capacity and launch of a system of
quarterly reporting by LGs to the PMU, the government has improved the M&E system
and should be able to use indicators more consistently to monitor outputs and outcomes
of the PNDM.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):
34. The next phase will consist in a new series of programmatic DPLs, requested by
the government, to consolidate results and take the program to full implementation.
The DPL program has supported first generation reforms, coinciding with Phase I of the
PNDM, and has contributed to substantiating the reform program, providing the
necessary institutional and regulatory conditions for improved sector outcomes. The
government has requested the support of the Bank for moving to Phase II of the PNDM,
and a new series of programmatic DPLs (DPL3&4) is under preparation to support this
transition to full program implementation and roll-out. Continued Bank support is
justified by the need for further investment in more complex reforms and actions that
build upon the foundations laid down by DPL1&2 and the other achievements of PNDM
Phase I, as implemented by the government and supported by the Bank and other donors.

                                           -10-
The Bank also continues to accompany the government in developing carbon assets in
this sector, and a Carbon Fund Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement has been
appraised and is ready to be negotiated between the Carbon Partnership Facility
(managed by the Bank) and the Fonds d’équipement communal (FEC) (LG Investment
Fund), which is the primary provider of investment funds to LGs.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
35. The objectives, design, and implementation of this operation were relevant to
Morocco’s development priorities and the Bank’s priorities as expressed in the 2005
CAS, and remain relevant today. The objective was highly relevant to supporting the
first phase of the PNDM, and aimed to generate enough momentum for the program to be
fully initiated, in line with PNDM Phase I objectives. The continued relevance of the
objectives is demonstrated by the government‟s request to accompany the next phase of
the PNDM with another series of two programmatic DPLs. The DPL program should be
seen as an upstream boost to the new spirit of openness and collaboration, which is
reflected in the ongoing constitutional reforms including the regionalization and
decentralization agenda; the two DPLs helped substantiate the spirit of collaboration
between the MoF, line ministries and public agencies, and the role of the Bank in this
process, providing visibility to the program and acting as an outside catalyst for concrete
actions, remains highly relevant at the time of this ICR.

36. Strong analytical base combined with incorporation of lessons learned in the
design allowed the DPL program to remain relevant throughout implementation.
Previous sector DPLs (water and energy) in Morocco had run into problems due to
underestimation of the complexity and capacity requirements to carry out the targeted
sector reforms in a timely manner, in spite of multi-year programmatic economic and
sector work carried out as foundation of the water DPL. The SWM DPL program was,
however, founded on significant analytical, policy and legal framework progress that had
already been made in the sector5. In addition, the triggers for DPL2 were identified based
on their contribution to sustaining advances across all parts of the sector reform program
as well as the government‟s strong commitment for implementation of these triggers as
part of the overall reform program. The design was further coordinated with other
donor‟s support to capacity building activities (especially GIZ and KFW in SWM, AFD
in broader aspects of municipal finances), a central element to support the success of the
program in the initial phase, which the Bank could not support through the DPL
instrument. Finally, the DPL program anticipated the potential risks and identified
reasonably appropriate mitigating measures.

 Analytical foundation in the form of sector work included among others: The Poverty and Social Impact
Analysis (1&2, Assessment of Environmental Impact Assessment System, Municipal Solid Waste
Financing Note, Morocco Solid Waste Recycling Sector Study, METAP Cost Assessment of
Environmental Degradation, and PPIAF PSP study).


                                                -11-
37. Environmental and social dimensions of the program were explicitly
incorporated in the DPL design, taking advantage of a growing awareness by the
government that these aspects mattered and also consistent with the Bank environmental
strategy that called for mainstreaming environmental and social aspects in development
projects. The success in integrating these dimensions in a DPL have established a
precedent that will certainly be important in shaping similar operations in the future both
in Morocco and Bank-wide.

38. The design was adjusted slightly during implementation with the removal of the
indicative trigger on a decree on user fees, which proved to be a less important part of the
program in the initial phase, as the LGs did in fact generate sufficient revenues to pay for
the service provision by the private sector. The design of the DPL program proved robust
enough to accommodate changes along the way without compromising the achievement
of overall objectives.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall outcomes of the SWM DPL program
39. The SWM DPL program contributed to significant achievements in all three
policy areas, and also contributed substantially to inter-ministerial coordination,
laying the groundwork and providing better knowledge of the needs associated with
decentralization. The CN-PNDM was set in place as a prior action to DPL1 and proved
highly effective in coordinating the program. It was largely due to the CN that synergies
were developed between ministries in charge of financial, environmental, and
decentralization issues, with the Bank playing a catalyzing role in this process. The
overall governance of the sector was clearly strengthened; sustainability was improved
through increased collection of the municipal services tax, from MAD 1.4 million to
MAD 2.6 million, falling slightly short of the MAD 3 million target. It should be
recognized that more needs to be done to assure capacity to move to full implementation
of the program in smaller LGs. Social and environmental considerations are now at the
forefront of the government‟s reflections on bringing the program to full implementation.
The social accountability aspect of service delivery is being strengthened further through
the implementation of citizen report cards, an activity flowing directly from the DPL
program.

40. The incentives created by the financial support from the government to LGs for
investment and operation assured a leap forward for the sector. The engagement of
the World Bank lent credibility to the process, especially in terms of clear eligibility
criteria, and helped concretize the program and incentivized the government to provide
US$212 million for the PNDM Phase I, as an incentive for LGs to invest at least US$1.3
billion in improved SWM. In line with PNDM financing objectives, LGs provided the
brother part of investments, with the government contribution serving as an incentive.
Financial support was allocated by the government to LGs on a regressive basis over 3 to
4 years for collection and cleaning, with good leverage – US$52 million for total private
sector contract values of US$487 million. For landfill construction, LGs received a one-

                                           -12-
off contribution of US$65 million for investments totaling US$253. A substantial part of
total government contribution also went to landfill rehabilitation, with most of the cost
covered (US$47 million contribution out of a total cost to LGs of US$72 million).
Limited support was provided to landfill operation, US$19 million subsidies for a total
contract volume of US$450. The rest of the government PNDM contributions were
allocated to elaborating SWM master plans, technical assistance, social measures, and
awareness-raising through awareness days on the PNDM to the benefit of all stakeholders.

41. The primary indicator, which can be used to capture the performance of the
program as a whole, is the percentage of municipal solid waste collected and
disposed in sanitary landfills. With outset in the actions supported by the DPL program,
the PNDM succeeded in taking this indicator from 10 percent in 2008 to 30 percent at the
end of 2011, reaching the target of 30 percent in advance of the PNDM target date of
end-2012. This is a very substantial achievement by any standards, but even more so in
the light of the social and environmental considerations incorporated into site selection,
improved technical standards, and the transparency of allocation of government financial
support to the PNDM, through the adopted allocation criteria, which have been published
on government websites. The DPL program‟s prior actions supporting clear eligibility
criteria for the allocation of financial support and appropriate funding for the PNDM in
the budget law provided incentives to close open dumpsites, with 21 dumpsites closed or
rehabilitated, largely surpassing the target of 12 dumpsites. The construction of 12 new
landfills, with financial contribution by the government through the PNDM as an
incentive, also contributed to the result. Further, increased sector investments has
contributed to improving the quality of service provision, with private sector operators
now providing collection services in 95 LGs, based on clear specifications, representing
66 percent of the urban population (against 40 percent in 2006). This represents about 5
million people in urban areas provided with improved and regular solid waste collection
as a result of the PNDM. The total collection rate is around 75 percent (private and public
providers together), against a PNDM baseline of 70 percent and a target of 90 percent in
2021. In comparison, based on government investments of about US$850 million since
2001, Algeria has reached a collection rate of 85 percent in urban areas, but only 15
percent of collected waste is landfilled and private sector participation is quasi-absent
(against US$212 for the Moroccan government for the PNDM Phase I).

42. Also, the consistency of SWM infrastructure supported through the PNDM with
national environmental regulations is a substantial achievement, given the novelty of
following clear environmental regulations, introduced by the Law 28-00 and its decrees.
The setting in place of regional EIA committees throughout the Kingdom was an
important contribution to this outcome, as they played an active role in critically
reviewing EIAs for all the SWM infrastructure supported under the PNDM and rejected
the EIAs that did not live up to required standards. Public EIA hearings also contributed
to participation and transparency. A total of 25 EIAs were reviewed as targeted; further, a
review carried out during the ICR mission showed that all bidding documents (100
percent) are consistent with national technical and environmental regulations, as targeted.




                                           -13-
43. On the social side, the program has promoted the early and systematic
consideration of social concerns in PSP contracts and PNDM eligibility criteria.
Morocco offers today the first experience in the region in term of waste-pickers inclusion
through partnership between LGs, private operators, and NGOs. As a result, a formal
waste-pickers cooperative was established and enters in partnership agreement with the
private operator offering better work environment and enhanced revenues for 154 people,
as targeted. Experiences from this pilot are ready to be scaled up; the development of a
financially viable waste recycling sector could potentially benefit 20,000 people, and is
being pursued by the government, supported by the Bank.

44. Some shortcomings in the achievement of indicators for the DPL program
should also be noted in terms of allocation of financial support, private sector
participation to tenders, and resource mobilization. Regarding allocation of financial
support, the PNDM experienced some problems during the initial implementation phase,
but the shortcomings were corrected through the adoption of a procedures manual and
hiring of additional experts to the PMU. The DPL Indicator 2 result of 80 percent hides
100 percent conformity with allocations for landfills in 2011. Private sector participation
to tenders did not improve significantly, as expected, although the maximum number of
bidders increased from five to six. The lack of performance can be explained mainly by
the relative novelty of the improved standard contracts and the longer time than expected
for the private sector to latch on to the better possibilities for participation in the sector.
Another factor explaining the low participation is the scarcity of private sector operators,
since the same bidders tend to recur in many of the tenders. To fully achieve the targeted
results, the DPL program could have focused more on accompanying market
development, which is currently around US$175 million per year, an increase over
US$100 in 2007, but not significant enough.

45. The DPL program has accompanied a transformation of the sector, as laid out in
the PNDM, which has moved from a concept of cleanliness in the cities to broader
considerations of social, environmental and economic sustainability aspects of SWM.
Over the course of four years, the basic elements to implement the Law 28-00 have been
set in place, seven decrees were adopted, and valuable experiences have been gained
under Phase I of the PNDM, which will allow a full roll-out of the program to small and
medium-size LGs, in line with the objective of the DPL program. The prior actions of
both DPL operations related to training programs supported the training of officials from
333 LGs, against 230 targeted. The MoI implemented a large part of the training on
technical aspects, but especially the GIZ also contributed to training on environmental
aspects. The basic capacities are starting to emerge in the sector, with the national
program having laid the groundwork and the program is starting to generate demand at
the LG level, based on clear financial incentives and improved regulatory environment.

Outcomes by operation
46. DPL1: Overall, the DPL1 was successful in meeting its objectives of establishing
an enabling environment for an integrated and affordable municipal solid waste
system, despite a few shortcomings, discussed below. The overall macro-economic


                                             -14-
framework was satisfactory. All conditions, triggers and targets identified in the policy
matrix and prior actions for the DPL1 were met without modifications.
Policy Area 1: Governance
47. The issuance of the circular to establish the CN-PNDM was key to the success of the
overall program, and to the synergies generated among ministries and with LGs. The CN
was headed by the MoE and included representatives from the MoI, MoF, MAEG, and of
the FEC. The CN-PNDM approved the annual work programs of the PNDM, as basis for
the work of the PMU hosted by the Directorate of Water and Sanitation in MoI. Regular
progress reports were elaborated by the PMU and adopted by the CN-PNDM. One of the
first activities of the CN-PNDM was to adopt the eligibility criteria for the allocation of
financial support to the municipalities under the PNDM, a prerequisite to getting the
program up and running. The publication of the decree related to classification of waste,
and the approval of draft decrees related to procedures for the elaboration of provincial
master plans for MSW and procedures and technical standards for MSW landfilling was
also essential elements to enable the government to provide financial support for
activities in LGs.
Policy Area 2: Sustainability
48. This policy area was supported by the actions related to the allocation of appropriate
funding for the PNDM in the budget law for 2009, assuring that activities could be
launched upon inception of the program. The appointment of the FEC as coordinating
mechanism for the CDM proved useful, but it was too optimistic to set an indicator for
generation of revenue from this activity, since the Carbon Finance (CF) stemming from
this activity would only be available once the program was up and running, necessitating
substantial investments in landfills. In terms of incentive for LGs to get involved in the
program and potential revenue generation, the CDM did however prove extremely useful,
with an agreement close to being reached between the FEC and the Carbon Partnership
Facility, managed by the World Bank (see also Annex 4 for a fuller presentation of the
CDM). The last activity supported under this policy area was the launch of a fully funded
capacity development program targeted at officials at all levels of administration (central
government agencies, regions, provinces, LGs). This activity was carried out by the
government with support from several donors (especially GIZ, KFW, AFD), and ran
throughout the implementation of Phase I of the PNDM, greatly benefiting the DPL
program. Training covered overall environmental considerations, environmental impact
assessment, SW collection and transfer, landfilling, SWM financing, and SWM master
plans at provincial level. Training was provided by a wide array of service providers,
including MoI, FEC, and private training institutes.
Policy Area 3: Social and environmental considerations
49. This policy area was probably the most neglected prior to the DPL program, and, as
for the two other policy areas, the activities were well targeted towards the most pressing
needs in order to get the PNDM up and running. Publication of the decree related to the
operation of national and regional EIA committees, along with the decree on procedures
for EIA-related public consultations, were essential to set in place a regulatory
framework, in keeping with the PNDM objective of mainstreaming social and
environmental considerations into the planning, implementation, and operation of MSW

                                           -15-
services and investments. The adoption of the principles for the inclusion of social
considerations in the framework of the PNDM was a further step in this direction.

50. DPL2: Overall, DPL2 was successful in meeting its objectives of capitalizing on the
momentum gained during the first operation while deepening the reforms at the regional
and municipal levels, although at the end of the DPL program, some shortcomings are
noted in terms of LG capacity to take the program to full implementation.
Policy Area 1: Governance
51. Building on the actions supported under DPL1, the second DPL supported the
continuing operation of the CN-PNDM, including the review and approval of model
bidding documents, a prerequisite to increased private sector participation,
competitiveness, and efficiency of service delivery. The establishment of regional
commissions for MSW master plans provided the foundation for inter-communal
planning of SWM infrastructure, necessary to achieve economies of scale as the PNDM
is rolled out to medium and small LGs, although the actual elaboration of master plans is
behind schedule, with only five provincial plans adopted so far. However, 18 more are
under development. The communications and awareness program helped push for
increased acceptance of the new initiatives by the public, including regarding the
necessity for LGs to provide adequate funding for SWM activities given the new
environmental and social standards.
Policy Area 2: Sustainability
52. After the groundwork for financial sustainability had been set in place under DPL1,
sustainability hinged largely on continued improved capacity development to assure that
the enlarging group of actors necessary to implement the program at the local level was
capable of contributing to the expected results. Support to capacity building continued
from key donors. During DPL2, the FEC continued to work on rendering the CDM useful
to the LGs, based on the activity supported by DPL1.
Policy Area 3: Social and environmental considerations
53. The establishment of regional EIA committees under DPL2 was based on the
finalization, under DPL1, of the regulation for national and regional EIA committees,
along with the decree on procedures for EIA-related public consultations. The partnership
agreements signed between the central and local governments to improve solid waste
services assured that concrete activities were implemented, and contributed to achieving
the indicator relating to the closure of open dumpsites and the ultimate goal of disposing
MSW in sanitary landfills.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Satisfactory

54. The high continued relevance of objectives, design and implementation, and Bank
support to the SWM sector through the DPL instrument, combined with achievement of
the main indicators but with moderate shortcomings on a number of secondary expected
outcomes justifies a rating of satisfactory.


                                          -16-
3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
55. The modernization of the MSW collection services was implemented mostly through
private sector participation and benefits today to about 66 percent of the urban population.
The related private sector contracts are based on common standards for service delivery
(quality and coverage) in low, medium and high income urban neighborhoods. Hence,
poor communities previously un-served and/or suffering from low quality services now
have equal access to decent MSW collection services. In addition, the closure of
dumpsites contributed to environmental improvement of the nearby areas often inhabited
by low income households. The impact on waste pickers is described above, section 3.2.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
56. Institutional change and strengthening was an integral part of the DPL program. The
impacts are described in section 3.2.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
57. The upgrading of the EIA system generates benefits beyond the sector to cover all
investment projects requiring an EIA.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
58. Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Moderate

59. Commitments to the reform and implementation capacity risks. The quality of
the Bank-client dialogue during the first programmatic series (DPL1&2) and dialogue on
DPL3&4 indicate that reform commitment remains robust. Technical capacity is largely
adequate at the central level and to some extent at the LG level and in the private sector
as the ultimate implementers of the reform program, but the institutional capacity to
coordinate and assure multi-sector coordination and efficiency of resource allocation
remains weak. Progress has been made on the systematization of procedures for the
allocation of financial support to municipalities, but the capacity of municipalities to
manage investments and service outsourcing (and in particular the capacity of medium-
sized and smaller municipalities), and the central government‟s monitoring arrangements
remain areas of risk.

60. This potential risk is mitigated by government‟s continued strong commitment to: (i)
scale up and mainstream the solid waste capacity building activities within the
government program to support decentralization at municipal level and to implement
regionalization of government support structures; (ii) continue to fund the reform
program, through the indicative allocation of MAD 200 million (US$23 million) annually
to the program for the duration of the government mandate (until 2017); and (iii) continue
to mobilize appropriate human resources to support the management of the program at
national and local levels.



                                           -17-
61. Social acceptance risk, namely the risk that the reforms will be unacceptable to
the general public and to waste pickers. While pilot projects implemented so far for the
re-employment of waste pickers are proving successful and the public profile of the solid
waste reforms has been fairly low, resistance from local populations has been noted in
several concrete cases, especially in relation to site selection for landfills. There also
remains a risk of adverse reaction to the future introduction of new sources of municipal
revenue. This potential risk is mitigated through the government‟s decision to create LG
budget annexes specifying line items for SWM, increasing transparency of resource
allocation, and the mandatory requirement for operators to cover social aspects in future
contracts.

62. The possibility of municipalities resisting the solid waste reforms remains real
but is mitigated by the continued allocation of targeted financial support. Analysis of
LG budgets indicate that funds are in principle available to pay private sector operators,
but that the political economy of budget management at the LG level often leads to late
payment of invoices and accumulation of arrears. Some concerns remain that the
incremental cost of the required investments may prove too high for some municipalities,
especially as the program is rolled out to medium-size and small LGs. The magnitude of
this potential risk is being partly addressed through a recently completed KFW-funded
study on institutional and financial aspects, coupled with additional analysis of
institutional options, and the government is fully committed to tailor its financial support
to small and poor local governments if needed. In the longer term, the progressive shift of
financial responsibility from government budgets to municipal taxpayers may weaken
municipalities‟ commitment to improved solid waste management practices. This
potential risk is mitigated by the government‟s strong commitment to proceed with the
envisaged municipal finance reforms, including the foreseen implementation of eco-taxes
and a SWM fee for large producers. Inter-municipal cooperation and regionalization of
solid waste disposal facilities will also help especially small municipalities to take
advantage of the significant economies of scale in waste management, but coordinated
planning of these investments needs to be strengthened.

63. The rapid increase in funding for the sector, stemming from political
prioritization, carries the risk of shortcomings and wastage in the implementation of
works. While the technical capacity is largely present, the institutional complexity of the
sector could lead to sub-optimal investment planning, especially as the program is rolled
out to medium and small municipalities, running the risk of a high level of wastage in the
initial phase of the PNDM, potentially locking in resources in sub-standard infrastructure
for many years to come. While DLP 1&2 contributed to increased private sector
participation in the sector, pushing for cost reduction, the market should be further
developed as should capacity to assure a fully optimal procurement process, effectively
implement works and supervise construction. The ongoing independent evaluation of
phase I of the PNDM will draw important lessons that will serve as basis for the
implementation of PNDM Phase II and preparation of DPL3&4, and thus facilitate the
mitigation of these risks.




                                           -18-
64. The public-private partnership approach developed under the series remains
fragile, but this risk is being mitigated through measures introduced under DPL1&2 and
only having effect now (such as standardized contracts), and targeted support to budget
and project management at the LG level.

65. Overall, it is not very likely that any single risk stemming from the institutional
complexity of the sector, combined with financial, economic, and social risks will
materialize. Further, mitigation measures are in place going forward and the government
remains fully committed to the program, including through funding allocation, justifying
an overall risk rating of moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: DPL1: Satisfactory. DPL2: Satisfactory

66. DPL1: The Bank‟s performance is rated satisfactory. The design choice of a series of
single tranche DPLs governed by a medium term program with triggers for the second
operation has allowed for flexibility in achieving programmatic objectives. This design
reinforces the hand of the reformers in the government. Throughout preparation and
implementation the Bank played a catalytic role in gathering ideas and people, as well as
transferring knowledge and solving problems and contentious issues. The design of the
DPL program benefited greatly from the base of analytical work done in a highly
participatory way.

67. DPL2: Overall, Bank performance was satisfactory during loan preparation and
appraisal. An active policy dialogue permitted satisfactory completion of triggers, while
effectively staging DPL2 as the instrument to operationalize tools initiated during DPL1.
The design of the program benefited from the analytical base and close supervision of
DPL1. The Bank team also accompanied the government through flexible adjustments in
the program which helped ensure its successful implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Ratings: Satisfactory

68. The DPL program implementation has been supervised thoroughly by a well
composed Bank task team. Six missions were carried out during implementation, with
detailed supervision reports. The findings were discussed with government and corrective
measures taken when needed. Further, the various members of the project team, with
expertise in different areas, followed the progress in the different components in detail. A
detailed progress report was elaborated in July 2010 to evaluate implementation of
measures supported by the program. Only minor shortcoming is the missed opportunity
for the Bank to accompany the government to strengthen the PNDM results framework
early on by leveraging DPL outcome indicators. The careful supervision helped to build
what is generally considered an excellent relation between the client and the Bank, as
confirmed by government counterpart during the ICR mission and in the government ICR
                                           -19-
(see Annex 4). Bank missions maintained contact with all project stakeholders, including
other donors, thus removing potential roadblocks to project implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

69. The DPL program was a well-designed and implemented operation, with few
shortcomings, none of which were substantial. As Bank performance for both quality at
entry and supervision are rated satisfactory, overall Bank performance is rated
satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

70. The government has committed fully to the program and to achieving the
development objectives, and has made substantial efforts to implement prior actions and
follow up on shortcomings in implementation, including hiring two experts to assure
adequate monitoring of the PNDM. The enabling environment included supportive
macro, sectoral, and institutional policies appropriate to country circumstances.
Stakeholders and civil society were consulted extensively at the beginning of the program
development, and mechanisms were set in place for inclusion of persons affected by
SWM activities resulting from the program. Most implementation issues were resolved
on a timely basis and the relationships and coordination with the Bank and other donors
were excellent throughout. The SWM DPL program provides a comprehensive
framework for continued sector improvement and transition to the next series of
operations.

71. The government‟s performance also had some shortcomings with regard to M&E
arrangements, including the utilization of M&E data in decision-making and resource
allocation for the PNDM supported by the DPL program. This is not because of the
government‟s unwillingness to perform well in these areas, but simply because M&E is a
relatively new concept in the sector and needs time to be fully appropriated, as testified
by the recent setting in place of quarterly reporting for the PNDM. Nonetheless,
government performance overall is rated satisfactory in light of the satisfactory ratings on
most aspects of program preparation and implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

72. The implementing agency is indistinguishable from the government for this DPL
program. Policy actions were implemented by several ministries under the supervision of
the CN-PDNM. The PMU in MoI was the implementing agency for the PNDM, but is not
evaluated in connection with the reform program supported by the Bank.



                                           -20-
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

73. The rating corresponds to the rating for government performance, as there was no
separate implementing agency.

6. Lessons Learned

74. The following lessons have been learned from the implementation of DLP1&2, and
are being incorporated into the next series of programmatic DPLs (DPL3&4) as relevant.

75. The experience of the programmatic series of two Municipal Solid Waste Sector
DPLs has been very positive and confirms the usefulness of the DLP instrument
under the right set of circumstances. Contributing factors included a long history of
Bank-client dialogue on sector policies and strong analytical foundation, which allowed
the Bank to accompany the government in a well-designed and phased program of home-
grown sector reform in a complex sector. The programmatic series was centered on a
simple policy matrix to substantiate the program of reforms as an emerging political
priority, with shared ownership of the reforms by the Ministries of Interior, Finance and
Environment. Investment lending could not have provided the same leverage on reforms,
due to the DPL nature as entry point to policy dialogue and the visibility accorded to the
reform program from the engagement of the Bank. The government was fully committed
to the program and took advantage of the analysis, planning framework, implementation
support and convening power offered by a DPL program whilst maintaining full
leadership and ownership of the reforms themselves, which was also essential factors
contributing to the success of the DPL program.

76. Regular program monitoring should build on a functional and fully integrated
national system. The PNDM is now completing the initiation phase and moving to full
implementation. The programmatic series has shown that DPLs should pay specific
attention to M&E issues in an emerging sector to correct any systematic under-
performance early on. While the government was able to provide information on the
results of the programmatic series in the context of this ICR, based on the results
indicators in the policy matrix, the monitoring of DPL program outcomes, based on the
underlying sector program (PNDM), should be strengthened for subsequent phases to
assure that real-time information is available to correct implementation backlogs and/or
lack of results. DPL3&4 aim to introduce a number of measures to allow the government
to learn from implementation, including an in-depth evaluation of PNDM phase I.

77. A policy reform program needs to be accompanied by adequate tools and
procedures to avoid reverse salients during implementation. DPL2 recognized this
shortcoming of DPL1 and supported the government in strengthening the PMU in the
Directorate of Water and Sanitation in MoI through the hiring of two experts, as well as
the preparation of an operational manual for the PNDM to assure precision in the use of
the allocation of investment support from the center to the municipalities, and to
strengthen investment appraisals, financing, and contracting mechanisms adopted under

                                           -21-
DPL1. Coordination with other donors is also important to accompany roll-out of reforms,
as showed by the impact of the capacity building under DLP1&2, although not enough
compared to the needs. DPL3&4 focus on project management in LGs to mitigate this
capacity shortcoming and supporting regionalization of government support structures.

78. Sector reform can be coupled successfully with overall decentralization and
improvements to local government finance. DPL1&2 were able to lay the foundations
for decentralized service delivery in the cities of Morocco through working at the LG
finances level, allowing the program to focus on service delivery overall and also lay the
foundations for improved local government budget management to reduce arrears with
private sector service providers. However, room for improvement remains in this area,
and as the PNDM is rolled out increasing attention will have to be paid to operating costs,
which will constitute a significant part of the budgets of smaller LGs. This is leading
DPL3&4 to continue to place increased focus on LG budget management and
transparency as key factors to enhancing private sector confidence and willingness to
engage in the sector. DLP3&4 also capitalize on lessons learned regarding local
government finances and the overall financial sustainability of the SWM sector by
looking at eco-taxes and SWM fees for large waste producers as a means to assure
adequate funding.

79. Continued coordination among ministries, national entities and municipalities is
needed for sustained successful results. One of the major impacts of the DPL program
is to mainstream coordinated planning to support the MSW reform program. This is a
major milestone in the way the government conducts business, not only in the solid waste
sector but in other reform areas. The Bank was able to act as catalyst for enhanced inter-
ministerial collaboration and accompany the government in a new spirit of openness in
which the ministries were looking for partnerships but did not yet have the habit of
working together on cross-sectoral issues.

80. Municipalities’ financial and technical capacity to implement the policy reform
has also come increasingly under the spotlight. Municipalities are benefiting from
intense capacity-building support provided by the Ministry of Interior as well as the AFD
(in municipal finance), GIZ and KFW (in SWM). As the focus of the solid waste
management reforms shifts from the initiation stage, focused on large and well-resourced
cities to medium sized and smaller LGs, the planning and management of capacity-
building activities will become increasingly important. The institutions at regional and
local level remain below capacity compared to what is needed to take the program into
the next phase, including carrying out inter-communal planning, and DPL3&4 place
focus on the overall coherence of sector reform with regionalization of support structures.

81. Quality of service delivery and involvement of the private sector increased under
the DPL program, but more should be done to increase cost-effectiveness and assure
funding in the longer term. While private sector participation as services providers in
the MSW sector increased substantially, the capacity building and standard specifications
supported by the DPL series have shown their limit in terms of improving cost-
effectiveness, and more has to be done in terms of market development. For now, the

                                           -22-
major cities have the funds necessary to contract out services, based on revenues from the
municipal service tax, but as coverage rates and service standards continue to increase,
new sources of funds targeted to MSW should be developed, also by looking at
investments by the private sector.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies
82. The quasi-final version of the ICR was translated into French and shared with the
borrower through the MAEG, which communicated it to the relevant ministries. After the
review, the MAEG confirmed not having any specific comments on the ICR.

(b) Cofinanciers
83. The project had no cofinanciers.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
84. The ICR was shared with GIZ for comments. GIZ confirmed their continued support of the
SWM sector, were appreciative for the mention of GIZ contributions, and confirmed that they do
not have any further comments on the ICR.

                             Kingdom of Morocco
  Completion report for the Morocco Household Waste Sector Support Program
                                  (May 2012)

2. The PNDM was supported by the World Bank in its first phase which lasted from 2008
to 2012 through two Solid Waste Sector DPLs. The program aims to support Morocco in
the implementation of PNDM through improved financial, environmental and social
performance and good governance in the household waste sector.

   I.      Context, objectives and design

Context of the PNDM

3. Morocco has in recent years implemented a proactive policy management in terms of
sustainable development and environmental protection. Since the establishment in 1992
of a ministerial department responsible for the environment, many initiatives have
emerged, including relating to professional collection services, cleaning and disposal of
household waste. Similarly, the international awareness for better environmental
management and conservation is increasingly reflected in Morocco. Political will is
expressed at the highest level of state including through the launch of the National
Human Development Initiative, the fight against poverty, social development and the
Environment and Sustainable Development Charter.

Present situation
4. Morocco had a population of about 30 million people in 2004 with a natural growth
rate of 1.4 percent and 55 percent of the population lived in urban areas. The average
production of household waste in urban areas reached about 0.76 kg/capita/day,
corresponding to 5.2 million tons, and 1.6 million tons were generated in rural areas (0.3
kg/capita/day). Solid waste management is undoubtedly one of the major environmental
problems facing Morocco. Thus, inadequate collection and uncontrolled disposal of waste
and the proliferation of uncontrolled landfills and dumps in public lands or waterways
contribute to the spread of diseases, landscape degradation and water contamination
surface and groundwater. A national program for managing household waste has been
developed to improve the environment and the living environment of urban populations.




                                          -29-
Institutional framework
5. The sector management shortcomings recognized for some time were mainly due to
institutional, legal, managerial and financial constraints, including inadequate legal and
institutional framework that limits the efficacy of sector governance, leads to low cost-
effectiveness of services and uncertain long-term financial viability of the sector. There
was an urgent need for integrated systems and implementation of modernized household
waste management to mitigate the economic, environmental and social impacts of
existing systems.

Government strategy
6. To remedy these shortcomings, the government has undertaken in recent years a series
of actions towards sector reform, including:

  The publication in December 2006 of Law 28-00 on waste management. This law
   reflects a clear political will to upgrade household waste management in particular.
  Declaration of October 2007 in which the Government placed the issue of solid
   waste management, and in particular the treatment of household waste, among the
   priorities of government including support to LGs and assuring environmental
   protection and sustainable development. This political will was reflected in the
   establishment, in the Budget Law 2007, of a special fund account entitled ‘National
   Fund for Protection and Enhancement of the Environment’, including specific
   support to the PNDM.
  In parallel, at the LG level, sustained action was carried out for the improvement and
   professionalization of waste collection services. Most large and medium cities,
   including the cities of Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangier, have initiated projects to
   achieve full professional collection services. In 2007, thanks to the efforts already
   made, the rate of professionalization had reached 40 percent of the urban population
   as part of outsourcing contracts to private operators.
  The development, in 2007, jointly by the Ministry of Interior and the Department of
   the Environment, of the PNDM. This is a program to upgrade the management of
   household waste by 2020. The total program cost is about MAD 37 billion over 15
   years and covering the full collection and disposal chain.

Donor support
7. Morocco has received support from the World Bank for PNDM phase I (2008-2012)
through:

  Technical support for framing and operationalizing the PNDM, including review of
   development objectives and components of PNDM, definition of priorities for
   technical and financial support and the definition of eligibility criteria and allocation
   of financial support, development of procedures for implementation and monitoring
   of PNDM (i.e. organization of technical coordination), ensuring the rational use of
   financial resources by the PNDM and approval of annual programs of State
   intervention.
  Support to the development and implementation of a programmatic Clean
   Development Mechanism (CDM) in the solid waste sector. The Bank has made

                                           -30-
   available to the Moroccan authorities and especially the FEC, its experience and
   expertise in carbon finance development through a programmatic approach.
  Two loans (DPL1&2) to support policy development in the waste sector, to ensure
   improved governance of the household waste sector, promote and support solid
   waste service management, and improve the management of environmental and
   social dimensions.
  Piloting a study on poverty and social impacts of the reform of municipal solid waste
   sector in Morocco (PSIA I).
  The Bank also mobilized a PPIAF grant for financing the study on a strategy of
   private sector participation in solid waste management in Morocco.

8. Other donors have contributed to the implementation of the PNDM, including:

  German International Cooperation Agency (GIZ) initiated in collaboration with LGs
   and government departments concerned an important environmental protection and
   management program (PGPE). The program represents a continuity of the German
   Technical Cooperation in management and environmental protection in Morocco,
   supported by the PNDM:
   o Capacity building in SWM.
   o Support for the establishment of integrated and sustainable hazardous waste
     management.
   o Improving waste management in the Northern Region (Tangier).
   o Support for environmental upgrading of industry, environmental capacity building,
     and technology transfer at the Prefecture of Mohammedia.

  KFW supports Morocco in:
   o Developing a strategy and management plan for hazardous and special wastes.
   o Piloting analytical work on the identification of options for improving the
     financial sustainability of the household waste sector.

  JICA supports the commune of Tiznit to upgrade the household waste sector
   through:
   o Capacity building of LG staff.
   o Implementation of pilot actions.
   o Equipping the municipality with waste management hardware.


  UNDP undertook a series of projects and programs in Morocco in the SWM sector:
   o Assistance to waste pickers.
   o Piloting a PSIA II for the sector.
   o Strengthening of the program „Partnership with Associations Active in the Field
     of Environment and Sustainable Development‟.

Development objective and key indicators of the PNDM

Objective of the PNDM
9. The PNDM aims to support urban municipalities to:

                                         -31-
  Ensure the collection and cleaning of household waste in urban centers and reach a
   collection rate of 90 percent by 2020 and 100 percent by 2030.
  Establish landfills for the benefit of all urban centers by 2020.
  Rehabilitate and close all existing spontaneous dumpsites by 2020.
  Professionalize the industry both for LGs managing in-house for those who opted for
   managed services through a public-private partnership.
  Organize and develop the "sorting - recycling - recovery" sector, with pilot screening,
   reaching a recycling rate of 20 percent by 2020.
  Generalize master plans for household waste management for all prefectures and
   provinces of the Kingdom.
  Awareness-raising and training of stakeholders on the issue of household waste.

Objectives of the program supported by the World Bank
10. The PDO of the DPL program was to support the government in implementing the
first phase of the reform program for the household waste sector through improving
sector governance, financial, environmental and social performance. Both operations
were well implemented, through three components:

 1. Improving governance in the sector by means of appropriate legal, regulatory and
    institutional measures designed to provide a clear framework for the sector.
 2. Improving the sustainability of household waste management services by
    introducing financial mechanisms and incentives for municipalities to support the
    viability of investments and services.
 3. Integration of environmental and social dimensions in planning, execution and
    implementation of services and investments in the household waste sector.

11. DPL1 supported the main tenets of the reform program, which established the
blueprint for the integrated management of waste. The second operation (DPL2) of the
reform program was to capitalize on knowledge of the first operation, deepening reforms
at central and municipal level.

12. In terms of sector governance, actions focused on:

  Promoting consistency and transparency of government actions in the solid waste
   sector by setting up the CN-PNDM to ensure monitoring and evaluation of the
   program, definition and adoption by the CN-PNDM of eligibility criteria for the
   allocation of financial support to local authorities as part of PNDM, establishment of
   a management unit for PNDM within the Directorate of Water and Sanitation in the
   Ministry of Interior, and the publication, via the website for improved private sector
   participation in solid waste sector, of the revised model bidding documents and
   contracts (adopted by the CN-PNDM) from 2010.
  Ensuring the implementation of Law 28-00 through the national policy on solid
   waste via the publication of decrees relating to the modalities for preparing
   Provincial or Prefectural master plans for SWM and administrative procedures and
   technical requirements for landfills, the establishment and operationalization of

                                          -32-
   Provincial or Prefectural Commissions charged with examining and validation
   master plans.
  Improving transparency, competitiveness and accountability for improved private
   sector participation in solid waste sector, using the revised model bidding documents
   and contracts (adopted by the CN-PNDM) from 2010.
  Changing public behavior and improving decision making across local government
   for solid waste services through the development in 2011 of a national
   communication and public awareness campaign and mobilizing the necessary
   funding under the PNDM.

13. In terms of financial sustainability of SWM services, actions focused on:

  Strengthening the financial capacity of local authorities to meet the financial
   requirements of the modernized systems of integrated solid waste management. The
   government committed to allocating a substantial budget to PNDM in the Budget
   Law, launching a study on the financial sustainability of household waste services,
   and developing a national CDM in the household waste sector.
  Strengthening the technical capacity of LGs for improved household waste
   management.

14. Regarding improvement of environmental and social performance, government is
committed to:

  Upgrading and operationalization of the EIA system at the national and regional
   levels and publishing in the Official Bulletin the two decrees on the allocation and
   operation of the National and Regional EIA Committees, and methods for organizing
   and holding public hearings on projects subject to EIA, the establishment and
   operationalization of at least three regional EIA committees, and developing a
   manual of procedures for evaluation and approval of EIAs by the National and
   Regional Committees.
  Improving the environmental performance of the solid waste sector, with the launch
   of the project to install at least three new landfills and closing of at least three
   uncontrolled landfills.
  Improving social performance of the SW sector, through the adoption by the CN-
   PNDM of a multiannual program for social integration of waste pickers and launch
   of a first pilot (including a census of waste pickers, and recovery actions for
   improving working conditions and hygiene), the expansion of social integration
   program of recovery to all projects supported by the PNDM, and the inclusion of
   social clauses in the revised model bidding documents and contracts.

   II.     Design and implementation of the PNDM

Performance evaluation of the sector reform support program

Implementation of the support program
15. As part of the sector governance component, the CN-PNDM was established,
followed by the definition and adoption by the Commission of the eligibility criteria for
allocating financial support to local authorities, the establishment of a PNDM Project
Management Unit (PMU) and publication, via the Department of Environment and local
government websites, of the eligibility criteria for allocation of financial support as part
of PNDM.

16. On the regulatory front, the program saw the publication of regulations implementing
Law 28-00 namely the decree on the procedure for preparation of the provincial or
prefectural master plan for managing household waste, the Decree on administrative
procedures and technical requirements for landfills, as well as the establishment and
operationalization of Provincial or Prefectural Commissions examining and validating
master plans and the signing of the Joint Ministerial Decision on terms of reference of
provincial and prefectural master plans for the management of household waste. Also, a
draft joint order of the Ministry of Interior and the Department of Environment defining
the characteristics of the geological barrier forming the base layer of the landfill site is
being developed. In addition, the CN-PNDM adopted the revised model bidding
documents and contracts, and the development of a circular by the Ministry of the
Interior instructing local authorities to use these Documents from 2010, and the
publication of such documents through the website of local authorities.

17. A national program of communication and public awareness in the waste sector was
validated by the CN-PNDM in June 2011.

18. In terms of promoting sustainability of household waste management services, annual
appropriations are allocated LGs by the State through the PNDM to strengthen their
financial capabilities to meet the costs of management of household waste services. A
study on the institutional and financial framework conditions for the management of
household waste is being developed to clarify ways of sustaining sources of funding.

19. In addition a program of activities for a national programmatic CDM project is being
implemented by the FEC. In order for LGs to reap the financial and environmental
benefits of the CDM, the FEC concluded in 2009 a partnership agreement with the World
Bank. The FEC thus becomes one of the first signatories to the agreement to participate
in the Carbon Partnership Facility of the World Bank, which guarantees long-term
marketing of Carbon Emission Reductions on the international carbon market. To this
end, the FEC has set up a support mechanism for LGs. This mechanism, developed in
partnership with the World Bank according to a programmatic approach and consistent
with the PNDM, aims to make the LGs benefit from financial and environmental benefits
of landfill biogas capture projects and its promotion of renewable energy. By integrating
this system, the LGs will benefit from technical expertise, financial and legal advice, and

                                           -34-
other benefits of the program approach, including reduced lead times of CDM projects
and the economy of scale in projects and marketing of carbon credits. This system is
operational and can accommodate projects of LGs having expressed a desire to develop
CDM projects in the solid waste sector. Under this program, Morocco has received a
donation of the Carbon Asset Development Facility, amounting to US$520,000,
dedicated exclusively to cover certain costs relating to the expertise required for
preparing CDM projects to benefit local communities, including the development of
feasibility studies, project documents, and plans for monitoring the production of carbon
credits and support the validation and verification of CDM projects.

20. The technical capacity of local authorities is also an important link to sector reform.
Thus, a capacity building program is underway and will continue throughout the
implementation of PNDM.

21. Regarding improvement of environmental and social performance, should be
mentioned the publication of the two decrees on the allocation and operation of the
National and Regional EIA Committees, and methods for organizing and holding public
hearings on projects subject to EIA. Regional Committees are also established and
trained across all regions. A manual of procedures for EIA evaluation and approval by
the National and Regional Committees is prepared and circulated.

22. Approaches for improving the social performance of the solid waste sector are being
developed through the completed PSIA study, with the final report validated by the CN-
PNDM. A multiannual program for social integration of waste pickers will be developed
and adopted by the CN-PNDM. A pilot including a census of waste pickers and actions to
improve hygiene and work conditions is already being implemented in Oum Azza and
others are planned in Casablanca and Agadir. Also, the social aspect is built into all
projects supported by the PNDM and related clauses are incorporated in the revised
model bidding documents and contracts. Currently, a waste sorting center is established
and operational at Oum Azza (Rabat), benefiting scavengers previously operating at the
Akreuch landfill. These waste pickers are organized in a cooperative.

Achievements
23. Since the inception of PNDM in 2008, the "Collection and Cleansing" activity has
benefited from support allocated to municipalities to support them with certain ongoing
contracts and also stimulate further improvements in SWM, ensuring an improved
collection rate in urban areas. The support allocated to LGs from 2008 to end December
2011 for collection and cleaning aggregates to MAD 451 million. Since 2010, LGs use
revised model bidding documents and contracts for delegated management of household
waste management in the private sector. The support provided has enabled the following
improvements, in terms of collecting and cleaning:

  Improving the coverage of the "professionalized" collection in urban areas from 40
   percent in 2007 to 66 percent (in terms of population) through 81 operations
   involving 95 municipalities.



                                           -35-
  The annual cost of professional collection has increased from MAD 804 million in
   2007 to MAD 1.5 billion in 2011.
  Improving the tonnage collected from 2.1 to 3,890,000 t / year, or a collection rate of
   about 75 percent of municipal waste.
  Also, environmental performance of the solid waste sector improved through
   disposal in controlled landfills; bringing today to 30 percent the amount of waste
   landfilled in a professional manner, a number that should reach about 64 percent
   with the completion of landfill sites already under construction.

24. The cumulative support granted to municipalities under the PNDM for the realization
of landfills and transfer stations amounted to MAD 439 million. This support involved
twelve (12) landfills and three transfer stations. Thus, seven landfills have been
constructed after the start of PNDM, which has helped increase the tonnage landfilled
from 10 percent to 30 percent of the total tonnage produced in urban areas in 2011.

25. In terms of prefectural or provincial master plans for household waste, MAD 93
million has been allocated to local authorities to reach 62 provinces since the start of
PNDM. Five master plans have already been developed including the master plan for
household waste for Tetouan, supported by the GIZ, and four others developed through a
partnership between the Ministry of Interior, the Department of the Environment and
regional development agencies. Currently 18 master plans are being developed.

26. The 2011 PNDM action plan foresaw the widespread use of master plans for all other
provinces or prefectures, since Law 28-00 on waste management stipulates in Article No.
12 that "Within five (5) years starting the date of publication of this Act, the territory of
each prefecture or province must be covered by a prefectural or provincial master plan for
the management of household waste." This law was published in the Official Bulletin. No.
5480 of 7 December 2006, which mandates the implementation of provincial or
prefectural master plans by the end of 2012.

27. Within the framework of accompanying measures for the success of the PNDM, an
envelope of MAD 3 million has been earmarked for the implementation of an outreach
and communication program and an envelope of MAD 7.9 million has been earmarked
for technical assistance to the PMU and local authorities. Technical assistance to the
PMU has been implemented in an effective manner since March 2011.

28. A training program was also implemented, aiming to improve the skills of the
participants (LG staff, trainers, etc.) on environmental issues in general and in terms of
household and similar waste in particular. During 2011, seven training sessions on
household waste master plans and integrated household waste management have been
organized for the benefit of 203 officials (top and middle) within 131 municipalities and
36 provinces / prefectures.

29. Further, to improve the social performance of the solid waste industry, the expansion
of social integration program of waste pickers has been expanded to all projects
supported by the PNDM and the clauses on social aspects were included in the

                                            -36-
agreements relating to the implementation of PNDM and the revised model bidding
documents and contracts. Thus, these clauses were included in contracts for the
discharges of Agadir and Casablanca. The waste pickers of the former discharge of
Akreuch, being rehabilitated in Oum Azza, Rabat were organized into a cooperative
called "Attawafouk" and integrated into the new sorting center in operation since June
2011. The number beneficiaries is 154.

30. Regarding the CDM program of activities the validation process of the program was
launched in September 2010, including the specific projects of the landfills of Oum Azza
and Oujda. The validation process of documentation of the program of activities and the
specific Oum Azza project is in the final phase and submission by the validator of these
documents to the Executive Board for CDM registration is imminent.

31. For other LGs potentially eligible for the CDM, the FEC has compiled a portfolio of
potential projects and has begun a campaign of awareness and information on support
available to LGs for the preparation of CDM projects and the marketing of carbon credits.
Thus, the cities of Moulay Abdelah (El Jadida landfill), Agadir and Rabat (Akreuch
landfill) have expressed their desire to benefit from the support of the FEC for the
preparation of CDM projects. In response, the FEC, after signing partnership agreements,
has begun preparations for the launch of studies on CDM projects on LG landfills. The
terms of reference to launch a tender for the selection of an expert CDM consultant was
developed and validated, a notice of call for expressions of interest has been issued.

Main factors influencing implementation

32. Implementation of the program has experienced a very significant success.
Accomplishments have far exceeded the predefined objectives of the program during the
identification and project preparation. This success can be explained by:

  The strong will of decision makers to upgrade management of the household waste
   sector.
  The appropriate institutional framework, particularly the role of the CN-PNDM in
   monitoring and evaluating the program, the role of the PMU in the daily
   management of the program and particularly the implication of LGs in upgrading
   sector performance and the implementation of the decrees to operationalize Law 28-
   00.
  Technical assistance from the World Bank to define eligibility criteria for
   government support to LGs, the clear vision of public-private partnerships and use of
   revised model bidding documents and contracts, incorporating a social clause based
   on the PSIA study.
  The adoption of a participatory approach with the organization of awareness days on
   the PNDM to the benefit of all stakeholders.
  Project monitoring by the relevant missions of the World Bank. The project team got
   involved in an effective manner to help overcome the constraints of the program.
   The example of the proposed recruitment of experts to strengthen the PMU can be
   mentioned.

                                          -37-
33. Identified risks are the same for both operations:

     The commitment vis-à-vis the reform and implementation capabilities. This risk has
      been mitigated at the LG level by setting in place capacity building program in the
      area of household waste management and adequate financial support for sector
      management at local and national level.
     The inclusion and particularly the social acceptance of reforms by the public and
      collectors. Integration of the social clause in standard contracts and communication
      is also very important to support stakeholders‟ adherence to the reforms.
     The risk that the LGs resist reforms was mitigated by financial support of the state to
      LGs.

34. The constraints identified for both operations include:

     Skill shortages in the field of waste management at municipal level.
     Choice of landfill sites.
     The cumbersome procedures for the signing of agreements (conventions adopted by
      the municipal councils).

Monitoring and evaluation of the project

35. Indicators were defined to monitor the performance of program implementation. As
part of improving governance, indicators focused on:

     The annual action plan and progress reports of PNDM examined and validated by
      CN-PNDM. Since 2009 annual action plans were reviewed and approved by the CN-
      PNDM, and progress reports were also adopted by the commission (16 meetings of
      the CN-PNDM took place during the period 2009-2011).
     The percentage of funding from the state to local governments in accordance with
      the eligibility criteria adopted should not exceed 30 percent of the cost for each
      project. For 2008-2011, state support for collection and cleaning reached a 69
      percent, and 65.7 percent for the construction and rehabilitation of landfills. Since
      the adoption of a procedures manual and the arrival of the technical assistants to the
      PMU in March 2011, the allocation criteria have been respected for all financial
      support to landfills and for 80 of financial support overall.
     In terms of increased competition in bidding for SWM, the average number of offers
      by tender is 3.6 (2 to 6) for the collection, and 5.8 (from 3 to 10) for landfills.6
     The number of thematic conventions signed between the State and local
      governments to upgrade their SWM systems reached 11 in 2011.

 Note: The ICR does not include the bids for landfill construction for the evaluation of DPL2 Indicator 4, as
there were no tenders for landfill construction prior to the PNDM and hence no comparator baseline.

                                                    -38-
36. Several indicators on improving household waste management services were
monitored, including:

  The number of beneficiaries of local government capacity building: 656 senior and
   middle managers have benefited from training on the environment in general and in
   terms of household waste in particular from the period 2008 to 2011. In 2011, 203
   managers from 131 municipalities and 36 provinces/prefectures have received
   training on integrated waste management plans and SWM. The total number of
   trainings dispensed to LGs reached 333.

37. Regarding the third axis of the support program for the waste sector social and
environmental considerations the indicators are:

  The number of environmental impact studies for SWM-related investments
   evaluated by the National or Regional EIA Committees will reach 25 by 2012.
   Currently 25 sector-related EIAs have been examined by the National and Regional
   Committees.
  30 percent of collected waste was to be deposited in controlled landfills by 2012; this
   rate is already achieved in 2011 and should reach 64 percent with the completion of
   landfills under construction.
  12 open dumpsites should be closed or rehabilitated by 2012. 21 spontaneous dumps
   have already been rehabilitated in 2011.
  100-150 waste collectors should enjoy social inclusion initiatives. 154 people on the
   Akreuch landfill which is being rehabilitated (Oum Azza, Rabat) have benefited
   from social inclusion. 250 collectors operate in the landfill of Casablanca (a sorting
   platform was constructed for them), 20 waste pickers operate at the Guelmim landfill,
   and 132 waste pickers operate in the discharge of Agadir (a sorting center is being
   developed).

38. Verification of indicators was by the CN-PNDM was based on review and validation
of relevant documents. In terms of physical projects (landfill construction, rehabilitation
and closing of dumps), monitoring was conducted through ministry field supervision. The
monitoring results are limited and it is recommended to set up a reporting system to
assure permanent feedback from the local level to the PMU. Such a reporting system has
now been introduced and data sheets will now be filled out on quarterly basis by the
concerned municipalities to inform on the progress of projects. The first data sheets
reached the PMU in March 2012. An Excel database was established by the consultants
recruited to the PMU. This reporting system will be strengthened, if necessary, and
complemented by field visits.

Next phase

39. The importance of reforming the SWM sector and the progress made to date has been
well appreciated by the Moroccan authorities. Thus, the government requested the
continued support of the World Bank to the PNDM for a second phase (2012-2016). This
third operation is under preparation. The areas covered by this operation include sector

                                           -39-
governance, the long-term sustainability of the sector, control and environmental
supervision and development of recycling processes.

   III.    Evaluation of project results

Relevance of objectives, design and implementation

40. The objectives and concept of the household waste sector support program are
considered highly relevant to the overall program and the current context in which
sustainable development is confirmed as a priority in the new government‟s program.
The high overall relevance of the objectives confirms that the design of the program
reflected a correct diagnosis of a development priority which is still relevant.

Rationale for rating overall result
41. Given the objectives and results achieved during the first phase of the household
waste sector support program, the project can be noted satisfactory despite some
shortcomings related to delays in the completion of SWM master plans, and the question
of institutional and financial sustainability of the sector.

   IV.     Critical analysis of the performance of the Bank and Borrower

42. The launch of the preparation of the household waste sector support program with the
World Bank was based on several consultations and a fruitful dialogue between the
departments involved and the Bank. Thus the objectives and program thrusts were
already determined at the launch of the program, which facilitated the preparation and
execution of the project. Implementation was marked by regular follow-up by the Bank
through monitoring and supervision missions, which helped to overcome the constraints
in achieving certain activities of the World Bank supported program.

43. As for the Moroccan authorities, the project was well implemented as testified by
satisfactory achievements and through regular monitoring by CN-PNDM and the PMU,
and especially the coordination of the program with line departments (MoI and MoE).

   V.      Key lessons learned from the design and implementation of the support
           project

44. The experience of the household waste sector DPL has been very positive. The
success factors include improved sector governance and the creation of synergy between
the various stakeholders, the fruitful dialogue between the Bank and the Moroccan
authorities, the articulation of the main pillars of the reform (institutional and financial
framework), support for local authorities in terms of finances and capacity building, and
advocacy/communication around the program.

45. Despite the results achieved during the PNDM Phase I, achievements were not
produced at the rate required to fully meet objectives. Minor deficiencies were recorded
in the implementation of the program, its objectives, or its relevance:

                                           -40-
  Significant delays are accumulated mainly in the implementation of SWM master
   plans.
  The delay in the study of financial sustainability of solid waste services is also noted.
   The choice of modality and province for a pilot initiative to test the results of this
   phase is not yet determined.
  Public access to information on SWM and poor communication on the quality and
   content of the service have contributed to the limited transparency in sector and
   service management. This could limit awareness of the program reform efforts.
  The construction of new landfills could potentially cause adverse effects on the
   environment, making imperative the establishment of a mechanism for
   environmental control to ensure compliance with norms and standards for
   environmental protection.
  The target for the rate of recycling and recovery by the PNDM is to reach 20 percent
   by 2016 with piloting of separation at source. However, the framework to achieve
   this purpose has not yet been established.
  The assessments carried out highlight three main problems affecting the institutional
   sustainability of the sector: the project management capacity, the deficiencies in the
   public-private partnership, and lack of institutional framework for the full SWM
   chain.

46. These actions will continue through the third operation with a clearer focus on social
aspects as part of a pillar focusing on the development of recycling and the
professionalization of SWM in line with the advancing regionalization. Also, the actions
that have experienced difficulties or delays in their implementation will be taken into
account. The new sector reform DPL will also draw lessons regarding the actions related
to communication and information about the program, the implementation of the study on
financial sustainability of waste services that will be retained, and the issue of
environmental control.

47. Moreover, the implementation of new institutional forms are needed to
professionalize the management of the sector in line with the new territorial organization
and advanced regionalization embodied in the constitutional reform, which could also
influence the planning and implementation of the PNDM.

       Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

1. The GIZ received the ICR for comments. The email received in return confirmed the
continuation of GIZ contributions to the SWM sector until at least 2015, and hence a
continued strong cooperation. The response confirmed that the GIZ has no problems with
the ICR, but simply wished to thank the Bank for the mention of the work of GIZ in the
SWM sector in Morocco.
