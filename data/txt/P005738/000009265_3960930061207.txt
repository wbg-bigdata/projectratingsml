MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPNENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A HOSPITAL RESTRUCTURING SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Tunisia for US$30.0 million equivalent is eubmitted for approval.
The proposed loan would help finance a Hospital Restructuring Support Project
which aims at improving the efficiency and sustainability of Tunisian public
hospitals.  The loan would have a term of seventeen years, including a five-
year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    Background.  In the last three decades, health conditions in Tunisia have
been transformed. Life expectancy increased from 41 to 67, infant mortality fell
from 175 to belo.v  O per thousand, and the total fertility rate declined from
7 to 3.5, the lowest in the Arab world and comparing favorably with other middle-
income countries. This progrese was made possible by improved living standards,
especially adequate food and safe water, by free universal primary education,
and by heavy i.ivestment in both preventive and curative health services. These
are now within one hour's walking distance of 90% of the population.
3.    overall spendinc  -n health, at 4.5% of GDP or $62 per person, is still
modest by middle-income country standards. It can be expected to rise sharply
in the next few years, driven by the costlier treatment associated with a higher
incidence of chronic and degenerative diseases linked to aging and urbanization.
This expenditure is still mainly shouldered by the State, which bears roughly
half of all health costs, as against one-third paid directly by households and
the remaining one-sixth met through insurance premia borne by employers and
employees. This resource share understates the importance of the public health
system, which provides 90% of hospital services and over half of all outpatient
care.   The strain of trying to consolidate past achievements and meet this
burgeoning demand in an environment of fiscal austerity (health allocations
account for 6.2% of the Government budget, down from 7.9% six years ago) shows
up in a familiar spiral of declining service quality, inadequate facility
maintenance and low staff morale.
4.    At the root of the public hospital system's growing problems lie both
mismanagement and unfair burden-sharing arrangements. Internal efficiency is
low because: budgets are allocated centrally without regard to past performance
or future needs; managers are not accountable; cost information is scarce and
nowhere related to services provided; standards and inventory are not monitored;
and staff training is deficient. At the same time, existing fee schedules are
allowed to erode with inflation, there are few incentives for fee collection,
programs designed to allow free or subsidized access to the poor are mistargeted
and co-payments are too low. The most glaring inequity lies with the health
insurance funds, which reimburse only 10% of the public hospital system's costs
while their members account for 40% of its activities. And yet, falling quality
of service and lack of evidence on coste and cost control provide ready
justification for insurers' reluctance to raise their contribution.



5.    Government Stratecv.  In the laet two years, the Minister of Health has
already done much to break out of this longstanding vicious cycle and has
formulated and implemented sweeping reforme, which the Bank endorses.   Fee
schedules and co-payments have been set to increase by more than 50% in 1991,
and staff and equipment have been transferred systematically to the more coet-
effective primary and secondary care levels. The centerpiece of the upcoming
reform is the restructuring of the 22 largest hospital facilities which account
for 60% of all hospital usage and absorb 50% of the entire public health sector
resources.   This starts with an overhaul of their governance and budgetary
procedures, and proceeds with the appointment of a new cadre of professional
managers, the introduction of new accounting and control systeme, urgent repairs
and improvements linked to patient service and fee collection, and a
comprehensive program designed to generate cost data for future negotiations with
insurance carriers and local communities.
6.    Rationale  for Bank involvement.   Comprehensive restructuring of the
tertiary hospital sub-sector is the only means to contain public expenditure on
higher-level curative services and begin to release resources for primary health
care: social pressure will otherwise overwhelm good intentions aimed at
"painless" internal reallocation. This lesson emerges from two Bank-supported
health operations in the 70s and 80s which were succeseful in creating basic
infrastructure but whose benefits were curtailed by insufficient operating funds.
The Bank's experience with public enterprise restructuring in most sectors of
the Tunisian economy, and its sustained advisory role on the design of health
finance reforme in particular, puts it in a privileged position to assist the
Ministry of Health during this critical phase.
7.    The project therefore builds on the overall framework of public finance
discipline and enterprise reform pursued in the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL,
Ln. 2962-TUN) and the Public Enterprises Rationalization loan (PERL, Ln. 3109-
TUN).   Analogous  efforts are being undertaken  in the education  sectors
(especially, forthcoming Higher Education Reform Loan). The project is closely
linked to the Population and Pamily Health Project presented in parallel with
these project, whose main thrust is to restore credibility to primary and first-
level referral services, thereby alleviating pressure on the hospital system.
8.    Proiect obiectives.  The proposed project will support the implementation
of the Government's reforme to address major efficiency and service-quality
issues in a large part of the public health care network and provide the cost
information needed to help alleviate the heavy burden imposed on Government
resources by the largeet public hospitals. The project will cover the 22 largest
hospital facilities proposed for restructuring in the initial phase of the
Government's hospital reform.
9.    Proiect Descrintion.  Succeseful restructuring is contingent upon changes
in the institutional framework within which hospitals operate. Specifically,
a new legal statue is being adopted to transform hospitals into Public Health
Establishments (EPS) with administrative and financial autonomy. Within this
framework, which will permit effective decentralization in decision-making and
responsibilities, the project will support the following:



(a)   Develonment of Management Capabilities and Institutional Adiustment
through: (i) the recruitment and in-service training of high- and
mid-level hospital managers and the introduction of financial
management and performance evaluation procedures; (ii) the
development and implementationof computerizedmanagement information
systems (MIS), including the provision of computer hardware and
software, training and technical assistance; (iii> the reorganization
of administrative and patient registration sections, including civil
works to adapt facilities to their new functions; and, (iv> the
carrying out of three studies aiming at improving th,. financial
burden-sharing arrangements, a medium-term strategic hospital
development plan, and hospital architectural masterplans.
(b)   Improvement in Oualitv of Service through: (i> the replacement of
priority medical equipment to improve treatment effectiveness and
efficiency; (ii) the strengthening of hospital maintenance units,
including the provision of training and basic equipment; <iii) the
improvement of patient accommodations, including priority renovation
and provision of furniture and equipment; and (iv> the improvement
of  hospital  hygiene  and  handling  of  medical  wastes  and
environmentally hazardous materials.
10.   Implementation and Management.   The project will be implemented on a
decentralized basis in each hospital, by the hospital General Manager (a new
position created as part of the reform) and his staff.   The overall reform
program will be coordinated and supervised by a Hospital Restructuring Management
Board (CGRH) composed of the Minister of Public Health, the General Managers of
the hospitals concerned, the MOH Directors involved in the reform, and of the
Head of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU, headed by a full time
coordinator and composed of a amall team of technicians, will report to the
Minister of Health.  The PCU will act as a secretariat for the CGRH, enaure
procurement, keep accounts and serve ae a liaison with the Bank.
11.   Cost and Financina.  The total project cost of US$49.5 million equivalent
including duties and taxes would be financed as follows: (a) a proposed IBRD loan
of US$30 million equivalent would finance the foreign exchange component of the
project or 61% of total project cost; (b) the Government would finance all local
costs estimated at US$19.5 million equivalent (including US$9.7 million in
taxes), or 39% of total project cost.  A breakdown of project coste and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methode of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the statue of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules
C and D respectively. The staff appraisal report No. 9157-TUN, dated February
26, 1991, is being distributed separately.
12.   Principal Actions Aareed Upon. The Government has approved the draft laws
transforming the hospitals into EPS and creating the Center for Health
Information (CIS) in charge of developing management information systeme. At
negotiations,  the  following  conditions  of  effectiveneas  were  agreed:
(a> enactment by Parliament of the law creating the EPS; (b) establishment of



the CGRH and PCU for the duration of the project with organization, staffing and
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; and (c) promulgation of EPS statutes
for four project hc,pLtals and appointment of their General Managers.   The
Government also provided assurances that the remaining 18 hospitals would be
transformed into EPS according to the agreed echedule (eight hospitals by
December 31, 1992, five hospitals by December 31, 1993, and the remaining five
hospitals by December 31, 1994). Prior transformation of the hospitals according
to the above phasing will be a condition of disbursoment of loan proceeds for
equipment and civil works. In addition, it was agreed that: (a) the studies on
financial burden-sharing referred to in paragraph 9 (a) will be carried out and
their recommandations presented to the Government by December 31, 1994; (b) CIS
shall have been established and its director appointed by September 30, 1991;
(c) a medium-term plan for hospital network development will be prepared and
reviewed with the Bank by September 30, 1992; (d) a hospital financial management
manual will be submitted to the Bank for review by September 1991; and
(e) architectural masterplans for 9 pre-selected hospitals will be formulated
and reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1992.
13.   Benefits.   The proposed project would address several critical issues
confronting the Tunisian health sector. Major progress is expected in hospital
cost containment through enhanced internal efficiency, and equity in the
financing of health care services through the definition and implementation of
methods to link utilization of services with burden-sharing responsibilities.
While remaining roughly stable in absolute terme, Government's share of public
health expenditures could drop significantly (from above 80% to below 60%) by
the end of the project, the social insurance programs share could grow from below
10% to over 30%, and patients direct contributions would remain roughly constant,
while better linked to ability to pay. This would permit sustained improvements
in the quality of services of the entire public health sector, including the
largest maternities, which would benefit directly the vast majority of the
population needing hospital and out-patient care.
14.   Risks.  One risk of the project relates to the ability of new managers to
introduce and implement successfully the hospital reforms and overcome the
system's rigidities and natural resistance to change. To compensate for the
limited experience and ekills of local managers,   training and technical
assistance are included in the project and the restructuring program has been
phased to allow evaluation and adjustment based on experience with the first
few institutions. Another possible risk is the lack of incentives among civil
servants to be cost-conscious in utilizing resources. This risk, however, will
be mitigated by the introduction of new budgeting procedures that would allow
hospital departments to retain most of the savinge generated through their
efforts, and the development of financial management standards that would allow
senior hospital managers to monitor performance. Finally, sustained benefits
in terms of a permanently reduced burden on Government resources ultimately
depend on the outcome of negotiations with its social partners (the medical
profession, unions and employers for health insurance, local communities for
indigent coverage), that will be contingent upon broader economtic developments.
The project aime at reestablishing the image of public hospitals as quality care
providers and supplying the Government with evidence on true health sector coet
and utilization patterns that would underpin these negotiations.

15.   Environmental impact.  The proposed project was reviewed under the Bank
Environmental Assesament procedures and determined to be in screening Category
C which includes projects which are not expected to result in significant
negative environtental impact. Moreover, the project will support activitire
to improve hospital hygiene and maintenance, and finance training fellowahips
for managerial staff in charge of environmental hazards in hospitals, and
incinerators to be procured upon completion of a study to assess the hospitals'
specific needs. This will allow for better handling of medical wastes and would
thereby improve the environment.
16.   Recommendation:   I am satisfied that the proposed project would comply
with the articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
