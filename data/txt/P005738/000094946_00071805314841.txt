3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The stated objectives of this project were to support the Government's efforts to: (i) address major hospital
internal efficiencies by containing costs while improving quality of services; and (ii) provide the necessary
information that would permit adjustments in the cost-sharing schemes by linking actual utilization of



hospital services to financial contributions made by the different organizations.
These objectives were very relevant at the time of project design and responded to two key issues identified
by the Government and the Bank: (i) inadequate financing mechanisms for the health system; and (ii) low
internal efficiency of the public health system, in particular, of its main tertiary and large hospitals which
absorbed half of the recurrent budget of all health facilities. There was, and still is, strong commitment
from the Government to address these issues. Support to the reform remained strong both during
preparation and implementation. This project was part of an overall Government strategy including in
particular the development of a reform of the health insurance and the strengthening of preventive and
primary health care services in underserved areas, which the Bank supported through sector work and a
parallel project.
The government adopted an incremental approach to implement hospital reform to ensure greater
collaboration and commitment from all stakeholders, which significantly contributed to its success.
However, this cautious approach somewhat limited, or at least slowed down, its potential impact. In
particular, (i) the autonomy of hospitals was hampered by the fact that human resources management was
controlled by the central MOH; (ii) the concentration of the project on strengthening the facilities without a
parallel effort to strengthen MOH capacity for monitoring and regulation created a disconnect which was
addressed but need to be further pursued to institutionalize the reform; and (iii) improvements in quality of
services were expected through rehabilitation of facilities and provision of equipment, and no measures
were taken to strengthen the capacity of staff, particularly the para-medical staff and no monitoring
indicators of quality were established during implementation.

Components and activities responded adequately to the project objectives. In particular, the conditions of
effectiveness requiring that the legal framework for the hospital reform be in place before the project helped
give it a momentum and the needed visibility.
3.4 Revised Components:
Though there was no revision in components, some minor adjustments were made during the project. In
particular, the number of facilities which benefited from priority renovations was greater than initially
anticipated, as a result of the favorable exchange rate which increased the financial envelope available.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
No formal review was done. The assessment of the authors is as follows:
- 2 -



Proiect Concept, Objectives and Approach: As described above, the project was designed in response to
the priority issues shared by both the Bank and the Govemment at the time of preparation. This project
was one of the first Bank-financed project to tackle the hospital sector. The potential risk that this
approach presented were minimized by the parallel implementation of a project supporting family planning
and basic health services. One of the weaknesses of the project was the lack of development of specific
monitoring and outcome indicators at inception. This weakness, however, was partially rectified during
implementation.
Technical, economic and financial analvsis: A sound analysis was carried out and the scenario developed
was realistic.
Environmental Analysis: Since there was no new construction planned under the project, environmental
concerns were incorporated in the development of the hospitals masterplans and in the elaboration of a
strategy for medical waste management. This approach is deemed appropriate.
Social and Stakeholders Analysis: Although there was no formal assessment carried out, great attention
was given by the Minister of Health and key MOH staff to ensure the involvement of key stakeholders in
the reform during project preparation. Also, the MOH adopted an incremental approach to sensitize the
public to the reform process and mitigate possible negative effects.
Institutional Capacity Analvsis: Great attention was given to assess and strengthen the institutional
capacity of hospitals to gain greater autonomy. However, the need to strengthen both central and regional
administrative levels was not considered at the time, and turned to be a blocking factor. Its impact on
project implementation, however, was minimal as the Government identified the issue early on and
strengthened the Project Coordination unit. This situation is now becoming a blocking factor for the reform
as hospitals are ready for increased autonomy and the MOH is somewhat reluctant to provide it because it
does not yet have adequate capacity to monitor performance. Contractual arrangements between MOH and
hospitals remain very soft.
Readiness for implementation: The project was well prepared, with the possible exception of (i) the
hospital masterplanning exercise which was poorly understood; and (ii) the lack of attention given to
identify monitoring indicators.
Risk and sustainabilit. A thorough analysis of the fimancial risks and impact of the project was made and
the scenario developed to justify Bank involvement was realistic. The risk of resistance to the reform by the
medical community was underestimated, and no remedial measures were planned. However, the
Government realized early on in implementation that this was a critical element, and an information
campaign as well as study tours were organized to expose doctors to learning from hospital reforms in
other countries.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Efficiency:
The efficiency in utilizing hospital resources had improved as demonstrated by the following:
-3 -



a) Ambulatory services had increased by an average of 3.1% from 1992 to 1997, however, admissions
generated from the ambulatory services had decreased as reflected by the consultation/admission ratio
which increased from 8 to 9 consultations per admission between 1991 and 1998.
b) The increase in the hospitalization activities had increased by an average of 3% from 1991 to 1997
coupled with a reduction in the average length of stay (ALOS) by one day which made available an
additional 900 beds approximately.
c) The bed turn-over rate had increased from 34 to 36 patients per bed from 1992 to 1998 while the
occupancy rate has been maintained around 76%.
d) There was an increase in recovering the costs of services. The revenues collected by the hospitals in
1998 had increased by 26.9% since 1992, with an average annual increase of 24.3%. This increase
was attributed to the improvement in the hospital management and information systems that enabled
the active collection of revenues, as well as, the increase in the fee schedule and hospital activities.
Productintv:
The productivity of staff has increased as demonstrated by the following:
a) the average annual increase in the financial resources, in constant dinar, which had been 5% from 1992
to 1998. This is a lower rate than the increase in the annual growth of hospital services, which have
been providing more expensive health interventions due to the increase in the rate of complex diseases.
This suggests that the hospitals were able to cope with the situation by reducing their operating
expenses, for example, by 27% in 1998.
b) the human resources (number of staff) had only increased by 2.3% annually from 1992 to 1998. If the
administrative category is excluded, this increase would be only 1.9%, far below the rate of increase of
the case load and services.
Financine:
The reforms of the financial systems envisaged by the project, including reducing the burden of the
government and increasing other revenue sources, had been achieved as demonstrated by:
a) The change in the regulations that resulted in revising the free provision of service and the reduced fee
schedule
b) The progressive introduction of the "billing system" of ambulatory and hospital services provided to
social insurance beneficiaries, which was introduced based on a unit cost analysis study of the hospital
services and following the installation of hospital information systems. This process has resulted in
generating additional financial resources to the hospitals estimated at TD 10 million in 1996, TD 20
million in 1997, TD 30 million in 1998, and TD 38 million in 1999.
c) The operating expenses of the hospitals (excluding salaries) had been marked by a progressive increase
in the share of the social insurance funds and the fee-for-service charges and a reduction in the
government's share. Between 1991 and 1998, the government's share has decreased from 69 to 35%,
the social insurance funds share increased from 12 to 35%, and the fee-for-service charges increased
from 19 to 30%.
-4 -



d) The expenditures on salaries of the hospitals, financed totally by the government, had increased by an
average of 4.3% annually from 1992 to 1998. However, the share of the salaries as a total of the
budget had decreased from 60.8% in 1992 to 53.4% in 1998.
e) With regard to the investment budget, it is worthwhile mentioning that the social insurance funds had
contributed significantly to assist the hospitals to acquire new medical equipment with the goal of
reducing the treatment abroad. In 1991, the funds financed an investment program of TD 54 million,
then a second program in 1997 for TD 50 million.
Ouality:
While there were some indicators identified at the beginning of the project to monitor the "quality of
services", they were not incorporated in the management system, which does not permit an evaluation of
this component. However, it can be noted that there was an improvement in the hospital auxiliary services
such as the reception, lodging, laundry, catering, and hospital waste disposal which are attributed to the
capital investments made in upgrading these services.
4.2 Outputs by components:
All activities of the project were implemented as anticipated, with minor modifications as described below:
A. Management Capacity and Policy Adjustments:
- The legal framework and organization of tertiary hospitals was adjusted to promote a greater management
autonomy, and the 23 largest hospitals were converted into this new statute of "Public Health
Establishment".
- Boards were created to oversee each establishment, hospital organizational charts were revised, new
modem management processes were introduced, and relevant staff were recruited.
- The Agency of information systems management (CIMSP) was created to develop and introduce the
information systems in all hospitals under the project, and to train the appropriate hospital staff on
information systems according to a plan.
- Studies aimed at developing options for improved financial burden-sharing arrangements were carried out
and contributed to the revision of the free and subsidized care policy (AMG) and to the development of the
health insurance reform by providing the needed unit costs by major diagnostics.
B. Improvement of quality of services:
All planned rehabilitations were achieved and replacement medical and auxiliary equipment procured.
However, implementation of these components fell somewhat short of expectations in the following areas:
- Insufficient autonomy for hospitals to manage their Human Resources;
- 5 -



-Lack of clear understanding on potential use of hospital masterplans as a tool for defning the hospital
strategy and negotiating programs with MOH.
- The contribution of the financing studies to the health insurance reform is difficult to assess as the latter
has not yet been implemented.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
NA
4.4 Financial rate of return.
NA
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Impact is significant for hospitals which had a weak management structure at project inception.  A
contractual relationship (contracts-programns) is being extended between MOH and facilities. However, the
role and mandates of MOH and regional offices as well as their capacity to monitor performance and
allocate resources in a transparent and equitable manner needs to be strengthened further.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
No major factors affected the project implementation with the exception of a favorable exchange rate,
which enabled some savings and therefore financing of additional priority rehabilitation and medical
equipment. Also, there was some resistance from the medical community to the reform, which was
addressed during implementation.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control.
Some of the factors which contributed to the project success are:
- the strong political support and sustained involvement of the Government in monitoring implementation of
the hospital reform and tackling issues in a proactive manner.
- the stability of the Government and of the project team
- the general economic environment and evolution towards liberalization
- the parallel development of the health insurance reform.
Some of the factors that limited the impact of the project and will need to be addressed if the reform is to be
furither expanded:
- the decision made not to transfer human resources management to hospitals therefore limited the potential
for real efficiency gain and for management by performance.
-6 -



- both the lack of a comprehensive human resources allocation strategy and budgetary constraints made it
difficult to recruit the required management and administrative staff for hospitals in a timely manner.
- the legislation concerning continuing training (payments of expenses and per-diem) limited the ability of
civil servants to engage in training programs to upgrade their skills.
- the constraining procurement legislation lengthened the process.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Factors which benefited the project are:
- a clear definition of the responsibility matrix of all project activities
- a very proactive PCU
Limiting factors were as follows:
- insufficient resources allocated to the project unit during its initial phase
- the lack of common understanding of the objective and contents of the hospital led to delays in
implementation of civil works.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The project unit monitored project costs very closely and ensured efficient cost control measures. This
situation, combined with favorable exchange rates, enabled to achieve all project activities in a satisfactory
manner, albeit with some delay, as described in annex.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationalefor sustainability rating:
Financial sustainability: As described above, one of the stated objectives of the project was to improve
the financial burden-sharing arrangements of EPS. This objective was fully achieved. The social security
funds now contribute to a larger share of expenditures. Moreover, the system is dominated by strong cost
control measures on the budgets, investments, salary mass, tariffs, and payment mechanisms which prevent
an undue growth of the hospital sector expenditures. Finally, the new management procedures introduced
in hospitals have increased their internal efficiency.
The hospital reform has received strong and sustained political support. It is now being extended to
lower-level regional hospitals, illustrating the broad agreement of all stakeholders on the need to adopt its
approach.
The institutional sustainability of the reform will require further efforts in developing a more contractual
relationship between hospitals and the MOH. While contrats-programmes are now being introduced,
based on performance targets, the MOH remains very involved in the daily management of the facilities. In
particular human resources management has not yet been transferred to hospitals. Finally, the MOH will
need to evolve and strengthen its capacity for monitoring and control and progressively relinquish its
"implementing" role to the regions and facilities.
- 7 -



With regards to the perception of the population, including health professionals, the reform is
acknowledged as a necessary first step, but still falls short of expectations with regards to quality and costs
of services.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Incremental recurrent expenditures have been minimal and absorbed by the increase in revenues.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The partnership developed between MOH and the Bank team during project preparation was very
constructive. The readiness of the Bank to prepare two operations in parallel (the second one tackling basic
health services and family planning) provided both the opportunity to address major issues in the sector and
the implementation flexibility of operations with a relatively simple design.
7.2 Supervision:
Bank intervention during supervision was characterized by (i) close monitoring illustrated by frequent
missions and contacts; (ii) regular consultations with the PCU; and (iii) continuity in staffing of Bank team.
The Borrower expressed its wish that (i) more supervision missions be carried out at the beginning of the
projects, and that their duration be longer to enable in-depth discussion and analysis of issues; (ii) Bank
consultants be recruited for longer periods to enable them  to become familiar with the country
characteristics.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The Borrower defines Bank performance as very adequate with regards to technical expertise, transfer of
know-how and emphasis on partnership building.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Intensive work was carried out during project preparation under the close monitoring of the Minister.
Close involvement of all concerned ministries (MOH, Finance, Plan/International Cooperation) in the
project design was also very beneficial. The Borrower's commitment to the project was illustrated by the
timely fulfillment of all effectiveness conditions (law on hospitals statutes) and legal covenants.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The sustained Government interest and involvement in the hospital reform was very beneficial to the
project. However, the issue of efficient allocation of human resources, and transfer of responsibility for
personnel management to hospitals, remains to be tackled.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The choice of implementation structure (i.e. a full-time project coordinator supporting implementation of
activities as carried out by the MOH departments) increased consensus around the project but somewhat
- 8 -



slowed down some activities because implementing departments sometimes had conflicting agendas, as
their mandate is larger than the project. The project coordination unit was highly committed and very
proactive. It somewhat lacked the needed human resources at the beginning of the project, in particular to
accompany the introduction of the new management procedures in the hospitals and provide them with the
required technical assistance.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Borrowees performance was dominated by a strong political commitment to the health reform and
therefore to the project. This resulted in a constant monitoring and evaluation of the project during its
implementation and in a proactive attitude to resolve the issues that arose.
8. Lessons Learned
There are several lessons learned as a result of this project that are relevant for both the World Bank and
the Borrower. The major lessons learned for the World Bank are to:
1. Ensure consistency between the Government goals/objectives and the project objectives. The project
objectives were very relevant to the government strategy and the project was addressing key concerns,
and therefore received high political commitment and support.
2. Ensure the consistencv between the project objectives and the project components and actions. This
consistency existed in most of the components. However, the objective of "improving quality of
services" was planned to be addressed primarily through focusing on the "hardware" aspects, e.g.,
physical infrastructure upgrading and provision of equipment, and little focus was given to the
software" aspects such as improved management of care or client satisfaction.
3. Ensure the development and adoption of specific project monitoring indicators and obtain consensus on
them by the stakeholders. In this case, some indicators were developed at the design stage and some at
the implementation stage. Also, the outcome indicators particularly for efficiency and quality were not
specific. Most importantly, there was no baseline for the indicators and some of them were not
incorporated in the management system to be monitored.
4. Analyze the legal and regulatory environment as well as the institutional capacitv related to the reform
to identify the necessary changes required to avoid any such obstacles that may impede the achievement
of the reform objectives. In this case, more emphasis should have been put on the legal and regulatory
aspects related to civil service and human resources, as well as on the institutional capacity at the
central and regional administration.
5. Identify and resolve the key and critical prerequisites of reform during negotiation stage. An excellent
approach was to require that the legal framework for hospital autonomy be issued as a condition for the
project effectiveness to ensure political commitment. However, the framework was accepted without
ensuring that the full decentralization of human resources management to the hospitals was included
which turned to be problematic.
6. Ensure that supervision visits are frequent and that there is continuity in the choice of consultants.
On the other hand, the major lessons learned for the Borrower are to:
-9-



1. Involve all the pertinent stakeholders from all levels in the conceptualization phase of any reform
project to ensure ownership and to facilitate its implementation, which was the approach adopted by
the MOH.
2. Design a "communication strategy" for any reform project aiming at inducing systemic changes. The
strategy should clearly articulate the reform objectives, policies, and strategies, and its implications on
"the people" and "the systems". It should also be formulated in a language targeted to different
audience groups such as the public, the medical profession, and policy makers.
3. Devise, in advance, alternative scenarios for implementing the reform to enable its adaptability to any
changes in the political, economic, or social enviromnent.
4. Ensure that any institutional reform of public health service delivery at the operational (hospital) level
should also include and affect organizational change at the central MOH level. More attention should
be devoted to redefining the changing role of the central MOH vis-a-vis the hospitals.
5. Ensure the appropriate selection of personnel to manage the project who can provide leadership and
strategic and technical guidance to the multidisciplinary teams that will execute the different project
components. Also, provide an environment that would enable the stability of the project management
team.
6. Develop a "comprehensive" training program for all levels involved in the implementation. Hospital
directors to manage hospital resources effectively, service providers to improve quality and be cost
conscious, and local and central managers to develop their monitoring and evaluation skills.
7. Develop proper intemal communication channels and feedback, in the context of the hospital sector
reform, between the hospitals, local authorities, and central MOH to resolve any management problem
and facilitate implementation.
8. Emphasize continually that the ultimate goal of any reform is eventually improving the health status of
the population through efficiently providing affordable and equitable health services to avoid diverting
the attention to the intermediate project objectives.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
This ICR is a summary of a longer report prepared in French, jointly by the MOH and the Bank. Since
MOH is a co-author, there was no formal comments transmitted.
(b) Cofinanciers:
N/A
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
The report was widely distributed for comments to all ministries, hospital boards and management.
Comments received were added in the project's files and evolved mainly around the following measures:
-10-



- the lack of consultation/information of medical and para-medical staff during reform development;
- the insufficient autonomy provided to hospitals;
- the need for a strengthened hospital management structure;
- greater attention to be given to staff continuing training;
- the development of quality assurance indicators.
