MEKORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE
IfTERNATIO1{AL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$1.4 million equivalent and development credit of SDR 1.1 (US$1.4 million
equivalent) to St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would 'e repayable over 17 years, including
five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturity.
The proposed loan and credit would help finance an agricultural
rehabilitation and diversification project.
2.       Background.  The agricultural sector of SVG accounts for about 202
of GDP and 702 of exports, and employs about 302 of the labor force. There
are about 10,000 farmers, including those who practice garden-type
agriculture. Food imports account for 252 of total imports. Unemployment
affects about 25-35Z of the labor force.
3.       The agricultural activities of the island have been developed
under a colonial estate system where the main crops were sugar, cotton,
arrowroot and bananas for export; only bananas remain as a major export.
The estates have since gone out of production and have been purchased by
the Government. They are now largely cultivated by squatters around the
estates, who are growing bananas and root crops. Root crops are the main
domestic staples, and are emerging as a major export and source of foreign
exchange. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Agriculture (MTIA) is the
key Government agency in charge of the sector. There are also banana and
cocoa producer associations and private marketing agencies which play
important roles in the sector's development. Agricultural credit is
provided by commercial banks and the state-owned Development Corporation
(DEVCO).
4.       The scope for further agricultural development of SVG lies in
improved utilization and management of the limited land resources, and in
modifiying the cropping pattern in favor of crops which offer the best
returns. About 90Z of the cultivable land of 24,000 acres is already in
use. The key constraints to achieving the agricultural potential are
insecurity of land tenure; poor access to farmland; weak institutional
support; and the generally high cost of production compared with competing
exporting countries.
5.       SVG has an open agricultural economy.  The Government policy is to
rely on the private sector to take the lead role in the sector's
development, and is supportive of private sector initiatives. Therefore,
the cornerstone of its development strategy is to divest public land to



- 2 -
smalllaolder farmers under a phased-program of divestiture supported by
improvement of roads and technical assistance. This strategy is reflected
in a Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP), in which the bulk of public
inv.stment in the sector is related to land divestiture; the Bank has
endorsed the PSIP. The first phase of the land settlement program,
involving the divestiture of a large Government estate known as Orange
Hill, has already started, and is being financed by the Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB), the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), the European Economic Community (EEC) and the Organization of
American States (OAS).
6.       Rationale for Be.nk/IDA Involvement.  The Bank's o.erall country
assistance strategy for SVG is to strengthen the country's creditworthiness
by financing specific investment projects which contribute to improved
productivity and exports, while minimizing the need for recourse to public
sector resources. The proposed project, which would promote the efficient
production of exportable agricultural commodities by private smallholder
growers, is consistent with this strategy. The blend IDA credit and Bank
loan to SVG is proposed pursuant to the December 1985 Board decision on
terms of lending to small island economies graduating from IDA, but which
could only be considered creditworthy for a limited amount of Bank lending.
In the context of the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic
Development, the Bank Group helped the Government with an agricultural
sector analysis and reached agreement with the Government on an appropriate
three-year Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). The proposed project
forms the centerpiece of the PSIP. At a Consultative Group meeting chaired
by the Bank on December 9, 1987, the PSIP was presented to the donor
community for financing. The Bank's expression of interest in the proposed
project helped mobilize support for the balance of the PSIP with the result
that the total financing needs were met subject to satisfactory conclusion
of bilateral discussions. For the future, the Bank strategy is to work
with CDB in developing a common agricultural sector strategy for the small
Cartbbean islands, as the basis for using that institution under an apex
arrangement to finance small projects similar to this one.
7.       Proiect Obiectives.  The key objectives of the project are to
promote growth and diversification of agricultural production and to
improve the income distribution of smallholder farmers through more
efficient use of the country's scarce land resources.
8.       Project Description.  The project would comprise a program of
divestiture of state-owned land to small-scale farmers (20X). along with a
program of farm access-road improvement (52Z), technical assistance and
training (28X). The divestiture would be the second and final phase of the
Government's program of divestiture of state land, and would cover seven
estates that have a total cultivable area of about 2,500 acres. Nearly
20 miles of existing farm access-roads would be improved, and 120 manmonths
of consultancy services provided for land use planning and surveying, and
supervision of the road rehabilitation program. External training would be
provided for six staff of MTIA, three in specialized crop production
related to the Government's agricultural diversification efforts, and three
in l.and use planning, surveying and administration. A small Project
Management Unit would be established within the Ministry of Finance and
Planning (MFP) to coordinate the activities of the implementing agencies
(MTIA for agricultural services and land survey, and the Ministry of



Communications and Works (MCW) for the road component). The role of the
Project Management Unit would cease once the land is fully divested, while
the line agencies would continue to provide supporting services. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$4 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$2.3 million (571). A breakdown of costs and the
financinb plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, together with the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in SVG are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is attached.  The Staff Appraisal Report, No. P-4881-STV dated
November 16. 1988, is also attached.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Borrower has designated a Director for the
Project Management Unit, with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank
Group. As conditions of effectiveness, the Borrower has agreed to:
(a) establish the Project Management Unit and its full staffing;
(b) establish a Land Settlement Committee, and appoint its members, to
ensure the *quitable and fair application of the criteria established for
the implementation of the land divestiture program; and (c) establish a
Project Account with an initial deposit of EC$200,000 to cover counterpart
expenditures. The Borrower also agreed, inter alia, that: (a) it would
employ consultants in land use planning and surveying by June 30, 1989;
(b) it would employ a consultant for supervising the road rehabilitation
program by June 30, 1990; (c) MTIA would assign at least eight agricultural
extension staff to service the needs of the smallholders under the project;
(d) MCW would provide road construction and maintenance services for the
development and maintenance of roads in the project area; (e) MTIA would be
responsible for demarcating plots, taking into consideration the
suitability of land for sustainable cultivation; (f) the Land Settlement
Committee would refine the criteria and procedures for the selection of
project beneficiaries, both in a manner satisfactory to the Bank Group, for
the implementation of the land divestiture program, by June 30, 1989; and
(g) MFP would set land rental rates for the small-scale farmer
beneficiaries, who would hold only some three to four acres, at levels
sufficient to recover at least 60X of the project's investment and
administrative expenses over 20 years. Such rental rates would be
established with the agreement of the Bank Group, and would be subject to
annual review thereafter in consultation with the Bank Group. Tenant-
farmers meeting the criteria provided in the lease agreement w*ould have the
option to purchase the land after ten years, based on the market value of
the land at that time, with rental payments being applied to the purchase
price.
10.      Proiect Benefits.  The quantifiable benefits would be increased
production of diverse agricultural products. The economic rate of return,
based on the quantifiable benefits, is estitated at 23Z, using the
projected price of bananas available to SVG under the Lome Agreement. At
world market prices for bananas, the rate of return would be 19Z. About
745 farmers would benefit, and their annual incomes at full development
would range from about US$3,100 to US$4,400 equivalent.
11.      Risks.  The main risk of the project is the extent to which the
country would be able to market the crops to be produced under the project.
This would depend on (a) whether or not the country would continue to
receive preferential treatment for the export of bananas to the UK and



- 4 -
(b) whether the country would be able to find new outlets or expand the
export of non-banana crops. SVG is a high cost producer of bananas, and
the liberalization of trade in the European Community after 1992 could make
it difficult for SVG producers to compete with other exporters. To help
improve the competitiveness of SVG, the project would reduce production
costs through yield increases. Secondly, the project would promote the
production of other specialized crops with small market niches in the US,
UK and Canada, where SVG has the opportunity of capturing a market share,
and where there is less likely to be stiff competition from the larger
agricultural exporting countries of Latin America. SVG, largely through
private sector initiatives, has already made considerable progress in
diversifying its agricultural exports from bananas (which were the dominant
export a few years ago) to root crops (which are now the major exports).
In addition, a program to support crop diversification has been launched by
the Governments of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), of
which SVG is a member, which would, inter alia, encourage the production of
non-traditional exports, seek and promote new export outlets, improve the
qual:.ty and value-added of the traditional exports, and promote joint
marketing. The Bank and CDB have been active in providing technical staff
support to this endeavor. Such efforts by the subregional Governments,
complemented by the already establishdd tradition of private
entrepreaeurship in export marketing, would minimize the project risk.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and IDA and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
