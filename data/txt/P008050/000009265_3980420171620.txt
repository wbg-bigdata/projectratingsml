FIRANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
Loan and Pworram Sumnarv
Borrower:            Republic of Perfi
Executing Aaencv:    Ministry of Economy and Finance
Amounts              US$400 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Loan Objectives:     The proposed loan would support Perd's medium-term
program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural
reforms, in particular reforms undertaken within the
financial sector.
Loan DescriDtion:    The loan recognizes the far-reaching program of reform of
the financial sector adopted by the goverrment and the
policy steps taken since mid-1990. It supports reforms
to be undertaken in 1992-93 in the areas of development
banking5 reduction of the role of the large public banks,
Banco de la Naci6n; privatization of commercial banks;
banking legislation, supervision and regulation; and
capital markets.
Benefits:            The reforms supported by the loan would lead to efficient
financial intermediation, thereby improving the
allocation of resources. Competition would be sharpened
by the removal of restrictions on credit pricing and
allocation, the withdrawal of the state as a provider of
financial services, and by the development of a rational
frameaork for prudential regulation. The development of
capital markets would be promoted. The reform program is
essential to the consolidation of the stabilization
effort and to achieving sustained growth.
Risks:               The risks to the macroeconomic program stem from
continuing fragility in public finances, especially in
public revenues, complications in the execution of
monetary policy presented by currency substitution, and,
in the transitional adjustment phase, high real interest
rates and an overvalued currency. Risks in policy
implementation may arise if the Congress elected upon the
adoption of a new constitution is fragmented or if the
policy actions taken by the present emergency government



- v -
are challenged on legal grounds. Risks specific to the
financial sector are posed by weak balance sheet
positions in banks, inadequate provisioning, and the weak
(though improving) standards of supervision. To address
these risks, the authorities are attampting to enhance
credibility in the policy stance through strict
maintenance of cash fiscal balance and stringent monetary
policies. Institutional capacities have been
strengthened to implement reforms. Legislation -- partly
in the form of decrees -- has been prepared to implement
the reform program. Banking supervision is being
strengthened, vigorous inspections of banks conducted,
and capital adequacy and credit concentration standards
are being raised.
Dilsbursement:       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches.  It is
envisaged that the first tranche (US$300 million) would
be released at end-December 1992 upon the clearance of
arrears to the Bank and the fulfillment of other
effectiveness conditions. The second tranche
(US$100 million) is expected to be released at end-1993.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIORAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED FINANCIAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation concerning a
proposed loan to the Republic of Perfi for the equivalent of US$400 million to
support the program of reform of the financial sector. The loan would be for
a period of 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
I. THE LOAN IN THE CONTEXT OF ARREARS CLEARANCE AND COUNTRY STRATEGY
2.          In May 1991, the Board adopted a new policy for countries in
protracted arrears demonstrating a record of cooperation with the Bank, which
involved the approval by the Board of loans in a period leading up to the
clearance of arrears but with disbursements taking place only upon the
elimination of arrears (Additional Sungort for Workout Programs in Countries
with Protracted Arrears, R91-70, April 11, 1991 and SecH91-509).  Countries
eliglble for assistance under this policy were required to: (i) adopt an
economic stabilization and adjustment program supported by the Fund and the
Bank; (ii) demonstrate a complete external financing package; and
(iii) maintain current debt service payments to the Bank.
3.          The Board approved the application of this policy to PerG in July
1991 (Per6s  The Bank's Approach to a Country with Protracted Arrears,
R91-171, July 12, 1991). With the adoption of this policy, the Bank
intensified its country assistance to PerO in the form of macroeconomic and
sector policy advice and technical support, which had earlier been initiated
with the change of governa.Ant in mid-1990. In September 1991, the Bank
participated actively in the formulation of an external financing plan for
1991-92 that required substantial contributions from bilateral donors.
Consistent with this policy, the Bank has been preparing a program of four
adjustment loans, of which two have already been presented to the Board. A
trade reform loan was approved by the Board in February 1992 and a structural
adjustment loan in March 1992, each of one tranche in the amount of
US$300 million. As the third in the series of adjustment loans to PerGi, it is
proposed that the Bank extend a loan in the amount of US$400 million in two
tranches in support of a program of financial sector reform. It is expected
that the loan will be signed, declared effective and the first tranche
(US$300 million) released at end-1992 upon the clearance of arrears, with the
second tranche (US$100 million) being released in the final quarter of 1993.
The final adjustment loan -- in support of privatization and private sector
development -- in the amount of US$260 million is under preparation, with
Board presentation being envisaged in the final quarter of 1992.
4.          The Bank has also been developing its country assistance strategy
for the period through FY95. During this period, the Bank expects to deepen
its support of the adjustment program through additional lending and economic



and sector work, and also expects to present investment loans now under
ptaparation. These loans are proving to be time and staff inteasive in
preparation, not least because of the hiatus in Bank lending to Per6 and the
need to strengthen Per6's public institutions.
5.          To strengthen public management, the Bank has launched a major
program of technical assistance, crucial for the successful implementation of
the medium-term economic program. It has mobilized resources for these
activities through the Japanese Grant Facility and the Deutsche Gesellschaft
fUr Technische Zusammanarbeit (GTZ), and is currently exploring other possible
avenues of financing. The Bank has secured Japanese grants for approximately
US$F million for seven technical assistance projects in the financial sector,
debt statistics and management, the social sector, water and sanitation,
energy, and privatization, and has secured GTZ grants for about US$1 million
for agriculture, macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms, energy,
mining and industry, infrastructure, and human resource development. Thus,
even before being able to disburse from its own resources, the Bank has
mobilized substantial resources for project preparation and implementation.
6.          The Bank's country assistance strategy is directed at four long-
term objectives: (i) sustaining stabilization and deepening adjustment;
(ii) fostering private sector development and public sector reform;
(iii) alleviating poverty and promoting human resource development; and
(iv) rehabilitating key infrastructure.
7.          Sustaininz Stabilization and Deenenina  Ad1ustaent.  Since mid-
1990, the authorities have pursued structural reforms to set the stage for
sustained economic recovery. Market-oriented reforms (including deregulation)
have beeu implemented in trade, monopoly rights, privatization, port services,
foreign investment, land tenure, labor markets, social security, tax policy
and administration, and the financial sector. Bank lending operations in Peroi
have initially focussed on a program of adjustment loans. The trade reform
loan recognized measures taken to reduce tariffs, eliminate non-tariff
barriers and export subsidies, and reform customs. The SAL aimed at
consolidating stabilization by supporting the continuation of non-inflationary
budget financing, improving tax collection and implementing tax reform. It
also redefines government functions and reduces public employment, lays out
strategies for privatization, increases labor mobility, and reduces state
intervention in agriculture.
8.          Fosterint Private Sector Develoument gad Public Sector Reform.
Bank support in this area will focus on reforms to encourage competition,
private sector investment, and privatisation. Bank support is being provided
through: (a) the reforms in the SAL and Trade Reform Loan; (b) the
privatisation component of the AL; (c) the banking privatization component in
this proposed loan; (d) the proposed privatization adjustment loan; (e) the
technical assistance program for privatisation funded by a Japanese Grant; and
(f) privatization components in the proposed power, transport, and water
sector loans.

9.          Alleviating Poverty and Promotint Human Resource DeveloDment. The
Bank is assisting the government in formulating and implementing a poverty
alleviation strategy, and in promoting human resource development. The Health
and Nutrition Project would support basic health services and nutrition to the
poor in selected regions. It would help in formulating a poverty alleviation
strategy and identifying reforms in food assistance programs. A subsequent
operation in primary education would address rehabilitation needs, with
special attention to the poor.
10.         Rehabllitating Kel Infrastruc'.ure.  The Bank's strategy includes
rehabilitation loans for the power, transport and water sectors, which have
suffered from lack of maintenance. These loans will also support policy and
regulatory changes to promote private sector participation and investment
(e.g. through concession arrangements).  Over the medium term, these loans
will be supplemented with loans to support further rehabilitation and sectoral
reforms, a- well as selected new investments. Projects for rural financing,
irrigation infrastructurt and municipal development are also in the lending
pipeline.
11.         Techaical Assistance. and Economic and Sector Work.  The Bank is
playing a prominent part in supporting technical assistance and is developing
an intensive program of economic and sector work. As noted, to counter
weaknesses in public management, the Bank has mobilized external funds
amounting to a'mut US$9 million (principally from Japanese and German sources)
to finance wide-ranging technical assistance within the government. A
technical assistance loan to support privatization is being developed in
parallel with the privatization adjustment loan. Economic and sector work has
ranged from macroeconomic, structural reform, trade reform and financial
sector reform studies to work on labor markets, privatization and deregulation
strategies, and an environmental sector study. Further studies on health,
nutrition and education, poverty assessment, energy, mining, irrigation, water
supply, telecommunicatlons, transport, and policy reform in infrastructure are
envisaged.
II.  ECONOMIC POLICIES AND DSJVQMf    S
Background
12.         Over the past decade, Pert has suffered from falling rates of
economic growth that have in recent years led to economic stagnation (Table 1
and Charts 1 to 3) and accelerating inflation stemming from loose fiscal and
monetary policies (Charts 4 to 7). These were exacerbated by a flight from
local currency holdings, and persisting difficulties in servicing external
debt that have resulted in the accumulation of massivo arrears to all
creditors. This pitiful development experience was associated with a large
expansion in the role of the state in the economy initiated in the late 1960s,
which created a policy environment and a legal structure inimical to
sustained, efficient growth.

13.         Relative Prices were severely distorted by government controls
over exchange rates, allocation of credit and wages as well as over final
output prices. External trade vas distorted through an overvaluation of the
local currency, multiple exchange rates, high tariffs and quantitative
restrictions. The pattern of domestic production departed increasingly from
efficiency. In factor markets, ill advised employment protection laws coupled
with high tax rates on labor led to misallocation ard stivulated the growth of
an informal sector. The marketability and the use of lan,' as collateral was
greatly restricted, and capital flows were distorted by heavy regulation and
growing state participation in the financial sector. The policy environment
squeezed returns to investment in reflection of growing inefficiency, dampened
export growth and led to unsustainable current account deficits and the build
up of external debt (Table 1). By 1985, real per caput GDP was 13 per cent
lower than a decade earlier.

1985-1990
14.         The government in power between 1985 and 1990 adopted a strategy
of stimulating domestic demand and limiting external debt servicing as the
means of re-initiating growth. The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR)
soared from 5.8 per cent of GDn in 1985 to 15.3 per cent of GDP in 1988 as
wide scale tax reductions were enacted, public employment and wages boosted,
and the public enterprise sector generated increasing losses. The PSBR was
financed largely by recourse to the Central Bank. The authorities decided to
limit public sector external debt payments to a maximum of 10 per cent of
exports of goods and non-factor services, and to service only those creditors
that had undertaken to provide a net inflow of foreign resources.
15.         The inflationary effect of this policy stance was initially
dampened through price and interest rate controls, expanding subsidies, a
pronounced fall in real terms in public sector tariffs and by a multiple
exchange rate system that yielded highly overvalued rates. (The sharp
appreciation in real terms of the sol between 1985 and 1990 is illustrated in
Chart 8.) In addition, domestic money demand expanded as the economy
experienced a sharp but highly temporary boom -- output grew by 17 per cent in
1986-87. As the unsustainability of policies became evident in the course of
1987, confidence evaporated and a flight from local currency precipitated a
hyperinflation from the final quarter of the year. Output fell markedly in
198$ and lack of credibility in exchange rate policies became increasingly
felt with the depletion of international reserves.
16.         The rapid rise in inflation exacerbated the fiscal deficit with
central government revenues falling by one-half (in relation to GDP) between
1985 and 1989 in reflection of the erosion in real tax revenues from
collection lags, rising evasion as well as the effects of tax reductions and
unadjusted public tariffs. The subsidies associated with the multiple
exchange rate system and expanding lending by development banks at low
interest rates led to the emergence of a large quasi-fiscal deficit. Monetary
financing of the PSBR rocketed at a time when domestic money demand was
falling rapidly in conditions of disintermediation. The authorities responded
to the deteriorating fiscal accounts by cutting public investment outlays to
historically low levels, with the greatest reduction taking place in health
and education. Yet, without an attempt to address the fundamental imbalances
within the economy, inflation continued to soar and real activity plummeted.
17.         Economic mismanagement reached a climax in 1989 and 1990.  Real
GDP contracted by nearly 16 per cent in 1989.90, with fixed investment falling
by over 10 per cent (Table 2). About 75 per cent of the labor force was
unemployed or partly employed. In 1990, per caput incomes were 23 per cent
lower than in 1985 and amounted to no more than the levels prevailing in the
late 1950s. Consumer prices rose by over 2700 per cent in 1989 and 7600 per
cent in 1990; the fiscal base had shrunk greatly and with it tax revenues and
public tariffs were approaching zero in real terms. The financial sector was
severely battered by the inflation and depression in activity with its
associated disintermediation and currency substitution; real domestic
liquidity in 1990 was about one-sixth of its value five years earlier. At

mid-year, when the administration left office, international reserves were
virtually exhausted and over two-thirds of Perfi's external debt of
US$22 billion was in arrears, with arrears to the Bank, the Fund and the IDB
totalling US$2.2 billion.

The Stabilization Package of Mid-1990 to Eayly 1991
18.         The authorities that assumed office at end-July 1990 adopted a
firm program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural adjustment with the
objective of arresting inflation and creating the conditions for a recovery of
activity in the private sector. The measures involved a correction of the
large fiscal deficit, the pursuit of tight monetary policies and the provision
of incentives to the private sector to expand output in an efficient manner.
To this end, distortions in relative prices were ironed out, a sharp reduction
in the PSBR was effected and the economy was exposed to foreign competition.



- 11 -
Specifically, the measures includedt (i) 8 rise in the uricea of publlc sector
goods and services ranging between 1000 per cent and 3000 per cent to restore
balance in public enterprise accounts; (ii) the elimination of numerous
exemptions on indirect taxes accompanied by a reduction in VAT from 18 per
cent to 14 per cent as well as the imposition of temporary taxes of 10 per
cent on exports and 1 per cent on net wealth; (iii) a reduction in marginal
reserve reauirem_nts on bank's domestic cui:ency liabilities from 80 per cent
to 40 per cent and, effectively, the free determination of interest rates on
loans and deposits; (iv) a substantial relaxation of price controls; (v) the
unification of the exchanae rates and a free float; (vi) abolition of nearly
all quantitative import restrictions and of some import tariff exonerations,
the consolidation of a complex tariff system into one with three rates of
15 per cent, 25 per cent and 50 per cent, and (vii) liberalization of
restrictions on current 2ayments for external transactions.
19.         Fiscal discipline was exerted by the institution of a cash
management committee at the Ministry of Finance that limited expenditures to
available cash revenues. Public sector wages were held down, while wages (and
prices) in the private sector were allowed to be market determined. In the
months following the initial package, public sector prices continued to be
adjusted periodically in line with costs.
20.         In early 1991, the adjustment measures were strengthened by a
further simplification of the tax system, with the current system relying
principally on five taxess on incomes of individuals and corporations, on
wealth of individuals and corporations, value added tax, on selective
consumption and tariffs on imports. In general, the tax base was expanded
(with elimination of exemptions) and tax rates were reduced. The temporary
taxes on exports and net wealth were removed. The tax administration system
was overhauled and its enforcement mechanisms strengthened. The authorities
published a list of 23 public enterprises eligible for urivatization and
removed public sector monopolies in various activities. Public eumlo'ment was
reduced with the institution of voluntary retirement schemes.
21.         The execution of monetary golicv was sharpened by measures taken
to reduce the quasi-fiscal deficit: subsidized lending by Banco Agrario was
eliminated and the overall activities of this bank limited to small farms in
socially deprived areas. A new banking law was adopted to strengthen
prudential requirements, capital adequacy and concentration ratios, promote
universal type banking and open the sector to foreign investment.
22.         The external pasments and trade gystem was further liberalized
progressively in the course of 1990. All restrictions on private current and
capital transactions have been eliminated (except for those on amortization of
certain classes of external debt). With the abolition of export surrender
requirements (on foreign exchange), removal of limitations on investment
income and capital transfers and the permitting of foreign exchange deposits
at home and overseas, the payments regime has been greatly liberalized.
Subsidized export credits and other export subsidies were eliminated. The
tariff regime was simplified to a maximum rate of 25 per cent, with most items
being subject to a tariff of 15 per cent.



- 12 -
23.         The rigid labor lrotection laws were amended to broaden provisions
for redundancies and to establish a better regime to capitalize the
contributions towards compensation at the time of redundancy or retirement.
Land urouertv rithts have been broadened and strengthened.  Corporations
(including agrarian cooperatives) can now legally become private estates.
Moreover, land is now freely transferable and can be used as collateral.
III. THE ECONOHIC PROGRAM
ProLras Obiectives and Policies
24.         The economic program for 1991-92 was intended to consolidate the
macroeconomic stabilization measures taken in mid-1990 and early 1991 and to
deepen the process of structural reforms then initiated. The program is being
supported by an arrangement with the Fund (the rights accumulation program)
that spans the period to end-1992 as well as by the Bank's program of
adjustment lending. The principal targets of the program (Table 3) are a
reduction in the rate of inflation to low single digit monthly rates by the
turn of the year 1991/92 and to less than 2 per cent per month by end-1992, a
return to growth averaging 3 per cent for years 1991/92 based on a recovery of
investment, and the attainment of a viable external financing position. The
objectives would be achieved by continued prudent fiscal and monetary
policies, market determined interest rates and exchange rates, supported by
fundamontal structural adjustments within the economy.
25.         The burden of the adjustment effort is placed on fiscal and
monetary policies. The program envisages an elimination of domestic financi n
of the PSBR in 1992, from 3.3 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 0.1 per cent of GDP
in 1991. The PSBR itself fell markedly in relation to GDP from 6.5 per cent
in 1990 to 3.2 per cent in 1991, as a result of severe restraints on
expenditures. In 1992, the PSBR will be allowed to rise to the equivalent of
4.4 per cent of GDP because additional external aid flows are expected to
allow higher investment spending than originally projected. Thus, net public
capital expenditures will rise from 1.9 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 3.7 per
cent of GDP in 1992. A recovery in central government revenues is projected
to stem from reforms in the tax system and in tax administration. Revenues
are being strengthened by a simplification of the tax system, reductions in
exonerations, a rise in VAT to 18 per cent, an increase in selective
consumption taxes, an extraordinary payroll tax of 3 per cent in effect during
1992, a gross assets tax of 2 per cent on companies, some receipts from
privatization and, importantly, strengthening of tax administration.
26.         The program will be supported by a continuation of tight monetarX
policies and a market determined excbanm rate; under the Fund program, limits

have been agreed on expansion of net domestic assets of the Central Bank, on
total net domestic borrowing of the public sector as well as on changos in net
external short-term debt. Interest rates are determined by market forces.
The authorities are making greater use of open market operations in the
conduct of monetary policy with the eventual aim of reducing reliance on
still-high reserve requirements. The sol will float freely in the foreign
exchange markets with limited intervention.
27.         In monitorint PerG's Performance under its macroeconomic program,
the Bank will pay particular attention to four variables in 1992: (i) that
central government revenues do not fall short of 9 per cent of GDP;
(ii) primary deficit of the non-financial public sector is no larger than 0.6
per cent of GDP; (iii) money base expansion in the twelve months to end-
D:ember should not exceed 40 per cent; and (iv) stock of other Central Bank
monetary liabilities in soles should not exceed 10 per cent of the monetary
base. The Bank will pay particular attention to measures of fiscal revenue
enhancement and expenditure control which will contribute to efficiency,
equity and the sustainability of adjustment in the medium term. It will
consult closely with the Fund.
28.         The economic nroaram for 1993 and supporting policies will be
agreed with the Bank in late 1992, and will provide the basis for Bank
adjustment lending (including lending under the proposed loan) in 1993 as well
as for an arrangement with the Fund -- the successor arrangement to the rights
accumulation program.
29.         Structural reforms that the government has programmed for 1992
have been detailed in the SAL document (P-5714-PE, March 2, 1992). In
summary, public sector roforms center on a reduction in the size of the
government and in public employment. The tax administration system will be
further strengthened. Privatixation will be undertaken in a wide range of
sectors (including financial). The authorities will develop a povertv
alleviatiou strategy and a program for priority investment in social sectors.
Agricultural reforms have involved improvements in land tenure, agricultural
marketing and credit, water usage and will be advanced further. The
authorities will deepen labor market reforms to increase flexibility in
employment and pay. The social security system (pensions and health) will be
partially privatized and regulations for private participation drawn up.
Recent Economic Develouments
30.         The initial stabilization package generated a burst of
"corrective" (one-time) inflation and a sharp fall in economic activity,
accompanied by the emergence of high real interest rates (Charts 9 to 13).
With the maintenance of a balanced budget on a cash basis (Chart 10) sad firm
monetary policies, inflation fell rapidly thereafter (except for a spike in
early 1991 when public sector prices were again adjusted). Inflation ranged
at monthly rates of 7-9 per cent for the first eight months of the year, but
between October 1991 and January 1992 ranged at 3.5 to 4 per cent. Inflation
accelerated to an average monthly rate of 6 per cent in February and

March 1992 reflecting in part seasonal factors and the effects of changes in
the coverage of the value added tax, but fell to 3.2 per cent In April. The
sharp fall in real balances occasioned by the program has induced large
capital inflows and promoted an appreciation of the sol in real terms by 60
per cent since the start of the program. The authorities have intervened to
limit the appreciation, and net international reserves (Chart 11) rose by
US$1.3 billion between August 1990 and March 1992. Economic activity was
highly depressed until mid-1991 (GDP fell by an estimated 10 per cent between
the first quarters of 1990 and 1991), but has recovered since then,
spearheaded by a revival of investment. By the final quarter of 1991, output
was 11 per cent higher than at the corresponding period of 1990, and in the
early months of 1992 has been expanding at an annual rate of 3 per cent.
Poverty Alleviation
31.         PerG suffers from chronic poverty, the extent and depth of which
has increased significantly over the past decade. In Lima alone, in 1990, it
was estimated that 44 per cent of the population was living in poverty
(defined by consumption being below the equivalent of the basic food basket).
The available data also confirm that half of all children under age six are
chronically malnourished. There is a sharp disparity in the availability and
quality of health, nutrition, and education services within the country.
Activities are not well-integrated or targeted to the most vulnerable groups:
infants, pregnant and lactating mothers, and children under six. Although
there are substantial contributions to food assistance programs by the central
government and donors (totalling about US$200 million in 1991), many programs
do not reach their target groups or have significant nutritional impact.
32.         To protect vulnerable groups during the adjustment period, the
government launched the social emergenc pvroaram in August 1990. However,
this program did not develop as planned, and disbursements fell short of their
original targets. In a renewed attempt to alleviate poverty, the government
created the National Fund for Social Compensation and Development (Uoncodes)
in August 1991 to finance small labor-intensive projects for the
rehabilitation of the social and economic infrastructure, e.g., health posts,
water and sanitation facility, schools, and rural access roads. Activities
have begun on a small scale, mainly in the emergency zones in the Andean
region where the incidence of poverty is high. The Bank, together vith the
IDB and the UNDP, is providing technical assistance financed by the Japanese
Grant Facility to strengthen the institutional capacity of Foncodes.
33.         With increased attention of the nsed to reach vulnerable groups
more effectively, the social sector ministries have also introduced several
key programs. These iucludes, a vaccination campaign, a child growth
monitoring and brea,t feeding program, a streamlining of the logistics of food
assistance, the formation of a coordinating group for nutrition programs, and
a school feeding program linked to basic health care services. In view of
fiscal constraints, the government now plans to improve and expand these
programs with resources from non-governmental organizations and the private
sector as well as external donors.



- 18 -
34.         Through the SAL and technical assistance under the Japanese Grant
Facility, the Bank has been assisting in defining and implementing a poverty
alleviation strategy. This strategy aims at establishing specific objectives
and implementation mechanisms for targeted social programs as well as defining
the roles of Foncodes, the social sector ministries, and the non-governmental
sector. The SAL also supports development of the profiles for priority
projects in primary health, nutrition, and basic education and the national
nutrition policy. The latter, together with the poverty alleviation strategy,
should serve as an important instrument for mobilixing external resources.
Reforms in food assistance will address major weakness in the current food
assistance program by integrating it with the promotion of good health and
nutrition practices and health services. Furthermore, these actions will be
developed into the Bank-supported first health and nutrition project.
Assessment and Rlsks
35.         By any measure, the results to date of Perit's economic adjustment
program are remarkable as has been the determination of the government to
pursue stringent policies in the face of considerable social pressures. The
program is comprehensive in its macroeconomic and structural adjustment
elements. The major benefits have already been recorded in inflation and in
the external position, and output and investment are beginning to recover,
amid signs of growing confidence.
36.         Even so, the policy stance remains fragile and confidence is not
yet firmly rooted. Whilst it remains vital to maintain the fiscal cash
balance, it is equally important in the interests of sustainability that the
central government revenue ratio be raised. Improvements in tax
administration are critical in this respect. At present, cash balance Implies
that suppliers are not fully paid, local authorities do not receive fiscal
transfers, foreign creditors are not kept current, salaries of civil servants
are at an all-time low, and net public investment is highly depressed with
little or no maintenance of physical infrastructure.
37.         The execution of monetary golicv faces a risk from the continued
dollarization of the economy. Currency substitution in excess of that
programmed would leave credit expansion ceilings too loose. Similarly, any
intervention beyond amounts consistent with financial targets would have to be
sterilized promptly. A prolonged appreciation of the sol in real terms is
likely to depress output and exports and may lead to pressures to ease
monetary policy.
38.         Thus, the authorities face a nolicv dilemma common to many other
countries in the early transitional phase of a stabilization program. Tight
fiscal and monetary policiec, in particular a sharp rise in interest rates,
have attracted capital inflows (partly corresponding to return of flight
capital) thereby leading to an appreciation of the sol. The ability to
intervene in foreign exchange markets is limited, given strict monetary
targets for anti-inflation purposes. The appreciated currency and high real



- 19 -
interest rates depress output, especially investment and exports. The
tightening of fiscal policies to the po.nt of generating surpluses that could
be used to purchase foreign exchange ia scarcely an option given the low level
of public expenditures. The government has recently taken steps to reduce the
cost of bank intermediation -- suspension of tax on cheques and debits, the
lowering of marginal reserve requirements on local currency liabilities to
zero -- and hence reduce bank spreads and, it is expected, lower interest
rates on deposits so as to deter capital inflows. As stabilization takes
hold, real interest rates could be expected to fall and the aol depreciate to
realistic levels. The portfolio adjustment evidenced by capital inflows could
also be expected to come to an end shortly.
39.         A further risk stems from recent political developments and,
hence, possible slackness in pursuing structural adjustment policies. In
early April, the President assumed extra-constitutional powers to dissolve
Congress and dismiss judges. Risk in Dolic mIwlementation could arise from
lack of a majority in the Congress due to be elected upon the adoption of a
new constitution. This could hamper the legislative program of the executive.
Under the extraordinary powers conferred on the cabinet at present,
legislation takes place by decree; these decrees may be subject to challenge
by a future Congress or judiciary. Thus, the legitimacy of financial sector
reforms and, indeed, the ownership of the reforms by the public may be open to
question under present political arrangements. However, it should be noted
that the need for reforms and the reform strategy adopted by the government is
widely accepted and the government enjoys great popularity at present. In
this context, it is encouraging that the President has set a timetable of ten
months for the election of the new Congress. The new constitution Vill be
approved by plebiscite later this year and regional elections will also be
held in November 1992. The opening up of the economy and the reduction in the
state's participation, especially through accelerated privatization, is of
utmost importance. Reforms of the financial sector are vital to the process
of efficient intermediation of domestic savings.
IV. EXTERNAL PIMANCING
Introduction
40.         At end-1990, Perfi's total external debt stood at US$22 billion
(over 550 per cent of exports of goods and non-factor services), of which
US$14 billion was in arrears (Table 4). The new government declared its
intention to seek a normalization of relations with creditors. To this end,
current debt service payments to the Fund were maintained and those to the
Bank resumed in October 1990 and to the IDB in November 1990. Thus, the stock
of arrears to the multilaterals has been frozen. Perfi has obtained
exceptional debt relief from its Paris Club creditors as well as extraordinary
financing from a group of eleven industrial country creditors, thereby
eliminating an otherwise large external financing gap associated with its 1991
and 1992 economic program. Projections of external financing requirements



- 20 -
beyond 1992 (Annex III) have been based on the assumptions that: (i) PerG
continues to obtain Paris Club reschedulings on standard terms for lower
middle income countries, and based on the usual practice of an unchanged cut-
off date; (ii) bilaterals provide a growing volume of capital inflowst (iii) a
Fund program and borrowings from PLAR take place in 1993; and (iv) debt
service payments to private creditors amount to only 10 per cent of the total
interest payments bill. The projections point to a financing gap averaging
US$581 million annually over the 1993-95 period. Without substantial debt
write offs or equivalent relief from Paris Club creditors (such as a shift in
cut-off date or drastic interest rate reduction), a gap of this magnitude will
be difficult to cover.

The 1991-92 Financin Plan
41.   PerG's gross external financing requirements for 1991 and 1992 could
total US$23.1 billion (Table 5). To help cover this requirement, the donor
community has developed a coordinated plan. Rescheduling and deferral of debt
to official bilateral creditors and a continued moratorium on debt servicing
to private creditors are expected to cover a large part of the financing
requirement. The balance is expected to be provided by fresh disbursements
from bilateral donors coordinated through a "Support Group."
42.         Debt R.scbedulinz and Deferral.  Negotiations vere successfully
completed with the Paris Club, but are still underway with other bilateral
creditors, notably some Latin American and Eastern European countries.   The
financing plan incorporates the agreement reached at the Paris Club, and
assumes that Pere will be able to secure similar terms from its other official
bilateral creditors. It also assumes PerfG will not service debts to private
creditors during 1991-92; these debts vill therefore be rescheduled.
43.         Paris Club Reschedulinag.  PerG rescheduled part of its obligations
to the Paris Club of creditors on September 17, 1991. The Paris Club awarded
the government exceptional treatment in the form of unprecedented cash flow
relief between October 1, 1991 and December 31, 1992 (the consolidation
period). All current maturities due during the consolidation period on debt
contracted before the 1983 Paris Club rescheduling (pre-cutoff debt) and all
arrears on pre-cutoff debt were rescheduled on terms reserved for heavily
indebted lower middle income countries. All moratorium interest (interest due
during the consolidation period on rescheduled debt) and all arrears on post-
cutoff debt were deferred, the latter contingent on continued performance
under the Fund's program. Details on the terms of the Paris Club rescheduling
can be found in Annex III.
44.         Other Official Bilateral Reschedulinas.  Per6 is seeking debt
rescheduling from other bilateral creditors on comparable terms to those
received from the Paris Club of creditors. This includes the reprogramming of
debt-for-export agreements with Eastern European creditors and the
restructuring of medium-term obligations to Latin American creditors that are
currently being serviced through the AIADI payments mechanism.
45.         Existin  Medium- and Lone-Term Debt to Commercial Banks and
Unmuaranteed S_awiliers. Following law suits brought by the commercial banks
in 1989-90, the new government negotiated an understanding under which it
renounced recourse to statute-of-limitations provisions in return for a
suspension of the default proceedings. Meanwhile, Per6 has been unable to
service its debt to private creditors. However, the government is currently
engaged in discussions with the commercial banks, which may lead to
negotiations towards a settlement as early as 1992.
46.         Existium  Short-Term Private Debt.  Per6 will continue to service
short-term trade credits. Amortization of short-term working-capital loans
has been suspended since 1983, but the government is currently engaged in

discussions which may lead to its reinstatement. Arrears that have emerged in
recent years on interest payments on working capital owed by some public-
sector entities are likely to persist.
47.         New Disbursements.  The three multilaterals and bilateral donors
are committed to helping Per6i secure the needed external financing. Such
financial assistance will remain conditional on Per6i's program of
stabilization and economic reforms remaining in place. For the financing plan
to be successful, Pera must abide by the conditions of the Fund's program and



- 23 -
the Bank's conditions for lending to a country with protracted arrears. As
long as Per6 adheres to its economic reform program, the Bank and the Fund
will disburse upon clearance of arrears. To clear arrears, a bridge loan will
be necessary.
48.         Tho B.k.  On May 2, 1991, the Bank adopted a new program for
committing loans to countries with protracted arrears (see paragraph 2).
Under this program, three adjustment operations (with commitments expected to
total US$1 billion) would be presented to the Board for approval, and
disbursements of US$900 million would be released upon clearance of arrears to
the Bank.
49.         The Fund. In January 1991, the Fund management reached an
agreement-in-principle with Per6 on an economic program for 1991-92 intended
to form the basis for a request for a two-year rights accumulation program.
On September 12, 1991, the Fund Board, satisfied that Pera's external
financing requirements could be met, and that Per6 would maintain its payments
on current obligations to the multilaterals, approved the program. Under the
program, Per6 would accrue rights to future disbursements equivalent to
188 per cent of its quota, or SDR 624 million, equivalent to Peril's current
arrears to the Fund. Rights would be disbursed once arrears to the Fund were
cleared.
50.         The Inter-American Develooment Book.  Peril's arrears to the IDB
were cleared first as they were smaller than those to the Bank or the Fund.
These arrears were cleared on September 13, 1991 1iith the help of a bridge
loan of US$325 million from the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR) .2 With
the clearance of its arrears, the IDB has begun to move ahead with a
substantial program in support of Peril's rehabilitation. On September 18,
1991 the IDB Board approved a quick-disbursing US$425 million loan for trade
reform. In November 1991, it approved a transportation rehabilitation
investment loan for US$210 million and in Merch 1992 a quick-disbursing
US$200 million loan for financial sector reform. This lending will be
followed up with disbursements on new projects In health, agriculture,
electricity, and water/sanitation, as well as the reactivation of existing
energy projects. Total disbursements in 1991 and 1992 are expected to be
about US$723 million.
51.         The Support Group.  Following several meetings beginning in April
1991, a Support Group, led by Japan and the U.S., was officially formed on
VI          FLAR, an institution of the Andean Pact countries created to deal
with balance-of-payments problems in the region through the provision of
medium-term (up to three-to-four-year) funding, has committed to make
available to Peru up to $78 million more in financing through the end of 1992.



- 24 -
June 7, 1991.' At the time of approval of the ri8hts accumulation program,
the Fund had estimated the quick disbursing balance of payments support
required from the Support Group at US$1.3 billion. Following the Paris Club
rescheduling, which was more favorable than expected, and an increase in
expected disbursements from the multilaterals, additional balance of payments
support needed was estimated at only US$0.7 billion. The Support Group
pledged to provide this amount, in addition to US$326 million earmarked for
project assistance. In 1991, US$437 million was disbursed.
Jinancina Beyond 1992
52.         Per6's net external financing requirements are projected at
US$3 billion annually between 1993 and 1995 (Annex III). The economy is
projected to grow at an annual rate of 3 per cent based on a recovery of
investment and exports.  This rate of growth is significantly below the
potential rate of growth; growth is constrained by a projected slow recovery
in domestic savings (givon the low levels of consumption) and by a cautious
assumption as to the avi.ilability of external financing. Growth at 3 per cent
would not permit a rise in consumption per caput until towards the end of the
decade.
53.         The external financing requirement is, of course, sensitive to the
projected inflows of capital and the targetted rise in gross international
reserves. A recovery in private capital inflows, including direct investment
related to the development of natural resource projects and renewed access to
short-term trade credits, is assumed.  let direct investment is projected to
rise from US$213 million in 1992 to US$350 million in 1993 and US$630 million
in 1995, in reflection of the changes in the incentive framework (market
exchange rate and interest rate policies, macroeconomic stability) and
policies towards foreign investment as well as investment in a large project--
the Camissa gas field. Privatization is also expected to act as a fillip to
foreign investment. In contrast, short-term capital inflows (including errors
and omissions) are projected to decline markedly as portfolio adjustment
(responsible for return of flight capital) is completed. The financing
scenario is highly tentative and should be interpreted with caution.
54.         Significant increases in flows from the multilaterals and official
bilateral donors are expected to account for most of the necessary financing.
Bilaterals are projected to increase their support from US$591 million in 1992
to US$700 million in 1993 and US$858 million in 1995. Disbursements from the
Bank and the IDB are based on lending programs currently in effect. Per6 is
projected to draw US$325 million annually from the Fund over 1993-95 --
approximately 50 per cent of its new quota -- under the arrangement that will
replace the rights accumulation program. In addition, it is assumed that the
government will continue to reschedule private debt service, (it is assumed
3f          Bilateral donors who have pledged through the Support Group are:
Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.



- 25 -
for illustrative purposes that from 1993 10 per cent of the interest bill to
private creditors is paid) and maintain pre-cutoff-date debt service to Paris-
Club creditors due throughout the period. No debt reduction is assumed for
either official bilateral or private creditors.
55.         Under these assumptions, a financing gap averaging US$581 million
annually in 1993-95 is projected. The principal potential source for filling
the projected gap over 1993-95 is bilaterals. Such support could be extended
in the form of either extraordinary financing through continued Support Group
type operations or through exceptional relief at the Paris Club or some
combination of the two. In the servicing of Paris Club debt, it is assumed
that the cut-off date remains unchanged and that all principal and interest
due in 1993-95 on post cut-off date is paid. It is also assumed that the
following are paid in 1993-95: (i) interest on rescheduled debt falling due
in the year in question; (ii) moratorium interest of the 1991-92 consolidation
period plus arrears of principal and interest on post cut-off debt as of 1991
as agreed in the terms of the 1991 rescheduling arrangement. Exceptional
relief from the Paris Club, referred to above, could consist of a rescheduling
or deferment of these amounts -- this would make a considerable contribution
to the financing of the calculated gap. Bank calculations indicate that, were
Pert' to be awarded Paris Club terms similar to those for Poland (in April 1991)
and ERypt (in May 1991), the external financing gap would average only
US$110 million annually over 1993-95.
56.         Debt Servicina CaMacitv.  PerG's creditworthiness is expected to
improve following the repayment of its arrears to the World Bank and the Fund
in December 1992 and the earlier resumption of relations with the IDB and the
Paris Club of creditors. The improvement in economic performance, in the
coming decade, from a sustained program of economic reform can be expected to
underpin creditworthiness by improving PerGi's capacity to service its external
debt.
57.         Under the assumed scenario, the ratio of debt service to exports
is projected to fall over the medium term. However, the ratios of debt to GDP
and interest to GDP, which better reflect the burden of transfer, rise
modestly. Debt reduction would clearly lead to a greater reduction in the
debt burden and contribute to the future recovery of Per6's creditworthiness.
(See Annex III for a summary of Per6'as debt and debt service indicators.)
V. THE STRATEGY OF FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORK
Th  Reform Strateav and Implementation in 1990-91
58.         The Peruvian Government recognizes that the initial stabilization
of the economy has to be bolstered by measures to promote efficiency in
financial intermediation if investment-led growth is to be established on a
firm, sustained basis. Over the past decade, domestic savings have been
channelled into unproductive domestic investment or capital flight as a



- 26 -
consequence of financial repression: controls over prices (interest rates,
multiple and overvalued exchange rates), over quantities (credit allocation,
restrictions on foreign exchange liabilities), and vast inefficiencies in the
intermediation process (large reserve requirements, taxes on cheque and bank
debits, taxes on loans, arbitrary subsidies on certain loans benefitting
farmers and exporters). Disintermediation has been provoked also by extreme
instability in fiscal and monetary policies that have resulted in volatile and
high rates of inflation, culminating in hyperinflation in the 1988-90 period.
At present, Hz is less than 3 per cent of CDP.
59.         Besides experiencing a marked shrinkage in recent years, the
Peruvian financial system has been characterized by deep market segmentation.
Until the authorization of universal type banking by the mid-1991 Banking Law,
the activities of financial institutions were rigidly regulated by law which
specified the permissible maturity range of liabilities and credits or the
authorized sectors in which operations could take place. Thus, commercial
banks could accept sight or savings deposits only and extend loans at short
maturities, but not medium or long-term loans, which were the province of
financial companies that accepted time deposits. Such segmentation introduced
rigidities in the intermediation process and led to efficiency losses.
60.         The state has played a near-dominant role in the financial sector.
Directed credit on highly preferential terms has been channeled through four
sector development banks, those for agriculture, housing, industry, and
mining, using in part external lines of credit, but, increasingly over time,
credit lines from the Central Bank. Such credit lines were eliminated in mid-
1990 and the development banks are at present in the process of liquidation.
Credit for long-term investment has also been extended through the multi-
sector public finance corporation (Cofide) that acts as an institution for
both first-tier and second-tier lending. The state is also the owner of Banco
de la Naci6n, which acts as the financial agent of the government and enjoys a
monopoly of all public sector accounts. Pricing and allocation of credit is
not conducted on market terms. Finally, the state is the sole owner of three
commercial banks and has significant participation in four others; public
commercial banks have a notably weaker portfolio and balance sheet than the
rest of the banking system. Details on the structure of the financial system
can be found in Annex IV.
61.         Competition within the financial system has been inhibited by the
predominant role of the state -- the operations of the Banco de la Nacin
alone are almost equal to the rest of the commercial banks put together -- as
well as by the effects of regulation on interest rates, direction of credit,
permissible activities. It has also been hampered by common ownership of
private banks and finance companies and linkages to specific companies or
conglomerates. Credlt is highly concentrated -- the top 10 per cent of
borrowers account for nearly 90 per cent of bank credit. This reflects the
aforementioned factors as well as the consequences of severe disintermediation
that protects credit to long standing clients or companies that have an equity
interest in the bank. Credit concentration has increased risk to banks and
has undoubtedly led to a weakening in portfolio quality.



- 27 -
62.         The supervisory authority -- the Superintendency of Banking gad
Insurance (SBS) -- has not been able to exercise adequate surveillance or
Impose sanctions to counteract the deterioration in portfolios as it has
lacked trained staff and the necessary instruments to perform its tasks.
63.         The program of financial sector reform centers on th. eradication
of distortion. within the system, She nromotion of comnetition through a
drastic reduction in state participation in the industry accompanied by an
opening to foreign investment, and establishina rational foundations for the
reaulatory structure. Underpinning the strategy of reform is the maintenance
of a sound macroeconomic policy stance, with balance in the overall public
sector cash account being at the core.
64.         As noted, the government acted promptly in August 1990 to
liberalize the exchange system and unify the exchange rate at a market
determined level and to effectively abolish controls over interest rates.
Administrative direction of credit has also been removed and agents are free
to hold foreign currency deposits locally or abroad. In liquidity control and
management of short-term public debt, the authorities are placing reduced
reliance on reserve requirements and have begun to market Central Bank bills
as embryonic money market operations. Whilst taxes on checks and debits
(which are highly distortionary) were left on the books for revenue reasons,
the government suspended these taxes in March 1992 and is committed to their
eventual abolition as fiscal conditions permit. A tax of 15 per cent on the
interest rate on loans remains in force. Subsidized lending has been phased
out. The promulgation of a new banking law (for details see below) in 1991
has led to the application of uniform legal standards on the entry (including
permitting foreign participation) and exit of banks, rationalized banking
activity (authorizing universal type banking), and established prudential
regulations governing capital requirements and credit concentration. These
initial steps towards financial sector reform, all undertaken within the
government's first year in office, represent impressive achievements.
The 1992-93 Reform Protram
65.         The final phase of reforms (to be Implemented during 1992 and
1993) will concentrate ons (i) the promotion of competition and market forces
through the near elimination of the state as a provider of financial services
and (ii) the establishment of a regulatory onvironment conducive to efficiency
and prudent financial markets. At present, the state is the sole shareholder
of four develoiment banks (agriculture, industry, housing, and mining) that
have been virtually the only source of long-term financing (but increasingly
lending has tended to be short-term) and which are all in a large negative net
worth position. These banks have acted as first-tier institutions. About
62 per cent of the total loan portfolio of US$350 million is non-performing.
The development banks have been funded largely through Central Bank lines but
also with deposits from the public. The state also owns the Banco de la
Naci6n, which enjoys a monopoly in providing financial services to the public
sector and is the source of much wasteful duplication in activity: public



- 28 -
sector deposits in this bank are the same size as M2. In addition, three
commercial banks accounting for 23 per cent of total banking system
liabilities are wholly state cwned.
66.         The government has decided to terminate the operations of the
development banks and to shift the intermediation of long-term external funds
to Cofide, an existing multi-sector public investment bank, or to a new small-
scale public development bank. Such a bank will conduct only second-tier
operations. The Banco de 18 Naci6n will also severely reduce its operations
as a bank, with the public sector opening accounts at commercial banks and the
Treasury a central account at the Central Bank. Finally, the state will offer
its three commercial banks for sale.
67.         The authorities intend to strengthen bankint suDervision by
phasing in the implementation of the Banking Law. The thrust of reform will
be placed on improved implementation of the strengthened regulations: on-site
inspections of financial institutions, more rigorous audit standards,
stringent enforcement of capital requirement., provisioning and of credit
concentration ratios; for these purposes, the Superintendency will re-train
and restructure personnel. The program provides for the promotion of canital
market activities, including the institution of Orivate pension funds.  A
Capital Markets Law passed in late-1991 will make the raising of iavestible
funds easier. It will also assist the ambitious privatization program under
way by making the placement of shares easier.  In late-1991, the government
removed public monopoly over pension funds; this measure will greatly
stimulate capital markets to the benefit of efficient investment.
VI. THE REFORM OF PUBLIC B_ANKS
Development Bankina
68.         The government has taken steps to cause the four (sector-specific)
development banks to cease operations as their losses exceeded capital and
reserves. The mining bank was declared insolvent in 1991. The agriculture
and the industrial banks were declared insolvent at end-February 1992 and
ceased operations that month. The housing bank ceased operations in March
1992 and the housing fund was ramoved from the bank. These four banks are now
on the way to liquidation; the process of liquidation will be executed by a
committee common to all four banks to be appointed in May. The deposits of
the general public in these banks (about US$20 million) will be transferred to
commercial banks, using proceeds from sales of assets. The liability to the
Central Bank (about US$120 million) will be extinguished either by net
proceeds from sales of assets, a Treasury bond issue, by a write-off on the
part of the Central Bank or some combination of the three. The assets of the
banks will be in part administered and collected by a remaining skeleton staff
and in part sold off to private banks or other financial institutions at a
discount. It is expected that the assets of the industrial and mining bank
being highly concentrated amongst a few borrowers will be administered by the



- 29 -
authorities, whilst those of the agriculture bank (except for some large and
easily collectible loans) and the housing bank will be sold to private
entities. Fixed assets -- chiefly buildings -- will be realized within a
period of about two years, with the funds being used to defray the liabilities
of the banks. Final decisions on the disposition of the balance sheet will be
taken by the liquidation committee and will be embodied in an action plan that
will be discussed with the Bank.
69.         The total staff of the four development banks was reduced from
11,500 in mid-1990 to 7,500 at end-1991. Further reductions have taken place
since in light of the closing of the banks and staff at present is around
2000. The authorities intend to reduce staff further to below 1500 by end-
1992, a number required for management of existing assets as well as perform
certain other residual functions connected with first-tier agricultural loans.
It is estimated that the staff required to extend credit and grants via fiscal
resources (described below) to poor farmers in remote areas over the medium
term as well as to gradually realize remaining financial and fixed assets of
the banks would not exceed 500. Such a sharp reduction of staff has been
achieved very largely through voluntary redundancies; at an average severance
pay and related benefits of US$3000 per employee, expenditures in 1992 are
projected at US$17 million and have been met through the central government
budget.
70.         With the elimination of the development banks, first-tier lending
will be conducted almost exclusively by the private financial institutions.
However, it was the practice of the agriculture bank in the past to extend
loans on social grounds to farmers operating on a small scale in remote areas
not served by the commercial banking network. Such loans were often extended
to uncreditworthy borrowers with the result that loan recovery rates were
poor. For social reasons, the government intends to extend similar support to
such farmers, but, recognizing the dubious credit quality of these operations,
the proposed support will be funded entirely out of the fiscal budget and will
be highly limited in volume. Thus, a combination of grants, loans and
guarantees amounting to US$50-100 million in 1992 will be extended from this
budget to the agricultural sector (including lending to small scale farmers in
remote areas). The authorities will endeavor to interest private financial
institutions in initiating lending to such farmers with appropriate collateral
and other forms of risk management and will try to channel resources through
private intermediaries, but the remaining staff of the development banks may
also be used for this purpose. The government is committed to progressively
reduce fiscal support for agriculture lending in future years. At the same
time, the authorities will devise schemes to stimulate lending by private
financial institutions to small scale farmers; such schemes may involve the
temporary use of subsidies to offset high start-up costs.
71.         Second-tier lending will be confined to the existing multi-sector
public finance corporation (Cofide) or to a bank to be set up specifically for
this purpose. Cofide or the new bank will engage in purely second-tier
lending intermediating long-term external lines of credit through eligible
commercial banks, which will bear the credit risk. In any event, Cofide will
shed its current first-tier functions; thus, the state will no longer engage



- 30 -
in any first-tier activities. After experience is gained in second-tier
lending and as local capital markets develop, Cofide or the new bank will be
authorized to issue long-term bonds with foreign resources becoming a smaller
source of funds for long-term development loans.
72.         The second-tier institution will require the necessary capital and
appropriate staffing. Over the past year, Cofide has reduced staff from 750
to 280. Should it be charged with exclusive second-tier responsibilities, a
total staff of about 200 would be sufficient, with a shift in staff skills
towards bankers experienced in second-tier activities. The elimination of
first-tier functions of Cofide will necessitate fewer commercial bankers, but
some will be needed to manage the existing first-tier portfolio. Should
second-tier activities devolve to a new institution, Cofide staff should be
reduced further and the new institution staffed at about 50 persons.
73.         The conditions for loan signing are:
(a) Cessation of all operations of the four development banks;
(b)   Credit to small farmers in remote areas not served by
commercial banks will not exceed US$100 million in 1992.
Commitment to reduce this amount gradually in subsequent
years. Such credit will be funded exclusively from the
fiscal budget. No deposit taking activity will be
permitted;
(c) Adoption of plan for final reduction of staff and branches
of the four development banks, satisfactory to the Bank;
(d) Reduction of staff of the four development banks to no
greater than 1,500;
(e) Completion of valuation of assets and liabilities of the
development banks;
(f) Adoption of plan for the financing of losses and transfer of
loans and deposits to the rest of the banking system,
satisfactory to the Bank;
(g) Adoption of plan, satisfactory to the Bank, for limiting
second-tier activities to either Cofide or a new
institution. Such institution will engage exclusively in
second-tier lending. Plan will include: (i) definition of
operations, (ii) adequate capitalization, and
(iii) appropriate staffing; and
(h) Adoption of plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to (i) wind down
the first-tier activities of Cofide, and (ii) implement
staff reductions consistent with Cofide's role.



- 31 -
74.         The conditions for release of second tranche ares
(a)   No revival of operations of the development bankst
(b)   Maintenance of program for reduction of fiscal support for
agricultural lending;
(c)   Staff of the development banks to be reduced to no more than
the minimum necessary for the implementation of the
liquidation plan and limited first-tier agricultural
lending;
(d)   Transfer of public deposits to commercial banks and sale of
the loan portfolio completed;
(e)   Portfolio losses financed by the authorities;
(f)   Implementation of the Cofide or new second-tier bank action
plan; and
(g)   Implementation of the Cofide plan to eliminate first-tier
lending and implement staff reductions.
Banco de 1B Maci6n (BN)
75.         The current functions of BN include the management of government
funds, the provision of near-monopoly banking services to the public sector,
and the administration of a large branch network. The Treasury and all
government departments maintain accounts at the BN. BE also assists in the
collection of taxes by providing an account to Sunat, the tax collection
authority; moreover, certain tax payers make payments directly at BN. All
deposits of public enterprises must be maintained at BN, but BN is empowered
to authorize the placement of deposits on a case-by-case basis at state-owned
commercial banks. In addition, BY acts as the external financial agent of the
government and maintains external debt statistics. In each of these functions
there are significant inefficiencies and wasteful duplication that have
created distortions in the functioning of the financial sector. Furthermore,
the BN is a high cost institution, employing 7000 persons, with administrative
expenses alone exceeding US$100 million annually.
76.         A major source of financial inefficiency arises from BN's lending
operations with public enterprises. BN essentially serves as an intermediary
between the public sector companies with positive cash flow and the less
efficient and ailing public companies that need continuous injections of
liquidity to survive. Such operations not only prevent companies with
positive cash flow obtaining market terms on their de-isits but, importantly,
obscure the real financial condition of weak public sector companies by
permitting the funding of public enterprise losses beyond amounts specifically
allocated in the budget. Such arbitrary transfers of liquidity on non-market



- 32 -
terms from surplus to deficit public enterprises blunt incentives for the
restructuring (under suitably drawn up financing programs) or liquidation of
public enterprises earning an inadequate return on capital.
77.         The reform strategy consists in eliminating duplicative and high
cost activities by the abolition of BN's role as banker to the public sector:
specifically, the Treasury will maintain its chief account at the Central Bank
and subsidiary accounts of government departments with commercial banks, and
public enterprises will bank exclusively at commercial banks. The management
of government deposits and debt directly by the Central Bank will ensure
better coordination of monetary and fiscal policies, not least by eliminating
the present uncoordinated placement of deposits by BN ir. comercial banks,
which adds greatly to liquidity fluctuations. The government departments'
active accounts on which they draw checks and effect payment transfers would
be best managed by the commercial banks. The Central Bank will also act as
the external financial agent of the government. The management of the
government foreign debt (including statistics) wi±l be placed in the Central
Bank; and all major foreign currency transactions on behalf of the government
handled by it.  Tax collection will be undertaken at commercial banks with
payments flowing to the tax collection authority, which will bank revenues at
the Central Bank. Thus, the unnecessary layer represented by BN with
associated high transaction costs will be eliminated.
78.         Credit to public enterprises will be extended by commercial banks
or through specific fiscal allocation. Ailing public companies will be
supported by transfers from the government budget ot by specifically
authorized borrowing under government guarantee whilst undergoing
restructuring, privatization or liquidation. The elimination of loans on a
non-commercial basis will greatly assist the restructuring of the public
sector.
79.         The implementation of reforms will be phased over two years.  The
authorities are in the process of developing an action plan -- based on advice
provided by the Bank -- for the progressive transfer of the functions of the
B3 to other institutions as described above, reduction of staff and branches
of the BN and the treatment of BN's balance sheet. The chief liabilities are
external loans, which have already been implicitly assumed by the government
and deposits of tbr public sector; as noted, the latter will be transferred to
the Central Bank an to commercial banks. The assets -- chiefly loans to
public enterprises -- will have to be carefully valued sad a plan adopted for
the recognition of losses either by a Treasury bond issue or through partial
write off by the Central Bank or some combination of the two. Performing
assets will be transferred to commercial banks.
80.         Fiscal costs will arise (as is the case with the liquidation of
the development banks, discussed earlier) from: (i) interest payments and
gradual amortization of the Treasury bond recognizing loan losses of the
institution and (ii) smaller Central Bank profits or greater quasi-fiscal
losses associated with debt write offs. Offsetting fiscal savings will be
realized from the administrative current expenditures of the 3N (over



- 33 -
US$100 million annually) and elimination of flow losses on the portfolio. One
time costs include staff severance payments; compensating one-time revenues
include sale of fixed assets. The action plan will review carefully fiscal
costs and savings and the authorities will be required to take the necessary
budgetary decisions.
81.         Conditions for loan signing are:
(a)   Removal of monopoly of the BN over government and public
enterprise deposits; and
(b)   Adoption of a program satisfactory to the Bank for: (i) the
elimination of wasteful and duplicative operations;
(ii) transfer of banking operations (including assets and
liabilities) to the Central Bank and to commercial banks;
(iii) closure of tax collection operations; (iv) the
transfer of the role of external financial agent of the
government and (v) portfolio reduction and financing of
portfolio losses, as well as staff reduction and branch
closures.
82.         Conditions for release of second tranche are:
(a)   Implementation of actions constituting not less than the
agreed first year program for the transfer to Contral Bank
and commercial banks of the functions as well as liabilities
and assets of the BN, and reduction in staff and branches;
and
(b)   Similar implementation of financing plan for the recognition
of losses.
Privatisation of Comercial Banks
83.         The government is the sole shareholder of three commercial banks
-- Banco Continental, Interbanc and Banco Popular Group (together accounting
for 23 per cent of the total liabilities of commercial banks) and part
shareholder of four others, three of which are subsidiaries of Banco
Continental. The balance sheet of the publicly-owned comercial banks is on
average weaker than that of the private banks; the Bsanco Popular Group is in
particularly poor financial condition, but Banco Continental and Interbanc,
though greatly overstaffed, are recognized to be well managed institutions.
As the government wishes to withdraw entirely from first-tier financial
intermediation, it has announced its intention to privatize all its commercial
banks.
84.         The government has established a central mainsterial committee
headed by a cabinet minister to oversee the entire privatization program.
This committee will be assisted by subcommittees specifically charged with
privatization of individual banks. Of the three wholly-owned public



- 34 -
commercial banks, the government has announced the intention to sell the
financially weakest one (Banco Popular, accounting for about 5 per cent of
total banking deposits) first, and preparatory work is vell advanced.
Privatization of this bank is likely to be completed within the next three
months as various buyers have expressed interest. The government has also
decided to divest itself of its 59 per cent holding in another bank, Banco de
Comercio, which accounts for 1-1/2 per cent of total banking deposits.
85.         The 8anco Popular Group consists of Banco Popular itself, various
branches in Bolivia, and a finance company, Peru-Invest. The privatization
committese is attempting to sell these elements separately as each appeals to a
different class of buyer. The privatization of Banco Popular is complicated
by the poor state of its portfolio (over 40 per cent of its loans present
problems), excessive labor force (Popular has reduced its labor force from
2,800 to 1,600 in the past year, but a further reduction to 600-800 appears
necessary), and poor management. The Superintendency of Banking has been
considering intervention on grounds of inadequacy of capital. The government
appointed a new board in February 1992 charged with preparing the bank for
speedy privatization. In view of the poor state of the portfolio of the bank,
continuing losses and the exodus of talented management, the authorities took
the position that a sale via the stock market would take unduly long and
carried serious risks of failure. In March 1992, a decree was issued
permitting a bilateral sale to any interested party. The authorities are in
the process of carrying out an acquisition audit and valuation of the bank.
At the same time, negotiations are taking place with a foreign bank that has
offered to purchase Banco Popular largely through the use of Peru's external
debt papers. The authorities are conscious of the need for transparency in
the sale process, to which end they will rely on the valuation report.
Preparations for the sale of the Bolivian branches of the Banco Popular Group
and the finance company have also been initiated. The sale of the partly-
owned bank, Banco de Comercio, is expected to take place within the next three
months.
86.         The government has announced the sale of the other two wholly-
owned commercial banks (Continental and Interbanc, together accounting for
13 per cent of total banking deposits) over the next 12 to 18 months. The
privatization of a sounder bank would add to credibility, lead to a diffuse
ownership through share placements via the stock market, increase competition
and yield fiscal revenues. It is likely that Interbanc, being smaller than
Continental, will be offered for sale later this year, and one or more of the
other partly-owned banks will also be sold. The preparations for sale have
only just begun. The banks will be put up for valuation later this year.
Adjustments to the staff stren8th prior to sale may be necessary. Emphasis
will be placed on an advertizing effort, especially as it is probable that the
banks would be bought by foreign interests in whole or in part. The
authorities will take a decision on the role of debt-equity swaps and the
conditions governing their use prior to privatization. Bank staff have been
providing advice on privatization strategy and plans.



- 35 -
87.         As conditions of loan signing the government Is required to:
(a)   Banco Popular Group and publicly-held shares of Banco de
Comercio to be offered for sale by the government.
Preparation of documentation for pre-qualification and
bidding satisfactory to the Bank; and
(b)   Adoption of a plan for the sale of either Interbanc or Banco
Continental, satisfactory to the Bank, and issuance of the
offer for valuation.
88.         As conditions for release of second tranches
(a)   Sale of Banco Popular, Banco de Comercio and either
Interbanc or Continental to be completed; and
(b)   Adoption of plan for sale of the remaining bank and issuance
of offer for valuation, satisfactory to the Bank. Adoption
of plan to sell regional banks and government holdings in
partially-owned banks.
VII.  THE REFORM OF REGULATORY ARRANGEMENTS
Introduction
89.         The reforms promptly enacted by the authorities upon taking office
in mid-1990 and further consolidated since then in the area of monetary
policies were discussed in Chapters II and 1II. In summary, controls over
interest rates have in effect been ended, directed credit abolished and
stubsidies on all credits eliminated. The Central Bank ceased to extend lines
of credit to development banks or other public institutions. The exchange
rate was unified and the sol permitted to float freely. These actions have
all but eliminated the quasi-fiscal deficit. In the area of monetary control,
the Central Bank is reducing reliance on reserve requirements and placing
greater emphasis on open market operations. Marginal reserve requirements are
remunerated at market interest rates. These sets of actions have greatly
reduced distortions in financial intermediation and have also led to a
lowering of the cost of intermediation.to the benefit of efficiency.
90.         The authorities recognize the importance of bolstering monetary
reform by putting the regulation and supervision of banks on a rational basis
and of liberalizing stock market activities and, in particular, permitting
private sector participation in the pension fund business if the financial
system is to be durably strengthened. The reform program, thus, encompasses
an overhaul of the regulatory framework governing these activities.



- 36 -
Banking Lemislation. Regrlation and Supervision
91.         Back_xound.  Banking legislation in place prior to mid-1991
inhibited competition by greatly restricting banks' abilities to allocate
resources. Banks were restricted to operating in the short-term. Long-term
operations were reserved for finance companies and development banks.
Directed credit resolutions further constrained bank operations by requiring
banks to allocate resources to government identified priority sectors and
geographical areas. Eleven banks were restricted to operating in only one
region. Entry and exit was discretionary, with little transparency, and
limits were placed on foreign ownership. State owned banks received
preferential treatment, including exclusive access to legal procedures for
recovering collateral on overdue loans, and preferential access to deposits of
state owned enterprises. For privately owned banks, the threat of
nationalization remained omnipresent, climaxing in 1987 with the attempted
nationalization of the entire banking system. With no deposit insurance
system in place, and poor available information to use in differentiating
between banks, depositors assumed an unlimited government guarantee or banked
off-shore.
92.         Exacerbating the restrictive legal framework, inadequate
prudential regulations and lax supervision and enforcement meant that
insolvent financial institutions continued to operate, in many cases relying
on central government support, and considerable uncertainty about the
financial condition of other banks was generated. Loan classification
procedures were inadequate, and for the most part left to individual financial
institutions. Loan loss reserves for bad debts were required only on loss or
doubtful accounts, leaving deficient loans without reserves. Liberal loan
rollover practices further undermined the discipline of setting aside
reserves. External audits for state owned banks were at times carried out
infrequently and often without coordination with the Superintendency.
93.         A major cause of lax supervision has been the inability of the
Superintendency of Banking and Insurance (SBS) to carry out its mandate. The
administration and support functions, where over half of the SBS employees
work, are over-staffed. Within the supervision area there has been little
coordination between different units resulting in significant duplication of
effort. Many staff lack professional qualifications, and inadequate training
has not kept staff abreast of modern supervisory techniques. Low salaries and
the reluctance for downsizing have contributed to making professional
recruitment difficult. Computer equipment is antiquated and not used
efficiently. These serious weaknesses have resulted in a supervision process
sometimes unrelated to the enforcement of existing prudential regulations,
with untimely off-site analysis and on-site inspections of low quality and
inadequate frequency.
94.         Reform Prosram.  The reform of banking legislation and regulation,
as well as the restructuring of the SBS are key components of financial sector
reform. Significant steps already have been taken by the government, and the
loan supports the maintenance of these accomplishments. The grivernment
initiated its program of financial sector reform with the enactment of a new



- 37 -
banking law in July 1991, which replaced the 1988 banking law, and at the same
time the government suspended the bank regionalization law. Later in January
1992, the SBS initiated a program of updated prudential regulations, which
complement and enhance the banking law. The SBS has devised a plan for the
restructuring of the SBS designed to improve banking supervision, and for
Interim improvements in bank inspections.
95.         The loan also supports the implementation of the recent measures.
For example the enactment of a new banking law in July 1991 provides an
appropriate legal framework, which now needs to be sustained and enforced.
The initiation of a program of updated prudential regulations designed to
improve banking supervision has to be followed through and operationalized. A
plan for the restructuring of the SBS must be refined and carried out, and
before the restructuring is complete, measures must be broadened to improve in
the short-term bank inspections.
96.         The 1991 Banking Law.  The 1991 banking law seeks to enhance
competitiveness, introduce a number of prudential requirements. These serve
as a basis for improved regulation, and as a mechanism to limit the liability
of the state in the case of bank failures, and at the same time protect small
savers (see Annex V for details).
97.         Competitiveness of banks and finance companies.  The law
authorizes universal type banking. Banks can now operate in the short, medium
and long term, issue bonds and underwrite securities, create and administer
mutual funds, engage in security and foreign exchange transactions, factor,
and operate leasing subsidiaries. Finance companies can now engage in all
commercial banking activities except accepting demand deposits and engaging in
foreign trade transactions. The law eliminates directed credit to priority
sectors and geographical areas and removes preferential treatment for state-
owned banks, which now have to compete with private banks under the same
conditions.
98.         The law also reduces discretion in awarding bank licenses and in
bank liquidation and rehabilitation. It abolishes the ceiling on foreign
ownership, and eliminates advantages enjoyed by local investors. The SBS, in
consultation with the BCR, authorizes the creation of new banks and finance
companies, based on minimum capital requirements, administrative and
organizational requirements, and stringent cross-ownership guidelines. The
law reduces discretion in the handling of bank and finance company crises, and
clarifies procedures for rehabilitation or liquidation. Intervention by the
SBS has been reduced to a 24 hour period, thus outlawing SBS management of a
financial institution. In the case of bank liquidation or rehabilitation,
power is shared between the SBS and the Central Bank.
99.         Prudential requirements.  The large exposure (lending) limit
contained within the new banking law permits only up to 5 per cent of net
worth, adjusted by inflation, to be lent to a single individual or economic
group.   However, under exceptional circumstances, for example, if bank
deposits are offered as collateral, the limit can reach up to 40 per cent.
The exposure limit under a single agreement is also 5 per cent.



- 38 -
100.        The law introduces prudential regulations establishing minimum
capital requirements for banks that are subject to yearly indexation according
to the general price index. A risk-weighted capital adequacy measure has been
introduced for banks and finance companies, which brings PerG close to
internationally accepted standards. Under the new banking law, total assets
plus contingent credits, weighted by risk, should not exceed more than 15
times the total net worth of the bank, adjusted by inflation. The SBS is
required under the new banking law to publish quarterly financial indicators
of banks. All financial institutions are now required to publish quarterly
their financial statements, in the official newspaper.
101.        Deposit protection. A deposit insurance scheme introduces
protection for small savers by guaranteeing public savings up to a limit of
Soles 2,500 per depositor per financial institution, and Soles 5,000 per
depositor per year, subject to yearly indexation according to the general
price index. Previously there had been a 100 per cent implicit guarantee.
The Deposit Insurance Fund will be financed by financial institutions, but it
can borrow from the Ministry of Economy and Finance if necessary to complete
payoffs to protected depositors.
102. *      Poa  of Prudential Reaulations.  Although the 1991 banking law
introduced a number of prudential regulations, after the law's enactment still
lacking was a comprehensive portfolio classification guideline, and
facilitating regulations necessary for the supervision of the regulations
contained in the law. Also a number of existing SBS prudential regulations
required updating. To address these deficiencies, in early 1992 the SBS
initiated a program of prudential regulations designed to further strengthen
banking regulation and bring standards to internationally accepted levels.
Under this program, the SBS has already issued stricter requirements for
establishing loan loss reserves, limits on foreign exchange exposure,
standards for external auditors, reporting of refinanced loans and a number of
regulations necessary to enforce prudential requirements in the banking law.
Additional regulations, including a comprehensive portfolio classification
guideline, will be issued. Both the IDB and the Fund have provided technical
assistance to the SBS.
103.        Loan lose reserves.  Banks are now required to set aside loan loss
reserves of 25 per cent on deficient loans, 50 per cent on doubtful, and 100
per cent on loss.
104.        Foreign exchange exposure. Banks are now restricted to a limit on
foreign currency sales of 2.5 per cent of net worth. A guideline has been
issued recomending that foreign currency credit be allocated only to
enterprises that generate foreign liquidity, and set prices and tariffs
directly linked to exchange rate fluctuations. Credits in foreign currency,
for which the borrower is having trouble repaying due to exchange rate
fluctuations, are now required to be classified as deficient.



- 39 -
105.        External auditors.  The SBS has established a register of
qualified auditors, which must be used by banks. In addition, a circular has
been issued requiring auditing companies to present 1991 audit results to the
SBS.
106.        Refinancing loans. A new category "refinanced loans," has been
introduced for classification purposes. All refinanced loans fall into this
category, except those where the borrower agrees to clear interest payments
and at least ten per cent of overdue capital upon refinancing.
107.        Regulatcons complementary to banklng law.  The Superintendency has
issued a series of regulations necessary to enforce the banking law, including
establishing (i) reporting requirements for bank shareholders with more than
4 per cent of capital, and economic groups related to management of a
financial entity, (ii) rules for the assessment of required collateral when
banks exceed the 5 per cent credit concentration guideline, (iii) sanctions
for banks reporting late to the Superintendency, (iv) reporting requirements
on credits exceeding 5 per cent of net worth, (v) reporting requirements on
financial indicators, and (vi) rules identifying assets to be weighted as high
risk under the risk weighted capital adequacy guideline.
108.       Iulementation of the New Refdlatorv Framework.  Improved
enforcement of prudential requirements by the SBS is necessary in both the
short- and long-term to identify and either rehabilitate or eliminate
insolvent institutions. In the short-term an improved evaluation of the
solvency of the system is of critical importance not only because it has borne
severe strains during the recent period of macroeconomic adjustment, but also
because of the need to devise policies towards banks for which transparent,
high quality information on the solvency of the financial system is required.
In the long-term better banking supervision will promote increased confidence
in the financial system.
109.        A proposal for restructuring the $BS, which addresses
organization, optimal staffing levels, skill mix and training, computer
equipment and software, and the rewriting of procedures and manuals has been
developed. The IDB is supporting this proposal with technical assistance
funds as part of its March 1992 financial sector reform loan. As the
restructuring process could be lengthy, the SBS needs to improve its capacity
to undertake banking supervision in the short-term and to evaluate the current
solvency of the financial system.  For this purpose, the SBS, supported by
IDB technical assistance funds, is creating a special supervision team, whose
main function is to evaluate the condition of banks. The team will be
composed of experts with extensive international experience, as well as
inspectors and analysts from the SBS, guided by internationally accepted
prudential regulations, to collect and analyze liformation on the commercial
banks and improve the consistency and quality of the reports submitted by
financial institutions. The team will evaluate fifteen banks' portfolios in
1992, including a classification of the portfolio, the adequacy of loan-loss
reserves, and an assessment of the capital adequacy of each bank, and
recommend intervention when necessary.



- 40 -
110.        Requirements for loan signing requires
(a)   Uniform legal standards to continue to be applied to all
bank., including foreign banks, continued broadening of
banks' scope of activities through universal type banking,
and maintained abolition of directed credit;
(b)   Continuation of program of prudential regulations; and
(c)   SBS to conduct, with the support of external experts with
international experience, off-site evaluation of all banks
and on-site inspection of at least 15 banks' loan
portfolios. SBS to intervene in cases of insolvency.
111.        Conditions for second tranche release ares
(a)   Maintenance of policies under "loan signing."  Establishment
of deposit insurance scheme;
(b)   Completion of program of prudential regulations;
(c)   Completion of restructuring of the SBS; and
(d)   0ff-site evaluation and on-site inspection by SBS to be
based on final completed program of prudential regulations,
including those in 1991 banking law. SBS to intervene in
cases of insolvency.
Canital Markets and Pension Funds
112.        The development of the capital market has been hampered by
macroeconomic instability, insufficient demand for long-term funds (for
productive investment) and the virtual absence of institutional investors.
The existing capital market is small and fragmented, has weak supervision and
investor protection, and lacks liquidity. Moreover, stock prices are highly
volatile, with trading concentrated in a handful of stock and controlled by a
half dozen leading brokers.
113.        The Capital Markets Law of 1991 (Decree 755) attempts to remedy
these systemic weaknesses. It strengthens the Securities' Commission, giving
it financial autonomy and stronger supervisory and regulatory authority over
the stock exchanges and all market intermediaries. The law also Improves
disclosure requirements and investor protection for all public issues of
securities, liberalizes all fees and commissions, sets criteria for over-the-
counter trading and sets out the legal framework and investment rules for
mutual funds. The law requires no implementation regulations, except for ad
hoc regulations to establish mutual funds and incorporate credit-rating
agencies. These special regulations are being drafted by a task force.



- 41 -
114.        The law derives much of its significance from the fact that it
complements Decree 724 on pension-fund reform (see below). For instance,
Decree 755 provides for credit rating and Decree 724 sets the framework of
investment classification commission for pension funds. This complementarity
shows that action to strengthen the institutional and supervisory framework of
the capital market is designed to prepare the ground for future inflows of
institutional investments once the new pension funds are introduced. As the
market gradually adapts to this new legal environment, and provided economic
stabilization progresses successfully, an increasing volume of new issues and
secondary trading can be expected.
115.        Besides revising the legal and regulatory framework for the
capital market, the government is taking much needed steps to overhaul the
state social-security system (IPSS). To deal with IPSS' virtual insolvency,
the government will cut staff, simplify benefit formulas and introduce easier
payment methods. The government is also strengthening the supervision of IPSS
and will impose penalties for contribution evasion. The IPSS reform is being
supported by the SAL.
116.        More important st 1l, the government will abolish IPSS' monopoly
on pensions and introduce pr tate pension plans. Legislative Decree 724
(November 1991), which sets the outline of the new pension system, is largely
modelled on Chile's 1980 pension reform.  Once implemented, Decree 724 will
establish independent private pension funds to which workers can freely
transfer from the present IPSS. As in Chile, each fund will be managed by a
separate Administradora de Pondo de Pensiones (APP). The outcome of the
reform should be better retirement benefits and coverage of invalidity and
survivor benefits, than is currently provided by IPSS. Implementation of the
Decree will require appropriate implementation regulations; these are now
being drafted.
117.        Under the reformed system, workers would be free to either remain
in the IPSS or transfer to a fund of their choice. Workers transferring will
be furnished with a "recognition bond" (a government liability) that
represents IPSS' accrued obligations to the worker. Private pension funds are
required to maintain individual accounts, will be subject to prudential
supervision by a Superintendency of AFPs, a financially autonomous agency with
broad regulatory powers, and will have to obey investment selection criteria
drawn up by a commission. The pension funds will be financed by a compulsory
contribution from members (equivalent to 8 per cent of wages), additional
voluntary contributions, and transfer of accumulated IPSS contributions, if
any.
118.        Current estimates are that the fiscal impact of honoring IPSS
obligations to future retirees and the workers who transfer to the private
system will average between 1.7 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP per year over
the next 50 years. This is quite low by comparison with Chile's experience.
Leaving aside deferral of the fiscal burden through the issue of recognition
bonds, there will be a l per cent "solidarity contribution" to IPSS by
employers. The remaining financing gap, if any, will have to be covered with
a combinatLon of taxes and additional employee contributions. The preferable



- 42 -
alternative would be to cover IPSS' financing gap with government bonds. But,
at present that option is excluded as the market is unwilling to accept long-
term government instruments.
119.        Once implemented, the new pension system is likely to provide
better and more reliable retirement benefits, help stave off a total collapse
of IPSS (by helping cover some of its financing gap with solidarity
contributions) and supply much needed contractual savings to stimulate
activity in the capital market. However, experience in Chile shows that the
transition from a state monopoly to a dual state/private pension system is a
complex task. Thus, it will take time and technical and institutional support
before contractual savings from the private pension funds trigger the desired
growth of the domestic capital market. More particularly, the success of the
pension-fund reform and its contribution to capital-market development will
largely depend on success in maintaining its economic stabilization program
and in its ability to regain credibility.
120.        For loan signing the government will:
(a)  Adopt an action plan for the implementation of Decree 755,
satisfactory to the Bank;
(b)   Adopt enabling regulations to make Decree 724 effective,
including the setting up of investment guidelines for
private pension funds; and
(c)   Initiate work to make the Superintendency of APPs
operational.
121.        For second tranche release:
(a)   Full implementation of Decree 755, through issuance of
necessary enabling regulations. Measures to remain in place
to permit freely functioning securities market;
(b)   Issuance by IPSS of recognition bonds to members who switch
to private pension funds; and
(c)   Superintendency of AFPs to be operational.
VIII. APPRAISAL OF THt REFORM PROGRAM AND RISKS
122.        PerG's financial sector reform strategy is comprehensive and well-
sequenced. The removal of controls over interest rates, exchange rates and
the abolition of directed credit as well as the opening up of capital markets
have created the basis for an efficient, well-functioning financial system.
The reform program for 1992-93 provides for the withdrawal of the state from



- 43 -
financial sector activities by the closure of the loss-making development
banks, the reduction in the scale of Banco de la Naci6n operations and removal
of its monopoly, and privatization of public commercial banks that account for
23 per cent of the banking market. The Banking Law of 1991 creates a rational
and well-devised regulatory environment. The permitting of private pension
funds and regulatory changes under the new Capital Markets Law will over time
lead to a vigorous capital market.
123.        Pero is well placed to implement this ambitious reform strategy.
It has maintained fiscal control, with the budget being balanced on a cash
basis and the quasi-fiscal deficit has been all but eliminated. The level of
domestic public debt is extremely low; thus, the reform is not threatened by a
potential build up of quasi-fiscal deficits as in other countries. As noted,
interest rates have been freed and capital markets liberalized. Yet risks
remain. Broad economic, political, and implementation risks were discussed in
Chapter III. The persistence of an overvalued sol and still-high real
interest rates have squeezed corporate cash flow and profitability and hence
worsened the corporate sector's capacity to service debt. The consequence is
some deterioration in the quality of banks' portfolios. (The auditing
exercise currently underway will quantify the overall state of the portfolio.)
However, it should be noted that the high inflation of the 1988-90 period had
eroded corporate debt significantly in real terms. Similarly, inflation and
associated disintermediation had led to a shrinkage of banks' balance sheets
and to an improvement in capital-asset ratios.
124.        Risks also arise in the transitional phase of moving from a
sheltered banking system to a more competitive and an internationally open
one. This places greater burdens on the skills of bankers, especially in
credit analysis. But skills and technology will be imported as foreign
participation rises. As improved supervision and regulation is phased in over
1992 and 1993, risks will be better monitored and managed. Finally, the
attainment of a stable macroeconomic environment with low rates of inflation
and sustainable real interest and exchange rates will greatly mitigate risks.
IX. THiL PROPOSED LOAN
Description
125.        A loan in the amount of US$400 million is proposed in support of
Pert's program of financial sector reform.  The loan would be quick-disbursing
and divided into two tranches: the first (US$300 million) will be made
available following the signing of the loan and fulfillment of effectiveness;
the second (US$100 million) will be disbursed upon the fulfillment of further
specified conditions. Consistent with current Bank policies for countries in
non-accrual status but which are demonstrating a record of cooperation with
the Bank, this loan is being presented to the Board. Provided Per6
(i) maintains a satisfactory record of macro and sectoral policy
implementation (including conditions specified in Chapters V, VI and VII and



- 44 -
Annexes I and II); (ii) the external financing plan is adhered to and current
debt service payments to the Bank are honoredt and (iii) the stock of arrears
to the Bank are cleared, the loan would be signed. It would be made effective
upon the government having furnished satisfactory evidence that the loan
agreement has been authorized or ratified by all necessary government action.
Arrears are expected A.o be cleared at end-1992. It is envisaged that loan
signing and effectiveness would take place at end-1992. The standard grace
period will be calculated from the time of the loan signature, rather than
Board presontation. The closing date of the loan is proposed to be September
30, 1994.
126.        The loan would support measures taken or planned in the areas of
development banking; reform of the state bank, Banco de la Naci6ni
privatization of commercial banks; banking law and banking supervision; and
capital markets and pension funds. Details of policy measures and tranche
release conditions can be found in Chapters III to VII and Annexes I and II.
Technical Assistance
127.        Technical assistance so far totalling US$440,000 funded from
Japanese grants has supported the development of this loan. In addition, the
Fund and the IDB have also provided technical financial assistance to PerG.
The Bank's assistance has provided the basis for the design and implementation
of reform policies on development banks and on Banco de la Naciln, the
establishment of a strategy for privatization, and the drafting of laws on
securities markets and cit private pension funds. The Banking Law was crafted
from the Bank's detailed recommendations. In all these areas, reports and
recommendations provided by t1.e Bank were extensively used by the authorities
in designing legislative or re, ilatory changes.
Cooueration with the Fund and ID&
128.        In accordance with Bank policy on countries in non-accrual, staff
have worked closely with the Fund staff in devising the macroeconomic program,
structural adjustment measures, and external financing plan. Given the
importance of financial sector reforms for economic stabilization and growth,
detailed exchanges of views have taken place on all loan components. The =
approved a financial sector adjustment loan in the amount of US$200 million in
March 1992 with conditionality consistent with that proposed under the Bank
loan. Staffs of the Bank and IDB have coordinated their efforts carefully.
The IDB loan proposes similar reform components to the Bank's loai.. The Bank
took the lead in the preparation of the components on reform of Banco de la
Nacion, privatization of commercial banks, reform of capital markets, and
institution of pension funds and IDB conditionality is based on the Bank's
work. The two institutions have casried out independent work on development
banking. The IDB took the lead on banking supervision.



- 45 -
Procur_ment. Disbursement. Audit and Administration
129.        The proposed loan would be used in its entirety to finance
100 per cent of the c.i.f. costs of eligible imports, as normally defined
under Bank policy-based lending. Two factors affecting procurement and
disbursement are worthy of note. First, given the Bank's planned
disbursements in December 1992, the expected level of IDB lending, and
bilateral aid for 1992 -- with the three totalling US$1.9 billion -- the
proportion of Perfi's total imports subject to disbursement and procurement
procedures similar to those of the Bank will be high. Total imports are
projected at about US$3.8 billion in 1992. Second, effectiveness will take
place considerably after the initiation of the policy reform process supported
by the loan. Under these circumstances, retroactive financing from August 8,
1990 of eligible imports for the entire first tranche is recommended.
130.        A Country Procurement Assessment Report prepared by the Bank in
September 1991 noted that the laws and decrees governing the procurement
procedures followed by both public and private sector importers were in broad
conformity with the Bank's procurement guidelines. In addition, the annual
budget law provides that goods and works financed by international financial
institutions will be procured in accordance with the requirements of these
institutions.
131.        The following procurement procedures would apply:
(a)   Contracts for the procurement of imports made by public and
private importers valued at or exceeding US$5 million would
be procured under simplified ICB procedures in accordance
with Bank procurement guidelines. Imports of petroleum
products and commodities such as wheat, corn, sugar, etc.,
would be purchased under competitive procedures acceptable
to the Bank. In addition, direct contracting would be
acceptable if it is in accordance with the requirements of
paragraph 3.5 of the procurement guidelines.  Contracts
below US$5,000 would not be eligible for Bank financing;
(b)   Public sector imports valued at below US$5 million and above
US$5,000 would be procured in accordance with local norms
which have been assessed as acceptable to the Bank in the
Country Procurement Assessment Report of September 1991; and
(c)   Import contracts by private importers below US$5 million and
above US$5,000 would be awarded in accordance with
established commercial practices, which are acceptable to
the Bank. These practices generally consist of inviting
more than one quotation, except for importers of small
amounts of consumer goods, who generally buy from
traditional sources using direct negotiation.



- 46 -
132.        Disbursements for contracts under US$5 million would be made
against statements of expenditure for which the relevant procurement
documentation would be kept locally for supervision by the Bank staff in the
field and for auditors whose terms of reference for auditing would be
acceptable to the Bank.
133.        The Ministry of Economy and Finance would administer the loan and
be responsible for submitting the relevant documentation for disbursement. To
fulfill this task, the Ministry has established a Coordinating Unit to ensure
compliance with loan conditions, prepare disbursement requests, supervise
consultancies, and fulfill reporting requirements to the Bank.
134.        To assist in the preparation of disbursement requests, the
Ministry and the Central Bank have, in conjunction with the Customs
Administration, created a Special Procurement Unit responsible for the
collection of relevant procurement documentation, ensuring that only eligible
and correctly procured imports are included in withdrawal applications. This
documentation would be retained for review, as required, by the Bank and the
auditors.
135.        Letter of Development Policy.   The basis for this loan is
provided by a letter of development policy (Annex I). Given the context of
Peru's workout, which envisages several adjustment projects and a performance
period that separates Board presentation from loan signature, this letter goes
beyond the normal scope of a letter of sector policy and constitutes the
understanding between the government and the Bank at the time of Board
presentation on the conditions and criteria upon which the proposed loan
agreement can be signed and made effective.
136.        Conditions for Board Presentation.  Consistent with the Bank's new
policy on countries in non-accrual demonstrating a record of cooperation with
the Bank (see pars. 1), the following Board presentation conditions have been
met:
(a)   A stabilization and adjustment program is in place and is
being supported by the Bank and the Fund (Chapter II).
(b)   An external financing plan (Chapter IV), agreed among the
international financial institutions and bilateral
governments, which would provide for full clearance of
arrears to the Bank is in place;
(c)   Agreement on financial sector reform policies and measures
(Chapters V to VII and Annexes I and II) have been reached;
and
(d)   PerC is current on its servicing of debt to the Bank
currently falling due.



- 47 -
137.        Conditions of Loan $iMning and Effectiveness.  Consistent with the
Bank's new policy, loan signing and effectiveness conditions would be as
follows:
Sianina:
(a)   Prior clearance of arrears to the Bank;
(b)   Compliance, during the performance period, with the Bank and
Fund supported program of stabilization and adjustment;
(c)   The continued viability of an external financing plan; and
(d)   Compliance, during the performance period, with the agreed
conditionality on financial sector reforms.
Effectiveness:
(a)  Taking of all governmental actions required to authorize
(or, if necessary, to ratify) signing of the loan agreement;
and
(b)   If a time lapse were to occur between signing and these
actions, continued satisfactory implementation of the
financial sector reform and macroeconomic stabilization
programs and the external financing plan, in accordance with
the provisions of the letter of development policy.
X. RECOMMENDATION
138.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the loan.

LETTER OF FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Limas May 13, 1992
Mr. Lewis T. Preston
Preoident
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Preston:
1.          The Government of Per6i has embarked upon an ambitious program of
reform of the financial sector with the objectives of reducing the role of the
state in financial intermediation, providing incentives for establishment of
efficient, distortion-free private markets, and placing prudential regulation
on a rational basis. We consider this reform program to be essential to the
consolidation of the current stabilization effort and to securing growth on a
sustainable basis. In support of this program, the government requests a
financial sector reform loan in the amount of US$400 million equivalent from
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development under the Bank's new
policies towards countries in protracted arrears that are demonstrating a
record of cooperation with the Bank.
2.          In support of this request this letter with attached Appendix
(which should be considered an integral part of this letter) describes:
-     the government's stabilization efforts and medium-term
adjustment program;
-     the external financing plan for 1991-92 agreed with major
creditors;
-     the objectives of the financial sector reform program, the
measures taken and to be taken, highlighting the precise
conditions the government is committed to fulfilling during
the period of the program; and
-     the process, general conditions and timetable by which the
loan would be presented to the IBRD's Board, subsequently
signed and-made effective.
Current Stabilization Efforts and the Medium-Term Adiustment Proara
3.          When the present government came to power in July 1990, PerGi was
confronted with a severe economic and social crisis. Inflation ran at



- 50 -
ANNEX I
Page 2 of 14
36,000 per cent, investment and exports had collapsed, and per-capita income
had reached a 30-year low. The social pressures stemming from severe
macroeconomic disequilibria were exacerbated by an intensification of violence
snd terrorism. The qconomic crisis resulted from a combination of massive
fiscal deficits, wage and price controls, highly distorted multiple exchange
rate system, and negative real interest rates. Recognizing the urgency of
restoring a sound economy, the new government launched the first stage of a
bold program of stabilization in August 1990. Notable corrective measures
were a tight control over public sector wages and public employment, a sharp
increase in public sector prices to reflect realistic cost levels, and the
creation of a cash management committee, which, by limiting expenditures to
available cash revenues, eliminated the non-financial public budget deficit.
The government effectively lifted controls over interest rates and unified the
exchange rate under a free floating regime. Tight monetary policies were
pursued. In March 1991, the Government consolidated the stabilization program
by launching structural reforms in trade, financial, and labor market reforms
and authorizing widespread privatization.
4.          The government's economic program for 1991 and 1992 centers on the
maintenance of fiscal and monetary discipline. This program has been
developed in detail in close consultation with staff of the Bank and the Fund.
It is being supported by the Bank's three adjustment loans presented to its
Board in 1992 as well as by the Fund's rights accumulation program. To this
end, the government is targeting an increase in tax revenues to 9 per cent of
GDP in 1992 through determined implementation of recently approved tax
reforms, and a further strengthening of the tax and customs administrations.
Central government expenditures are projected at 13.2 per cent of GDP in 1992,
including an increase in central government capital expenditures from 1.3 per
cent of GDP in 1991 to 2.8 per cent of GDP. The overall public sector deficit
will increase by 1.4 per cent of GDP mainly reflecting higher investment in
infrastructure and social programs, made possible by additional foreign
financial flows. The current account deficit of the nonfinancial public
sector will be reduced further from an estimated 0.8 per cent of GDP in 1991
to 0.4 per cent of GDP in 1992. In combination with the expected net external
financing, this should enable the nonfinancial public sector to offset the
quasi-fiscal deficit, ensuring no net domestic borrowing by the consolidated
(financial and nonfinancial) public sector during 1992. In accordance with
the projected increase of money supply required to purchase foreign exchange
reserves and to service the external debt of the Central Bank, the program
targets an average monthly inflation rate of 5 per cent for the second half of
1991, and a monthly average of 2.7 per cent for 1992, with inflation at end-
1992 approaching international rates.
5.          The government recognizes that the success of its stabilization
policy requires not only cuts in spending and a tightening of credlt but also
significant increases in tax revenues from extremely low levels of tax
pressure. To achieve the latter objective, the government has considerably
simplified the tax system and taken drastic measures to improve tax
administration. The government is also determined to maintain the tax



- 51 -
ANNEX I
Page 3 of 14
contribution of petroleum sector in real terms and adjust public sector prices
in line with expected inflation.
6.          In order to contain inflationary pressures, the current
stabilization plan entails eliminating domestic financing of the overall
public sector deficit. The removal of interest rate controls is expected to
boost financial savings and improve the efficiency of its allocation. In
general, the financial system will increasingly be subject to market forces.
The sol will continue to float freely in foreign exchange markets with limited
intervention.
7.          The government considers that structural teforms will reinforce
the credibility and effectiveness of the stabilization program and is in close
consultation with the Bank in the design of the reform package.   The foremost
objectives of the trade reform are to remove the import substitution bias and
induce a more efficient use of domestic resources. This program is also
expected to provide an impetus to technological advance. The elimination of
multiple exchange rates has been x major step in this direction by eliminating
the implicit differential import tariffs. Both current and capital account
transactions have been greatly liberalized. The government will maintain the
convertibility of the sol at a unified rate. The government has also moved
towards more uniform tariff structure by reducing considerably the number of
different rates. By March 1991, only two rates of 15 and 25 per cent were in
effect, with the former rate covering as much as 81 per cent of tariff
positions.
8.          The key objective of fiscal reforms is the strengthening of
revenues. To this end, public sector prices were adjusted and the tax system
improved. Corrective measures taken to contain expenditures include a
combination of tight controls upon public sector wages and the postponement of
public investments. The government is improving the efficiency of its tax
administration.   The tax administration agency will Improve the quality of
its personnel and modernize its equipment. These rhanges will facilitate the
envisaged monitoring of a larger sample of taxpayers. The program is
reforming the public sector, redefining the scope of government activities and
changing policies related to its personnel management.
9.          The considerable interest that the government places in the social
component of reforms arises from two factors. First, standards of living have
deteriorated very fast in the past five years hence compounding the structural
poverty and skewed income distribution. Second, the adjustment from an
unsustainable economic situation, more often than not, has a significant
social cost. For this reason, we understand the need to design policies to
protect the most vulnerable groups. Furthermore, this will ensure the
political sustainability of the reforms. To this end, the government has
created the National Fund for Social Compensation and Development to channel
resources to labor intensive projects targeted to the poorest segment of the
population including in the areas of basic health and education services.

10.         In the context of the structural adjustment loan, the government
will develop a poverty alleviation strategy and implementation schedule,
outlining policies, identifying priority programs for target groups. As far
as primary health and nutrition are concerned, the government will design and
submit to the Bank profiles for priority projects, prepare a national
nutrition policy, and review the existing food aid program in order to
undertake the first stage of its reform. Priority projects for basic
education also need to be identified with a corresponding implementation
schedule.
11.         Privatization is expected to directly contribite to the
stabilization program through revenue increases, reduction in the burden of
managing public enterprises, and, most importantly, by efficiency gains
realized by an expanding private sector. In March 1991, the president
established the procedures for the privatization of 23 companies in a wide
range of sectors. This was followed by a legislative decree defining the
legal and ir3titutional framework for the overall privatization program. In
order to facilitate the privatization process, a Commission under the direct
supervision of the President was created. We shall develop and begin to
implement an action plan for the privatization of fourteen enterprises in
mining, industry, fishing and communications in 1992. Additioual reforms will
consist of setting regulatory frameworks for specific sectors.
12.         The agricultural sector has greatly benefitted from the
unification of the exchange rate as well as the liberalization and
deregulation of all domestic and foreign trade. In line with its commitment
to rely on market mechanisms, the government has abolished a state-owned rice
marketing monopoly, and land has been allowed to be transferred and used as
collateral. In addition, credit granted by the Banco Agrario has been
eliminated. The agricultural sector will finance itself through use of
commercial banks. However, the Government will create a limited fund out of
fiscal revenues directed at small farmers in remote areas not served by
commercial banks. The government plans to reform agricultural institutions
with more activities being shifted to the private sector.
13.         A more flexible system of labor regulation is a prerequisite for
the expected gains in resource allocation in the goods market to materialize.
The restrictiveness of labor market regulations in Pera has artificially
raised the effective cost of labor in the formal sector hence contributing to
the shifting of resources towards the informal sector and impeding
international competitiveness. In order to increase the flexibility of labor
markets, the government has substantially relaxed the prohibition on fixed-
term contracts. Exit policy has been greatly liberalized.
The External Pinancina Plan
14.         At end-1990, PerG's external debt stood at US$22 billion of which
two-thirds was in arrears. The government, with the support of its major
creditors, has put in place a three-stage debt work-out. The first stages



- 53 -
ANNEX I
Page 5 of 14
which entails the eventual clearance of arrears with multilateral creditors,
has already been put into effect. The government took prompt steps to restore
relations with the multilaterals by resuming current debt service payments to
the Bank in October 1990 and to the IDB in November 1990.  Payments to the
Fund, reinitiated in September 1989, were maintained.
15.         The second stage was initiated in September 1991 with rescheduling
of bilateral debt at the Paris Club. The final stage covers commercial bank
and suppliers' debt and negotiations will be initiated shortly. The success
of the overall financing plan rests on four key factors. First, PerO's
continued compliance with its economic program. Second, PerG'ls maintenance of
current debt service payments to multilaterals. Third, the support group
should disburse the financing agreed to cover the 1991-92 economic program.
Fourth, Per6 abiding by the terms of the 1991 Paris Club rescheduling.
16.         The clearance of arrears to the IDB took place in September 1991.
The financing of this clearance helped by the disbursement of a US$325 million
loan to Per6 from the Latin American Reserve Fund (FLAR). In September, the
IDB approved a trade sector adjustment loan of US$425 million, and in March
1992 a financial sector loan of US$200 million. Also in September 1991, the
Fund approved a 16-month rights accumulation program to support Per6' s
adjustment program. Provided the macroeconomic targets of the program are met
and other policy commitments adhered to, this scheme will allow Pero to build
up "rights" towards a purchase equivalent to the stock of arrears to the Fund
(SDR 624 million). We expect that the Bank's contribution to external
financing will be made under the new policy for countries with protracted
arrears using three adjustment loans covering: trade, structural adjustment
and the financial sector.
17.         PerG has obtained significant debt relief from its Paris Club
creditors. The September 1991 rescheduling opened the way for disbursements
of Support Group commitments totalling US$1.3 billion, of which US$700 million
was in the form of balance of payments financing. Further reschedulings
beyond 1992 will be necessary. It is also clear that without greatly enhanced
debt relief from the Paris Club (outright debt reduction, drastic lowering of
interest rates, shift in cut-off date), external financing requirements beyond
1992 cannot be met.
18.         Pero has entered into discussions with its commercial bank
creditors which could lead to negotiations later this year. However, we
believe that, under the current circumstances, debt service payments to
commercial creditors are not feasible. For this reason, the economic program
assumes that no payments on medium- and long-term debt to these creditors will
be made, except for short-term trade credits and non-guaranteed private
creditors which Per6i is expected to service fully. The government is
determined to create a favorable environment for nprivate long term canital
inflows and is taking steps to encourage inflows of capital and technology,
particularly in the development of mineral and petroleum resources. To this
end, the government has decided to move expeditiously to resolve some of the



- 54 -
ANNEX I
Page 6 of 14
outstanding problems mainly arising from past nationalizations. The support
of the World Bank Group for these policies and initiatives will be essential
in order to create a more propitious environment for private business and
investment.
Financial Sector Reforms
19.         The government considers its program of financial sector reforms
to be an essential element of its attempt to modernize the economy, increase
efficiency in investment and the use of savings, and to lay the foundations
for sustained growth. Without strengthened financial intermediation,
efficient allocation and use of resources will prove elusive. Decades of
misallocation resulting from interest rate controls, directed credit, and
arbitrary taxes and subsidies on loans and deposits have to be replaced by a
market oriented system with minimal state participation.
20.         Our strategy rests on four pillars:
(i)   the promotion of competition;
(ii)  the removal of distortions to pricing, allocation and
incentives;
(iii) the disengagement of the state as a provider of financial
services; and
(iv)  establishing an efficient regulatory framework.
21.         Upon taking office, the government promptly removed three key
distortions: interest rate ceilings were rendered non-binding; thus, loans
and deposits in both local and foreign currency are freely priced by the
market; the exchange rate vas unified and the sol allowed to float; and
directed credit was abolished. Interest rate subsidies (mainly for export
credit and lending to farmers and to small enterprises) were ended. Central
Bank credit lines to public banks were abolished. Strict limits were placed
on short term lending by the Central lank to commercial banks. Taxes on bank
cheques and bank debits, though distortionary, were retained, but now have
been temporarily suspended. They will be abolished as soon as fiscal
conditions permit.
22.         The government promulgated a wide ranging banking law in early
1991 that permits universal type banking, applies uniform legal standards for
all banks (including foreign banks), establishes a risk-weighted capital
adequacy guideline (based on international standards), credit concentration
limits and other prudential requirements.
23.         The reform stratefv for 1992 and 1993 and the specific policy
steps that the goverment intends to take are elaborated below and are
codified in Appendix I to this letter.

Page 7 of 14
24.         Develo9ment bankint.  The four sector development banks have been
a prime cause of resource misallocation and inefficiency. These banks have
used Central Bank credit lines and deposits from the public to extend loans of
dubious credit quality and, in consequence, loan recovery rates have been very
poor. The banks now have been declared insolvent and the Superintendency has
intervened; operations of the banks have ceased. The government will not
permit operations to be reinitiated. Highly limited lending or extension of
grants or guarantees fully financed out of budgetary resources will be
permitted to take place, with small farmers in remote areas being loan
recipients. We intend to limit such lending to a range of US$50-100 million
in 1992, and thereafter to reduce fiscal support to agricultural lending.
25.         All second-tier lending will be confined to either Cofide, the
existing multisector public investment finance corporation, or to a newly
established institution. Such an institution will engage exclusively in
second-tier activities, and will accept no deposits. It will be adequately
capitalized and appropriately staffed.
26.         The staff of the four development banks stood at 11,500 at mid-
1990. We are implementing a plan of reduction of staff. Total staff will be
reduced to a maximum of 1500 at end-1992. By end-1993 a further substantial
reduction of staff will take place, such that the number of personnel
remaining will be no greater than that required for implementing the
liquidation plan, and for the limited agricultural lending. Public deposits
will be shifted to private commercial banks and the loan portfolio sold off to
the private sector. Losses will be valued and paid for out of public
resources. The government will devise an action plan to put these measures
into effect. Cofide will refrain from first-tier lending activities. The
staff strength of Cofide has been reduced from 750 at mid-1990 to 280 at
present, and further reductions will take place in line with our decision on
the eventual role of Cofide.
27.         Banco de la Nacion. The functions of this bank comprise the
provision of monopoly banking services to the entire public sector, the
administration of a large banking network, and acting as the external
financial agent of the government. The bank is a high cost institution,
greatly overstaffed at 7000 persons, and inefficient as a financial
intermediary as it does not use market tests for the allocation and pricing of
credit. Its operations can be farmed out to commercial banks or to the
Central Bank.
28.         We shall remove the monopoly powers of this bank by permitting
private banks entry into the public enterprise business. Similarly, tax
collection and payments out of government accounts will take place through
private commercial banks or directly with the tax authority. The Treasury
will maintain its main account with the Central Bank, which shall also act as
the external financial agent of the government. Credit to public enterprises
will be extended by the market or through specific fiscal allocation -- this



- 56 -
ANNEX I
Page 8 of 14
will help public enterprises restructure or privatize. These steps will lead
to an elimination of the wasteful, duplicative functions of the bank and to a
drastic reduction in its scale of operations. We intend to adopt an action
plan to put into effect the reform strategy described above and then to
proceed promptly with the gradual implementation of the plan.
29.         Privatizat40n.  The Government intends to privatize all wholly-
owned banks (Popular Group, Interbanc, Continental and its various regional
banks) and sell its shares in the partly-owned banks, thereby withdrawing
entirely from commercial banking. Detailed discussions have been held with
the Bank on the appropriate privatization strategy. We intend to sell Banco
Popular Group and Banco de Comercio over the next six months, and the
remaining banks over the next 12 to 18 months. By end-1992, the government
will have authorized the sale of either Continental or Interbanc and will have
issued the offer for valuation. We expect that this sale will be executed in
the course of 1993. By end-1993, we will have prepared the sale of the
remaining bank and issued the offer for valuation. We will have developed
also a plan for the sale of the regional banks and the divestiture of other
minority state holdings in banks. Privatization will not only lead to
efficiency gains, but also to revenues that will be used to support public
investment.
30.         Bankina suDervision.  The banking law (described earlier) will be
phased in steadily over 1992-93 and the strengthened prudential regulations
stringently enforced. The banking sector will be better prepared for the more
competitive climate that lies ahead. The Superintendency of Banking (SBS)
will issue further regulations and guidelines required for sharper monitoring
of bank behavior. The SBS will carry out a rapid program of bank inspections
that is much needed to evaluate capital adequacy. The SBS itself will be
restructured as to personnel and equipment to be better prepared to implement
the banking law. A deposit insurance scheme is being established.
31.         Capital markets.  The government realizes the potential of
securities markets for the efficient channelling of savings and has passed a
law (Ley de Mercado de Valores - Decree 755) to strengthen supervision,
investor disclosure and protection, liberalize trading and market entry, and
set criteria for over the counter trading. This will permit the market to
issue and trade greater volumes of equity, including issues associated with
privatization. It will also facilitate the issuance of debt securities. In
addition, Decree 755 provides for the creation of risk-rating agencies and for
mutual funds.
32.         The government is also in the process of removing the IPSS
monopoly over pension funds. The regulatory and supervision environment for
private pension funds is being set up and regulations for Decree 724 (the
legal framework for pension-fund reform) are being drafted. These private
funds should be operational by end 1992 and will be potentially large sources
of long-term contractual savings in capital markets.

The Reguested Loan In the Context of Outatandint Arrears to the Bank
33.         The government recognizes that the -tresentation to the Board of
the requested loan requires that the following conditions be met: (i) the
adherence to the economic program that is being supported by Bank adjustment
lending and Fund rights accumulation; (ii) the implementation of the agreed
external financing plan; (iii) adherence to the program of financial sector
reforms as described in this letter; and (iv) Per6 remaining current on its
servicing of debt to the Bank currently falling due on terms already agreed
between the government and the Bank.
34.         The government acknowledges that in assessing the adjustment
program, the Bank will be using the following indicators for 1992: central
government tax revenues should not fall short of 9.0 per cent of GDP; the
primary deficit of the non-financial public sector should not exceed 0.6 per
cent of GDP with no domestic financing of the consolidated public sector
balance; during 1992 the rate of expansion of monetary base should not exceed
40 per cent and at end-1992 the stock of other Central Bank monetary
'liabilities in soles should not exceed 10 per cent of the monetary base.
35.         The government is fully aware that the loan will not be eligible
for sisnature unless: (i) it is approved by the Board; (ii) the stock of
arrears to the Bank is cleared; and (iii) the macroeconomic and financial
sector reform program as well as the external financing plan and current debt
service payments to the Bank (as elaborated in Appendix I of this letter) are
adhered to. Loan signature is expected to take place at end-December 1992.
The government is committed to supplying the Bank with the information
required for program monitoring and reporting to the Board.
conclusion
36.         In light of the policies for stabilization and structural refoms
already implemented and the government's commitment to put in place further
reform measures agreed with the Bank that are described in this letter, the
government requests your favorable consideration of its request for a
financial sector reform loan.
Yours sincerely,
Carlos Bolofia Behr
Minister of Economy and Finance

Notes to Tables 1.1 to 1.4
The projections in this Annex illustrate a feasible path for the
economy under the stabilization and structural reforms initiated by the
Fujimori Government. These notes spell out some assumptions behind the
projections and some definitions of items projected.
I.   Assum=tions for Balance-vt*-Pavments Items (Excluding Debt Servicing and
the Capital Account) and National Accounts
The key country assumptions behind the forecasts in Tables 1.1,
1.3, and 1.4 are as follows:
1.   After three consecutive years of decline, Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) grew by 2.9 per cent during 1991, the rate increasing
steadily to reach 4.5 per cent in 2000 (an average of 3.6 per cent
for the period).
2.  Population is assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent a year up to 1991,
declining to 2.2 per cent by 1997.
3.   Exports of goods and non-factor services are expected, because of
the trade reforms, to be a major contributor to GDP growth. After
an initial increase of only 1.5 per cent in 1991, reflecting the
appreciation of the real exchange rate, export growth will recover
by about 5 per cent during 1992. For the rest of the period,
exports are assumed to grow at an average of 8.6 per cent per year,
increasing their share in GDP from 11 per cent in 1990 to about 13
per cent in 2000.
4.   Similarly, imports of goods and non-factor services, after an
initial increment of about 4 per cent in 1992, are assumed to grow
at an average of about 6.8 per cent between 1993 and 2000, to reach
a level of 13.8 per cent of GDP in 2000 (up from 10.5 per cent in
1990). The net movement of imports and exports would reduce the
current-account deficit from 4.9 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 4.1 per
cent in 2000.
5.   The ratio of investment to GDP is expected to increase from 16 per
cent in 1991 to about 19 per cent in 2000, with an average ratio of
17.4 per cent during this period, a level comparable to other
middle-income economies. During the same period, public gross
capital formation would rise to 4.5 per cent of GDP from 1.8 per
cent.
6.   Between 1991 and 2000, contraction in demand would result in a
growth in consumption of only 2.1 per cent a year, consistent with
an average level of total consumption of 84.1 per cent of GDP.



- 79 -
ANNEX III
Page 9 of 11
However, this expected growth would be enough to allow an increase
in per capita consumption from 1998 onwards.
7.   For the period as a whole, these trends would result in an increase
in domestic savings from 13.1 to 18.5 per cent of CDP. Similarly,
national savings, because of the increasing level of investment and
the improving current-account balance, would increase from 11.1 to
15.2 per cent of GDP.
II. DescriDtion of Line Items in Table 1.2t Balance of Payments (Financint
Reauirements and Possible Sources of Financing)
1.   Non-Interest Current Account Deficit:  from Table 1.1.
2. Debt Service Obligations: estimated publicly guaranteed debt
service obligations to the IBRD, IDB, IMF, and bilateral and
private creditors.
3. Total Arrears: arrears outstanding to the IBRD, IDB, IMP, and
bilateral and private creditors.
4.   Increase in Gross Reserves:  estimated targets for increase in
Central Bank reserves.
5.   Loan Disbursements in Pipeline:  estimated disbursements already in
the pipeline from the 1DB, bilateral creditors, and unguaranteed
private creditors.
6.   Private Caiital Flows: direct foreign investment and funds
repatriated from abroad (includes errors and omissions).
7.   Debt Rescheduling and Deferral:  in 1991 and 1992 all official
bilateral debt is assumed to be rescheduled on the terms secured in
the September 1991 Paris Club negotiations (see below). In 1993
and beyond, pre-cutoff debt service due to the Paris Club of
creditors is assumed to be rescheduled. Other official bilateral
debt is assumed to be serviced.    Private debt service is assumed
to be rescheduled every year for 1991-2000.
The terms of the September 1991 Paris Club agreement are as
follows.

A SUMMARY NOTE ON THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
1.   Structure
PerG's financial system has as main characteristic its deep market
segmentation. The financial institutions offer different services to each
market segment according with the maturity of their assets and liabilities.
The principal institutions are (Table 1):
a)   Banco de la Nacion (BN): is the financial agent of the
Government. Deposits of the central government and of public
enterprises are maintained at the BN. It also assists in tax
collection, foreign trade transactions, and external debt
management. Moreover, it is the largest bank in the system
accounting for almost 37 per cent of total deposits (though
such deposits being public sector deposits are not included in
13) and 54 per cent of total credit;
b)   Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo (COPIDE)s is a second
tier bank intermediating foreign lines of credit;
c)   Development Banks (DB)s were created to ensure a supply of
credit to productive sectors deemed to be particularly
important. Thus, Banco Agrario (BAP) supports agriculture
sector, Banco Industrial (BIP) promotes manufacturing sector,
Banco Minero (BMP) funds mining sector, Banco de la Viviends
(BVP) supports housing sector. These banks account for just 3
per cent of deposits and 11 per cent of the total credits;
d)   Commercial Banks (CB): focus their businesses in the supply of
short-term working capital loans using demand and savings
deposits. Include private and public commercial banks. The
later appeared when the Government decided to bail out private
banks in deep financial problems. Together account for fully
one half of the total deposits and 28 per cent of total
credits. Furthermore, there are regional commercial banks
bounded to operate in their corresponding regions. Foreign
banks have an almost negligible impact in the market. There
is a branch of a foreign bank, another bank is majority
foreign-owned bank, and an additional two have a minority
foreign participation in their ownership. Together these
banks account for a mere 3-4 per cent of the system's deposits
and credits outstanding;
e) Finance Companies (PC): focus in long term financing. Public
and private commercial banks own half of them. Account for 10



- 84 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 8
per cent of total deposits and only 7 per cent of total
lending;
f)   Insurance Companies (IC): sell of insurance and reinsurance.
Many of them are subsidiaries of foreign companies;
g)  Housing Mutualities (10): are savings and loan institutions
aimed to provide mortgage financlng;
h)  Municipal Savings Banks (MSB) : have the goal to decentralize
financial services and depend of their corresponding
municipality;
i)   Rural Saving Banks (RSB)s aimed to promote agricultural
activities. They operate within geographical limits and are
non-profit institutions;
J)   Savings and Loans Cooperatives (SLC)s are non-profit
institutions set vith capital contributions of their
affiliates; and
k)   Storage Companies (SC): storage goods and issue warrants which
are used as collateral in financial transactions. Most of
them are subsidiaries of the commercial banks.
Except SLC, supervised by the National Institute of Coopecatives, the
Superintendency of Banks and Insurance Companies (8BS) regulates all the
institutions.
2.   Financial Deoienina
Over the last eleven years, the real stock of broad money supply
has steadily dwindled, attaining its lowest level in 1990 (see Table 2). The
ratio of broad money to GDP had a similar behavior, rose over the early 1980s,
reaching a peak of almost 20 per cent of GDP in 1983 and 1984, and then
declined 6teadily to 6.8 per cent in 1991, the lowest figure in a decade.
The drop in monetization coincided with the period of negative real
interest rates and high and fluctuating inflation (see text Charts 6 and 7).
Moreover, this disintermediation has produced the following interrelated
trends:
a) Informalization of intermediations financial repression have
given rise to widespread resources mobilization through non-
financial business enterprises;
b)   Shortening of maturitiess at the height of the inflationary
period, loans had a maturity of 3-5 daysg and



- 85 -
ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 8
c)   Dollarizations dollar savings provide protection to high and
volatile inflation. Thus, drop in the real value of domestic
currency meant that dollar deposits were equivalent to 47 per
cent of total liquidity, as of December 1990. As of December
1991, this percentage increased further to 60 per cent,
because the economic agents perceived an important
appreciation in the real exchange rate.
3.   Trends in Resource Mobilization and Fundin_
As of December 1991, analysis of data on sources of funding by type
of financial institutions showed (see Table 3) : i) the influence of
specialization in the mobilization of resources; ii) the large dependence of
development banks on BCR creditil; iii) the low leverage of Banco de la
Nacion and Development Banks; and iv) the relative small role of the public
banks (state banks, public commercial banks, and development banks) in the
interbank market.
4.   Credit Allocation
Table 4 shows the sectoral distribution of credit of the banking
system. State/development banks are excluded because of their specific
sectoral focus. Industry has remained the largest user of credit, absorbing
around 32-47 per cent of the total. This represents roughly twice its share
In GDP.
Geographically, Lima and Callao provinces (see Table 5) absorb
about 83 per cent of all credit. However, these provinces' share in total
banking deposits is smaller, which merus that other regions are transferring
them resources.
5. Receat Zliancial Performance of Financial Institutions
Liauidity: Bank's liquidity was subject to large fluctuations. It
was a factor of actual and expected reserve requirements, interest rates,
exchange rate and inflation. After an initial excess of liquidity, there was a
reduction of this balances due to : an upburst of economic activity, a decline
in nominal interest rates, and devaluation ruors. The liquidity position of
public banks has been very tight since the beginning of the stabilization
program. Furthermore, the tight credit policy of the current Government has
largely reduced the sources of their funds.
11        As of June 1990, Banco Agrario obtained 93 percent of its funds
from this source. Banco Minero and Banco Industrial showed less dependence
largely because financial support came through Central Government's asumption
of their external debt.

Asset Qualitv: Table 6 summarizes asset quality information of
selected financial institutions. These figures were severely distorted by
inflation because highly-negative real interest rates decreased the relative
weight of older loans.
Stateldevelopment banks had the worse loan portfolios. About 18 per
cent of their portfolio classified as doubtful or loss, and 60 per cent was
overdue. In this regard, Banco Agrario's loan performance appeared
reasonable, but account must be taken of the following factorss i) 99 per
cent of its portfolio was in domestic currency, and hence it was exposed to
the effects of high inflation rates; ii) there was a widespread rolling over
of loans; iii) agricultural loans, debt service was repayable upon maturity
and not at regulor installments; and iv) loans were given at very low rates (0
to 25 per cent) in nominal terms so inflation wiped out the debts and
facilitated repayment.
For commercial banks, overall non-performance was about 31 per
cent. This was a very high figure mainly concentrated at Banco Popular, Banco
de Comercio, and Banco del Norte.
Finally, it is important to bear in mind two factors that have been
affecting the quality and structure of banks' portfolios: i) between 1988 and
1990, the accumulated decline in GDP was about 23S; and ii) the steady
appreciation of the domestic currency has prompted a shift to loans in foreign
currency. The latter places additional risk on the soundness of the financial
system because about two thirds of the total credit is in dollar denominated
loans.
Credit Concentrations Banking credit was concentrated to a level
that could induce instability in the financial system and affect asset
quality. For the consolidated financial system (excluding S&Ls) as of April
1990, the top 2 per cent of the borrowers took 54 per cent of all credit and
the top 10 per cent of borrowers took 87 per cent of all credit.
Concentration was particularly high for the public commercial banks (where the
top 2 per cent of borrowers took 59 per cent of credit), and low for finance
companies (where the top 2 per cent of the borrowers took 28 per cent of
credit).
Solvency: Analysis of leverage ratios of all financial
institutions (deposits and financial obligations to net worth), as of June
1990, showed very low levels by international standards. This situation is
due to hyperinflation and the reduction in intermediation which has occurred
in recent years. The average leverage ratio of commercial bank. was 7.5
against a legislated maximum of 20. For finance companies, leverage is even
lower at 5.1. These figures show that most institutions could write off a
large part of their bad assets and remain within the 20:1 leverage ratio.
Nonetheless, there were several institutions (particularly public banks) which
were insolvent. Banco Ninero was book-value insolvent, and Banco Industrial
had a very small net worth which would had become negative if assets had been
valued properly.

Profitabilitp: An evaluation of profitability before the August
1990 stabilization program was only of limited interest because the dramatic
change in the status quo. However, the main factors affecting profitability,
and prevailing trends were: i) large interest rate spreads; ii) foreign
exchange revaluations drove earnings of most banks in recent times; and
iii) remuneration paid on reserve requirements exceeded the bank's financial
Cost of deposits. Of these three factors, only the first one remains in place
as the main source of earnings. As of December 1991, the spread between loans
and deposits in domestic currency was 52 a month or 60S a year. Thus, it is
not surprising that some private banks have already announced major
restructuring aiming to cost slashes.

THE PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF THE BANKING LAW
INTROUION
1.          Before July 1991, the principal laws governing financial sector
activities were the Banking Law (Legislative Decree 469, 1988) and the Bank
Regionalization Law (1987). The 1991 Banking Law (Legislative Decree 637 of
April 1991), effective since July 1, 1991, replaced the 1988 Banking Law. At
the same time the Bank Regionalization Law Was suspended. The Banking Law
applies to all private financial instltutions and state-owned comercial
banks, which were established under private corporate law. The rest of the
institutions operating in the Peruviat financial system, with the exception of
the Central Bank (BCR), are only subje:t to those articles of the Law
referring explicitly to them.
x-  CMPTITIVENESS OF ANS An  FINACE COMPANIES
Bank Powers
2.          According to the previous legislation, medium- and long-term
operations were undertaken by finance companies. Banks could only operate in
the short-term. This limitation imposed on commercial private banks justified
the creation of state owned development banks with the mandate to allocate
long-term credit toward investment projects in priority sectors.
3.          The 1991 Law introduces universal type banking, which allows all
financial institutions to operate in the short-, medium- and long-term, and
broadens their scope of activities beyond financial intermediation. Banks are
now permitted to:
(a)   Issue bonds (including mortgage and subordinated bonds) and
stocks;
(b)   Create and administer mutual fund programs (through
subsidiaries);
(c)   Trade securities and participate in foreign trade
transactions (through subsidiaries);
(d)   Buy and sell stocks; and
(e)   Engage in parallel operations such as leasing, factoring,
and gold trading.

4.         PFiance companies are now permitted to be involved in all
commercial banking activities except accepting demand deposits and engaging in
foreign trade transactVius.
Directed Credi*
5.          The BCR used to require comercial banks to allocate resources to
priority sectors and geographical areas. Banks were usually given the option
of either making deposits in development banks or lending directly to satisfy
these requirements. The 1991 Law eliminates the BCR's mandate to direct
credit. Thus, credit allocation becomes the sole responsibility of bankers,
within the boundaries of prudential requirements such as credit concentration
limits.
Canital Ownersh"i
6.          Banks and finance companies which operate as joint stock companies
are obliged to have at least ten shareholders which are not interrelated,
according to the 1991 Law. Major shareholders, the three shareholders of a
bank or finance company whose individual ownership represents at least 116 of
the capital, are not allowed to own more than 5 per cent of the capital of
another bank or finance company. The SBS must authorize capital transfer.,
and any personal acquisition representing more than 15 per cent of the
capital.
Fore nm Capital
7.          Previous legislation did not establish any regulations regarding
foreign ownership of capital which, in practice, was limited to a maximum of
33 per cent. This ceiling has been lifted by the 1991 Banking Law, which
imposes no restrictions on foreign ownership. Furthermore all the conditions
established by the 1991 Law apply equally to foreign as to national capital.
Bank Crtn
8.          According to previous regulations, the BCR was responsible for
giving authorization to create banks and finance companies. The 1991 Law
delegated this role to the $8S which will make the decision based on the
applicant meeting minimum capital, share ownership and other administrative
and organizational requirements, and after consulting with the BCR. Before
initiating any operations, all financial institutions will have to create a
compulsory deposit of two per cent of their capital at the BCR. This deposit
will be remunerated at the marginal reserve requirement rate and will be then
adjusted for any increases in capital.
Hendline Bank Crises
9.          The 1991 Law clarifies procedures for bank rehabilitation and
liquidation, and provides criteria to reduce discretion in the handling of
bank and finance company crises. It also gives more autonomy in initiating



- 93 -
AX V
Page 3 of 8
penal action for lack of compliance with regulations under its jurisdiction,
and it introduces a 90 day surveillance period to be applied in case of lack
of compliance with capital standards, reserve requirements, credit
concentration limits, short term liquidity and other individual or global
limits monitored by the SBS.
10.         The S8S can intervene in a financial institution at the end of the
surveillance period if no positive results have been achieved or if there is a
loss of more than 50 per cent of the capital. Intervention can be declared as
well for avoiding BCR and S3S dispositions. The 1991 Law reduces intervention
to a 24 hour period, thus not allowing the S8S to get bogged down in the
management of a financial institution, a situation which in the past led to
law suits since previous managers and owners tended to blame the SBS for the
poor performance of the bank.
11.         Prior to the 1991 Banking Law reform, the SBS was given all
responsibility regarding bank liquidations. According to the 1991 Law, the
SBS shares its power to make decisions on banks' liquidation and
rehabilitation with the BCR. The principal SBS function is to supervise and
advise banks about auy possibility of liquidation. The BCR is assigned the
responsibility of naming the liquidators. The rationale for this change is to
get the S8S away from the business of dealing with failed banks so that it
could mainly concentrate on its preventive role.
12.         The BCR can decide to rehabilitate a financial institution in
crisis as an alternative to liquidation, in which case the SBS will design the
implementation process. In the case of rehabilitation subordinated bonds are
required to be converted into capital, and stocks issued and subscribed by the
BCR. Once rehabilitation is finalized and the bank or finance company
complies with the legal capital adequacy ratio, a new Board of Directors is
required to be named.
$I. PRlUDENTIAL R4QIREMENTS
Capital Regamirementp
Minimum Canital Standard
13.         Prior to July 1991, the minimum capital levels required to obtain
a charter to open a financial institution were discretionary and individually
fixed by the SBS. Not subject to any indexation, these levels, in practice,
were very low (normally about US$150,000 for banks).
14.         Revised minimum capital requirements for banks and financial
institutions have been established by the 1991 Lawt soles 3.0 million
(approximately US$3.5 million) for commercial banks and soles 1.3 million
(approximately US$1.5 million) for finance companies. These amounts are



- 94 -
ANNEX V
Page 4 of 8
calculated in ^onstant local currency; they will be automatically subject to
yearly indexation according to the general price index.
Cagital Adequacv Ratio
15.         According to previous legislation, the capital adequacy guideline
for banks was the ratio of liabilities to net worth and its percentage was
fixed by the S8S. In practice, liabilities could reach levels up to 15 and 20
times net worth for finance companies and banks respectively. The inclusion
of off-balance sheet or contingent liabilities was not required.
.6.         The new capital adequacy guideline requires that total assets plus
contingent credits, weighted by their risk level, should not exceed more than
15 times total net worth adjusted by inflation1.
Credit Concentration Limits
17.         The 1988 Banking Law limited the total amount a bank could lend to
an individual or economic group to a maximum of 20 per cent of its total net
worth. This limit could be expanded to 30 per cent with the authorization of
the BCR. No indexation was applied.
18.         The 1991 legislation limits lending to a legal entity, which
includes economic groups and/or individuals, to 5 per cent of net worth
adjusted by inflation. Only under exceptional circumstances can this limit
reach higher levels of up to 15 per cent, as in the case of mortgages, 30 per
cent for example in the case of export credit insurance, and 40 per cent only
if a bank deposit or an ALADI collateral are created for an amount equivalent
to the excess over the credit concentration limit.2 The Law limits lending
to individuals related by ownership or management to a financial institution
(those shareholders owning more than 4 per cent of the capital) to the total
net worth of the financial institution.
III. DEPOSIT PROTECTION
19.         The 1991 Law limits savers' risk by establishing capital adequacy
standards and promoting maintenance of free real interest rates as described
before.
1/          This ratio of 15/1 translates into a 6.7 per cent ratio of capital
to risk-adjusted assets, close to the 8 per cent minimum capital to risk-
adjusted assets established by the Basle Agreement.
21          The 1991 Law allows banks and finance institutions to continue
lending up to a limit of 10 per cent of net worth during a one year period,
followed by a six months period of readjustment after which the new rules will
apply.

ANNEXV
Page 5 of 8
20.         Also, under the 1991 Law, a11 financial institutions are obliged
to publish their financial statements, general balance-sheets and profit and
lose accounts in the official newspaper and in another newspaper of extensive
publication at least four times at year. The SBS is also in charge of
publishing quarterly financial information.
21.         According to the previous legisla'-on, the Constitution was
interpreted as if all deposits were protected by the State and therefore there
was an implicit 100 per cent deposit insurance for all depositors. In the
past no depositors had ever lost any money in liquidated banks.
22.         The 1991 Law introduces a deposit insurance fund which is meant to
protect small depositors. It will guarantee public savings up to a limit of
soles 2500 per depositor and liquidated financial institution, and of soles
5000 per depositor and year, in case of a lack of solvency. These quantities
are calculated in constant values and will be indexed yearly. The main
financial resources of this fund will be an initial BCR contribution, all
premiums paids by all financial institutions,, resources obtained from fines
and sanctions imposed by the SBS, and from other resources, for example from
liquidating financial ifastitutions in crisis. Also in order to make the new
scheme credible, the Treasury will be responsible for lending money to the
Fund if this is required for completing the payoffs to protected depositors.
23.         On March 27, 1992 the Government approved the establishment of a
deposit insurance fund, according to the rules established by the Law, and
created a comission that will be in charge of fixing the yearly premiums to
be paid by member financial institutions.
IV. CENTRAL BANK (BCR) MONETARY POLICY
lnterest Rates
24.         Before the 1991 BAnking Law was enacted, banks and finance
companies were free to fix their deposit and lending interest rates. No clear
adjustment rule was followed. However, as mandated by the Peruvian Civil Code
("Codigo Civil" Art. 1243), the BCR was obliged to fix nominal interest rate
ceilings, for deposit and lending rates, which were applied to both foreign
and domestic currency operations. It used to establish different interest
I/          The yearly premium that every member of the deposit insurance fund
should pay must be established by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. It
should not exceed more than 3/4 per cent of the total deposits.
Al          Except Banco de la Macion, development banks, municipal saving
banks, rural saving banks, saving and loans9cooperatives, and subsidiaries.



- 96 -
Page 6 of 8
rate ceilings according to type of bank and kind of operation, as well as the
commissions added to the interest rate in every financial transaction.
25.         The BCR still retains the ability to control int.erest rate
ceilings. However the 1991 Law points out that real savings should be
promoted under a free financial market, and that no binding ceilings for any
financial institution should be imposed by the BCR.'
26.         In March 1991 the BCR phased out all preferential interest rates
by linking the rediscount rate to market deposit rates. At present, the
rediscount rate applied is higher than the average deposit rate of the banking
system. This policy is intended to avoid BCR quasi-fiscal losses which, in
the past, were caused by preferential rediscount lines given, for example, to
development banks.
Reserve Reauirememts
lffvels
27.         The 1991 Law has not changed the minimum reserve requirement
levels. Minimum reserve requirements are fixed by a 1986 Legislative Decree
at 15 per cent for sight deposits, and 6 per cent for saving and time
deposits. They are applied on the volume of deposits held by each institution
as of 9/15190. Marginal reserve requirements are applied on the excess of
deposits over the volume held on that day. They are established periodically
by BCR resolutions. Before the enactment of the 1991 Banking Law marginal
reserves were 15 per cent for domestic money and 30 per cent for foreign
currency, and some banks were subject to average reserve requirements lower
than others. In particular, state owned development banks, Banco de la
Nscin, state-owned saving banks, and savings and loans had to comply only
with the minimum reserve requirement. In the case of state owned commercial
banks, preferential marginal reserve requirements were mainly oriented towards
protecting regional banks.
28.         In order to achieve monetary policy goals, the BCR, under the 1991
law, is allowed to establish uniform marginal reserve requirements for all
institutions.
29.         Before August of 1990 high levels of legal reserve requirements
had contributed to disintermediation as well as to the rise in lending
interest rates charged by banks. Since that date, reserve requirements have
been kept at relatively lower levels. All BCR regulations in this matter have
S/          In August 1990, with the new economic program, the BCR ceilings
were already placed at non-binding levels for deposit and lending in local
currency, since inflation hp, 'tllen. In the case of dollar operations
binding ceilings for both deposit and lending rates were removed in March
1991.

been oriented towards avoiding the use of reserve requirements as the main
instrument to control money, and the desire to promote open market operations.
30.         This tendency was only temporarily reversed' by the first BCR
regulations introduced after the 1991 Law vent into effect according to which
both marginal reserve requirements on domestic and foreign cuirrency were
raised respectively from 15 per cent to 40 per cent (level reached in August,
1990) and from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. This temporary increase was
intended to sterilize excess money supply due to massive foreign capital
inflows. However, marginal reserve requirements were lowered again to 15 per
cent for sol deposits on October 1, 1991, and to 50 per cent for dollar
deposits on November 1, 1991.
Cciwositin
31.         According to previous BCR regulations, cash could be used only to
comply with minimum reserve requirements. Banks were required to make
deposits at the BCR in order to meet marginal reserve requirements. In some
circumstances, the Government issued legal resolutions obliging financial
institutions to comply with reserve requirements by making deposits in state
owned development banks or buying public bonds.
32.         The 1991 Law establishes that total reserve requirements should be
met by either making deposits at the BCR or by holding cash out of
circulation. After the law's enactment, a new BCR resolution was issued
allowing the use of excess cash to cover marginal reserve requirements, once
the minimum had been covered, if institutions renounced the remuneration rate
that would apply to marginal reserves held in deposits at the BCR.
Remuneration
33.         Before the 1991 Law was enacted, remune;ation on minimum and
marginal reserves was determines' by BCR regulations. From September 16, 1990,
remuneration hsd been applied to 104 per cent of the amount of total reserves
required according to the average ratio. In other words, a 4 per cent excess
over the compulsory average reserve requirement was also remunerated. Any
amount of voluntary reserves beyond 4 per cent did not receive any
remuneration. Compulsory remuneration rates were also established through BCR
regulations. The nominal monthly remuneration rate applied on domestic
currency reserves had been gradually lowered from 9 per cent (9-16-90) to 4.5
per cent (2-1-91). Reserves requirements on foreign currency deposits were
remunerated at the current annual LIBOR minus one (April, 1991).
34.         The 1991 Law establishes a minimum remuneration rate to be applied
only to marginal reserves. The minimum is no longer remunerated. According
to the Law the rate of remuneration is guaranteed at the level of the average
6/          Open market operations had been recently initiated.

market deposit interest rate'. The ssme regulations were established by the
1991 Law for foreign currency deposits marginal reserves. However, the
Government derogated them by issuing a Supreme Decree according to which the
BCR is allowed to limit the reserve remuneration on dollar deposits to a
maximum of the three-month LIBOR rate.
Skort-Term Liguiditv
35.         Before the 1991 Law was enacted, no eligibility criteria for banks
having access to BCR short-term direct credit had been defined. The 1991 Law
reduces this arbitrariness by introducing conditionality in the allocation of
short-term credit and its refinancing. Financial institutions that have lost
more than 50 per cent of their capital and reserves are not eligible. Those
institutions having outstanding credit for more than 60 daye can only continue
to receive BCR credit if they have established and are complying with a
strengthening plan agreed upon with the SBS.
7I          The average deposits interest rates ("Tass de interes pasivas")
are published by the SBS. They are calculated as an average of all banks'
interest rates on local (TAMN) and foreign currency (TAHEX).
