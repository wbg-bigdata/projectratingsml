following modifications:
      (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the
Page  9
following is substituted therefor:
      "2.8 Notification and Advertising
            The international community should be notified in a
      timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
      advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a bidder's
      invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid;
      such advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper
      of general circulation in the Borrower's country and, in
      addition, in at least one of the following forms:
            (i)    a notice in the United Nations publication,
                   Development Forum, Business Edition; or
            (ii)   an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                   technical journal of wide international
                   circulation; or
            (iii)  a notice to local representatives of countries
                   and territories referred to in the Guidelines,
                   that are potential suppliers of the goods
                   required."
      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
            "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
      the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
      used in international trade and specified in the bidding
      documents."
      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.
      (d)   The foregoing notwithstanding, and subject to the
agreement of the Bank, direct contracting may be used for
transactions costing the equivalent of $5,000,000 or more when
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines.

such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found
acceptable by the Bank; and
      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice.
3.    Subject to the prior approval of the Bank, commonly traded
commodities may be procured through organized international

this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the

funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, two
conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a description of the
advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
5.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraphs 2 and
3 of this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to
the submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal
of funds from the Loan Account in respect thereof, such
documentation and information as the Bank may reasonably request to
support withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.

6.    The provisions of the preceding paragraph 5 of this Schedule

the Loan Account are to be made on the basis of statements of
