MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Madagascar for SDR 31.8 million, the equivalent of US$46.0
million, to help finance an Energy Sector Development Project. The Credit would be on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, including 10 years of grace. The Government of Madagascar
will on-lend to the national utility for electricity and water, JIRAMA, SDR 22.0 million, the
equivalent of US$31.8 million, from the proceeds of the Credit at an adjustable interest rate equal to
the London Interbank Rate (LIBOR) plus 0.9 percent per annum with 25 years maturity, including a
5-year grace period.
Country and Sector Background
2.    Economic Reforrn. In the last twenty-five years, Madagascar experienced an unprecedented
economic decline, attributable mostly to poor government policies that reserved the leading role in the
economy for the state. Between 1971 and 1994, per capita GDP fell by about 45 percent. In 1994
the population of approximately 13 million growing at about 2.8 percent per annum had a per capita
income of US$230. It is estimated that 74 percent of the population currently lives below the poverty
line. Chronic malnutrition rates are about 40 percent, child mortality claims 20 percent of live births
before the age of five, education standards are low and enrollment rates are on the decline. Also, the
country has suffered extensive environmental degradation in the form of deforestation (partly due to
wood offtake for use as fuel) and soil erosion. During the mid-1980s, the Government initiated a
reform program that began to move Madagascar away from its old model of development, and which
resulted in a brief resumption of growth. This process was interrupted by a period of political
turmoil and transition to democracy in 1991-1993.
3.    In the face of the above dire economic and social outcomes, as well as the experience of the
brief revival in the late 1980s, the government has indicated its commitment to deep-seated reforms,
with the central objective to reduce poverty. But poverty in Madagascar is so pervasive that it cannot
be overcome without strong economic growth, leading to increasing employment. The government's
reform program aims to boost the country to its 1971 living standards in ten years and double its per
capita GDP in 25 years. This requires that annual GDP growth reaches six percent by the end of the
decade. To achieve that level of sustained growth the country needs, among other things, adequate
infrastructure for transport, telecommunications and energy. The government's strategy includes
refocussing public expenditures aiming to improve resource allocation to priority sectors. This will
require sectoral reforms opening up for private participation sectors that in the past have been
reserved for the state, with the government focussing on its essential objectives, namely, establishing
a coherent macroeconomic policy geared to financial stability, liberalizing the economy, and waging a
comprehensive battle against poverty, environmental degradation, and the deterioration of social
services 1'. The government has started to take steps in these directions which, if sustained, would
help restore the country's credibility and prepare the ground for a SAC by the Bank and an ESAF by
the IMF and possible debt relief from the Paris Club. It is not clear, however, if the political force-
field will allow the government to complete the full range of reform measures.
I'    Madagascar: A Strategy for High Growth and Poverty Alleviation - An Economic
Strategy Note (World Bank, June 1994).



4.     In the energy sector, the government has launched a program of reforms aiming at the
introduction of rational pricing policies, the elimination of monopolies, and state divestiture and
competition through the opening of the sector to private participation. Reforms in the petroleum
sector are being supported by the Petroleum Sector Reform Project (Cr. 2538-MAG). The proposed
project would extend these reforms to the electricity sub-sector and support a program for
rehabilitation and extension of power infrastructure as well as a program for the efficient production
and use of firewood and charcoal to lessen the burden of energy expenditures on poor households'
budgets and the damage to the environment.
5.     The Energy Sector. Madagascar's energy balance reflects the country's early stage of
economic development. It shows that most of the energy consumed comes from woodfuels and is
used by households. Firewood accounts for 74 percent and charcoal for 9 percent of a net energy
supply that was 2.6 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1993. Conversion losses in the production
of charcoal are very high, about 1.2 million toe annually. The Government is concerned about the
sustainability and the environmental impact of the use of woodfuels, since their large-scale
consumption is one of the factors contributing to the destruction of Madagascar's rich, biodiverse
environment. Because of this, with support from IDA, the Government has been promoting more
efficient methods to produce and burn charcoal, the urban households' fuel of choice. The proposed
project will continue supporting these actions, which will now be extended to include a pilot program
for better management of forest resources being exploited for fuel.
6.     The second largest source of energy is imported petroleum (12 percent of net supply), which
in 1993 absorbed 26 percent of export earnings. The transport sector is the largest consumer of
petroleum products. Electricity's share of net energy supply is only two percent, but this source of
energy is crucial to running a modern productive sector. Although hydroelectric resources are
substantial (about 60,000 GWh/yr) the country has developed less than one percent of this total for
electricity generation, and only eight percent of the Malagasy population has access to electricity.
For this reason, the Government also wants to promote increased access to electricity, particularly for
lower-income groups, in a manner that is economically rational. The Government is also keen on
improving energy efficiency in general. Therefore, in addition to actions concerning woodfuels, the
proposed project will support initiatives to explore the potential for greater fuel efficiency in the
transport sector and for efficiency gains in industry, as well as an electricity loss-reduction program
by the national utility, JIRAMA.
The Power Subsector
7.     Institutional set-up. At the institutional level, Madagascar's power subsector is presently
characterized by state domination. The subsector's current legal framework is defined in a 1974
decree, covering both the electricity and water sub-sectors. The decree declares electric power and
water services to be economic activities reserved for the state and spells out Government policies for
the subsectors. To implement those policies, the Government created the electricity and water utility
JIRAMA in 1975. Because of Government intervention, in its early years JIRAMA operated in a
non-commercial environment, but the Government is now committed to open the power subsector to
private capital, and to corporatize and commercialize the utility. The proposed project will support
this reform program. The Government is also preparing a restructuring program for the water sub-
sector, which IDA intends to support.



8.    Physical characteristics. In its physical structure, Madagascar's power supply system is
characterized by its great fragmentation. Because of the low levels of demand and the vast distances
separating load centers, local networks still represent the least-cost solution for supply in the majority
of cases. As a result, the electricity supply system consists of 63 separate public networks.
JIRAMA's name-plate generation capacity is 216 MW, of which 105 MW is in hydroelectric plants.
Aggregate peak demand is currently 110 MW, with the eight largest cities accounting for 95 percent
of the total. Although it appears as if there is more than enough capacity, in fact, most of
Madagascar's installations are very old. As a consequence, a large number of the existing thermal
units has to be retired before the year 2000, while most of the hydro units need urgent rehabilitation
to extend their lives. Some transmission lines, and many of the distribution networks, also require
urgent rehabilitation.
9.     Evolution of demand and supply. Electricity sales were 437 GWh in 1994, supplied from a
gross generation of 546 GWh of which 71 percent came from hydro plants. Demand growth has been
uneven, reflecting the vicissitudes of GDP growth. Demand grew at an average annual rate of 4.8
percent between 1986 and 1990, decreased 2 percent in 1991, the year when civil disorders swept the
country, grew again at 5.6 percent from 1991 to 1993, and stagnated in 1994. The number of
consumers increased from 140,000 in 1986 to 190,000 in 1994, at an average annual growth rate of
3.7 percent. JIRAMA projects its electricity sales to grow at an average rate of 4.8 percent per year
between 1995 and 2000. Because of the expected effect of the loss reduction program included in the
project, the corresponding growth rate of gross generation is only 4.1 percent.
10.   System expansion. In 1989-90, JIRAMA developed a least-cost expansion plan with the
assistance of consultants financed by the Energy I project (Credit 1787-MAG). The plan, which was
recently updated by JIRAMA, constitutes the basis for its investment program. The proposed credit
will finance the rehabilitation and extension of the electricity supply system, through support of
JIRAMA's least-cost expansion plan, and also of a program to extend electrification at low cost,
focussing on peri-urban and dynamic rural areas, and targeting lower-income groups which up to now
have been excluded from access due to the financial barrier of up-front costs.
11.    Electricity pricing and cost recovery. In 1990, JIRAMA and its consultants also carried out a
tariff study which introduced a system of tariffs based on the long run marginal cost of supply
(LRMC). In 1991, JIRAMA adopted the tariff structure defined by the study, and the level required
for financial equilibrium, as a target which the company was to reach through successive adjustments.
The Government approved substantial tariff increases and the process was completed by mid-1994.
The present tariff structure is based on the LRMC, and its average level of about US10 cents/kWh is
sufficient to ensure JIRAMA's financial equilibrium. Furthermore, since the beginning of 1993, the
tariff level is automatically adjusted for changes in fuel price, the exchange rate, and inflation. The
Government has maintained this tariff policy through difficult economic times, demonstrating its
commitment to pricing based on sound economic criteria. With the exception of a large industrial
client in Mahajanga, with whom JIRAMA is negotiating a solution, collection delays from private
clients are within 60 days. Public sector clients, on the other hand, have in the past tended to
accumulate large arrears which were periodically settled through cross-debt compensations. The
Government and JIRAMA are taking measures to ensure timely payment in the future (para. 26).

12.   Proposed power sub-sector reform. The reform program will create a new legal and
regulatory framework for the electricity sub-sector, and restructure JIRAMA. In June 1996, the
Government will propose to the National Assembly the adoption of an Electricity Law that will, inter
alia: (a) open the power sub-sector to private economic agents, establishing the rules for entry and
exit, as well as the standard obligations and rights of operators; (b) create a Regulatory Commission
having as main functions the calculation and setting of tariffs, and quality of service monitoring; (c)
establish the rules for sector structure and economic operation of power systems; and (d) define the
principles and procedures to be applied in tariff calculation and setting. The Regulatory Commission
will consist of a governing board and a technical secretariat. The board will consist of five members
and will be chaired by a representative of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). The technical
secretariat, staffed with a small number of specialists, will provide the technical foundation for the
decisions of the board by means of studies that it will conduct itself or that it will request from
qualified international consultants. The electric utilities will finance the agency's budget. IDA will
finance an initial tariff study to define regulated prices and adjustment formulas.
13.   The Govermnent has also invited proposals for consulting services to define a restructuring
program for JIRAMA, including its conversion into a commercially-oriented joint-stock company,
with the possibility of private participation in its capital. The study will include: (a) an assessment of
JIRAMA's present situation; (b) definition of a new corporate strategy for the utility, taking into
account the proposed new regulatory framework, including an analysis of the feasibility of separating
water and electricity operations and identification of the options for private participation; (c) definition
of a financial restructuring package, including a revision of the asset base, a revaluation of assets, and
a recapitalization if needed; and (d) fornulation of new statutes for the utility as a joint-stock
company, a new organizational structure, and adequate management systems. Furthermore, the
consultants will define a plan for implementing the restructuring package, which will then be executed
under the project.
Woodfuels
14.   Traditional methods for both the production and consumption of charcoal are inefficient and
could be improved. Under the Energy I project, the MEM did research and initiated actions that led
to the introduction of an improved kiln for charcoal manufacturing, and proper control of the
carbonization process - with an efficiency gain of 40 to 50 percent - and also to the development of
improved charcoal stoves -- which permit an efficiency gain of about 30 percent. MEM trained
charcoal makers and stove manufacturers, and mounted a successful promotional campaign for the
improved stoves in the area of the capital. A recent IDA Environmental Impact of Woodfuels study
evaluated the environmental problems of seven regions in Madagascar and found two, Mahajanga and
Toliary, where the exploitation of forest resources for fuel was the main cause of forest degradation.
The study pointed to the need for integrated long-term plans for the use of wood resources at the
regional level. The proposed project will test, on a pilot basis in the Mahajanga region, an integrated
set of measures to improve forest resource management, and will also continue disseminating nation-
wide the techniques for more efficient production and use of charcoal developed under Energy I.
15.   Project Rationale. The project will contribute to implementing Madagascar's strategy for
economic growth and poverty reduction by: (a) providing electricity infrastructure to support strong
economic growth, leading to greater employment; (b) transforming the power sub-sector's legal and
regulatory framework, in line with the Government's policy of liberalization and sound pricing, to
increase efficiency and attract private investment; (c) improving the efficiency of energy processes,
particularly the production and use of charcoal; and (d) introducing better management of forest

resources being exploited for fuel. The project continues the reforms and investment initiated under
the recently-completed Energy I project (Cr. 1787 MAG) and complements the ongoing Petroleum
Sector Reforn Project (Cr. 2538 MAG).
16.    The initial thrust of the power sub-sector reforn will be on creating a transparent legal and
regulatory framework conducive to greater efficiency and capable of attracting private investment, and
on preparing JIRAMA for operation in the new environment through corporatization and
commercialization. Before substantial private investment can realistically be expected, a transition
period of three to five years is needed to establish the credibility of the new legal and regulatory
environment. For that reason, the proposed project will support the state-owned utility's investment
in power infrastructure up to the year 2000 to ensure that there are no bottlenecks that could constrain
economic growth.
17.   JIRAMA's investment program covers generation, transmission and distribution. For
generation, the program emphasizes rehabilitating existing hydroelectric plants, and is the result of a
least-cost expansion planning study carried out with the assistance of consultants financed by IDA
under Energy 1. The alternative of increasing diesel-based generation was more costly. For the
majority of the small isolated centers, however, the only alternative available is the addition of small
diesel generating sets (40 to 300 kW). In transmission, an extension will incorporate several centers
now served from diesel plants to systems that have surplus hydroelectric capacity. Higher fuel costs
make the alternative of letting the systems develop separately more expensive. In distribution, the
project will finance rehabilitation, expansion and renovation of networks in the country's eight largest
urban centers. Expansion will follow a master plan prepared by consultants that IDA financed, which
considered different alternative voltage levels and timing of network additions. In Antananarivo,
where the capacity of the existing 5-kilovolt distribution system has become insufficient for the city,
the network will be renovated using a 20-kV voltage level, following a master plan prepared within
the framework of the Energy I project by consultants with French financing. The study considered
several alternative voltage levels and network structures which the technico-economic analysis found
less adequate.
18.    As mentioned before, the infrastructure components also include an electrification program
focusing on peri-urban and dynamic rural areas that will target lower-income groups, helping them to
overcome the financial barrier through mechanisms for financing up-front costs, such as house wiring
and connection fees. This will help improve quality of life among those groups. In order to benefit a
maximum number of people, the average cost per connection will be minimized by more intensive
utilization of existing infrastructure, and by applying low-cost design standards. For remote, poorer
areas, solutions based on photo-voltaics or wind will be explored. This program, for which the
strategy has been agreed with MEM, will follow a master plan to be developed with consultant
support under the project. The idea is to complement investment based on pure commercial criteria
with a program that will help gain access to electricity areas and groups able to elicit, after a start-up
phase, a sufficient level of consumption at economic prices.
19.    The project will also contribute to sustainable growth and preservation of the environment
through its components for greater energy efficiency, including the reduction of electricity losses,
improved techniques for the production and use of charcoal, and support of a pilot program to ensure
a sustainable supply of woodfuels to the Mahajanga region that will test new arrangements for
managing natural forest resources that are being exploited for fuel.



- 6 -
20.    Project Obiectives. The proposed project aims at: (a) enhancing Madagascar's prospects for
economic recovery and growth by ensuring an adequate supply of electricity, including an increased
access of peri-urban and rural populations to the service; (b) increasing economic and management
efficiency in the power subsector, and attracting private capital for investment, through institutional
reform; and (c) promoting greater energy efficiency, which, in the case of woodfuels, will at the same
time help mitigate adverse environmental impacts.
21.    Project Description. The project consists of four major components. First, the bulk of
JIRAMA's investment program, including: infrastructure (rehabilitation and extension of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities), tools and equipment for maintenance; a loss reduction
program; improvements in management systems and personnel training; and feasibility studies for two
small hydro projects (US$118.1 million). Second, an electrification program to selectively increase
the population's access to electricity service, by applying low-cost design standards, with emphasis on
better utilization of existing infrastructure and the extension of networks that have surplus generating
capacity (US$7.8 million). Third, a program to support capacity building and actions to reform the
power subsector, including the establishment of a new legal and regulatory framework that will allow
private sector participation; and the restructuring of JIRAMA according to principles of commercial
operations (US$3.2 million). Fourth, a country-wide program to promote energy efficiency, with
emphasis on woodfuels, including an integrated pilot program to ensure a sustainable supply of
woodfuels for the Mahajanga region, preserving the natural forest (US$3.4 million). The project will
be co-financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) (US$24.7 million), the French Development
Agency (Caisse Francaise de Developpement, CFD) (US$28.3 million), and the Arab Bank for the
Economic Development of Africa (ABEDA) (US$6.6 million).
22.    Schedule A presents the detailed costs of the program, as well as the financing arrangements.
Schedule B presents economic and financial-analysis tables, as well as key performance indicators.
Schedule C summarizes procurement and disbursement arrangements. Schedules D and E
respectively present a timetable of key project processing events, and the status of IDA operations in
Madagascar.
23.    Project Implementation. The project will be executed in five and a half years, with
December 31, 2001, as the closing date. JIRAMA will be responsible for implementing its
investment program. It acquired considerable capability in project implementation under the Energy I
project. Furthermore, as part of the preparation activities, JIRAMA is receiving support from
consultants in designing and setting up an organization and systems for project management. The
Directorate of Energy at the Ministry of Energy and Mines will be the executing agency for the
electrification program, the reform of the power subsector and the energy efficiency program. For
the latter, there is already a structure in place which successfully executed a component under the
Energy I project. A consultant will define the institutional arrangements for the electrification
component within the framework of a master-plan study.
24.    Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. Since 1978, IDA has been active in supporting
the development of the energy sector in the Republic of Madagascar, with one hydroelectric project,
three projects in the petroleum sector, an energy assessment under the Joint UNDP/Bank Energy
Sector Management Assistance Programme and one energy sector project. The most important
lessons from previous power projects in Africa and elsewhere that have been incorporated in the
design of this project are: (a) that greater efficiency and financial viability of power subsector
operations requires structural reform: opening the subsector to private participation, maintaining
economically efficient pricing, and conmnercializing state-owned utilities; and (b) that electrification of



- 7 -
new areas has to be done selectively, focusing on areas that can make productive use of electricity,
trying to make more intensive use of existing infrastructure, and applying low-cost design standards.
Also, on a more specific level, and based on the experience of the Energy I project, JIRAMA has
sought to structure procurement packages to minimize the burden of supervision and coordination.
25.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is an important instrument for implementing
IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Madagascar, discussed by the Board on July 12. 1994
and updated by the progress report circulated together with this package. The CAS seeks to help the
Government in promoting vigorous growth, which is crucial for long-term poverty alleviation, and
improving natural resource management. The proposed project will support: (a) expanding the role of
the private sector in the provision of services, as well as improvements in infrastructure to stimulate
economic growth; and (b) better forest management in the Mahajanga region. IDA's involvement
will help the Government in taking the necessary steps to address two main issues in the power sub-
sector, namely: (i) the need for a change in the legal framework to allow private sector participation;
and (ii) the restructuring and corporatization of JIRAMA, the national power company, to open its
capital to private interests. Several European companies have already expressed interest in investing
in the power subsector in Madagascar. The project's components for power system rehabilitation are
consistent with the CAS emphasis on the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure.
The project also represents the next step in an on-going dialogue between the Government and IDA
on an agreed program of energy sector development. In particular, it continues work which the
Energy I project initiated on the economic pricing of electricity and programs to promote efficiency in
the production and consumption of woodfuels. The restructuring of JIRAMA's electricity operations
is consistent with on-going restructuring efforts to open public sector companies to private sector
participation, both in the petroleum subsector, supported by IDA's Petroleum Sector Reform Project,
and in JIRAMA's water operations, which IDA also plans to support. Madagascar's political
situation is evolving, but there is a broad consensus that there is no alternative but to interest the
private sector in the financing and management of new power infrastructure if the country is to meet
its objective of sustained growth.
26.   Agreed Actions. In its letter of sector policy submitted to IDA, the Government states that
its key objectives for the energy sector are to: open the sector to private capital, with the Government
assuming a regulatory role; maintain an efficient pricing policy; and promote efficiency in the
production and use of energy. The Government will submit a draft Electricity Law to the National
Assembly in June 1996, and will set up a regulatory agency before the end of September 1996. The
Government has agreed to continue a pricing policy for electricity based on the LRMC and with
tariffs automatically adjusted. The Government and JIRAMA agreed to a plan, involving a debt
write-off and conversion of debt into equity, designed to enable JIRAMA to attain a debt-to-equity
ratio not exceeding 70/30 by the end of 1996. JIRAMA agreed to generate from internal sources not
less than 30 percent of its average annual capital expenditures, and to maintain an internal cash
generation of at least 1.5 times the estimated debt-service requirement. The Government is also
putting in place new procedures to ensure the timely payment of electricity bills by the Central
Government, and its agencies. The conditions for credit effectiveness are: (a) the execution of a
satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and JIRAMA; (b) the appointment by
the Directorate of Energy and JIRAMA of key implementation staff; (c) issuance of the request for
proposals for the restructuring of JIRAMA by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (actual) and (d) the
submission to IDA of the bidding documents for contracts scheduled for award during the first year.
Finally, disbursements for the electrification program will be conditional on the establishment of a
regulatory authority for the power sector.

27.   Environlmental Aspects. The proposed project has been assigned environmental category B.
The preparatory work included an environmental analysis for the transmission lines and substations
which JIRAMA will build. The analysis confirmed that the transmission corridors and substation sites
that JIRAMA has designated for the planned installations do not traverse any environmentally
sensitive areas. The proposed systems do cross a variety of inhabited and agricultural areas, and the
primary environmental issue is the potential socio-cultural and anthropological impact. Environmental
planning to mitigate any adverse effects will focus on good route planning and construction practices.
The Borrower and IDA have agreed on a review mechanism to ensure: (a) the incorporation of the
detailed environmental recommendations in the final engineering design; and (b) project monitoring to
ensure their actual implementation. IDA has approved the environmental analysis and mitigation
plan.
28.    Several of the project components will help enhance the quality of the environment. The
rehabilitation of hydro plants, and the incorporation of several centers now served from diesel plants
to systems that have surplus hydro generating capacity will help reduce CO2 emissions and
environmental pollution. The substitution of hydro for thermal generation in Manakara and
Mananjary, through the incorporation of those towns to the Fianarantsoa interconnected system, will
reduce contamination of the surrounding lagoon systems with fuel and lubricant from the existing
diesel plants. Improving energy efficiency will also lessen pollution. The woodfuels components will
reduce deforestation.
29.   Program Objective Categories. The proposed project is an investment operation which
makes a contribution to basic infrastructure, public sector management, private sector development
and environmental protection.
30.   Particiatorv apDroach. The proposed project is the next step in a long-standing dialogue
between the Government and IDA on energy sector issues, and has been prepared with full
participation of the implementing agencies. JIRAMA's investment program is based on expansion
plans defined by the utility itself with the assistance of consultants financed by IDA. The initiative
for the electrification and energy efficiency programs comes from the MEM. On the issue of power
sector reform, the Bank had the role of introducing the new ideas about sector management and
structure, but the proposed reform program was defined by a local commission after discussions with
Bank staff.
31.   Benefits. Support of JIRAMA's investment program will help ensure enhanced and more
reliable electricity supply, and relatedly avoid or reduce outage costs, fuel costs, and energy losses.
Without the project, outage costs would increase as a result of shortfalls in generating capacity, as
well as the increased incidence of faults in the existing systems. The project will help avoid fuel
costs for thermal generation by extending the life of existing hydroelectric plants, and by connecting
several centers, now served from diesel plants, to systems that have surplus hydro generating
capacity. The reduction of technical losses will achieve savings in both, capacity investment and
energy generated, and the reduction of commercial losses will increase utility revenue. The
electrification program will result in savings from the substitution of electricity in end-uses which
currently depend on kerosene, candles, and batteries, and will make possible increased economic
activity.

32.   The new regulatory framework for the power sub-sector will elicit efficiency gains, part of
which will be transferred to consumers through tariff regulation. Over the long term, the institutional
reforms are expected to attract private investment for system expansion. Improved energy efficiency
will reduce waste, and, in the case of woodfuels, save trees. Benefits have been quantified for
JIRAMA's investment program as a whole and for its individual components. Benefits have also been
estimated for the improved stoves program and for the pilot woodfuels supply program for
Mahajanga. The economic rate of return on JIRAMA's investment program is estimated at 22
percent. The economic rates of return on the rehabilitation work under the project range from 12
percent to 57 percent. These rates of return were calculated using existing tariffs as a proxy for
benefits. The economic benefits are much higher when calculated using the willingness of consumers
to pay for electricity. For the improved stove program and the Mahajanga pilot woodfuel program,
the ERRs are 22 and 42 percent, respectively (see Schedule B). All economic rates of return equal or
exceed the opportunity cost of capital in Madagascar estimated at 12 percent.
33.   Project Sustainability. The reform of the power sector will begin a gradual disengagement
of the State and involvement of the private sector which should lead to power companies operating on
commercial principles. Rate regulation will be geared towards this end, making investment in the
sector attractive, while at the same time introducing incentives for efficiency. The Government has
agreed to maintain the present tariff policy until a revised tariff system is put into effect in October
1997, within the framework of power sector reform. The proposed project will also contribute to the
sustainability of woodfuels supply by increasing efficiency in the production and use of charcoal.
34.    Risks. The possible developments that may adversely affect the project may be divided into
pre- and post-commissioning risks. The pre-commissioning risks relate to: (a) construction cost
increases; and (b) delays in completion. The post-commissioning risks are related to: (i) the market
risk; and (ii) government policies and actions on market structure and regulation, and pricing policy.
35.   With respect to pre-commissioning risks, the risk of construction cost increases was
minimized by taking into account cost data for similar works and setting aside contingencies in
proportion to the perceived risks of occurrence (15 percent for hydro rehabilitation, and 10 percent
for other components); the delays-in-completion risk has also been reduced through: (a) the advance
preparation of bidding documents; (b) the provision of assistance, as part of project preparation, to
supply the tools for project management and to set-up detailed implementation schedules for each
component; and (c) the experience gained by both JIRAMA and MEM with the implementation of the
Energy I Project (Cr. 2787 MAG) 21. The woodfuel components will be implemented by MEM
through local consultants and NGOs which are closer to the communities most affected by the
woodfuel crisis.

36.    Once the project is constructed, the market risk becomes predominant. A sensitivity analysis
was carried out which evaluated the effect on the return of the project of a drop in sales, due for
example to an economic downturn. Due the rehabilitative nature of the majority of the work, the
economics of the project remain sound. However, other policies and actions the Government could
take may have a negative effect on the project. Concerning electricity services, the risk would arise
from the imposition of price controls, and the unwillingness to allow greater private sector
participation through the creation of barriers to entry. The sensitivity analysis on the program as a
whole as well as on components thereof, shows that a reduction in benefits either through lower
prices, lower quantities or both would significantly affect their rate of return. Reneging on
commitments to open up the electricity subsector to private participation would have some serious
medium to long-term effects as the Government cannot afford to pay for power expansion and
rehabilitation. The system would not be able to satisfy demand and would most certainly deteriorate.
Although this risk is present, great care has been taken to develop and strengthen local ownership of
the process. The local authorities have had the leading role in the formulation of the reform program
for the power subsector, which ensured that social and political constraints were given particular
consideration.
37.    Reconmiendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
Note on Portfolio and Disbursement Performance
1.    In August 1993, Madagascar completed a two-year process of political transition from a single
party regime to a pluralistic democracy. Implementation and disbursement of the IDA-financed
portfolio, which had been slow during the transition, are now showing improvement. While the
continued poor economic and financial situation in the country had the potential to hamper portfolio
progress, efforts were made during annual public expenditure reviews (PERs) to ensure adequate
counterpart resources for the priority investment program. The April 1994 country portfolio
performance review (CPPR) addressed key generic problems which were affecting the portfolio, and
set action plans to speed parliamentary ratification of projects, to guarantee timely availability of
counterpart funds and eliminate roadblocks to requests for disbursements of IDA funds, to limit
procurement delays, and to improve accounting and audit procedures. The government decided to
systematically monitor portfolio performance, and empowered a department in the Ministry of
Budget, Finance and Planning to monitor implementation and report regularly, both to the
government and the Bank. A May 1995 CPPR reviewed the progress achieved and remaining steps to
be taken. It also focused, on a project-by-project basis, on the achievement of results on the ground
and project objectives. This CPPR benefited from the participation of a number of beneficiaries who
reported on their perceptions of how the projects are implemented, how they are useful, and how they
might be improved.
2.    The efforts to improve project implementation are paying off. The percentage of
unsatisfactory projects in the portfolio dropped from 27 percent in FY92 to 13 percent in FY95 as
regards implementation progress, and from 27 percent to 17 percent as regards development
objectives. In addition, 22 percent of the portfolio was rated highly satisfactory in terms of meeting
development objectives. Disbursements for investment projects increased substantially from US$23
million in FY92 to US$72 million in FY95. This represented an increase in the disbursement ratio
from 7 percent to 20 percent. Disbursements so far in FY96 (through end-February 1996) are US$51
million. At the end of this schedule is a table which shows project-by-project disbursement trends for
FY95 and FY96.
3.    While significant progress has been made on portfolio performance, much remains to be
done. The political and economic/financial situations in Madagascar still have the potential to derail
project implementation, and continuing efforts will be made to monitor closely and follow up the
action plans identified during the May 1995 CPPR, both for remaining generic issues and for
individual projects.
4.    Disbursement Lags. Even though disbursements have been reasonably robust, the
undisbursed balance for some projects has diminished more slowly due to the strengthening value of
the SDR versus the US$ between the time of approval and the present, a trend which has only started
to reverse recently. There are also projects which are now performing well, but which because of
initial delays, show lags when compared to original expectations. Four projects show disbursement
lags of more than 50%:

The Antananarivo Plain Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG) has achieved substantial
progress toward its institutional objectives; in particular, the government has created the
entities charged with the future operation and maintenance of the drainage and flood control
and sewerage utilities. However, suspension of disbursements for downstream portions of the
drainage system by the key co-financier, due to payment arrears, has delayed IDA's ability to
proceed with the upstream works. IDA is studying in coordination with the co-financier
possible solutions to this problem. If resolution is not forthcoming, the IDA credit may have
to be suspended.
The Health Sector Improvement Project (Cr. 2251-MAG) was considered a problem
project in FY94. Since the beginning of FY95, however, considerable progress has been
made by the Ministry of Health (MOH) with support from IDA and other partners in
implementing key reforms aimed at addressing sectoral issues: (i) a private non-profit drug
procurement unit has been established; (ii) health districts have been established with medical
officers appointed and budgetary allocations decentralized; (iii) a package of essential services
and norms have been defined; and (iv) a policy on cost recovery and community management
has been agreed. These reforns and the significant improvement of project management
resulted in an upgrading of the project to a satisfactory rating. Disbursements have picked
up. The project mid-term review held in June and October 1995 resulted in proposals for
some project restructuring -- to help MOH upgrade district health services and introduce cost
recovery and community management in the districts; to remove from the project family
planning activities which will now be supported by USAID; to help finance the revolving drug
fund of the newly-established drug procurement unit; and to refine institutional strengthening
activities to address MOH's main weaknesses in human resources development, IEC
(information, education, communications) and management information systems. The project
changes will be submitted to the Board shortly on a non-objection basis.
Despite a difficult start, linked both to political and management uncertainties, the Financial
Institutions Development Project (Cr. 2497-MAG) is now showing progress. Overall,
management of the Central Bank (BCM) has improved considerably, and the Acting Governor
has taken key policy and institutional decisions. Since he replaced the previous Governor in
December 1994, BCM has played a more active role in the conduct of monetary policy --
establishment of a mechanism linking its reference rate for the price of money to inflation;
raising reserve requirements; placing the two state-owned banks under holding management;
and based on the above, removal of credit ceilings and reliance on instruments of indirect
control. The adoption of new BCM statutes has given it real independence from the
government. Finally, important progress has been made in banking supervision. The recent
promulgation of a new banking law will reinforce this effort. Concerning project
implementation itself, a coordination unit has been established to take day-to-day management
decisions within parameters of general priorities defined by a supervision committee. The
BCM has agreed to introduce a new accounting system for 1997 and has already launched the
preselection process for new software. With decisions made on key sector issues and
improved management, procurement of key items and disbursements are now advancing.
Effectiveness of the Petroleum Sector Reform Project (Cr. 2538-MAG) was slow owing to
a lengthy process of ratification by the National Assembly. After a slow start, project
implementation is picking up momentum with the recent recruitment of the project
management consultant. Also, in line with its decision to liberalize the import of refined

petroleum products, the government opted for opening up immediately the capital of the
refinery to the private sector and requested that the project be restructured so as to eliminate
the rehabilitation of the refinery and related investments. The government request is now
being processed and it is expected that about US$18 million will be canceled. Remaining
investments under the project relate to: (i) the restructuring of SOLIMA, the creation of an
open access system to certain key facilities by all operators and the establishment of a
regulatory authority; and (ii ) physical investments in infrastructure to improve safety and
protect the environment.
5.     Effectiveness. The Social Fund II (FID) Project (Cr. 2778-MAG), approved by the Board
in September 1995, was expected to become effective by early January 1996. The government's
decision to remove the FID Director in November 1995, however, slowed project activities including
follow-up on credit effectiveness conditions. The National Assembly has approved the project. The
government is in the process of recruiting a new FID Director, whose first task will be to ensure that
all credit effectiveness conditions are fulfilled. The government is also taking actions to meet the
conditions meanwhile. Effectiveness is now expected by June 1, 1996.
