MEMORA4DUM AND RLCONMUNDATION 0 TUE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTSRNATIONAL DEVBLOPHENS ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO RONM
FOR A FOURTH POPULATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Kenya for SDR 26.3 million (US$35.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years matur'ty and help finance a four A
population project. The project would be cofinanced by USAID for US$2.2
million.
2.        Background.  Over the past few months a number of positive
developments in Kenya's population program have become apparent. Results
of a demographic and health suxvey conducted earlier this year show that
there has been a significant increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate.
About twenty-seven percent of married women are currently using some method
of contraception. Nearly two-thirds of these are modern methods.
Contraceptive usage has increased by 50 percent in the past five years.
These trends have translated into an estimated decline in fertility from
7.7 in 1984 to 6.7 at present.
3.        The results of the demographic and health survey are very good
news for Kenya, which has experienced increasing population growth rates
since Independence. This rapid population growth has placed enormous
strains on the country's education system, labor market, and natural
environment, thus acting as a serious constraint to national economic and
social development. Although the results of the recent 1989 Population
Census have not been released, it is probably unrealistic to expect the
dramatic decline in the total fertility rate (TFR) to be immediately
translated into a precipitous fall in the population growth rate. However,
after years of inactivity and little progress, Kenya's population program
appears to have finally taken off.
4.        A number of factors help to explain the recent progress of
Kenya's population program. Undoubtedly the most important of these has
been the strong and sustained commitment at the highest levels of
Government, particularly the Office of the President, to dealing with the
causes and consequences of rapid population growth. This high-visibility
support has made a major contribution to changing traditional attitudes of
Kenyans towards population and family planning. But considerable
improvements have also been made on the supply side.
5.        Learning from experience accumulated over more than two decades,
public and private sector (especially Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs)) delivery systems have been vastly expanded and rationalized. The
National Council for Population and Development (NCPD), the agency
responsible for overall coordination of Kenya's population program, has at
the same time been substantially strengthened both administratively and
financially. A final ingredient of success for the program has been strong
donor support, including NORAD, ODA, SIDA, UNFPA, USAID, plus three IDA
credits totalling around US$45 million.



-2-
6.        The Kenyan population program is now at a critical juncture.
Although the recent achievements are encouraging, there is a serious risk
that further progress will be jeopardized by shortage of contraceptive
supplies and weak demand in provinces with low contraceptive prevalence
rates. Furthermore, there is evidence from Asian population programs that
contraceptive prevalence tends to reach a plateau of about 25-30S unless
new incentives are introduced, such as women's income generating activities
which have resulted in further substantial fertility decline. Under no
circumstances can Ker.ya afford a break in contraceptive supplies, notably
injectables. It is under these circumstances that the current population
project is proposed. The project, quickly following the Third Population
Project, fills gaps that are mainly attributable to the recent positive
developments in the program.
7.        Although the Kenyan Third Population Project (Credit 1904-KE
approved in 1988) contains a component in support of imports of
contraceptives, the demand for contraceptives observed over the past few
years has been far greater than anticipated at the time of appraisal. In
an effort to meet this demand some project funds have been reallocated from
certain civil works to finance the import of injectable contraceptives.
This has helped to alleviate shortages temporarily. At the same time, a
National Leader's Conference held in Septewler 1989 further strengthened
the political and administrative support for the program. This has
resulted in new opportunities for development of the population program.
The proposed project addresses the issue of contraceptive supply and the
possibility to further expand the population program.
8.        Proiect Objectives: The objectives of the project are to:  (a)
further increase the availability, accessibility, and quality of family
planning services provided by the Government and NGO- (b) further
strengthen the demand for family planning services through expansion of IEC
activities of additional NGOs and government ministries; and (c) further
strengthen the capacity of the NCPD to plan and monitor the expanding
national population program.
9.        Project Description:  The proposed project has three components:
(a) increase availability, accessibility and quality of family planning
services through provision of adequate supplies of contraceptives for both
Government and NGO service providers, an improved and strengthened
contraceptive logistics system and the establishment of a surveillance
system for clinical contraceptives; (b) strengthen the demand for family
planning services through expansion of IEC programs in additional
government ministries and NGOs, and through development of income
generating activities targeted pr'-arily at women's groups; (c) continued
support to NCPD, focusing on instatutional development and expansion of
district population programs. The project to be disbursed over a seven
year period, provides funds for contraceptives; IEC materials and supplies;
technical assistance; overseas and local training; monitoring, research and
evaluation; and incremental operating costs. Total estimated project costs
are US$41.3 million equivalent, 62? of which are foreign exchange costs. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disDursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the Status of Bank Group Operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No.8319-KE, dated March 9,
1990 and a map are attached.



-3-
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvement:  The proposed project extends the
scope of the Third Population Praject and builds upon the experiences of
the earlier projects. The project will be critical in ensuring that
adequate contraceptive supplies are available in light of the rapidly
growing demand and in the expansion of population programs at the district
level. IDA assistance has previously concentrated on supply and demand and
on institution building. These efforts have paid off with rising
contraceptive prevalence rates and rapidly increasing demand. This project
will fill the gaps in the population program whJch have emerged due to its
rapid expansion. In addition, the ground work will be laid to address
longer-term sustainability Issues, namely the possible plateauing of
contraceptive prevalence rates. External assistance will continue to be
required for the medium term to achieve fertility decline through an
effective population program. IDA dialogue with NCPD and other senior
government officials on population policy issues is excellent. Close
cooperation with other donors has resulted in attracting cofinancing for
the sector.
11.       Actions Agreed.  Government would:  (a) for effectiveness: (i)
submit an organizational structure for the Division of Family Health for
review and comment by IDA and a plan for its implementation; and (ii)
appoint a Logistics Management Advisor in the Division of Family Health,
whose qualifications and experience would be satisfactory to IDA; (b) for
disbursement of selected components: (i) submit an implementation plan,
acceptable to IDA for the first year of the project for the women's sub-
component, (ii) submit to IDA an evaluation of the first phase of the
district population program and agree with IDA on possible changes required
for implementation of the district focus sub-component; and (iii) submit a
national IEC strategy and implementation plan acceptable to IDA: (c) other
covenants: (i) draft annual work plans, including budgetary allocations,
satisfactory to IDA be submitted by March 31, annually and a mid-term
review be undertaken by December 31, 1992; and (ii) research proposals in
reproductive biology for the Institute of Primate Research sub-component be
submitted to IDA for review and approval by June 30, 1991.
12.       Benefits.  The proposed project would reinforce and expand
activities initiated under the Third Population Project. The project would
ensure an uninterrupted supply of contraceptives. This together with the
increase in demand for family planning through IEC activities and expanded
district population programs, would facilitate the further reduction in
fertility levels from the current 6.7 to 6.0 by 1995. Investment in the
population sector is central to Kenya's development strategy in that rapid
population growth can negate the benefits, in per capita terms, of efforts
in other sectors. Furthermore, reduction in the rate of population growth
will ease pressure on natural resources and have a positive impact on the
environment in the long run.



-4-
13.       Risks.  The main risks of this project relate to the
administrative, managerial and financial capabilities in the Division of
Family Health of the Ministry of Health and the ability of the NCPD to
coordinate and manage an expanding multi-sectoral program.  NCPD staffing
has steadily increased over the past few years and a program for staff
development is being implemented. The NCPD is becoming more effective in
m naging an expanding population progre- and there is every reason to
believe that it can respond to the proposed expansion satisfactorily. With
support for management strengthening, the Division of Family Health is
expected to improve its performance. Closer supervision by senior MDR
management has also been instituted and these steps are expected to address
the risks involving the Division of Family Health.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
com.ly with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
