MICROENTERPRISE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
BorrEKower:             Islamic Republic of Pakistan
Beneficiaries:          Non-government organizations (NGOs), initially
including Agha Khan Rural Support Program, Orangi
Pilot Project, Basic Urban Services for Katchi
Abadies, and Alfalah Development Institute; private
leasing companies, initially including Orix Leasing
Pakistan Ltd. (OLP); established and viable micro-
and small-scale enterprises as well as start-up
microenterprises owned and operated by women, in
manufacturing, commerce and services.
Amount:                 US$26.0 million equivalent.
Co-Financinit:          US$2.8 million equivalent (f4.8 million) grant from
the Government of the Netherlands.
-terms:                 Twenty years, including a five-year grace period, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
On-lending Terms:       The Governmer.t of Pakistan will pass on the
Netherlands' funds as grants to the participating
NGOs to enable them to build a revolving fund as
self-sustaining financing programs. (Participation
in the proposed Project is open to any interested
NGOs that meet the eligibility criteria.) The NGOs
will on-lend the proceeds of the grants as short-
term loans to microenterprises for working capital
and purchase of tools. The NGOs will charge
prevailing market rates (currently about 15-22
percent per year), sufficient to cover each NGO's
opportunity cost of funds, administrative costs, and
provision for losses, and to generate net annual
surplus for growth.
The Government will on-lend Bank loan through the
administrating institution (Bankers Equity Limited)
to OLP and other eligible leasing companies at a
variable rate adjusted periodically at the same
frequency as the Bank's rate. The on-lending rate to
OLP and other eligible leasing companies would
include the Bank's prevailing interest rate plus the
prevailing fee for the foreign exchange risk coverage
as determined by the State Bank of Pakistan and a
fixed spread of 0.75 percent per annum (which is
composed of 0.25 percent per annum representing the

average commitment fees incurred by the Government
over the life of the loan, and a 0.50 percent per
annum for administration cost to BEL). In view of
the fact that small and micro-entrepreneurs do not
possess means to hedge against the foreign exchange
risk, the Government will bear that risk. OLP and
other leasing companies would also provide to the
Government a guarantee from a suitable tbtrd party.
OLP and other eligible leasing companies will finance
equipment lease contracts for small and micro-
entrepreneurs. The OLP and other eligible leasing
companies will charge prevailing rates in the leasing
market (effective yields for lease contracts
presently average about 23 percent per year). OLP
and other eligible leasing companies would repay
their loans over 10 years, including a grace period
of 3 years.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL RANR FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVElOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAXISTAN
POR A MICROENTERPRISE PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendatior on a proposed loan to Pakistan for US$26.0 million equivalent.
The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 years maturity,
including a grace period of five years, and would help finance a Micro-
enterprise Project. The Government of the Netherlands would co-finance this
project with a grant of US$2.8 million equivalent to be administered by the
Bank.
2.          CountXr and Sectoral Back round.  Microenterprises in Pakistan
consist of enterprises with less than 10 workers, which are legally not
required to register under the Factories Act. In manufacturing, they account
for about a third of the sector's total value added and employ about 70
percent of its work force. Output and employment of the microenterprise sub-
sector have grown faster than those for the economy as a whole.
Microenterprises are mainly family businesses -- mostly household-based units
-- with an average of two to three employees. They operate in unregulated and
competitive markets characterized by free entry and exit, and many engage
extensively in sub-contracting activities.  They rely largely on indigenous
resources, and use labor-intensive and adapted technology with skills mostly
acquired outside formal schooling. In household-based units, a large number
of part-time and piece-rate workers are women, on contract for larger
factories or middlemen. The sub-sector also contains self-employed women, in
such businesses as tailors, leather working, traditional cosmetics, and print
shops. Lastly, the sub-sector has historically been an important point of re-
entry by migrant workers returning from the Middle-East -- an aspect that
takes on an added significance in Pakistan today.
3.          The primary obstacle to microenterprise development in Pakistan is
extremely limited access to credit, not the repayment ability. Aside from
seed capital by microentrepreneurs' own savings and subordinated debt from
family and friends, much of their financial needs are met in fragmented
informal financial markets via suppliers' credits, buyers' advances,
moneylenders, and an elaborate system of aparchis" (promissory notes). While
interest rates in the formal financial markets vary roughly between 10 and 17
percent per annum at present, those in the informal markets range between 2 to
4 percent por month (about 27 to 60 percent in effective annual terms -- rates
of moneylenders, for consumer and producer financing, are higher at around 75
percent per year). Thus, it is not subsidies that microenterprises need, but
greater access to credit at market prices. As in other countries, this
limited access has resulted from policies regulating the formal financial
sector, and inappropriate financial instruments or lending methodologies of
formal intermediaries especially concerning substitutes for collateral. The



secondary constraint to the sub-sector's development is an inadequate supply
of technical and social support services, which satisfy microentrepreneurs'
needs and which are provided to accommodate their particular business
conditions. Such technical services range from very basic ones (e.g. literacy
and accounting), marketing organizations (e.g. transport to local markets or
access to export facilities), product design, new material information, to
securing steady supplies of raw materials, and management training. Social
support services such as child care, health care and legal counseling are in
greater demand in the sub-sector's poorest segments and particularly among
women.
4.          The size, business character and needs of microenterprises vary
widely, but the spectrum has three principal groups. In the lower stratum are
borderline subsistence businesses, representing efforts of disadvantaged
individuals who are at the fringe of the economy and trying to integrate into
the productive economy. This group includes such businesses as repair shops,
bakeries, soap and candle making, and book binding, and has the largest
concentration of women workers and entrepreneurs. Financing needs of this
group are very small short-term loans to purchase supplies and tools. Non-
government organizations (NGOs) have been the sole provider of institutional
credit (as well as support services) to enterprises in this stratum,
innovating on group guarantee methodologies and the use of group savings as
collateral. In the middle stratum are relatively stable family businesses,
representing the bulk of microenterprises interested in expansion. The group
is populated by such businesses as carpet weaving, sporting goods (e.g. soccer
balls and cricket bats), flat cloth products, cutlery, and shoe making.
Financing needs of these enterprises are modest working capital to purchase
inputs. Such needs could constitute a profitable business niche for
commercial banks, but there has been an absence of formal institutions
providing such access. In the upper stratum are somewhat more sophisticated
businesses, which engage extensively in sub-contracting with the small-scale
end of the formal sector and for whom growing out of the microenterprise sub-
sector is a possibility. This group includes such activities as simple
electrical appliance (e.g. fans), iron gate and grill making, hand tools,
bicycle parts, and small surgical instruments. This is the group that
requires modest but medium-term funds for investment -- an access hitherto
generally denied by the banking system, but where financial leasing can
simultaneously provide funds and overcome the collateral problem.  Indeed, a
demonstrated business interest is emerging in the leasing industry,
specifically in one leasing company that has been specializing in small-scale
businesses and has initiated a marketing strategy to lease to such clients'
subcontractors in the microenterprise sub-sector.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed Project is the first
assistance to microenterprises by the Bank for Pakistan, and forms an integral
part of the Bank's country and sector assistance strategy in the medium term.
In the financial sector, it complements the Government's current reforms on
financial liberalization supported by the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan.
Previous Bank lending to small-scale industries has assisted small
establishments in the formal sector, but has failed to reach the
microenterprise sub-sector. Through a series of such assistance, however, the



- 3 -
Bank has gained experience and understanding about the underlying causes for
the sub-sector's credit access problem: Financial sector liberalization is
necessary but not sufficient for lifting this particular aspect of financial
repression; the client character is such that microenterprise lending demands
fundamental innovation in lending techniques and instruments; and NGOs'
lending methodologies provide key features of such innovation in short-term
lending, while financial leasing presents itself as a promising instrument for
medium-term lending. As such, the Project is proposed as a gilot one: It
would focus its assistance on those private-sector initiatives present or
emerging today in NGOs and leasing to strengthen and reach a larger
constituency, thereby demonstrating the replicability of financial innovations
in these initiatives as a sustainable business along with the market credit-
worthiness of microentrepreneurs including women. In the social sector, as a
pilot effort, the proposed Project promotes the Government's interest to
pursue poverty alleviation strategy that does not impose excessive fiscal
burden by demonstrating how to make better use of private sector initiatives
and market mechanisms. In the trade and industrial sector, again as a pilot,
it supports the Government's outward-oriented structural adjustment objectives
by demonstrating one approach to mitigate the social cost of adjustment in the
socially and economically disadvantaged, most labor-intensive, yet supply-
responsive sub-sector. In all of the above, the Bank's involvement is called
for to help ensure a sustainable development of new instruments, approaches,
and required institutional capacity, and to provide additional resources
otherwise unavailable. The Bank's involvement is also called for to effect
the transfer of best international experiences in microenterprise lending, the
lessons from which having already shaped the project design. Lastly, the Bank
has also been asked to take the leadership in stimulating the interest of
other donors in microenterprises and to coordinate their assistance.
6.          Proiect Objectives.  In initiating the Bank assistance for micro-
enterprises in Pakistan, the proposed Project focuses on those private-sector
initiatives that are present or emerging in NGOs and leasing industry. In
this context of a pilot effort, the proposed Project has the following
objectives: (i) to strengthen the capacity of participating institutions in
delivering financial, as well as technical and/or social, services to
microenterprises; (ii) to assist these institutions to deliver their services
to a larger constituency of microenterprises; (iii) to broaden the menu of
financial instruments available for microenterprises in the upper stratum, by
promoting the initiative to market leasing to sub-contractors of small-scale
businesses; (iv) to catalyze NGOs' financial, technical and social support
services for microenterprises in the lower stratum; (v) to demonstrate the
replicability of the NOOs' and leasing initiatives to others, including
commercial banks who could potentially see microenterprises in the middle to
upper strata as a promising market niche; (v) to demonstrate the
creditworthiness of microentrepreneurs, including and particularly women, at
market prices and practices; and (vi) to promote the development of businesses
owned and operated by women.
7.          Project Description.  The proposed Project would provide funds for
(i) short-term loans to microenterprises in the lower stratum for working
capital and tools, through co-financing with the Netherlands (US$1.7 million),



and (ii) lease contracts for equipment to both small-scale businesses and
microenterprises in the upper stratum, as the Bank loan (US$26 million). The
Netherlands will provide the US$1.7 million as grants initially to four NGOs
(Agha Khan Rural Support Program, Orangi Pilot Project, Basic Urban Services
for Katchi Abadies, and Alfalah Development Institute) as seed capital for
their revolving credit operations, which should become financially self-
sustaining at the completion of the project. Funds would be utilized for
short-term loans (6-24 months) at prevailing market rates, and be made
available only to established and operational microenterprises. In the case
of women entrepreneurs, however, start-up firms would be eligible. The Bank
loan of US$26.0 million would be on-lent by the Government through the
administrating institution (BEL) to a private leasing company, Orix Leasing
Pakistan Ltd. (OLP) and other eligible leasing companies. The leasing
companies would bear the credit risks, and will be responsible for appraising
lease contracts in accordance with Bank agreed criteria. OLP would effect its
strategic marketing plan to take advantage of existing sub-contracting
business arrangements between small and microenterprises, and finance at
prevailing market lease rates those lease contracts of established and
operational small-scale and microenterprises. A technical assistance
component of US$1.1 million, co-financed by the Netherlands, would provide
funds to: (i) assist NGOs in training their staff and to adapt their credit
procedures and supervision information systems, to enable expansion of their
credit and support service programs; (ii) provide technical business support
services to microentrepreneurs on a demand-driven basis, with the NGOs, OLP
and other leasing companies as implementing agencies; (iii) conduct a study
assessing the development impact of the proposed Project, to be completed in
two years after its effectiveness not later than December 31, 1992; and (iv)
conduct regular supervision and monitoring reviews and a performance
evaluation two years after effectiveness to be completed not later than
October 31, 1993. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in Schedules C, D and E
respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 9070-PAK
dated March 28, 1991 is being distributed separately.
8.          Agreed Actions.  During negotiations agreements with the
Government on the following were reached.
(i) Eligibility criteria of particiRating NGOs.  It was agreed
that all participating NGOs will be required to meet the following conditions:
(a) approval of satisfactory policy, procedures and strategy statements by
their boards; (b) employment of competent staff to manage and administer
credit operations, or existence of a clear plan to build up such a capability
with technical assistance; (c) employment of competent managing directors and
project directors acceptable to the Bank; (d) establishment of a separate and
independent unit for credit operations; and (e) agreement to a performance
evaluation two years after the Project effectiveness. All four NGOs selected
were found to be in compliance with the agreed eligibility criteria at
appraisal. Continuing compliance would be monitored during project



-5-
implementation. Any other NGOs interested in participating will be subject to
the same assessment vis-a-vis the eligibility criteria.
(ii) Eligibility criteria of particiDating leasing companies. It
was agreed that OLP, or any other leasing company, will be required to meet
the following conditions: (a) approval of satisfactory policy, procedures and
strategy statements by the company's board; (b) a clean audit by external
auditors in accordance with internationally accepted accounting principles;
(c) compliance with existing and new prudential regulations; (d) sound
financial condition including maintenance of a maximum debt:equity ratio of
10:1 and a minimum debt service ratio of 1.25; and (e) agreement to a
performance evaluation two years after the Project effectiveness. OLP was
found to be in compliance with the agreed eligibility criteria at appraisal.
Continuing compliance would be monitored during project implementation. Any
other leasing companies interested in participating will be subject to the
same assessment vis-a-vis the eligibility criteria.
(iii) The on-lending arrangement. The credit component funded by
the Netherlands as grant will be handled by the NGOs that meet the agreed
eligibility criteria. The participating NGOs will initially include four
institutions. The proposed grant of US$1.7 million will be allocated to these
four NGOs as follows: US$1.0 million to Agha Khan Rural Support Program;
US$325,000 to Alfalah Development Institute; US$245,000 to Basic Urban
Services for Katchi Abadies; and US$100,000 to Orangi Pilot Project. It was
agreed that a re-allocation of outstanding grant commitments among the four
NGOs and any other eligible NGOs will be considered at the time of the two-
year performance review. The credit component financed by the Bank will be
handled by leasing companies that meet the agreed eligibility criteria. The
participating leasing company will initially be OLP. The proposed Bank loan
of US$26.0 million will thus be allocated to OLP, A re-allocation of
outstanding commitment to any other eligible leasing companies will be
considered any time during the project implementation.
(iv) On-lending rates and foreign exchange risk. The sub-loans
and lease contracts under the proposed Project will be denominated in Rupees.
It was agreed that the Government will pass on the Netherlands' funds as
grants to enable each NGO to build a revolving fund as a self-sustaining
financing program. The NGOs will on-lend to microenterprises at prevailing
market rates (currently between 15-22 percent per annum), sufficient to cover
each NGO's opportunity cost of funds, administration costs, provision for
losses and net annual surplus to support growth. The Government will on-lend
the Bank's funds through the administrating institution (BEL) to OLP and other
eligible leasing companies, the on-lending rate will be a variable rate
adjusted at the same frequency as the Bank's rate. The on-lending rate to the
leasing companies would include the Bank prevailing rate plus the prevailing
fee for foreign exchange risk coverage as determined by the State Bank which
is adjusted from time to time and a fixed spread of 0.75 percent per annum.
The fixed spread is composed of 0.25 percent per annum, representing the
average commitment fees incurred by the Government over the life of the loan,
and a 0.50 percent per annum for administration cost. The adjusted rate will
be applied to the aggregate equivalent amount withdrawn and outstanding



expressed in rupees. In view of the fact that small and micro-entrepreneurs
do not possess means to hedge against the foreign exchange risk, it was agreed
that the Government will bear the risk. The participating leasing companies
would also provide a third party guarantee to the Government.
9.          Environment Aspects.  Because of their size and type of
activities, sub-loans and leases financed under this project would have an
exceptionally low probability of causing environmental damage. Nevertheless,
in the case of the leasing component, each sub-borrower will be required to
comply with the environmental protection regulations of the Government. The
environmental authorities will carry out an assessment of the adequacy of the
environmental protection measures in the lease contracts. Sub-borrowers will
be required to submit evidence of clearance from the environmental authorities
that any environmental concerns identified would be addressed through
appropriate measures. During the implementation of the proposed Project,
regular reporting to the environmental offices would be required to ensure
continued compliance. This approach to environmental protection would be
reflected in the policy and strategy statements of the participating leasing
company, which would have to be approved by its boards and be satisfactory to
the bank. The Bank has provided to the participating leasing company
guidelines covering various aspects of environmental protection to assist them
in the environmental assessment.
10.         Mnefits. The Project's direct beneficiaries among micro-
enterprises will necessarily be extremely limited relative to the size of the
sub-sector. By itself, therefore, the Project cannot claim to generate a
significant improvement in incomes of the economically handicapped population,
in the labor force participation of women, nor in additional employment. It
is hoped, however, that this pilot Project would demonstrate the replicability
of financial innovations and initiatives in the private sector as sustainable
businesses, ard demonstrating the credit-worthiness of microentrepreneurs
including women at market prices and practices. The NGOs expect to reach out
to about 2,300 microenterprises, and OLP projects to serve about 3,500 clients
of whom at least 2,500 would be microenterprises.
11.         Rlsks.  The risks relate to the institutional capacity of the
participating institutions. The NGOs must strengthen their experience in
project-based lending on a scale larger than before. The participating
leasing company must accumulate further the experience to lend to the informal
sector. The Bank frequent quality supervision and technical assistance would
thus be critical, not only for the planned implementation of this pilot but
also for its intended demonstration effects and the associated sustainability
of such assistance to microenterprises in the future. The supervision and
technical assistance aim to (i) shorten loan processing, (ii) strengthen the
N¢Os' supervision and loan collection systems, and (iii) alleviate demand-
side problems of implementation. Loan recovery by the NGOs may also be
considered a risk, but experience in other developing countries (Indonesia,
India, Bangladesh) indicates this risk to be significantly below that
associated with traditional borrowers of formal credit institutions, due to
safeguards in lending methodologies that are adapted to the community-based
culture of microenterprises.

12.         Recommendtio. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
