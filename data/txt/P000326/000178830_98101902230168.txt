INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A COCOA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the United Republic of Cameroon for the equivalent of US$6.5 million to help
finance a cocoa project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including six
years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum. The Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (France) would make a loan for the same project equiv-
alent to US$5.5 million for 20 years, including five years of grace, with in-
terest at 3.5 percent per annum. Fonds d'Aide et de Coope'ration (France) would
provide US$1 million towards project costs as a grant.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon" (No. 72-247)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27, 1972. An updating
mission visited the country in May/June 1973. A basic economic mission is
planned for FY 1975 to coincide with the preparation of Cameroon's Fourth
Development Plan (FY 77-81).
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon's natural resources are varied, although not abundant.
Soils and climatic conditions permit cultivation of a wide range of crops and
provide substantial agricultural potential. These crops include oil palm and
rubber in the south, cocoa and coffee in the central region, and rice, ground-
nuts, cotton, sorghum and millet in the north. The forest areas of the south-
east contain large untapped timber resources, and in the north there is good
potential for livestock.
4.        While the main opportunities for development lie in the expansion
of agricultural production, Cameroon also has an industrial potential. It
comprises not only the production of import substitutes needed for a growing
domestic market, but also processing of local raw materials, particularly
agricultural and forestry products, for export.
5.        A prerequisite to promoting agricultural, forestry and industrial
development is an adequate transport system. Cameroon is a large country
with its three main economic centers (West, South, and North) separated by
vast underpopulated areas. In addition, the country serves as one of the
main export routes for landlocked Chad and CAR. Hence, commerce, transport



- 2 -
and transit services are important activities, and considerable investments
in a port, road, and railroad infrastructure are needed to develop Cameroon's
economy and to strengthen its role as a regional trade center.
Past Performance
6.        During the first decade of independence (1960-70) the Government
made serious efforts to lay the groundwork for accelerated economic devel-
opment and to step up the mobilization of financial resources for this pur-
pose. In spite of internal political difficulties during the early 1960's
and of administrative constraints arising from Cameroon's top-heavy federal
structure, these efforts have been quite successful. During the 1960's real
CDP grew at an average rate of over six percent a year and owing to prudent
financial policies the Government was able to finance a rising proportion of
public investment from domestic savings.
7.        The sectoral distribution of public investment corresponded to
the country's development requirements. By far the largest part of public
investment was devoted to lifting the most immediate development constraint,
namely the shortcomings of the transport network. Conscious of the lack of
trained manpower at all levels, the Government also emphasized the expansion
and improvement of education. Numerous new schools were opened, school
enrollment soared and a beginning was made with the reform of education.    In
agriculture, the Government promoted crop diversification through projects for
rubber, oil palm, cotton and rice and made a beginning with the rehabilitation
of existing coffee and cocoa plantings. Cash crop production rose steadily
throughiout the 1960's due to good prices and favorable weather conditions.
In industry, the Government's efforts were limited to providing financial
support for key projects and maintaining a liberal investment climate that
led to an increase in private foreign investment and quick expansion of
manufacturing capacity, particularly in the field of import substitution.
8.        In the early 1970's economic growth slowed down to less than 4
percent annually in real terms because of declining world prices for cocoa
and coffee and a decline in foreign private investment. Nevertheless, Gov-
ernment managed to increase budgetary savings through improved tax collec-
tion, better expenditure control, and a modest rise in tax rates. Public
investment rose, however, even faster, partly to compensate for the decline
in private investment and activity. The result was a drawdown of treasury
reserves and an increase in external debt. With an estimated debt service
ratio in 1973 of 6 percent, Cameroon was not faced with a significant debt
problem. The increase in cocoa, coffee and timber prices in 1973 and early
1974 led to some improvement in the balance of payments, and a modest recov-
ery in foreign exchange reserves. At the same time, the drought in the
north annihilated much of the cotton crop and affected yields of food and
cash crops. Moreover, with rapidly rising prices of vital imports a deter-
ioration in Cameroon's terms of trade is expected for the next few years.
This will lead to increasing external financing requirements and a higher
debt service ratio (see paragraph 13) while keeping future growth of the
economy well below the rate achieved in the 1960's.



- 3-
Prospects and Development Strategy
9.        Further economic growth will also depend on the extent to which
the Government will come to grips with several structural problems that have
come to the fore in recent years and of which the Government and foreign de-
velopment partners are increasingly aware: (i) agriculture, which will re-
main the mainstay of the economy, suffers from the lack of financial and
technical assistance for small farmers who produce more than 95 percent of
thie country's agricultural products; (ii) migration from the countryside to
the cities continues at a rapid rate, creating serious problems of empi'oyment,
housing, infrastructure, and social services. The Government intends to devote
increased attention to migration and urban problems and has asked the Bank for
advice. In the industrial sector, a revision of policies is necessary to re-
store foreign investors' confidence which in recent years had suffered from
the effects of slow and cumbersome administrative procedures; (iii) in spite
of massive investments in recent years, the basic transport infrastructure is
still insufficient to meet the country's requirements. The Douala port and
the Douala-Yaounde section of the railroad require improvements and the road
system needs to be adapted to traffic growth and the development of new agri-
cultural and forestry areas.
10.       To resolve these problems, action on two fronts is essential.   First,
the Government will have to strengthen its capability to prepare and implement
projects, especially in agriculture, transport and industry. Second, a major
effort will be needed to mobilize more doniestic and external resources for
Cameroon's sizeable public investment program.
11.       Progress is being made on the first objective.   In 1972 President
.hidjo's policy of national integration culminated in a successful referendum
which abolished the former federated states and replaced the cumbersome fed-
eral structure by a strong central government.   Within the newly established
federal ministries special planning units for project and policy formulation
are being created.
12.       Thus, the Ministry of Transport is strengthening its planning cap-
ability with technical assistance financed by UNDP and the Bank Group (Loan
935-CM/Credit 429-21 for the Second Hlligiway Project).  In agriculture the new
Ministry of Agriculture, a national fund for rural development (Fonds National
pour le Developpement Rural - FONADER) and special crop development corporations
(such as the project agency set up to implemrent the proposed cocoa project)
are designed to give new impetus to rural development. Nevertheless, further
substantial efforts are necessary in this respect.
13.       As far as the financing of public investments is concerned, public
savings are likely to cover in the future a smaller part than in the past,
even assuming continued good fiscal performance. With budgetary revenues
already reaching 20 percent of GDP, future Government revenues cannot be
expected to increase much faster than tile economy as a whole, while current



expenditures will have to be stepped up in line with recent substantial pub-
lic investments in transport infrastructure, education and health. Further-
more, public debt service charges will rapidly increase. As a consequence,
in the next five years public savings after debt service will probably not
exceed 30 percent of public investments, as compared with about 40 percent,
after debt service, over the past few years. Hence, Cameroon will have to
rely on external financing for the bulk of its public investments. Bilateral
and other sources outside the Bank Group are expected to contribute about 70
percent of the country's external requirements. Increasing reliance on foreign
borrowing during a period of relatively slow economic growth and an expected
worsening of Cameroon's terms of trade will require very careful foreign debt
management. Even assuming that 50 percent of foreign public capital inflow be
at very concessionary terms, the foreign debt service ratio would increase to
about 12 percent by 1980 compared with 6 percent in 1973.
14.       Cameroon's ability to make effective use of external resources and
the Government's dedication to development are reasons for increased external
support. With rising debt service absorbing an increasing share of gross
public savings, Cameroon can make only a modest contribution to the financing
of future public investment. To avoid further rapid buildup of debt service,
lenders, including the Bank Group, should provide a large part of their as-
sistance on concessionary terms. They should also be prepared to finance a
high proportion of project costs including, as in the present project, a part
of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
15.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of June 30, 1974 and includes notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to US$157 million and
cover twelve projects: four in agriculture, five in transportation, two in
education and one in public utilities. With recent loans and credits for
highway and railway projects, transportation remains the sector receiving the
largest share (57 percent) of our past commitments followed by agriculture
(27 percent). Although delays, setbacks and cost overruns have been occasion-
ally encountered in the execution of the projects, the Government has always
been willing to collaborate with the Bank in determining and applying satis-
factory solutions.
16.       For the future, the Bank Group's strategy is to support the Govern-
ment in its efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to accelerate
rural development and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
17.       Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investments to this sector. The Bank Group,
together with bilateral institutions, has substantially helDed the Govern-
ment develop adequate transport facilities. The Second Highway Project of



1973 will help complete the establishment of the basic trunk road system.
The recently approved Second Railway Project will take care of urgent track
and capacity improvements on the Douala-Yaounde line. Given sharp traffic
increases and the backlog of required investments, massive injections of
capital will still be necessary in the years ahead, particularly for the
expansion of the port of Douala and further improvement of the transport
corridor which links it with the capital, Yaounde. Future road investments
would mainly be for road maintenance and feeder roads to provide links to
local markets and facilitate exploitation of Cameroon's forests, a major
area for future development.
18.       In agriculture we have been able to help the Government to divers-
ify production by financing oil palm and rubber plantations in the east and
west and rice irrigation in the north. The recently approved livestock proj-
ect provides for cattle ranches in the northwest, center and east, a tsetse
fly extermination campaign, animal slaughtering and meat retailing facilities,
and credit to private livestock holders. The proposed cocoa rehabilitation
and planting project is desigRed to modernize cocoa growing by smallholders and
raise rural productivity in an area south and west of the capital. An integrated
rural development project in a populated but poor region in the north is under
consideration for FY 76. Thus, Bank Group lending to agriculture supports the
Government's efforts to modernize the sector and to correct economic imbalances
through the development of a hitherto lagging sector. Outside agriculture and
transportation, we are actively considering a first small-scale industries
project and a third education project with special emphasis on rural education
and training.
19.       In all our projects we will, as in the past, include training, tech-
nical assistance and other provisions necessary for strengthening institutions
and improving sector policies. Besides, through our economic work, we will
continue to advise the authorities, at their request, on development questions
in general, and subjects such as economic management, problems of urban migra-
tion, and manpower development in particular.
20.       Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in seven out of twelve projects, financing arrangements have been
either joint or parallel. French assistance agencies, which made a parallel
loan for the recent Second Railway Project, would join us in financing the
proposed cocoa project.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CAMEROON
21.       Close to 80% of the population still depends on agriculture which
accounts for about 32 percent of GDP and for 70 percent of the value of exports,
comprised principally of cocoa, coffee and cotton. The traditional sector ac-
counts for over 90 percent of agricultural productJ--n, with large state owned



- 6 -
plantationis, imainly of oil-palmi1 and rubber, accounting for the balance.  Some
950,000 smallholders cultivate plots averaging about 2 ha. Labor is generally
supplied by the family.
22.       Cameroon is largely self-sufficient in food products; the exceptions
are rice and wheat, which are being imported in increasing amounts, and lesser
imports of sugar and meat also take place. Although food crop production is
keeping slightly ahead of population growth, major urban centers are experien-
cing increasing supply problems. Food crop marketing is not regulated, and
is largely in the hands of private traders, most of whom operate over small
areas and withi a snall turnover.
23.       For the main export crops, production increased by about 5 percent
annually during the late 1960s, but growth hias slowed down in recent years.
Marketing is highly organized, and Government intervenes by fixing guar-
anteed producer prices and licensing private exporters. This intervention
is implemented through Stabilization Funds (cocoa, robusta coffee, arabica
coffee, cotton, and groundnuts) in the Eastern part, and a Mlarketing Board
in the Western part; these agencies are now being merged.
24.       Agricultural credit consists mainly of marketing loans for the main
export crops, and is provided by the Bianque Camerounaise de Developpement and
comnercial banks.  Production credit to inicividual farmers is small in amount,
and linmited to participants in specific progranis and projects. Agricultural
credit for production purposes is provided by the recently created FONADER.
25.       Agricultural development has so far been hampered by the fragmen-
tation and weakniess of the Government services responsible for project pre-
paration and implemlentation.  The creation in 1972 of central Mfinistries of
Agriculture and Livestock, replacing the previously separate state administra-
tions, has improved the situation, but these Ministries are not yet adequately
staffed. Furthermore, there is a need to coordinate research and training,
now the responsibility of several Ministries. The Government is, however,
making efforts to centralize and coordinate rural development activities.
PART IV - TIlE PROJECT
Background and Purpose
26.       Cameroon is the world's -ifth largest producer of cocoa.   The area
planted is estimated at 3o0,000 ha; annual production over the last three
years has averaged 110,000 tons of dried beans or about 7 percent of world
production and lhas accounted for 30 percenit of the value of Cameroon's exports.
Cocoa provides a livelitood for about 1 million rural inhabitants.   It is
mostly cultivated by family labor on small farmls of about 2 to 3 ha. Average
yields are low. One reason is a general low level of mLaintenance. The prin-
cipal reason for low yields however is black pod, a fungus disease, which



destroys the cocoa pods. It is estimated that about 50 percent of the annual
crop is lost to black pod. The proposed project is designed to assist the
Government primarily in its efforts to increase production within Cameroon's
quota under the international cocoa agreement through black pod control and
improvement of input supply, credit, infrastructure, extension services, and
marketing.
27.       The proposed project would be financed jointly with the French agen-
cies Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC), and Cameroonian Government.   The feasibility study for the
proposed project was prepared by Societe d'Etudes pour le Developpement
Economique et Social (SEDES) in 1972-73 and the project was appraised by a
Bank mission in October/November 1973. The appraisal report, Appraisal of a
Cocoa Project No. 462-CM dated August 1, 1974 is being circulated separately
to the Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is in Annex III of
this report. Negotiations for a loan were held in Washington in June 1974
with a Cameroonian delegation headed by Mr. Tchoungui, Cameroon's Ambassador
to the United States, and comprising Directors-General of SODECAO and FONADER.
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique and Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation
were also represented at negotiations.
Project Description
28.       The project would aim at raising farmers' incomes, the country's
foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues by increasing the produc-
tion of cocoa. It would be carried out over a six-year development period
and would involve:
(a) rehabilitating some 35,000 ha of existing cocoa and planting
up to 15,000 ha of new land with high-yielding hybrid cocoa;
(b) strengthening the extension services, to help farmers control
disease and improve their cultivation practices and to supply
them with the necessary inputs and credit facilities;
(c) providing training for some 230 extension workers and 2,000
new cocoa farmers;
(d) improving 950 km of rural roads;
(e) adaptive research on cocoa and food crop cultivation;
(f) equipping and staffing the new agency, SODECAO, to carry out
the project and take over responsibility for the development
of cocoa production in the area;



- 8-
(g) employing consultants to:
(i) advise on the organization of the new agency;
(ii) evaluate the progress and impact of the project;
(iii) prepare a follow-up project; and
(h) encouraging the formation of farmers' groups that would
increase the role of farmers in marketing and credit.
Project Execution
29.       The ZAPI, a development agency, which is presently responsible for
agricultural development over most of the project area, has been criticized
for its lack of attention to production; and its marketing policies have
proved unpopular with farmers. To stimulate participation in the project,
therefore, a new authority, Societe de Developpement du Cacao (SODECAO), has
been established that would absorb, gradually and selectively, ZAPI's func-
tions and staff.
30.       SODECAO would be generally responsible for the execution of the
project.  It would make arrangements with other agencies for the execution
of certain project components such as farm input supply (with FONADER), road
improvement, and research. SODECAO's senior management would consist of a
General Director, a Deputy General Director in charge of technical affairs,
a Deputy Technical Director, a Marketing and Credit Director, a Senior
Inspector and a Chief Accountant. Covernment has already appointed a
Cameroonian General Director and a Deputy General Director whose qualifica-
tions and experience are satisfactory to the Bank. The posts of Senior
Inspector and Chief Accountant would be filled through international recruit-
ment and after Bank approval of the qualifications and experience of the
candidates (Section 3.01 of the Project Agreement). From the beginning,
local staff would be trained to take over the functions of some expatriates
after periods ranging from three to six years.
31.       SODECAO would engage consultants to:   (a) advise on its organiza-
tion and the takeover of activities from ZAPI, (b) assess the progress and
impact of project, and (c) carry out a feasibility study for a follow-up
project.
32.       SODECAO would encourage the formation of farmers' groups which would
gradually take over marketing functions, including storage, and enter into
direct contracts with exporters. The earnings of such groups from marketing
margins and quality and quantity bonuses would be distributed to farmer mem-
bers after meeting their costs.
Project Costs and Financing Arrangements
33.       Project costs, including contingencies of US$7.0 million, are esti-
mated at US$22.6 million net of taxes, with a foreign exchange component of
US$9.5 million or 42 percent. Including taxes, tocal project costs would
amount to US$23.8 million.



- 9 -
34.       The Bank would make a loan of US$6.5 million to Government for a
20 year term including a grace period of six years. The balance of US$17.3
million would be covered by French bilateral sources (US$6.5 million), by
farmer contributions (US$0.7 million), and by budgetary allocations (US$10.1
million). The proposed Bank loan and the French contribution would cover
the fore'gn exchange cost of the project and a portion of local currency
expenditures. The Bank loan would not become effective until Government
fulfilled necessary conditions for disbursement of the French contribution
(Section 6.01 of the Loan Agreement). The proceeds of the Bank loan and the
French contribution would be passed on to SODECAO and FONADER together with
the Government's contribution as grants in accordance with financing agree-
ments whose execution and delivery are conditions of effectiveness (Section
6.01 of the Loan Agreement); the Bank has reviewed and approved drafts of
these agreements. It is proposed that some US$150,000 of the proceeds of
the loan be used for retroactive financing of the cost of expatriate salaries
and other expenditures incurred prior to the signing of the Loan Agreement.
35.       The project would provide fungicides and sprayers to individual
farmers and building materials and equipment for collection centers to farmer
groups. All items would be made available for cash or on credit; the credit
price would be up to 20 percent above the cash price, to cover bad debts and
interest and service charges.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Items financed by the Bank loan would be procured as follows:
(i) One grader, thirteen passenger cars, and two-wheeled vehicles have
already been ordered with Bank approval through negotiated purchases on the
basis of quotations from local suppliers, in order to facilitate the start-up
of the project. These amount to US$150,000 and would be financed retroactively;
(ii) Office furniture and equipment, and small spare parts would be similarly
procured; (iii) All other items, including equipment and vehicles costing US$1
million, and amounting in total to some US$3.5 million, would be procured in
accordance with Bank guidelines on the basis of international competitive
bidding. Manufactured goods originating in UDEAC countries would be allowed
a preference equal to the lower of (a) 15 percent or (b) applicable duties;
(iv) The services of expatriate personnel and consultants would be secured
according to procedures acceptable to the Bank.
37.       The French agencies would finance 100 percent of the cost of training,
research and studies; 46 percent of the personnel and operation and maintenance
costs of the road program; and 32 percent of the cost of pest control. The
procurement of items for these activities would be subject to the procedures
of these agencies.
38.       Proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbursed to cover:
(a) 58 percent of the cost of SODECAO's administrative staff
(US$2.8 million);



- 10 -
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures or 90 percent of local
expenditures on vehicles and equipment for SODECAO's admin-
istrative staff and for road construction equipment (US$0.9
million); and
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures on sprayers and fungicides
(US$0.8 million).
The balance of US$2.0 million represents contingencies, which would be un-
allocated.
Markets and Prices
39.       Growing conditions in West Africa have been generally poor in the
last three years, and this has intensified the supply-depressing impact of
limited investment and abandonment of low-yielding plantings following the
low cocoa prices during the early 1960's. The average world cocoa price
during 1973 was higher at US465/lb. The current Bank forecast is for a 1980
price of about USJ47/lb, in average 1973/1974 prices, and this has been used
in the economic and financial analyses.   Cameroon has been allocated a quota
of 129,000 tons, well above the average production of 110,000 tons during
the past three years. The International Cocoa Agreement is unlikely to exert
any significant constraint on cocoa production and exports in the medium term.
Cameroon's market prospects are firm at least through 1980, and no difficulties
are anticipated in selling the project's output.
Economic Justification
40.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 26 percent using market
prices. Cost increases of 10 and 25 percent, or benefit decreases of similar
proportions, would lower the rate of return to about 23 percent and 19 percent
respectively. Simultaneous cost increases and benefit reductions of 25 percent
would bring the rate down to about 12 percent.    Since total control of black
pod is difficult to achieve, the effect of a serious shortfall from project
targets for this component of the project has been calculated. This shows
that if only about one third of the expected benefits from rehabilitation
were obtained, the rate of return for the project would still be 10 percent.
The risk of such a shortfall is considered to be small, particularly since
the average increases on yields have been conservatively estimated. Further-
more, the project has been charged with the entire cost of:
(a) the rehabilitation of rural roads, while no account has been
taken of the benefits accruing to nonproject activities, such
as the marketing of food crops, general goods and nonproject
cocoa; and
(b) the research and studies, although benefits from these activ-
ities have not been taken into account.



- 11 -
Excluding the cost of these components, the economic rate of return would be
35 percent. Rates of return have been calculated for the rehabilitation and
new plantings components separately, although allocation of project agency
costs is necessarily arbitrary. The rates are 32 percent for rehabilitation
and 20 percent for new plantings.
41.       The improvement of agricultural institutions, training of local
technicians in advanced cocoa technology and extension, and encouragement of
farmers association would permit an expansion of the project concept through-
out the cocoa growing area. Furthermore, the experience of cocoa replanting
acquired through the present project's research component would allow this
expansion to take place in more densely populated and poorer cocoa areas.
The experience gained by the project in establishing SODECAO, training ex-
tension workers and farmers, and encouraging cooperative action by farmers
should provide a sound basis for future projects of a similar kind.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Cameroon and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Societe de Developpe-
ment du Cacao (SODECAO), the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft reso-
lution approving the loan are being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors.
43.       Features of the Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement of parti-
cular interest are referred to in paragraphs 34 and 30, respectively, of this
report.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490 CAMDEV Project: US$11 million Credit of March
28, 1967; Closing Date: June 30, 1972 and
US$7 million Loan to CAMDEV of same date;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
The original planting program of 11,500 ha has been reduced by elim-
inating 1,000 ha of tea. Project implementation is satisfactory but last year
cash funds had been seriously depleted by cost increases due to general infla-
tion, lower than expected yields from non-project plantings and excessive over-
heads. lhowever, Goverrunent agreed to implement econom1y measures which, coupled
with better management and higher commodity prices, have already improved the
CAMDEV cash position into one of considerable strengtih.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp Ln. No. 886   Oil Palm Project:   US$7.9 million Loan
to Sopame of April 15, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976 and US$1.7 million
Supplemental Loan of April 9, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
After successful initial implementation significant cost overruns
occurred and it was found that one of the two oil palm estate sites was un-
satisfactory. A substantial part of the cost overrun was due to the under-
estimation of price inflation when the project was first appraised. Following
reappraisal in 1972 the project was modified from 9,000 ha to 8,500 ha but es-
timated production will remain unchanged as higher yields are now anticipated.
The project is now on schedule and proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 604 Wqater Supply Project; US$5 million Loan to SNEC of June 2,
1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974 (Original Closing
Date: MIay 31, 1972).
This project was completed ahead of schedule with substantial savings
which have been approved for investi,ment in further water distribution works;
however, disbursemenits have lagged due to the strong working capital position
of the borrower and the closing date has been postponed thrice in order to
allow remaining funds to be disbursed. The Borrower has informed us that it
has completed 75 percent of distribution works and requested a final six months
prolongation up to Deceraber 31, 1974 to complete them.   Remaining balance of
the loan is US$218,000.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that tlhey
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengtlhs and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 161 First Education Project; US$10.5 million Credit of September
23, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1975 (original Closing
Date: June 30, 1974).
The Project is 12 months behind schedule, due to delays in (i) selec-
ting the consultants and the specialists for the technical assistance program,
(ii) reaching agreement on the schedule of accommodation, (iii) revising the
bidding documents, (iv) starting construction works for which over-priced ini-
tial bids had to be cancelled for 16 project items, (v) awarding contracts,
and (vi) completing the lists of equipmlent. The project is now progressing
satisfactorily. The closing date has been extended to December 31, 1975 to
permit completion of project. It is forecast that the Project cost will
increase by about US$1.5 million, due to the devaluation of the US dollar
and the impact of the oil crisis.
Cr. No. 180, Ln. No. 663   liighway Project; US$7 million Credit of March
27, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974 and
US$12 million Loan of same date; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974; (Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1973).
This project had a slow start due primarily to administrative delays
on the part of the implementing ministries. By December 1971, all construc-
tion and consultants contracts were signed and work was proceeding satisfactorily.
Ilowever, during the 1973 rainy season, some completed sections, totalling 60 km,
of the Ngaoundere-Garoua road failed. IWork was resumed in November 1973 after
the contractor agreed to repair all failures at his own1 expense and the Govern-
ment to improve the design.
Ln. No. 687  Railway Project; US$5.2 million Loan to REGIFERCAM of June 9,
1970; Closing Date:  June 30, 1975; (Original Closing Date:
June 30, 1974).
Project execution has been satisfactory for track renewal work and
delivery of motive power and rolling stock.   Unforeseen teclnical difficulties,
such as extremely bad subsoil conditions, made lengthy studies necessary before
selecting the site and the optimum design of the new railway bridge at Japoma,
near Douala. Bids were called at the completion of studies and results showed
that funds of Loan No. 687 would be insufficient to cover the full construction
costs of the new bridge. Supplementary financing has been foreseen under the
recently approved Second Railway Project. The closing date has been extended
to June 30, 1975 to permit disbursemient on Japoma bridge.

Cr. No. 229  Douala Port Project:   US$1.5 million Credit of January 14,
1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1974 (Original Closing Date:
June 30, 1973).
After considerable delay in starting the project, largely because
of tinie consunming Government procedures involved, the project proceeded satis-
factorily. This credit is now fully disbursed.
Cr. No. 302 SEMRY Rice Project; US$3.7 million Credit of April 26, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project started in mid 1972 and is progressing satisfactorily.
Execution is largely on schedule with 83 percent of the US$3.7 million credit
disbursed. Despite the devaluation of the US dollar and costs related to addi-
tional works (financed by FAC and Government), the IDA credit would be suffi-
cient for project completion.
Cr. No. 320 Second Education Project; US$9 million Credit of June 28,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Due to delays in selecting the consulting architects, the date of
effectiveness specified in the Credit Agreement, October 2, 1972, has had to be
postponed to February 27, 1973. Due to delays in selecting two sites for the
construction of three Project items, the design period has been extended by six
months; however, no extension of the closing, date of June 30, 1979 is expected.
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935 Second hiighway Project: US$24 million Credit of
September 26, 1973, Closing Date: December 31,
1978 and US$24 million Loan of same date; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan and credit became effective on December 20, 1973. The bids
have been called and the Government is comiparing offers which are very signi-
ficantly above appraisal estimates due to recent price escalation.
LIl. No. 983  Livestock Project:  US$11.6 million Loan of NIay 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The Government is negotiating a contract for recruiting experts for
SODEPA, the project authority. The date of effectiveness specified in the Loan
Agreement, August 16, 1974, has been postponed to September 30, 1974 to allow
the Government to meet all the necessary cond(itions.
