A: Project Development and Global Objective
1. Project Development Objective
The overall objective of the Amazon Region Protected Areas Project (ARPA or "the Project") is
to expand and consolidate the protected areas (PAs) system in the Amazon region of Brazil. The
proposed Project would be the first phase (Phase 1) of a 10-year ARPA program. The Project's
objective will be achieved by:
*  Creating 18 million hectares in new protected areas (9 million hectares of "strict protection"
PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use"' PAs)
*  Consolidating the management of 7 million hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs in
addition to 9 million hectares of the newly created "strict protection" PAs
*  Establishing and operating an endowment fund to meet the recurrent costs of protected areas
*  Establishing and operating a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system at the protected
area and regional levels
2. Key Performance Indicators
The key performance indicators for Phase I are:
*  23 ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon analyzed for identification of new PAs
* 18 million hectares of new PAs (9 million hectares of "strict protection" PAs and 9 million
hectares of "sustainable use" PAs) created
*  7 million hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs and 3 million hectares of new "strict
protection" PAs consolidated and managed
*  An endowment fund for financial sustainability of existing "strict protection" PAs
established and capitalized with a minimum of US$14.5 million
* Demonstration projects for financial sustainability of PAs implemented
*  An environmental monitoring methodology for specific PAs defined and implemented
*  Program Committee, Conflict Mediation Committee, and two project coordination units
(one in the Ministry of Environment (MMA) and one in the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund
(FUNBIO) created and operational
Preparation for Phase 2 would begin after the following Phase 1 benchmarks have been met:
* Creation of 9 million hectares of new "strict protection" PAs
* Consolidation of 4 million hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs
* The endowment fund established, capitalized, and meeting performance benchmarks
I Sustainable use protected areas have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the communities
living in them. These protected areas are regulated by management plans that include various use zones, some of
which protect key environmental values of these areas, including, in particular, a "strict protection" zone. ARPA
will support only surveillance and enforcement activities in the "sustainable use" protected areas to ensure
ecological integrity and biodiversity conservation.

B: Strategic Context
la. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Goal Supported by the Project
(see Annex 1)
Document number: CAS: R2002-0098[IFC/R2002/0091]
Date of latest CAS discussion: June 13, 2002
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy document (R2002-0098[IFC/R2002/0091])
stresses that environmental management needs to become an integral part of Brazil's overall
development strategy. The CAS focuses in particular on policies that help reduce poverty and
contribute to, or are compatible with, renewed economic growth. This emphasis is further
elaborated in a section of the CAS document that addresses environmental and natural resource
management, with special attention given to persisting deforestation in the Amazon region. The
CAS identifies a strategy to deal with deforestation that is also incorporated into the design of
this Project. Deforestation is the result of a complex interplay of forces involving farming,
ranching, logging, mining, and other commercial pursuits; and is closely related to economic
factors such as inflation, capital availability, and land prices. Solutions are equally complex and
require combining the protection of priority ecosystems with balanced measures that reduce
poverty and develop sustainable alternatives for increasing the income of the local population.
The Brazilian government is experimenting with such alternatives through its Pilot Program to
Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest (PPG7) in which the World Bank (the Bank) plays a key
coordination and secretariat role. Interest in the conservation of some of the country's
environmental assets extends beyond Brazil as these assets provide internationally significant
externalities (for example, biodiversity, carbon sequestration). The proposed Project is fully
consistent with the CAS recommendations, particularly the need for protection of priority
ecosystems. It builds on the achievements of the PPG7 and earlier Global Environment Facility
(GEF) operations in Brazil.
lb. Global Operational Strategy/Program Objective Addressed by the Project
Occupying nearly one-half of the South American continent, Brazil has a wide range of climate
zones ranging from humid tropics to semiarid and temperate areas. These comprise several
ecologically differentiated biogeographical zones (biomes). Brazil contains the world's largest
standing contiguous tropical rain forest (Amazonian forests), the world's largest inland wetland
(Pantanal), expanses of semiarid thorn forests (Caatinga), vast tree and scrub woodlands
(Cerrado), and more than 7,000 linear kilometers of coastal and marine ecosystems. The
country's vast size and diversity of biomes contribute to a wide diversification of fauna and
flora. Brazil is acknowledged as the most biodiversity-rich country in the world (Mittermeier
1998). With more than 50,000 species of vascular plants (one-fifth of the world total), Brazil is
the most plant-rich country in the world. Areas such as the Atlantic forests and western Amazon
have been designated as biodiversity "hot spots" because of their floral diversity and endemism.
One in eleven of all world mammals (394 species) are found in Brazil, together with one in six
of all world birds (1576), one in fifteen of all reptiles (468), and one in eight of all amphibians
(502). Many of these species are also unique to Brazil, with 68 endemic mammnals, 191 endemic
birds, 172 endemic reptiles, and 294 endemic amphibians.
ARPA supports the GEF's Global Operational Strategy by contributing to the long-term
protection of Brazil's globally important ecosystems. Specifically, the Project supports
3



Operational Programs 3 (Forest Ecosystems) and 2 (Freshwater Ecosystems), and targets three
GEF priorities: (a) in situ conservation of globally unique biodiversity; (b) sustainable use of
biodiversity; and (c) local participation in the benefits of conservation activities. The Project is
fully consistent with Brazil's first report to the Conference of Parties (COP) IV. By supporting
all three levels of biodiversity (ecosystems, species, and genes), the Project is also fully
consistent with the principles of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and supports
COP Decisions I/8, II/8, II/9, III/9, III/10, and III/12, as well as the SBSTTA Recommendation
I/3.
The GEF is asked to finance the incremental cost of creating and consolidating new protected
areas in the Amazon region. The requested GEF grant would also support the implementation of
financial management and cost recovery mechanisms necessary to ensure the long-term
management and financial sustainability of both existing and newly created Amazon protected
areas.
2. Main Sector Issues and Government Strategy
The Brazilian Amazon occupies about five million square kilometers, a vast area equal in size to
the combined territory of 25 European countries. It is inhabited by 13 million people, a majority
of whom live in urban areas. The Amazon region encompasses the largest area of remaining
tropical rain forest on the planet (30 percent), containing carbon stores of around 120 billion
tons. Because the region is still relatively intact, it has a significant influence on both the
regional and global climates. The Brazilian Amazon contains 23 ecoregions and is the
repository of significant global biodiversity. According to the latest estimates, the region houses
approximately 2.5 million species of insects, tens of thousands of species of vascular plants, at
least 2,000 fish species, and 950 bird and 200 mammal species, offering some of the greatest
genetic diversity on the earth. According to the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI), the
region's indigenous population amounts to approximately 200,000 persons. The 206-known
ethnic groups surviving in the area, with close to 170 indigenous languages still spoken, reflect
the region's rich cultural diversity. There is no doubt that preserving a significant portion of the
Amazon rain forest is crucial for Brazil and for the world at large.
The extensive biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon is threatened by deforestation driven by
accelerated economic development, agricultural expansion, ranching, logging, mining, and
settlement policies. Vested interests, poverty, and an absence of environmentally sustainable
alternative economic activities exacerbate the situation. Consequences of these factors are
increased clearing and burning of tropical forests, degradation of watersheds, and over-
exploitation of wildlife and fisheries. In the Amazon, landless rural people continue to be settled
in inappropriate areas; timber extraction has increased as a result of growing participation by
foreign logging companies; and large tracts of forest are being converted to cattle pastures and
agricultural monocultures such as soybeans. Long-term solutions require measures to reduce
poverty, provide economically feasible and environmentally sustainable alternatives, and
strengthen the protection of priority ecosystems.
Brazil's federal and state governments have made many reforms, adopted national policies, and
signed international agreements to reduce deforestation and to increase environmentally friendly
policies for sustainable development that are key to the Amazon challenges: (a) the adoption of
4



a "green protocol," requiring banks and lending agencies to incorporate environmental criteria
into funded projects, is now institutionalized; (b) in 1992, the Brazilian federal government
ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD); (c) there has been a trend for the
devolution of environmental management to states and municipalities; (d) a "green sales tax"
(ICMs verde) for biodiversity protection has been introduced in some states; (e) in 1998, the
amount of private land holdings in the Amazon required to be kept as "legal forest reserves"
increased from 50 to 80 percent; (f) improved land tax collection and legislative reform allows
for forested lands to be considered "in productive use"; (g) in 1998, the Environmental Crimes
Law was passed allowing for the prosecution of environmental violators; (h) in 1999, the
government declared a temporary ban on mahogany extraction in Amazon forests.
Conservation and sustainable development of the Amazon region. To implement the
environmental policies itemized above, the Brazilian government has developed over the past
10 years many programs and projects. The Pilot Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest
(PPG7) is the most comprehensive effort by the federal and state governments to support the
preservation and sustainable use of Amazon ecosystems. The PPG7 started its operations in
1992, and supports pilot projects aimed at optimizing the environmental benefits offered by rain
forest ecosystems in a way that is consistent with Brazil's development goals. At the request of
the G-7 countries and Brazil, the World Bank coordinates the PPG7, supervises the program's
ongoing projects, and administers the PPG7's Rain Forest Trust Fund (RFT). With currently
about US$300 million in grant funds provided by the G-7 countries, the European Union, the
Netherlands, and the Brazilian government, the PPG7 is the largest multilateral grant program
for environmental conservation in a single country. More than US$160 million have already
been invested in the program's projects. Its thirteen core pilot projects address areas critical to
the conservation of Brazilian tropical forests.
Pilot projects implemented to date include extractive reserves; indigenous reserves; innovative
approaches for managing forests and floodplains; environmentally sound development
initiatives to be carried out by local communities; strategy and strengthening of key research
centers; and improved oversight and enforcement of environmental policies at the state level.
One of the largest and most complex of the PPG7 projects is the Natural Resources Policy
Project, which aims at building up the institutional capacity of the Amazonian states and
municipalities to effectively manage their natural resources. A significant result of the project is
that most of the states have completed their economic-ecological zoning (ZEE) and are using
this planning tool as a form of spatial planning of resources, law enforcement, surveillance,
licensing, and environmental monitoring.
The PPG7 has helped to promote constructive changes within the wider institutional and policy
context in the Brazilian Amazon. The formulation of the National Integrated Policy for the
Legal Amazon (1995) benefited from much of the early work undertaken by the PPG7. The
PPG7 has also contributed to the strengthened role of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
through the GTA (Amazon Working Group) network, and has been a catalyst for new and
productive forms of collaboration linking federal and subnational governments with civil
society. In parallel to the PPG7, Natural Resources Management Bank loans to the states of
Rondonia and Mato Grosso (Planafloro and Prodeagro) have established and demarcated
indigenous lands, parks, and reserves in the Brazilian Amazon region in an effort to conserve
the Amazon rain forests.
5



The PPG7 approach to the Amazon has generally stressed the importance of sustainable
development and has tried to balance legitimate economic aspirations with ecological
imperatives. Despite the successes mentioned above, relatively little attention has been given to
strict protection of key ecosystems, which is the foundation for sustainable development and for
the maintenance of ecological integrity. Brazil has only about 12 million hectares of tropical
forest in the Amazon region (3.2 percent of its land surface) under strict protection. This is low
relative to other Amazon countries-Venezuela has 18 percent and Colombia and Ecuador have
15 percent of their Amazon territory under strict protection. Although the PPG7 has supported
the establishment of extractive reserves, the local constituencies such as rubber tappers and non-
timber forest product extractors have expressed their desire to increase the areas of Extractive
Reserves and Sustainable Development in the Amazon which, given the actual demand for these
types of reserves, has not been sufficiently addressed by PPG7. The government of Brazil
recognizes the importance of creating additional protected areas in the Amazon as a
complementary program to the PPG7.
Biodiversity conservation. In an effort to implement the United Nations' Convention on
Biological Diversity, the government of Brazil, with support of the private sector, has executed
since 1996 two GEF pilot projects: the National Biodiversity Project (PROBIO) and the
Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO). These pilot projects have contributed significantly to
supporting Amazon initiatives. PROBIO has supported five priority-setting assessments, a
national biodiversity information network, and 22 model demonstration projects throughout
Brazil. Of the five priority-setting assessments, one was dedicated to setting conservation
priorities in the Amazon region. The results of the Amazon region's assessment has been used
in the early planning stages of ARPA. FUJNBIO is one of the major environmental funds
supported by the World Bank and the GEF. This sinking fund was established in 1996 with a
US$20 million grant from GEF and US$10 million from other domestic and international
partners. FUNBIO involves an innovative arrangement whereby release of GEF capital for the
sinking fund is tied to mobilization of matching funds primarily from the private sector. Both
initiatives (PROBIO and FUNBIO) have a relevant role to play in the proposed Project. They
are the building blocks that allow this project to move forward. PROBIO provides the scientific,
social, and participatory context to setting conservation priorities in the Amazon; FUNBIO
provides the financial mechanism to meet the long-term recurrent costs of protected areas. Both
projects are small scale and pilot new initiatives but have not addressed the need to create and
effectively manage protected areas on a large scale in the Brazilian Amazon-that is the scope
of the proposed Project.
Protected areas management. The management of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon
region is the primary responsibility of two federal institutions under the Ministry of
Environment (MMA) and the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural
Resources (IBAMA). State and municipal governments also participate in the management and
administration of protected areas. In recent years, the federal government has promoted
involvement in conservation issues by the Brazilian society in general. Through meetings and
workshops, local communities and their representatives now take a more active part in all stages
of the planning and implementation of protected areas. Implementation is frequently carried out
through partnerships between governmental institutions, NGOs, and private sector institutions
and organizations. The Brazilian government's investment in the Amazon protected areas has
actually been very limited. Less than US$3.5 million per year are invested in only 30 areas,
averaging US$22,000 per area per year. The World Bank provided a loan to the National
6



Environmental Program (NEP) that channeled financial resources to areas under strict
protection in the Amazon. Consequently, over the past five years US$6.5 million have been
invested, primarily in four areas: Serra do Divisor National Park in Acre, and Jau National Park,
Anavilhanas Ecological Station, and Mamiraua State Park in Amazon State. While
improvements resulted, protected areas management continues to be problematic. Major
problems include: (a) management is overly centralized; (b) protected areas are scattered and
often too small (less than 100,000 hectares) to ensure genetically viable populations of the
larger, wide-ranging species such as top predators; (c) IBAMA resources are insufficient to
manage effectively a large number of small units; (d) protected areas are inadequately staffed
and lack skilled staff-on average, there is one IBAMA employee for every 27,560 hectares of
protected area, and only 20 percent of the 575 employees administering protected areas have a
higher education; (e) budgetary processes are centralized and inflexible. It is apparent from the
lessons learned from this past experience that the management of protected areas in general
throughout Brazil, and in particular in the Amazon region, needs to be more effective to ensure
that biodiversity is protected.
Legal context for protected areas. One of Brazil's most significant accomplishments to protect
the Amazon ecosystems was the passing of the National System of Conservation Units (SNUC)
law. Following a lengthy process of public consultations and consideration in thematic
commissions, law no. 9.985 was passed on July 18, 2000. The SNUC law regulates article 225,
and sections I, II, III, and VII of the Federal Constitution, enacting the National System of
Protected Areas. The overall objective of this system is to maintain biological diversity and
genetic resources in national territory and jurisdictional waters. It aims to achieve this by
providing a uniform legal basis, concept, and methodology for the numerous governmental
agencies at the municipal, state, and federal levels responsible for consolidating protected areas.
SNUC eliminates some legislative governmental contradictions and overlaps previously
experienced in managing Brazil's protected areas. The system defines the responsibilities and
categories of protected areas, establishes rules for managing protected areas, and provides for
property ownership. To date, the system has approved five categories of "strict protection" areas
(Ecological Stations, Biological Reserves, National Parks, Natural Monuments, and Wildlife
Reserves) and four categories of "sustainable resource use" areas (National Forests, Extractive
Reserves, Sustainable Development Reserves, and the Private Natural Heritage Reserves).
These areas will be zoned for various uses, including a "strict protection" use.
SNUC substantially strengthens the legal framework for protected areas in the Amazon region.
Passing the law has been an important milestone for Brazil's protected areas system. The next
step is to regulate the law and test it on the ground. The discussion on and preparation of the
SNUC regulation advanced significantly between January and April 2002. The National
Council for the Environment (CONAMA) prepared and approved a proposal for a decree that
will regulate the SNUC legislation. The proposal is currently being evaluated by MMA. It is
crucial to develop programs and projects that test the SNUC law during the next five years,
particularly the proposed participatory methodology for creating and consolidating protected
areas. Protected areas management in Brazil need to develop partnership and co-management
arrangements if Brazil's protected areas are to be more effectively managed.
The government of Brazil acknowledges that each of the programs and projects mentioned
above have significantly contributed to protecting Amazonian ecosystems. It also recognizes
issues needing improvement over the next five years, including the need to:
7



* regulate and test the SNUC law
* increase the percentage of protected areas in the Amazon region and manage these areas
effectively
* adopt a methodology to create a mosaic of protected areas in the Amazon to ensure their
ecological and social sustainability
* develop long-term financial mechanisms that support protected areas in the Amazon
* strengthen the participatory and decentralized mechanisms needed to manage effectively
biodiversity in the Amazon.
In order to address these critical issues, MMA recognizes the need for increased participation at
the state level in the development of an overall strategy for the Amazon region. Over the past
two years, MMIA has executed the program Positive Agenda for the Amazon (Agenda Positiva
para a Amazonia). This is a transparent and constant dialogue with economic and social agents
of the Amazon region including local government, NGOs, the private sector, universities, and
local and indigenous communities. These actors have been involved in developing common
agendas for sustainable development, and the discussions have reflected a strong consensus as
well as disagreements. MMA has subsequently developed a strategy for the Amazon comprised
of three primary courses of action: (a) strengthening the control of natural resources use by
licensing, inspection, and monitoring; (b) stimulating the productive sector to adopt sustainable
economic practices; and (c) expanding and consolidating protected areas for biodiversity
conservation.
Control of natural resources use. To support the first course of action, MMA and IBAMA will
continue to modernize the control mechanisms for environmental licensing and the approval of
management plans in rural properties. With the support of state and local governments, MMA
and IBAMA are planning to increase the surveillance and monitoring of vegetation burnings
and deforestation. Since 2000, the World Bank-supported project, Program for Prevention and
Control of Burnings and Forest Fires (PROARCO), implemented in the Deforestation Belt, has
shown concrete results. The number of burning incidents decreased by over 80 percent in the
year 2000. The most conspicuous control actions are being carried out in Mato Grosso, Para,
and Rondonia, the states with the highest deforestation rate (80 percent of the total), where
specific initiatives were defined to address the different realities and deforestation dynamics.
Under the new licensing system, geo-referenced monitoring involving small and large
properties will be piloted in Mato Grosso and Acre. Additional states will eventually be added
to these pilot programs.
Sustainable economic practices. The Brazilian government has recently created the National
Forest Program (PNF) for the purpose of coordinating management of the Brazilian forest
sector, updating sector guidelines, incorporating new management concepts, identifying funding
sources, and introducing new sustainability models. Through the program, the government
hopes to lend greater consistency and substance to the new Forest Policy. It establishes a
coherent strategy to promote sustainable forest development, harmonizing economic use with
the protection of ecosystems. It will also make forest policy compatible with other public
policies and promote the expansion of markets both at home and abroad as well as the
institutional development of the sector. After an extensive, countrywide consultation process, 10
themes were defined as guidelines for planning and action. Three program lines are already
included in the federal government's development plan Avanca Brasil-Plano Plurianuall PPA
2000-2003, and approximately US$ 100 million have been allocated for investment purposes.
8



The PNF represents an unprecedented participatory effort for organizing and defining priorities
for the Brazilian forest sector. Brazil's environmental NGO community has shown strong
support for this program and its emphasis on ecologically appropriate, socially beneficial, and
economically viable forest-based development. The government plans to request financing from
the World Bank to support implementation of the National Forest Program. The PNF is
complementary to ARPA as it seeks to develop a sustainable development strategy once the
areas with highest biodiversity have been permanently set aside for conservation.
Creation ofprotected areas. The creation of new protected areas is a viable strategy for the
Brazilian Amazon. It is well known that the cost of creating protected areas increases as rural
areas and the agricultural frontier expand. However, the Brazilian Amazon still has vast
expanses of remote and scarcely populated areas rich in biodiversity that are ideal for
transforming into protected areas. A significant portion of the Brazilian Amazon (12 percent) is
still categorized as "unclaimed government lands." This open-land designation creates favorable
conditions for squatters, other land users, and speculators to invade these unclaimed lands, a
situation exacerbated by the government's limited enforcement capacity in the remote frontier
areas. Research by Conservation International (CI) indicates that areas in the Brazilian Amazon
that have been legally designated as protected areas-even when not implemented-are much
better protected from encroachment than "non-declared" areas, even under minimal
enforcement. This fact underscores the importance of legally establishing protected areas and of
promoting public awareness as necessary first steps in protecting land from encroachment by
mining, logging, colonizers, and road construction. More important, legally establishing
protected areas and promoting public awareness will help maintain the long-term ecological
integrity of the region. Therefore, creating protected areas from "unclaimed government lands"
in remote areas-even if enforcement capacity is limited-is a cheap and strategically important
choice for the Brazilian Amazon, especially considering that only 3.2 percent of the land surface
is currently under strict protection.
Government efforts at the federal and subnational levels, together with the increased public
awareness of environmental concerns resulting from a decade of PPG7 efforts, have created a
strong constituency for creating new protected areas in the Amazon. There is growing
recognition that sustainable development and protected areas are both necessary and reinforce
one another. One result of this growing recognition is the proposed project. Created with the
catalytic support of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)/World Bank Alliance, the GEF, federal
and state authorities, NGOs, and the PPG7, the Project's goal is to add 25 million hectares in
new protected areas over the next 10 years. Within a decade, the Project, aided by existing
efforts, will result in a total of 70 million hectares-nearly 30 percent-of Amazon forested
ecosystems under some form of effective protection and sustainable use.
The concept of ARPA was adopted in 1998 by Brazil's President Cardoso in response to the
formation of the WWF/World Bank Alliance. Preparation of ARPA has taken a substantial time
to complete in order to ensure the participation of the key stakeholders and the appropriate
financial mechanisms for such a complex project.
ARPA consists of three phases to be executed within 10 years:
Phase 1. The duration of Phase 1 (the proposed project) would be four years. Objectives of this
phase are to:
9



* Create 18 million hectares of new protected areas (9 million hectares of "strict protection"
PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use" PAs)
* Consolidate the management of 7 million hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs and of
9 million hectares of newly created "strict protection" PAs
* Establish an endowment fund to support the recurrent costs of PAs
* Establish a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system at the PA and regional levels
Phase 1 performance benchmarks must be satisfied before proceeding to Phase 2. Phases 2 and
3 would build on lessons learned during Phase 1.
Phase 2. Phase 2 focuses on establishing an additional 19.5 milllion hectares of new "strict
protection" PAs while supporting the managerial consolidation of existing and newly created
PAs. By the end of Phase 2, the identification of new protected areas will be completed.
Institutional capacity-building efforts will continue the strengthening of protected area
management, to include installation and implementation of financial and environmental
information systems. In addition, critical legal reforms (to include user fees and market-based
cost recovery mechanisms) will be passed during this phase, and income-generating activities
with low environmental-impact would be implemented. Phase 2 would consequently adapt and
implement these initiatives, creating the basis for financial sustainability. To this end, initiatives
would be undertaken to develop partnership programs with the private sector.
Phase 3. Phase 3 focuses primarily on the long-term sustainability of the areas created and
consolidated in the previous two phases. Institutional strengthening activities would continue
through this phase, and implementation of revenue-generating activities and private sector
participation would be intensified.
Proceeding to Phases 2 and 3 would be based on recommendations from independent
evaluations conducted toward the end of Phases 1 and 2, respectively. The performance
benchmarks to be used during these evaluations are presented in Annex 1-A. The role and scope
of the GEF's support for Phases 2 and 3 would be determined at that time.
3. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices
Legal and policy framework. The proposed Project seeks to test some key and potentially very
important elements of the SNUC law:
* Participation of local populations in the establishment, implementation, and management of
protected areas
* Creation of instruments to elicit support and cooperation from the public and private sectors
for studies, scientific research, environmental education, recreation, ecotourism,
management, monitoring, and other activities relevant to the use and maintenance of
protected areas
* Incentives for local populations and private organizations to establish and manage protected
areas within the national system
* Creation of conditions for the economic sustainability of protected areas, where possible
* Establishment and management of protected areas within the legal framework governing
land and water management, taking into account local socioeconomic conditions and
requirements
10



* Provision of alternative forms of livelihood or adequate compensation for traditional
populations which can no longer harvest existing natural resources within protected areas
* Provision of sufficient financial resources for proper management of protected areas
* Establishment of financial and administrative autonomy for the protected areas, whenever
possible and in accordance with federal guidelines
* Establishment of Consultative Management Councils for each protected area
* Regularization of financial contributions by private enterprises that obtain direct benefits
from protected areas
* Regularization of land tenure within and surrounding protected areas
Financial sustainability. IBAMA currently has only one staff member for every 27,560 hectares
under its responsibility. It manages more than 174 protected areas and a total area of 35 million
hectares. The Brazilian government's fiscal funding for protected areas management has been
insufficient and variable. With increased participation by the private sector and civil society,
and funding from international donors, a new modus operandi for protected areas' financial
sustainability is needed. It is critical that the Project establish the basis for long-term financial
sustainability of protected areas in the Amazon region. The Project addresses this issue by
identifyring, developing, and implementing appropriate financial vehicles to generate the needed
resources. Project funds will finance the establishment of a Trust Fund for Protected Areas. The
trust fund would be complementary to the government's obligation to finance the core staffing
in each of the protected areas supported under the Project.
Protected areas programs coordination. The Project addresses the need to coordinate the
currently diffuse federal and state government efforts related to protected areas creation and
management. During project preparation, MMA and IBAMA have worked closely together to
integrate their protected areas programs and to coordinate more closely their efforts. Through a
series of meetings with state environmental officials, MMA has developed a strategy to
consolidate state protected areas under the Agenda Positiva initiative. The Project has had the
active participation of civil society, which will continue during project implementation. The
Project will establish a permanent Program Committee where coordination of ongoing MMA
and IBAMA programs supporting PAs will be spelled out. The Program Committee will also
include state and civil society representatives.
Participatory approach. The proposed Project takes as a central premise that the success of
demarcating and protecting PAs depends upon direct involvement and participation of the local
people. Hence, the active participation of local communities will be a key element in protected
area selection and design. The Project will also promote the incorporation of established
Brazilian organizations, NGOs, scientific and academic institutions, and civil society
organizations. Assistance will be sought in the areas of protected areas management, natural
resources management, rural development, community organization, technology transfer,
monitoring and evaluation, and environmental education. The mechanism for involving civil
society will be partnership and concession agreements in order to increase the number of
qualified stakeholders and to facilitate an effective participatory management. The Project
would provide funding for assessing the viability of different organizations and mechanisms,
strengthening the management capability of candidate organizations, and developing
appropriate partnership "contracts" (for example, concessions, leasing) for the management of
protected areas. This participatory approach would also contribute to the strengthening of the
ongoing process of decentralization promoted by MMA and IBAMA, and would reduce the
11



government's financial burden by tasking protected area management partners with mobilizing
private sector funding (for example, matching funds for protected area management).
Strategic choices. To address the issues referred to above, the following strategic choices were
made:
a. In its first concept, the Project would only include "strict protection" PAs which are less
numerous in the Amazon region. Through a consultation process with the states and the civil
society, this initial design at the Project Concept Document (PCD) stage was modified. The
government's previous experience to have a more socially sustainable protected areas system in
the Amazon points out that the system needs to be designed in a comprehensive way, allowing
for a mosaic ofprotected areas adjacent to each other. The category of these protected areas and
the uses allowed in them are designed with a full participation of the local players. The result is
that these areas support each other instead of working against each other. Because it is the major
local actors that determine this mosaic through a consensual process and with technical support
from the government and other organizations, the resulting proposals have broader ownership.
Through a consensual process among the social stakeholders, the different government players,
and the donors, ARPA now includes the goal of creating 9 million hectares of Extractive and
Sustainable Development Reserves in addition to the targets for strict conservation areas (nine
million hectares for Phase 1).
b. Regarding financial mechanisms and sustainability, several options were considered. After
the PCD stage, the need to create a trust fund for the protected areas in the Amazon became
clear to the government and other Project stakeholders. First, the FMA (National Environmental
Fund Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente) was considered as a possible host for ARPA. But
lessons learned on protected areas funds in Latin America and the Caribbean suggest that a
government-operated fund does not have enough flexibility to attract and manage private
donations, whereas a private fund does. Since most of the ARPA donors are from the private
sector, a private organization was selected through a lengthy process of consultation involving
the Brazilian government and other stakeholders. FUNBIO, a private NGO that the Bank is
supporting through other GEF grants, was selected as the partner for ARPA and host for the
Protected Areas Trust Fund. In March 2002, the International Affairs Secretariat (SEAIN)
submitted a letter to the Bank indicating that FUNBIO would be the recipient of the GEF
US$30 million grant.
c. Regarding project participation and coordination, several strategic choices were made to
ensure stakeholder participation. First, the Program Committee that will operate during project
implementation has six government members (SECEX/MMA, SCA/MMA, SBF/MMA,
IBAMA, State Forum of Secretaries of Environment of the Amazon Region, and municipalities)
and six from civil society (two social NGOs, two environmental NGOs, one FLUNBIO member,
and one donor). Second, the Project has tested a participatory methodology financed by the
WWF/WB Alliance in two pilot areas, one in Rondonia and one in Roraima. These workshops
were carried out in October and November of 2000. One case study involved the creation of an
indirect use area (park) and of two extractive reserves in Costa Marques, Rond6nia. The second
case study involved the preparatory workshop for the consolidation of a mosaic of protected
areas of indirect use (parks and ecological stations) in Caracarai, Roraima. The methodology to
be used during ARPA's implementation was tested at the workshops and includes a broad-base
consultation process at the local level. A summary is presented in Annex 15. Finally, the Project
12



will establish a Conflict Mediation Committee (CMC) that will address and propose solutions to
social conflicts in protected areas. This decision has been ratified. through a letter from the
Minister of Environment to the Bank in April 2002. Details of the committee's mandate are
presented in section C.4, and the operating procedures will be spelled out in the Project
Operational Manual.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project Components
ARPA's objectives will be met through five project components. For a detailed project
description, refer to Annex 2. For financing of specific components by the GEF, WWF,
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the government of Brazil, refer to the Tables in
Annex 3.
Component 1: Creation of new protected areas
This component would finance the creation of 18 million hectares of new protected areas (9
million heztares of "strict protection" PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use" PAs). The
areas will be created following strict selection criteria and the process described in Annex 13,
following a tested participatory methodology described in detail in Annex 15. The major
activities under this component are:
* The collection of biological, social, and economic data on the Amazon region for use in
selecting the protected areas to be created. Data collection would employ existing
information, databases, and updated satellite images.
* The preparation of studies, consultations, and proposals for creating the new protected areas.
These studies will include environmental and social studies carried out locally, as well as
land tenure assessments. Any social conflict identified in the assessments would be reported
to the Conflict Mediation Committee. The local consultations would discuss the proposals
and once discussed, the decree would be submitted for approval and publication.
* The on-the-ground establishment of new protected areas once they have been declared. This
activity will include demarcation procedures, implementation of land tenure regularization
plans and land acquisition where needed, preparation of basic protection plans, construction
of the minimum infrastructure and purchase of minimal equipment, and personnel training.
It is expected that 10 new protected areas would be established on the ground. The full
consolidation of these areas into effectively managed protected areas will be part of
Component 2.
This component will be implemented by MMA, IBAMA, states and municipalities (for state or
municipal PAs) and FUNBIO.
Component 2: Consolidation of protected areas
This component will support activities in a minimum of 10 new "strict protection" PAs
(approximately 9 million hectares) and 12 existing "strict protection" PAs (7 million hectares).
The existing protected areas were selected using criteria that included lack of conflicts with
indigenous lands; land tenure situations resolved or favorable for resolution; feasibility of
13



implementation; presence of NGOs; and high conservation value. See Annex 14 for a detailed
description of the 12 existing "strict protection" PAs. The major activities to be supported
include:
* Demarcation and land regularizations, including land tenure assessments, baseline land
registry surveys, ground surveys, private property infrastructure surveys, and mapping. A
detailed land acquisition plan will be prepared and government funds will be used to
finance land purchase where needed.
* Basic protection activities, including infrastructure, equipment, and core staff, to secure
services of protection and community outreach before the preparation and implementation
of management plans.
* Preparation and implementation of management plans for new and existing protected areas
consolidated under the Project.
* Community participation for the establishment and consolidation of protected areas. The
activities will include the establishment and operation of protected area councils,
partnerships with NGOs for protected area management, and community-driven
subprojects. The eligibility criteria for the subprojects will be spelled out in the Project
Operational Manual. These subprojects would support communities-including indigenous
communities-living around the protected areas.
* Training programs to strengthen the administrative, financial, and conservation
management of protected areas.
IBAMA, the states and municipalities (for state and municipal PAs), and FUNBIO will be
responsible for this component.
Component 3: Long-term sustainability of protected areas
This component will support the establishment of an endowment fund (FAP) for the protected
areas system in the Amazon region. The main activities under this component are: (a) creation
of an administrative, financial, and legal structure for FAP; (b) support the recurrent costs of
existing protected areas; and (c) develop a fundraising strategy for capitalizing FAP. See
Annex 12 for a detailed description of FAP operations and finances. FAP resources can support
the recurrent costs of "strict protection" PAs that are consolidated under the Project and that
have clearly identified conservation needs beyond the basic personnel financed by the
Brazilian government. "Sustainable use" PAs will be eligible for support from FAP for
surveillance and enforcement activities to protect key environmental values of these areas, in
particular, the strict protection zones. The eligibility criteria for the protected areas that will
enter the program have been established and will be documented in the FAP Operational
Manual. These criteria will be agreed to before the Project grant is effective. This component
will also support the preparation of studies and subprojects aimed at defining and testing
adequate revenue-generating mechanisms for protected area sustainability. A total of 10
subprojects would be supported during implementation. These subprojects would benefit
communities living around the ARPA protected areas, including indigenous communities. The
eligibility criteria for the subprojects will be spelled out in the FAP Operational Manual.
FUNBIO will be responsible for the implementation of this component and the administration
of FAP.
14



Component 4: Protected area monitoring
This component will support the establishment of a biodiversity monitoring system and
analysis of new and existing protected areas. Project monitoring would include information on
biodiversity status (key indicator groups), pressure on ecosystems (levels of threat), water
resources and climate, island effect (levels of connectivity), and management effectiveness.
The monitoring system will be tested in five existing protected areas and will be applied in the
newly created protected areas as they are implemented. This component will support training
activities for protected area staff in the field and at central agencies (IBAMA and state
environmental agencies). Training will cover data collection methods, interpretation and
implementation of the biodiversity monitoring system, dissemination activities for preparing
local communities, and methods for accessing and providing information relevant to the
monitoring of protected areas. IBAMA and FIJNBIO will be responsible for this component.
Component 5: Project coordination and management
This component would support the overall coordination of the various components in MMA,
IBAMA, and FUNBIO, and would ensure implementation of the following management
activities: (a) preparation of annual operating plans; (b) preparation of supervisory reports or
any request for information by donors or the Bank; (c) monitoring and evaluation of project
activities; (d) procurement, financial management, and accountability; (e) assurance that
implementation agreements and financial execution are effectively carried out; (f)
communication and dissemination activities of ARPA. This component will also finance the
operating costs of the various project committees. See section C.4 on institutional and
implementation arrangements, for details on this component.
A summary of GEF financing of the Project's components is presented below.

2. Key Policy and Institutional Reforms Supported by the Project
The Project will pilot the implementation of new laws and regulations supporting the creation
and management of Brazilian protected areas, particularly the SNUC law. The Project would
increase intersectoral dialogue and joint actions by engaging IBAMA, FUNAI, the Land
15



Reform Agency (INCRA), and state and municipal governments in the creation and
management of protected areas. It would also develop critical core experience in creating and
managing protected areas and buffer zones, synthesizing and disseminating the experiences of
primary stakeholders such as the government, environmental, and biodiversity conservation
agencies, and civil society. Income generation from protected area services and charges is an
additional expected outcome of the institutional reforms. Finally, the Project will continue to
strengthen financial management in the environmental sector by incorporating the lessons
learned from using organizations such as Banco do Brasil as a financial intermediary under the
PPG7 -Demonstrations Project (PDA) and FUNBIO.
3. Benefits and Target Population
The Project aims to achieve measurable improvements in the quality and management of
biodiversity and natural resources in the Amazon region at the federal, state, municipal, and
local levels.
Local populations. Some of the beneficiaries of these improvements will be the populations
adversely affected by the loss of biodiversity and other forms of natural resource and
environmental degradation. The establishment of "strict protection" PAs could also adversely
affect such families in the short term by eliminating their use of the natural resources. To
manage potential short-term economic dislocations and losses of livelihood for poor
communities during the transition period, the Project would support the interventions
enumerated below:
* Targeted investments in alternative revenue-generating activities in protected areas and
buffer zones where additional private and public funding will be sought for low
environmental-impact development activities to benefit local populations
* Building a strong constituency for protected areas through partnerships, environmental
education, and co-management agreements
* Strengthening the capacity of states, municipalities, and other local representative entities to
conduct participatory protected area management so that decision-makers can make
informed choices that promote poverty alleviation efforts along with conservation objectives
* Strengthening the role of IBAMA and the MMA as coordinators of responsive protected
area policy, and continuing the effort started under PPG7 to include local populations in all
aspects of protected area creation and management
The country and the government. Regional and national benefits will include:
* Maintenance of biodiversity and implementation of replicable sustainable development
models in environmentally valuable areas
* Development of income generating activities and other economic incentives to maintain
protected areas in the longer term
* Poverty alleviation in and around protected areas
* Strengthened protected areas managerial capacity and legal framework
* Replication of successful protected areas models in other areas resulting in additional
benefits
Global environmental benefits. The global environmental benefits consist of:
16



* Preservation of arguably the most significant biodiversity reserves in the world-the
Brazilian Amazon biome-through creation of extensive protected areas and enhanced
management of new and existing protected areas
* Development of innovative models and experiences in preservation of biodiversity and
sustainable development, with possibly huge replicability. potential in Brazil and globally
* Engagement of the most important biodiversity country in the world, Brazil, in a relatively
rare, meaningful, and successful conservation effort that should lead to new efforts
* Maintenance of globally important watershed areas and carbon sequestration capacity
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
a. Institutions involved in the Proiect. ARPA will be executed by the Ministry of Environment
(MMA), the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO), the Brazilian Institute for the Environment
and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), and state and municipal agencies (for specific
protected areas).
A grant agreement between the World Bank and FUNBIO will be signed to carry out the
implementation of ARPA. FUNBIO was selected by the Brazilian govermment to manage the
grant resources; responsibilities shall include: (a) procuring goods and contracting services
needed for project execution with GEF grant resources; (b) carrying out disbursements and the
financial execution and accounting of the Project; (c) creating and establishing the Protected
Areas Trust Fund (FAP) (see Annex 12); (d) preparing studies on financial and legal
instruments for long-term sustainability of protected areas; and (e) testing proposed financial
mechanisms in selected protected areas.
ARPA will be established by presidential decree. In this decree, the project partners'
responsibilities will be spelled out. A draft of the presidential decree was discussed during
negotiations and the decree would be passed prior to effectiveness.
A implementation agreement between MMA and FUNBIO, and one between IBAMA and
FUNBIO, will be signed as a condition of effectiveness. The implementation agreements shall
define each organization's responsibilities and obligations under the Project.
For the state and municipal participation, a model cooperation agreement between their
environmental secretariats and agencies, the Brazilian federal government, through the iMMA,
and FUNBIO would be included in the Project Operational Manual and would be signed before
any state or municipality participates in the Project.
In addition, cooperation agreements between MMA and FUJNAI, and between MMA and
INCRA, would be signed before effectiveness. In the MMA/FUNAI agreement, the
responsibilities of FUNAI vis-a-vis the demarcation of indigenous territories and activities
related to ARPA by indigenous peoples would be spelled out, including a commitment to
prioritize the demarcation of indigenous areas adjacent to protected areas to be created under
ARPA. Although resettlement activities are unlikely to happen under ARPA, the INCRA
agreement would spell out the responsibility and commitment of fNCRA to carry out the
resettlement process if such process is required during implementation.
17



Cofmancing for the Project has been agreed to during appraisal and is presented in Table 2 in
Annex 3. The main cofinancing partners for ARPA are:
* World Wildlife Fund (WWF-Brazil), project donor, supporting overall project activities and
having a strong commitment to fund-raising activities for the Protected Areas Trust Fund
(FAP). WWF has been initially appointed as the representative of the Project's private
donors. This appointment would be subject to annual renewal by the formal group of private
donors. A grant agreement between WWF and FUNBIO will provide support for the
Project's trust fund (FAP) and other activities under the WWF/FUNBIO agreement. The
amount of funding confirmed by WWF during the appraisal is US$11.5 million, to be
disbursed over four years. The WWF funds will be used to finance the activities specified in
Component 1. 1, 1.2, 1.3 (for sustainable use PAs) and Component 5. (See Annex 3 for
more details on the activities to be financed by WWF.)
* Kreditanstaltfur Wiederaujbau (KfW) has increased its allocation to the PPG7 program in
order to support ARPA. Two agreements-a grant agreement between the federal
government of Brazil, through the MMA, and KfW, and a separate project agreement
(Acordo em Separado) between the MMA, IBAMA, KfW, and FUTNBIO-define the rules
for the transfer of funds from the MMA to FUNBIO, the utilization of funds, the
disbursement procedures, and the control of utilization of the funds. The amount of funding
confirmed by KfW during the appraisal is US$14.4 million dollars. The funds from KfW
will be used to finance the activities in Component 1.3 (for "strict protection" PAs) and in
Component 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5.
ARPA will also be supported, both technically and financially, by other important partners:
* Deutsche Gesellschaftfur Technische Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ) will provide technical
assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Project, to improve the management
of protected areas, monitoring and evaluation, and the disbursement and application of
Kf(W-supplied funds.
* Brazil Connects has committed to become a project donor to the Protected Areas Trust Fund
to support activities in "sustainable use" protected areas.
* Other Partners, public or private corporations, may, in the future, contribute to the
achievement of the Project's objectives. Among such partners there is the possibility that the
Civil Society Organizations of Public Interest (OSCIP) may manage protected areas, under
the terms of article 30 of law no. 9.985/2000.
As a condition of disbursement of grant proceeds to the Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP), an
agreement between FUNBIO and an Asset Manager must be signed. This agreement would set
the responsibilities of the selected asset manager in managing FAP.
The table below summarizes the distribution of execution and administration responsibilities
among the different institutions for each component of the Project.

and management       FUNBIO
Within MMA, the Executive Secretariat (SECEX) will have the duty of carrying out the overall
institutional coordination required to implement project activities. SECEX will oversee the
functions of the General Coordination (CG), the Program Committee (CP), and the Scientific
Advisory Panel (PCA) described below. Two Technical Secretariats within MMA will
participate:
* Secretariat of Coordination for the Amazon Region (SCA) will have the duty of carrying out
the executive coordination of the Project. The SCA shall obtain from the Secretariat of
Biodiversity and Forests, through the Directorate of Protected Areas (DAP) and the
Directorate of Forests (DPF), approval of proposals for the creation of new protected areas
and Annual Operating Plans (POAs), partial and consolidated, so that counterpart budget
resources may be made available as scheduled. The SCA will oversee the functions of the
Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and the Conflict Mediation Committee (CRC). (See
section C.4b for additional information.)
* Secretariat of Biodiversity and Forests (SBF) will have the duty of participating in the
General Coordination (GC) and Program Committee (CP), ensuring articulation of project
activities with other projects in the secretariat, facilitating the participation of state and
municipal protected areas under the Project, and allocating counterpart budget resources to
the Project.
IBAMA will have the responsibility for preparing proposals for the creation of federally
protected areas, managing the process of consolidating existing protected areas, preparing the
Annual Operating Plans for federally protected areas, and providing the counterpart resources.
The Directorate of Strategic Management (DIGET) within IBAMA will oversee the work of
IBAMA and will coordinate with the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), MMA, and FUNBIO.
The Directorate of Strategic Management would work closely with the Directorate of
19



Ecosystems (DIREC) for "strict protection" PAs and with National Center for Traditional
Populations (CNPT) for extractive reserves.
The State and Municipal Environmental Secretariats and Agencies of the Amazon Region will
be responsible for preparing proposals for the creation of state and municipal protected areas;
managing the process of consolidating new and existing state and municipal protected areas;
preparing the Annual Operating Plans for participating state and municipal protected areas; and
ensuring the counterpart resources anticipated in the Project and promoting their application.
The project will receive technical assistance from the Deutsche Gesellschaftfiir Technische
Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GTZ). The GTZ will also support the institutional structure of the
project, technical issues of protected areas, monitoring and evaluation, and the disbursement
and application of KfW-supplied funds.
b. Project coordination and management. The duties and responsibilities of entities and
agencies under the Project's institutional arrangement are:
*  General Coordination (CG). An entity of MMA, the General Coordination was formed by
the Executive Secretariat, the Secretariate of Coordination of the Amazon Region, the
Secretariate of Biodiversity and Forests, and IBAMA. Chaired by the Executive
Secretariate, the General Coordination will be responsible for overall government
institutional coordination, ensuring the completion of project objectives and the articulation
of project actions with environmental policies and other projects.
* Program Committee (CP). A deliberative, joint-administrative unit subordinate to the
General Coordination, the Program Committee's purpose is to ensure compliance with
proposed project objectives. To that end, the committee will approve action strategies;
define procedures and guidelines; establish criteria for the signing of agreements and
contracts envisioned under the Project; analyze and approve the Project's Annual Operating
Plan; and analyze and issue opinions on technical and financial reports. The Committee, to
be chaired by the Executive Secretary of MMA, will be comprised as follows:

Secretaries of Environment of the
Amazon region
1 representative of municipalities  1 representative of the private donors
MMA and IBAMA representatives and alternates will be appointed by the Minister of
Environment through a specific administrative act. The state representative and alternate
will be appointed by the State Forum of Secretaries of the Environment of the Amazon
Region. Municipalities will appoint their respective representatives and alternates in
20



accordance with the National Association of Municipalities (ANAMA), through the
Amazonian regional section. Environmental and social NGOs shall appoint their
representatives and alternates from among those who are registered in the National Registry
of Environmental Entities (CNEA), and who can provide proof of their work in the Amazon
region. The FUNBIO representative shall be appointed by FUNBIO's Board of Directors.
The representative from the private donors will be selected by the group of donors. The
mandate of Program Committee members, as well as the frequency of meetings, among
other definitions, shall be detailed in the Project Operational Manual.
Scientific Advisory Panel (PCA). This panel was formed by a broad spectrum of scientists
from universities, research institutions, government, and NGOs to facilitate the process of
identifying new protected areas. The PCA will be appointed by the Program Committee.
The mandate of the panel would be to recommend improvements on the protected areas
selection methodology; help identify new opportunities for conservation; and comment on
protected areas proposed to be created outside accepted polygons. This mandate would help
to underpin the Project's protected areas creation process with broad scientific support. It is
expected that the panel would meet every six months.
Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU will have an executive nature, instituted under
the scope of the Secretariat of Coordination of the Amazon Region (SCA) within MMA,
and shall have the duty of establishing a link between the Program Committee and the
different executors. The PCU will be responsible for supporting, executing, and supervising
the different components; monitoring the Project's physical and financial activities; guiding
project executors on the technical, administrative, and financial procedures accepted by the
World Bank; formulating and systematizing documents for analysis and approval by the
Program Committee; receiving POAs; carrying out the physical and financial execution
reports from all executors, with the approval of SBF/DAP and DPF; and preparing the
consolidated POA for the Project and the general progress report for consideration by the
Program Committee and for donor review. The PCU will also act as the executive
secretariat for the General Coordination (CG) and the Program Committee (CP). The PCU
will call the meetings of the Conflict Meditation Committee (see below) in response to
requests from the Program Committee, the General Coordination, civil society, and grass
roots organizations.
Conflict Mediation Committee (CMC). A permanent committee will be created by a specific
administrative act of the Minister of Environment for the purpose of aiding the Project's
executive coordination in negotiating and proposing potential solutions to social issues
related to the creation and implementation of protected areas; and, acting as a forum for the
discussion and resolution of issues related to traditional populations inside existing "strict
protection" PAs. This core group will be composed by the project coordinator representing
MMA and representatives from FUNAI, IBAMA (CNPT and DIREC), and INCRA. The
detailed functions and operational guidelines for the CMC will be presented in the Project
Operational Manual. The CMC will be established as a condition of effectiveness.
FUNBIO's Technical Commissions (FTC). A technical commission on protected areas to be
established within FUNBIO. This commission would oversee ARPA implementation and
manage the Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP). The technical commission would consist of
members of FUNBIO's Board of Directors, government representatives, CNS, GTA, and
21



private donors. The composition and operation of the FTC would be spelled out in the
Project Operational Manual.
* FUNBIO's ARPA Coordination Unit (PROARPA). FUNBIO will establish a unit,
PROARPA, to carry out all responsibilities under the World Bank/FUNBIO agreement,
including procurement of goods and services for the Project, financial accounting and
auditing, execution of Component 3 of the Project, and the Protected Areas Trust Fund
(FAP).
The organizational chart describing the institutional arrangements and the management model
to be used under ARPA are presented in Annex 11.
c. Project Management. ARPA's administrative and financial procedures would be detailed in
the Project's Operational Manuals that are a condition of grant effectiveness. The first manual
will apply to the entire project. The second manual will be specific to the operation of the
Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP). A summary of accepted key procedures is presented below
and would be further expanded in the two Operational Manuals.
Annual Operating Plans
IBAMA, FUNBIO (in its capacity as financial manager and for component 3), and state and
municipal environmental agencies, where appropriate and under the scope of their respective
responsibilities, would prepare Annual Operating Plans (POAs) and send them to the Project's
Coordination Unit. The POAs would direct the application of financial resources allocated to
the Project. The PCU would review the different POAs, seek comments from other partners
such as SBF/DAP and DPF; consolidate the different POAs into a single Project POA and send
it to the World Bank and other donors to seek a "no objection" decision. The Project's POA
would then be sent to the Program Committee for its final approval. The PCU would forward
the POA to FUNBIO and other agencies and administrative authorities in charge of POA
execution. These agencies would, in turn, implement them through their internal procedures,
strictly observing the terms approved by the World Bank, donors and Program Committee and
the contractual rules assumed with the Bank and WWF through the grant agreements and the
Operational Manual.
The KfW resources will be allocated to FUNBIO, and will finance purchases and contracting of
goods and services for "strict protection" PAs included in Program Committee- and World
Bank-approved POAs. POAs that include activities to be financed by KfW would be reviewed
jointly by KfW and the Bank, before the Bank officially approves the POA.
Flow of Funds
1) Special Account. In order to facilitate project implementation, FUNBIO will establish a
special account, in U.S. dollars, in a commercial bank. Allocation of US$2.5 million shall be
authorized for projected disbursements to occur over a four month period. Disbursements would
be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs), except for goods above US$100,000
equivalent, contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent, and contracts with
individuals above US$50,000 equivalent. In these cases, all contractual information must be
attached to a Summary Sheet (SS). The information required for the compilation of statements
22



of expenditure would be maintained by the financial management unit in the Management
Information System (MIS) database.
2) Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP). FUNBIO will establish the endowment fund to receive
and manage US$14.5 million from the GEF grant and the other donors' funds. (Component 3.)
The GEF and matching funds will be managed by an asset manager according to investment
guidelines and spending rules approved by the Bank and detailed in the FAP Operational
Manual. The asset manager shall be selected by FUNBIO following Bank procurement and
financial guidelines, and agreed with the Bank. The Bank's approval shall also be required for
the FAP Operational Manual and will be a condition of effectiveness.
The GEF funds will be kept separate from other donors' funds. Before disbursements can occur,
two conditions must be met: a disbursement agreement must be signed by the asset manager;
and, the Bank must have verified the proof of matching funds. FUNBIO will submit withdrawal
applications to the Bank, with attached proof showing the amount of the matching contribution
made to the endowment fund. Proof of matching can be bank statements or signed contracts
with donors. The Bank provides the "no objection" decision after verifying that the matching
requirements have been fulfilled. Thereafter, the Bank authorizes the disbursement to the asset
manager's account. Withdrawal applications may be submitted for amounts up to US$250,000.
If FUNBIO has raised less than US$250,000, a withdrawal application may not be presented
until proof of a minimum of US$250,000 in matching funds can be presented to trigger the
Bank's deposit. The intervals of disbursements will depend on the fundraising targets reached.
The fundraising plan indicates that approximately US$2 million will be raised every six months.
This would trigger a disbursement from the GEF trust fund to FAP of approximately US$2
million every six months until the GEF funds allocated to FAP (US$14.5 milllion) are
exhausted.
FAP will be governed by FUNBIO's Board of Directors and ARPA's Project Commission,
according to procedures spelled out in the FAP Operational Manual. Annex 12 describes in
detail the operation of FAP.
3) Other accounts:The KfW funds (US$14.4 million) would be channeled through MMA/PPG7
to a special project account also managed by FUNBIO. This account would cover direct
investments under Components 1 and 2. Similar disbursement procedures as described above
for the special account will apply to KfW funds and will be specified in the grant agreement
between MMA, FUNBIO and the KfW. WWF would channel their funds (US$16.5 million)
directly to FUNBIO into a separate account. A full description and chart showing the flow of
funds is presented in Annex 6-b.
Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Results
Within MMA, a Project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) unit will be established that will be
independent of the Project Coordination Unit. This unit will be responsible for monitoring and
evaluating the Project technically. The monitoring and evaluation indicators have been agreed to
and are presented in Annex 1. These indicators will also be a part of the implementation letter
that would be signed together with the grant agreement. Monitoring and evaluation will be
conducted through: (a) activities of the Project Coordination Unit; (b) annual progress reviews
during Bank supervision missions; (c) mid-term review of project implementation to be
23



conducted jointly by the Brazilian government, the National Coordinating Committee, the
Project Coordination Unit, the World Bank, WWF, and KfW; and (d) periodic beneficiary
assessments and other special studies. The latter would include a participatory evaluation
component to be carried out in consultation with local communities and NGOs, as well as an
independent evaluation mechanism at mid-term and completion of Phase 1. Progress in
achieving targets would be assessed during the mid-term review and again at project conclusion,
upon which the decision to proceed to Phase 2 of the Project will be based. Under Component
4, biological monitoring will be carried out as well as studies and activities to capture lessons
learned, disseminate results, and promote replication elsewhere in Brazil and globally. Every six
months, the project administration unit will transmit to the Bank progress reports.on project
implementation and outcomes. An Implementation Completion Report will be prepared within
six months after closing of the grant.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection
An alternative to the proposed Project was to place the project entirely under IBAMA. The
Bank rejected this option because of the project scope, the need to ensure broader ownership,
and the necessity of reinforcing IBAMA's administrative and budgetary capacity in order to
achieve project objectives within the allotted time period. A second alternative was to exclude
IBAMA, thereby avoiding administrative bottlenecks caused by relatively limited
implementation capacity. This alternative was rejected because of IBAMA's key role and
substantial experience in creating and managing protected areas in Brazil. The structure of the
proposed Project builds on IBAMA's strengths and compensates for its weaknesses by
incorporating numerous competent partners and stakeholders to work with IBAMA and MMA.
Maximizing stakeholder participation in project management expands project ownership and
increases the probability that the project's ambitious goals will be achieved within the proposed
timeframe. A third option also explored was to finance the Project through the PPG7. However,
the PPG7 was designed as a pilot program and works in very few areas of strict conservation
use and does not have a project such as ARPA. The proposed Project is a comprehensive
program to create and manage a whole system of protected areas (strict and sustainable use)
designed to capture all the diversity of ecosystems present in the Amazon region. Therefore, it
was decided that ARPA would be an associated program to the PPG7. PPG7 would cofinance
the Project and complement the Project's objective to expand and consolidate protected areas in
the Amazon.

The proposed Project is closely associated with the PPG7 financed by G-7 donors and the
Brazilian government. The Project's objectives are complementary to the PPG7 objectives; that
is, to (a) strengthen Brazil's institutional framework and capacity to protect the Amazon; (b)
support protection of specific endangered ecosystems, in particular the Amazon region and
Atlantic forests, through indigenous reserves, extractive reserves, corridors, forest and
floodplain management; (c) strengthen the regulatory framework of the environmental sector at
26



the state and municipal level; (d) support environmentally sound development initiatives carried
out by local communities; and (e) support strategic research and strengthening of key research
centers. The KfW has provided additional funds to the PPG7 to support ARPA. These funds
will be used to finance portions of Components 1 and 2 under parallel financing.
Two GEF Pilot Phase projects-the National Biodiversity Project (PROBIO) and the Brazilian
Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO}-are directly linked to the proposed Project. PROBIO is of
national scope and has supported five priority-setting assessments, a national biodiversity
information network, and 22 model demonstration projects throughout Brazil. PROBIO also
financed the workshop that set conservation priorities in the Amazon region. ARPA will work
with those priorities to create and manage protected areas in the Amazon region. FUNBIO, is
one of the major environmental funds supported by the World Bank and the GEF. This fund
was established in 1996 under the GEF Pilot Phase (with a US$20 million grant from the GEF
and US$10 million from other domestic and international partners). FUNBIO involves an
innovative arrangement whereby release of GEF capital for the fund is tied to mobilization of
matching funds primarily from the private sector. FUNBIO will be directly linked to ARPA by
providing an interim institutional home for the new Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP). Lessons
learned from FUNBIO have influenced project design (see below).
UNDP has provided extensive technical assistance to the government of Brazil in a wide range
of environment-related projects. The most relevant to the present proposal is the project
Management of Biological Diversity in Brazil (funded by the GEF as an Enabling Activity),
which is supporting National Biological Diversity Commission (COBIO) coordination efforts
within MMA. COBIO has the charter to plan, monitor, and evaluate actions related to the
conservation and sustainable use of Brazilian biological diversity, especially PRONABIO
program activities. One result of this project is the first, recently published Biodiversity Strategy
and Action Plan. The First National Report to the COP was published and has been used to
structure ARPA.
3. Lessons Learned and Incorporated into the Proposed Project Design
Lessons have been taken from a number of projects, financed by the Bank and other institutions,
that have shared the goal of establishing protected areas and effective, sustainable management
systems.
Strengthening protected areas. The recently closed National Environmental Project (NEP)
financed the consolidation of 30 Brazilian protected areas). Lessons learned include the
importance of (a) developing clear guidelines for the creation and management of protected
areas-this will be facilitated by the recently passed SNUC law; (b) improving basic equipment
and infrastructure to support protected areas management; (c) involving local stakeholders (civil
society, municipal, and state governments) in protected area co-management to optimize
operation and to create a conservation constituency-considerable GEF project resources will
be devoted to these activities; (d) assuring adequate and sustainable financing-the Project will
identify financial mechanisms, require managing partners to provide matching funds, create a
trust fund to defray recurrent costs, and explore best-practices to address this issue;(e) training
IBAMA staff and local comanagers of protected areas to improve performance and create a
27



heightened awareness and sense of ownership among stakeholders-training is emphasized in
the ARPA institutional components.
Demarcation of Indigenous Lands in the Brazilian Amazon. The PPG7 project has been
financing the establishment and demarcation of Indigenous Reserves since 1994, the target
being 150 reserves (44,153,584 hectares). Demarcation and registration will be critical in ARPA
as well. The key lessons learned and incorporated into ARPA are: (a) constituency building is
critical-with a strong constituency, it is possible to create many new areas in a short period of
time; (b) when modem participatory techniques are employed demarcation has a better chance
of proceeding efficiently; (c) costs of land acquisition are not included under ARPA since
indigenous lands rights have priority over any other tenure.
Brazilian Biodiversitv Fund (FUNBIO). ARPA seeks to develop long-term financing
mechanisms for protected areas. From lessons learned in the FUNBIO project, the following
safeguards are incorporated into ARPA: (a) a strong, active, and responsible Board of Directors;
(b) a Board that works with technical commissions-small groups constituted by Board
members that are delegated specific tasks and become accountable for those tasks; (c) a project
director that quickly responds to the Board's direction and presents key issues requiring Board-
level decisions; (d) a flexible financial structure with funds managed by an asset manager.
Other lessons learned. There is a body of experience with biodiversity projects within the World
Bank and among environmental practitioners that reconfirms the importance of (a) facilitating
"direct" biodiversity-conservation activities by communities or groups of people who have a
vital interest in conservation, either because their livelihoods depend directly on biological
resources or because their quality of life depends significantly on use and existence values of
biodiversity; (b) increased participation by interested stakeholders and, in particular, local
communities, NGOs, and the private sector; (c) developing a strategic policy framework for
biodiversity conservation; (d) establishing financial mechanisms that fully cover operational
costs on a sustainable and long-term basis; and (e) decentralizing responsibilities from the
federal to state and municipal environmental agencies.
The proposed project is founded on a strategic policy framework that includes adequate
financial mechanisms, decentralization of responsibilities, and a high degree of participation by
stakeholders.
4. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership
The Amazon forest of Brazil is recognized as a part of the National Patrimony in the
Constitution of Brazil (article 225). A national consensus on the need to conserve the Amazon
and other important biomes is gaining momentum. Commitment to provide support for the
project is very high among participating agencies, at all levels. The proposed Project was
legitimized and gained political support at the highest levels when President Cardoso pledged in
April 1998 to achieve the target of at least 10 percent strict conservation of all forest types in
Brazil. The Project supports Cardoso's pledge to protect the Amazonian biome, but it is
expected that, as experience is gained, additional protected areas will be created in other forest
biomes. Since Cardoso's pledge and during the extended time required to prepare ARPA, the
Brazilian government has created a significant number of new protected areas. These are
enumerated in the table below.

Project preparation has been guided by an interagency steering group composed of MMA,
IBAMA, the Planning Ministry, and WWF. In addition, the steering group has developed a
collaborative relationship with civil society and the NGO community, which strongly support
the initiative. The project has been endorsed by the national GEF focal point at the International
Affairs Secretariat (SEAIN) as being consistent with Brazil's national conservation strategy and
a top national priority. SEAIN provided a letter in March 2002 indicating that FUNBIO would
be the recipient of the GEF grant. The fact that the federal and state governments are willing to
allocate US$18 million to the proposed project to support direct investments in Amazon
protected areas is another strong sign of government commitment, particularly when compared
with historical averages. The Brazilian government has also increased nonfinancial
contributions, such as land made available from INCRA.
With regard to integration with the state governments, MMA has executed the program Positive
Agenda for the Amazon (Agenda Positivapara a Amazonia) over the past two years. This is a
transparent and constant dialogue with economic and social agents of the Amazon region
including local government, NGOs, the private sector, universities, and local and indigenous
communities. These actors have been involved in developing common agendas for sustainable
development, and the discussions have reflected both a strong consensus as well as
disagreements. At least, four draft agreements for the creation of protected areas by state
governments have been received by MMA.
5. Value Added of Bank and Global Support in this Project
The World Bank possesses considerable experience in Brazil through the GEF Pilot Phase
projects (FUNBIO and PROBIO), the PPG7 program for the Amazon region, the NEP I, and the
state loans (Prodeagro and Planafloro), which directly or indirectly address biodiversity
conservation and protected areas management. Through ARPA, the Bank will assist the
government of Brazil in developing a full program on protected areas management at the
regional level (the Amazon biome). The GEF funds to be disbursed under the Project will
complement previous investments by developing stronger links between the various initiatives
and by bringing experience garnered during the design and implementation phases. One strong
aspect of the proposed project is the emphasis on developing long-term financial mechanisms
for protected areas. This has also been a recurrent issue in NEP I, Prodeagro, and Planafloro.
The Bank is well positioned to assist the Brazilian government and FUNBIO in this aspect of
the project due to the fact that the Bank supervises GEF-funded Protected Areas Endowment
Funds in 10 countries in Latin America.
The value added by the GEF stems from the fact that GEF funds can be committed toward
permanent endowment funds and can catalyze the mobilization of additional resources. Without
GEF and Bank involvement it would be very difficult to create and consolidate the protected
areas in the Amazon region and bring lessons from other countries and regions.
30



E: Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic
The proposed Project has been evaluated using the GEF incremental cost methodology (for
details, see Annex 4).
2. Financial
A long process of estimating ARPA costs has been carried out with the assistance of WWF and
their ARPA Private Sector Task Force (including pro-bono advice from Goldman Sachs and
PriceWaterhouse Coopers). The final projected costs associated with Phase 1 and for the total
10-year program are presented in Annexes 3 and 5. The Project is top priority, for the Ministry
of Environment (MMA), as shown by the fact that the Brazilian government's four-year plan
(PPA) has allocated US$18 million to ARPA. The US$18 million will support the creation and
implementation of the new and existing Amazon protected areas. During appraisal, KfW
confirmed their contribution of US$14.4 million for creating and consolidating several protected
areas of ARPA. The KfW funds will be channeled through the PPG7 program. In addition,
GTZ will provide technical assistance worth US$ 1.0 million. During appraisal, WWF
confirmed their intention to raise US$11.5 million for the creation, consolidation and
administration of protected areas.
The GEF contribution to the endowment fund is US$14.5 million, contingent on a 1:1 match
from other donors. This potential capital of US$29 million represents the initial contribution to
the much larger endowment that will be required to cover the recurrent costs of the protected
areas created and consolidated under ARPA. During appraisal, a strategy to secure the
resources needed by the endowment fund was agreed. This strategy consists of: (1) a letter of
intent by the ARPA donors to support the long-term goals of ARPA of which this project is just
the first phase; (2) a strategy to raise the funds needed by the endowment fund; and (3) agreed
spending rules for the use of the endowment fund revenue. WWF has pledged to raise a
minimum of US$ 5 million match for the endowment fund. Brazil Connect has confirmed their
contribution of US$ 1.5 million match for the endowment fund. The remaining US$ 8 million
needed to match the GEF funds will be raised through a fundraising campaign designed as part
of the strategy above and in conjuction with FUNBIO.
The total cofinancing package confirmed during the appraisal and negotiations by WWF, KfW,
GTZ, the Brazilian Government and Brazil Connect was US$51.5 million. (see section C.4 on
institutional and implementation arrangements, for details on the sub-components that each
donor will finance). This total will increase during project implementation by an additional
US$8.0 million, the minimum amount to be leveraged for the endowment fund in order to
access the GEF funds toward the endowment. The government of Brazil has also appropriated
funds from other PPG7 funding sources (PPTAL, PPDI, Ecological Corridors, and others) to
support buffer zones of the ARPA protected areas. State and municipal governments have
expressed their interest to support the Project and their willingness to participate by setting aside
areas for conservation.
31



3. Technical
The technical studies required for project preparation have been finalized by the preparation
team with PDF-B financing through the WWF-Brazil under the World Bank/WWF Alliance.
The studies performed included: (a) ecoregional representation and priority setting exercises to
select candidate zones for the creation of new parks (Component 1); (b) institutional and legal
framework for the protected areas (Components I and 2); (c) review of current income-
generation activities in Brazil; (d) review of lessons learned from PPG7 sustainable
development and direct-use protected areas; (e) two workshops to test the methodology to
create protected areas in the Amazon; (f) indigenous strategy for the project; and other relevant
studies. A full list of technical reports is available in Annex 8.
The criteria to select protected areas so that they better address other federal government
programs, such as the Eixos de Desenvolvimento, were raised during the project concept stage
and have been revised by a team composed of WWF, the Bank, IBAMA, and MMA. The
document describing the criteria and process to select protected areas is available in project files
and a summary is presented in Annex 14. To ensure that the selection process is transparent and
that the biodiversity criteria are kept throughout the life of the project, a scientific/technical
advisory committee would be established to oversee the candidate areas and review their
biological importance. One technical issue faced during early stages of preparation is the size of
protected areas. The proposed Project design intends to work with an average size per park of
650,000 hectares instead of 500,000 hectares. In addition, during preparation, funds from the
WWF/WB Alliance were used to support feasibility studies to create one new park in the
Amazon. This park, Tumucumaque National Park, will be approximately 3 million hectares in
size. The proposal has been submitted to Congress and will be passed soon.
Another technical issue worth mentioning is the Brazilian government's request for the project
to include the creation of new categories of protected areas (Extractive and Sustainable Use
Reserves). Since the project concept stage, the government has refined its strategy for the
Amazon as a result of consultations with the states and civil society. The government's previous
experience in creating a more socially sustainable protected areas system in the Amazon points
out that the system needs to be designed in a comprehensive way, allowing for a mosaic of
protected areas adjacent to each other. The category of these protected areas and their permitted
uses are designed with the full participation of the local actors The result is that these areas
support each other instead of working against each other. Because it is the major local actors
that determine this mosaic through a consensual process and with technical support from the
'government and other organizations, proposals have a broader ownership basis. In summary,
ARPA now includes the creation of 9 million hectares of Extractive and Sustainable
Development Reserves in addition to the strict conservation areas target (9 million hectares).
Protected Areas Trust Fund design. The Protected Areas Trust Fund (FAP) for protected areas
in the Amazon is critical to the success of the Project. Following the project concept stage, the
need to create a trust fund for the Amazon protected areas became clearer to the Brazilian
government. Creation of the fund has been a lengthy process of negotiations and learning from
other trust funds operating in the region. The design of the Protected Areas Trust Fund will be
fully consistent with the recommendations of the GEF council's Evaluation of Experience with
Conservation Trust Funds (1998). The Mexico Protected Areas Trust Fund has been used as an
example for FAP. ARPA has also benefited from technical assistance in the financial viability
32



and design of this trust fund from the pro bono advice of Goldman Sachs (a full report prepared
by the firm is available in the project files). FAP will use the existing structure of FUNBIO.
Although the trust fund will not solve the recurrent cost needs of all Amazon protected areas, it
can be used for critical protected areas with limited possibility to generate income and can
complement those that would be supported under the Project's planned income-generating
activities. For details on FAP issues, refer to Annex 2, Component 3 and Annex 12.
4. Institutional
4.1 Executing agencies
The management of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon region is the primary
responsibility of two federal institutions under the MMA and IBAMA. State and municipal
governments also participate in the management and administration of protected areas. In recent
years, the Brazilian government has promoted the involvement of Brazilian society, in general,
in conservation issues. Through meetings and workshops, local communities and their
representatives now take a more active part in all stages of the planning and implementation of
protected areas, frequently carried out through partnerships between government institutions,
NGOs, and other institutions and organizations of the private sector.
The Bank provided loan funds to IBAMA under the National Environment Program (NEP I) for
institutional strengthening and management of a number of protected areas. (See section D.3 for
lessons larned). While improvements resulted, protected areas management continues to be
problematic. Major problems include: (a) management is overly centralized; (b) protected areas
are scattered and often too small (less than 100,000 hectares) to ensure genetically viable
populations of the larger, wide-ranging species such as top predators; (c) IBAMA resources are
insufficient to manage effectively a large number of small units; (d) protected areas are
inadequately staffed and lack skilled staff-on average, there is one IBAMA employee for
every 27,560 hectares of protected areas, and only 20 percent of the 575 employees
administering protected areas have a higher education); (e) budgetary processes are centralized
and inflexible.
The institutional arrangements are detailed in section C.4. The MMA and IBAMA have
increased their capacity to manage and coordinate complex environmental projects with
differing objectives (PPG7, NEP I, etc.). The MMA has a relatively small core staff, but it has
shown that it can make good use of expert consultants and other institutions to achieve the level
of expertise and quality required to implement projects. The MMA and IBAMA have also
acquired considerable expertise in budgeting, project accounting, procurement, and coordination
of external executing agencies, at all levels of government and in the private sector. Under the
National Environment Project (NEP I), MMA acquired considerable experience in
administering a decentralized program of investments. This experience will help the Project
Coordination Unit, IBAMA and the MMA meet the requirements of the project. Consultant and
Bank staff have conducted an institutional capacity assessment of IBAMA and of FUNBIO, the
two major partners in ARPA. The resulting recommendations have been incorporated into the
project design. Copies of these reports are available in the project files.
33



ARPA is an estimated 10-year program and includes many partners. Although the Project
currently is being prepared for Phase 1 implementation, the expectation is that the Project will
have two additional phases. A Memorandum of Understanding between the World Bank, WWF,
the GEF and the government of Brazil will ensure the long-term viability of ARPA.
4.2 Procurement and financial management
Procurement and financial management arrangements have been reviewed by World Bank
specialists and are considered satisfactory to initiate project implementation subject to execution
of the prerequisite action plans. Assessment of the procurement capacity of PROARPA (the unit
within FUNBIO responsible for procurement) to implement procurement actions for the project
is complete and was approved by the Regional Procurement Advisor on June 21, 2002. The
assessment reviewed the proposed organizational structure and found it reasonable. However,
before effectiveness, the FUNBIO offices in Rio and in Manaus require new staff and
procurement training for existing staff. In addition to procurement capacity assessment, a
financial management assessment was carried out and finalized in June 24, 2002. In the past,
FUNBIO has hired an accounting firm to deliver all accounting services. The accounting firm
produces all accounting reports and, based on these reports and accounting records, FUNBIO
produces its management reports. As a result of the financial management assessment carried
out by the Bank, it was agreed that FUJNBIO would establish an accounting department to
manage the financial and accounting activities of ARPA before effectiveness. This accounting
unit would oversee the financial and accounting activities of the Special Account and of the
endowment fund (FAP). FUNBIO would also have in place a financial management system to
generate financial, physical monitoring, and procurement reports (FMRs) on use of the GEF
grant monies, donor contributions, and the government's counterpart funds.
5. Environmental
5.1 Environmental assessment
No major adverse environmental impacts are expected as a result of this project. The Category
B has been assigned to ARPA. ARPA's main goal is to create and consolidate protected areas
in the Amazon region. Despite the largely positive and neutral project environmental impacts,
some sustainable use subprojects in the buffer areas of the protected areas could trigger OP 4.01
and OP 4.36. Mechanisms have been put in place that will screen for environmental safeguards
before any investments are made. Prior to appraisal, the Borrower submitted an Environmental
Annex on April 23, 2002 (prior to appraisal) that addresses OP. 4.01 and OP 4.36. This
information is presented in Annex 18. Key provisions of the Environmental Annex will be
incorporated within the Project Operational Manual.
5.2 Main features of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
Environmental Policy OP 4.01. BP 4.01. The subprojects in the buffer zones of protected areas
would support sustainable activities with minimum environmental impact under Components 2
and 3 of ARPA. These activities are meant to strengthen the conservation activities of the
protected areas, and would be identified in the management plans of the protected areas. Once
the protected areas have been identified, proposals would be prepared to request funding from
ARPA. The proposals for these subprojects would be submitted to the Program Committee,
34



which would assess their value and identify whether they are eligible for ARPA funding. The
proposals would include a section on the environmental issues of the activities, and explain
whether or not they have environmental impact; if they have impacts, the proposal shall
describe how these will be mitigated. An environmental assessment would be developed as
needed. IBAMA or the state environmental agency (depending on whether it is a federal or state
protected area) would screen for the environmental impact of these proposals before they are
submitted to the Program Committee for final approval. Eligibility criteria will be spelled out in
the Project Operational Manual. If a proposed subproject is not eligible, the Program Committee
may recommend other funding sources. The required management plans shall include a zoning
plan that takes into account the ecological fragility and biological importance of different zones
within the protected area, and that spells out the uses permitted within each zone. The
management plans would be sent to the Bank and donors for approval before the management
plans are implemented. IBAMA or the state environmental agency would also ensure that the
proposed sustainable use activities adhere to the zoning proposal. No disbursements for
sustainable use activities would be made until the management plans for the areas have been
approved. Finally, no roads will be built in the protected areas with any of the Project funds.
Because FUNBIO would be supporting the implementation of pilot subprojects under
Component 3, FUNBIO would be responsible for the screening of any of the environmental
impacts of the proposals for sustainable use activities, following the same mechanism described
above.
Forestry Policy OP 4.36. In extractive reserves, only community forestry is allowed under the
newly passed SNUC law. Community forestry was not allowed in extractive reserves before the
passing of this law. ARPA would ensure that any activity of this type is done according to the
Bank's Forestry Policy. Article 7 of SNUC states that the exploration of timber resources in
extractive reserves will only be permitted under sustainable schemes and in special
circumstances, and should be complementary to the other activities developed within the
extractive reserve, according to the dispositions in the regulations and based on the management
plan for the reserve.
To ensure that the Bank's Forestry Policy is applied to community forestry in extractive
reserves, the following has been agreed:
Bank's review of Management Plans under Component 1. The unit at IBAMA responsible for
overseeing the extractive reserves is CNPT. Extractive reserves cannot undergo any use before a
management plan is approved. Management plans for extractive reserves would be supported
under ARPA and would be prepared according to IBAMA's rules. Management plans would
follow similar guidelines (Roteiro Metodologico do IBAMA) to those used by DIREC for parks
and reserves. The management plan would consist of four major sections: the Utilization plan,
Development plan, Business plan, and plan's duration. Detailed guidelines on management
plans for extractive reserves will be included in the Project Operational Manual. A study carried
out by CNPT shows that, in the past, extractive reserves have the potential to generate income
from activities such as the harvesting of rubber, nuts, and timber; ecotourism;, and
environmental services. The management plans would discuss all of these alternatives. In the
extractive reserves implemented by CNPT, timber is mainly extracted by local communities to
use it as material for art crafts rather than for the selling of whole logs. The management plans
35



are prepared by the communities living in the areas and are approved by IBAMA. In the event
the communities request timber extraction as part of a larger program of Reserve utilization, the
section in the management plan on utilization would include, arnong other pertinent aspects,
species inventories, mode of extraction, quantity, reforestation procedures, and if available,
planned certification schemes.
The procedures explained above are described in greater detail in Annex 18 and will be included
in the Project Operational Manual. If the regulation of SNUC is approved and the new
regulation changes the current guidelines for preparing the management plans, the Bank would
revise the context of the new regulation and its effect on the Project and, if necessary, request
that the Brazilian government modify the procedures spelled out in Annex 18.
Eligible activities under Component 3. Once the management plans of extractive reserves are
approved by the Program Committee and IBAMA, and reviewed by the Bank, certain extractive
reserves may be eligible to receive funds from the Project's endowment fund. The eligibility
criteria are limited to surveillance and enforcement activities in the intangible areas of the
reserve. Additional eligibility criteria would be applied to the selection of extractive reserves for
funding. These eligibility criteria are: (a) an approved management plan; (b) the creation of a
local inhabitants association for the reserve; (c) a completed assessment of the reserve
population; (d) an established Local Advisory Committee; (e) an approved POA; (f) at least 90
percent of it's the protected area's original forest cover remains; and, (g) all World Bank
safeguards are fulfilled.
5.3 Timeline and status of environmental assessment
The Borrower submitted an Environmental Annex prior to appraisal which, after QAT review,
has been sent to the InfoShop (April, 2002).
5.4 Stakeholder involvement
A number of consultations with stakeholders that live and work near protected areas in the
Amazon have been conducted through the social consultation process described in section E.6.
Stakeholders have manifested their demands for sustainable development initiatives to be
financed in the protected areas' buffer zone as a way to provide them with sustainable
livelihood alternatives. Project design addresses such a demand and assures that this can be met
without harmful environmental impact.
5.5 Environmental indicators
The M&E program for ARPA (Component 4) includes detailed indicators on changes in land
uses and ecosystem health as well as indicator species and social indicators. The M&E system is
designed to give early warning to managers of protected areas to permit mitigating actions. The
indicators fully reflect the project. The M&E program would assist and guide the development
of activities to be permitted in the parks and reserves. In addition, workshops would be
conducted with Directors and staff of protected areas under the Project to improve their capacity
to evaluate environmental impacts, implement the legislation, and design mitigation measures.
Protected area staff would also be given an opportunity to refine the checklist of activities
requiring environmental assessments and activities that should not be permitted, as well as
36



methods for implementing the checklists to ensure that the rules reflect the practical need in the
field.
6. Social
6.1 Key social issues and planned social development outcomes
(see Annex 16 and 17)
The social aspects of the Amazon region relevant to project preparation have been analyzed in a
comprehensive study and through a series of workshops that culminated in the publication of
the book Biodiversidade na Amazonia Brasileira compiled by the Socio-Environmental Institute
(ISA). This comprehensive work was financed by the Bank/GEF-financed operation PROBIO,
and has been the basis for the definition of the Project's social strategy, which is described
below.
Indigenous People Policy:-D 4.20. The Project triggers OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples) since
the project is located in the Brazilian Amazon where most of the indigenous population of
Brazil is located. A central premise of the proposed project is that the success of identification,
demarcation, and protection of protected areas depends on direct involvement and participation
of the local population. Another keystone of the Project is that it will not support creation or
consolidation of any protected area that includes or overlaps with indigenous lands. The
decision of whether an indigenous land overlaps with a protected area will be based on the
official maps of IBAMA and FUNAI, and consultation with key NGOs working on indigenous
issues such as ISA and COAIB. Brazilian legislation requires consultation and participation of
local and indigenous communities in regularization and other activities affecting their lands.
According to Brazilian legislation, indigenous territories and their demarcation are conceded
priority over any other land claim or proposed government land use designation. ARPA will
rigorously verify that none of the areas to be created or consolidated will overlap or affect
indigenous lands.
Annex 16 outlines the Brazilian government's general strategy with regard to indigenous
peoples in the context of ARPA. This strategy was publicly disclosed in Brazil on May 28,
2002, prior to appraisal, and was subsequently reviewed and endorsed on June 24, 2002 by the
LCSES QAT, prior to negotiations. For each proposed new protected or existing protected area
for consolidation, a preliminary screening would be done to ascertain whether indigenous
peoples are present inside or near the targeted area. This screening would be performed by the
Conflict Mediation Committee. Whenever the creation and implementation of a protected area
would have a significant direct or indirect impact on indigenous people, MMA will follow the
consultative process established in the Project Operational Manual and prepare a specific plan
agreed with the Bank. This plan would be approved by the Bank prior to any actions, other than
studies and consultations, being taken in the area. In addition, when protected areas border
indigenous lands, the Project would support, as part of the protected area management plans, the
development of culturally appropriate activities determined necessary to assist the indigenous
people. Such activities would be prepared with the full participation of the indigenous people
near the protected area, and would be financed by a variety of sources such as the PPG7, the
PDPI, other government funding, and some of the community subprojects in Component 2 and
revenue generating activities in Component 3. Prior to effectiveness, MMA will sign a
cooperation agreement with FUNAI to assure that indigenous lands will be properly identified
37



and demarcated before implementation of protected areas. In this agreement, the responsibilities
of FUNAI vis-a-vis the demarcation of indigenous territories and any activities related to ARPA
by indigenous peoples would be spelled out, including a commitment to prioritize the
demarcation of indigenous areas adjacent to protected areas to be created under ARPA and to
provide the certification that the proposed boundaries of a protected area do not overlap with
indigenous lands. ARPA is currently being proposed as an associated project to the PPG7.
Before effectiveness, ARPA will be fully integrated to the planning of the PPG7; thus, the
Project will have assurances that indigenous lands identified in the vicinity of proposed new
protected areas will receive priority for financing. Also, prior to effectiveness, the Brazilian
government will agree with officials and donors of the Indigenous Demonstration Project (PDI)
on appropriate mechanisms for assuring the availability of financing to assist indigenous
peoples in the vicinity of protected areas.
Resettlement-OP 4.12. Annex 17 presents the Brazilian government's strategy to address issues
of resettlement. The Resettlement Policy and Process Framework, consistent with the Bank's
guidelines, were publicly disclosed on May 28, 2002, prior to the ARPA appraisal mission, and
were subsequently reviewed and endorsed on June 24, 2002 by the LCSES QAT. The Project is
likely to encounter situations where local communities and traditional communities are located
in protected areas to be created or consolidated and, therefore, would be affected by the Project.
SNUC allows for categories of protected areas, such as Extractive and Sustainable Use Reserves
that belong to the federal government, where conservation of the forest ecosystems needs to be
reconciled with the use of the forest products by local populations so that they can develop over
generations. SNUC also takes into account local culture and past experiences in managing
natural ecosystems. To the extent that such areas can be created to accommodate traditional
populations, resettlement would be unnecessary. In these types of protected areas, local
populations remain in place and can use the natural resources under management plans prepared
by them and approved by IBAMA. In cases where such management plans restrict the use of
resources that were formerly utilized by the local population for a substantial proportion of their
livelihood, OP4.12 is triggered. Prior to implementation of the protected area, a Process
Framework, agreed with the Bank, would be negotiated with the affected population to allow
them to remain in place while developing alternative resources and practices that will
effectively replace any that may be lost.
Other types of protected areas that would be considered under ARPA include parks and
reserves. In such areas, local populations are not permitted. The National System of
Conservation Units Law (SNUC, 2000) requires that people in three categories of protected
areas be resettled. In view of the SNUC law, the stated policy of MMA is to avoid resettlement
by creating "sustainable use" protected areas or by reclassifying existing protected areas to
accommodate traditional populations. If, during the preliminary screening process, it is
determined that resettlement is unavoidable, the process triggers OP4.12. MMA has submitted a
Resettlement Policy document that lays out the procedures that would be put in place under the
Project to deal with potential resettlements. In such cases, a Resettlement Plan agreed with the
Bank would be prepared prior to implementation of a new protected area or consolidation of an
existing protected area, and MMA/INCRA would ensure appropriate financing. MMA has
agreed to sign a cooperation agreement with INCRA prior to effectiveness to assure financing
and institutional responsibility to carry out any resettlement that may become necessary under
ARPA.
38



6.2 Stakeholder participation in the project
Preparation of the project has been undertaken as a collaborative effort among stakeholders. An
Advisory Committee has been operating since earlier stages of preparation to oversee project
design. The Committee is comprised of MMA, IBAMA, WWF, FUNBIO, National Council of
Rubber Tapers (CNS), and Amazon Working Group (GTA). In addition, NGOs and
international agencies have been consulted during this initial organizing phase; these included
FUNATURA, USAID, Institute for Society, Population and Nature (ISPN), the Nature
Conservancy (TNC), the British Council, GTZ, PNUD, and Socio-Environmental Institute
(ISA). MMA sponsored a key social forum, the Macapa Workshop, in September 1999 to
establish priority areas for Amazonian biodiversity conservation and to identify actions
supporting regional sustainable development. The Macapa Workshop and prior preparations
were coordinated by a consortium of NGOs, including ISA, GTA, IMAZON, IPAN, ISPN, and
CI. A total of 226 participants were involved in the workshop (see complete list of participants
and affiliated organizations at httn://www/socioambiental.org/bio/index.htm). The Workshop
was attended by a cross section of community, NGO, indigenous, private sector, governmental
and environmental specialist stakeholders. An Evaluation Committee was also established to
advise the workshop organizers during the entire process. They included the following
organizations: INPA, Museu Emilio Goeldi, Embrapa, UFPa, Sociedade Civil Mamiraua,
FASE, Aimex, CNA, CNS, COIAB, FETAGRI-PA, MMA, IBAMA, SECTAM/PA, OEMA do
Amapa, Coordenadoria de Saneamento e Meio Ambiente de Santarem e Prefeitura Municipal de
Xapuri. COIAB is the indigenous organization for the Amazon. The following indigenous
organizations participated in the workshop: Federa,ao Das Org. Indigenas do Rio Negro -
FOIRN Conselho Indigena de Roraima - CTICentro de Trabalho Indigenista, and COIAB.
Workshop results underpin the ongoing protected areas selection process. The Project itself is
also conceived as a highly collaborative and participatory exercise to ensure ownership of
beneficiaries and stakeholders, and to facilitate efficient implementation.
6.3 Collaboration with NGOs and other organizations in civil society
ARPA has been discussed very widely over the last two years. The proposal has been submitted
for comments to social organizations in the Amazon (GTA, CNS, CONTAG, COIAB, and
ASMUBIP) and to FUJNBIO's Board which has a broad NGO representation. Other
participatory processes have taken place since the early phase of project development and help
test the procedures for continued public consultation during project implementation. Two
workshops were organized, one in Rond6nia and one in Roraima, financed by the WWF/WB
Alliance, to create a set of new areas and develop a methodology for public consultation during
project implementation. These workshops were carried out in October and November 2000. One
case study involved the creation of an indirect use area (park) and of two extractive reserves in
Costa Marques, Rond6nia. The second case study involved the preparatory workshop for the
consolidation of a mosaic of protected areas of indirect use (parks and ecological stations) in
Caracaraf, Roraima. In both cases, the methodology was assessed by a variety of actors and
found appropriate for the proposed objectives of ARPA. Annex 15 describes the participatory
methodology to be used under ARPA that was based on the result of these workshops.
The Brazilian government recently gave one additional seat in the Program Committee to social
NGOs. The Program Committee that will operate during project implementation has six
government representatives (SECEX/MMA, SCA/MMA, SBF/MMA, IBAMA, State Forum of
39



Secretaries of Environment of the Amazon Region, and municipalities) and six representatives
from civil society (two social NGOs, two environmental NGOs, one FUNBIO member, and one
donor).
6.4 Institutional arrangements to ensure that the project achieves its social development
outcomes (see Annex 16 and 17)
Indigenous Peoples Plan. The Program Committee and Conflict Mediation Committee (CMC)
to be established will operate under the MMA to ensure that the Indigenous Strategy and the
specific Indigenous Peoples Plans are implemented. The purpose of the CMC is to assist the
Project's executive coordination in negotiating and proposing potential solutions to social and
indigenous people issues related to the creation and implementation of protected areas; and,
acting as a forum for the discussion and resolution of issues related to traditional and indigenous
populations inside existing "strict protection" PAs. This core group would be composed by the
project coordinator representing MMA and representatives from FUNAI, IBAMA (CNPT and
DIREC), and INCRA. The detailed functions and operational guidelines for the CMC will be
presented in the Project Operational Manual. In addition, the MMA will sign an agreement with
FUNAI that will set forth FUNAI's and MMA's responsibilities in the implementation of the
relevant Indigenous People Strategy that is an integral part of ARPA.
Resettlement Policy Framework and Process Framework. The Program Committee and the
CMC would oversee all aspects of the project, including the application of the Resettlement
Policy and Process Framework agreed for the project. In addition, if aspects of the application
of the Framework apply to traditional communities, IBAMA would carry out the activities
agreed. If other inhabitants need to be considered, INCRA, through an agreement with MMA
would oversee that the procedures in the Resettlement Policy and Process Framework are
applied.
6.5 Monitoring of social development outcomes
Monitoring indicators of social development outcomes would be incorporated into the Project
Operational Manual and would be part of the activities included in Component 4 of the Project
(Monitoring and Evaluation).
7. Participatory Approach
7.1 Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups
Since its inception the Project has been framed as a collaborative effort among stakeholders.
WWF initiated the process, including important international and national NGOs in Brazilian
briefings that prepared the ground for the creation of an Advisory Conmuittee to oversee the
elaboration of the GEF proposal. The Committee comprises the World Bank and principal
government ministry and NGO project sponsors, including MMA/IBAMA and the WWF. To
elaborate the proposal, the Committee, in turn, created a task force composed of MMA,
IBAMA, WWF, the World Bank, and environmental specialists. Local groups, NGOs, and aid
agencies consulted during this initial organizing phase included FUNATURA, USAID, ISPN,
the Nature Conservancy (TNC), the British Council, Grupo de Trabalho da Amazonia (GTA),
Rede Brasil de Bancos Multilaterais, GTZ, PNUD, and Instituto Socio Ambiental (ISA).
40



The federal government sponsored a key social forum, the Macapa Workshop, and two local
workshops in Roraima and Rondonia, already mentioned in section E.6. Section C.4 on
institutional and implementation arrangements lists the partners that ARPA would have during
its implementation.
The project itself is being framed as a highly collaborative and participatory exercise to ensure
ownership of beneficiaries and stakeholders, and to facilitate efficient implementation.
Participation of stakeholders is programmed in each of the five components, as summarized
below. Annex 15 describes the participatory method to be used to create new protected areas.
Component 1-Creation of new protected areas. Evaluation of local conditions require
participatory social and environmental analyses. The process and its implications for local
communities would be fully disseminated through a social communication campaign.
Demarcation activities would include local and especially indigenous people and/or their
representatives. The ongoing process of updating information bases, including socioeconomic
information, would also rely on local participation.
Component 2-Consolidation of protected areas. Selection criteria for existing protected areas
already include stakeholder participation and NGO activity in the candidate area based on the
participatory management plans. The partnership paradigm for this component would promote
the involvement of local groups and NGOs in protected areas and buffer zone management, and
would provide training as necessary. Protected Areas Management Councils would be formed
from local government and private stakeholders. The development of management plans and
identification and implementation of any revenue generating activities will be participatory, and
would be openly discussed with beneficiaries and those affected.
Component 3-Long-term sustainability of protected areas. Two workshops, one in Ecuador
(June 2000) and one in Mexico (November 2001) discussed successful mechanisms for
financing parks in Latin America. Team members from ARPA participated in these meetings. In
addition to the FAP, this component will delve into market-driven revenue generation
instruments to support protected areas management. Market-driven mechanisms include
ecotourism, services, royalties, and fiscal incentives (see Annex 2). Plans would be developed
to pilot instruments/mechanisms, and these would involve local and indigenous community
consultations to ensure that they are feasible and demand-driven. Also, a subcomponent would
disseminate information on protected area laws and regulations to affected populations, and
would monitor closely for anomalies.
Component 4-Protected area monitoring. While this component is more technical it would
also involve collaboration at the technical level with SIMBIO and organizations specialized in
monitoring. The results of monitoring, which would include project implementation progress as
well as environmental monitoring, would be broadly disseminated.
Component 5-Project Coordination and Management. A National Coordinating Committee
would work with public sector and Civil Society Organization (CSO) representatives to assure
that guidelines are functional and being implemented properly, and to generally monitor project
progress. The results would also be widely available to interested parties.

8.2a Issues involved, not already discussed above
Two Bank policy exceptions apply to ARPA: (a) FUNBIO will establish an account where a
portion of the funds will be advanced upfront toward the FAP (Component 3). These funds will
not be managed through a special account but by an asset manager agreed with the Bank and
under investment guidelines and spending rules approved by the Bank. This special
disbursement and management system has been adopted for ARPA under the exception to the
application of disbursements and trust fund policies for GEF-supported Conservation Funds
approved by Bank senior management on March 15, 2002. The FAP account will be managed
like an endowment fund, where only the income from the investments will be used to finance
the recurrent costs of protected areas. (b) The Operational Memorandum Bank Policy on
Financing Income Taxes, issued on June 13, 2001, clarifies the Bank's policy against financing
local income taxes in Bank-financed operations. One clarification is that nonprofit,
nongovernmental organizations can use grant proceeds to pay taxes. The proposed project
applies this rule.
42



F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability
Sustainability will be achieved through the following measures:
a. The independent and accountable private endowment fund (FAP), within the institutional
context of FUNBIO, will manage capital funds in such a way as to provide assured, long-term
flow of resources to the protected areas, in accordance with Bank-approved investment
guidelines.
b. At the protected area level, identification of cost-recovery and cost-financing mechanisms,
which will be used to augment FAP support and government budgetary allocations.
c. The adoption of participatory planning mechanisms and strategic partnerships with
stakeholders, as well as social assessments and monitoring of conditions ensuring social
sustainability of the Project.
d. Building a strong management capacity in MMA, IBAMA, FUNBIO, and at the local
protected area level ensuring the institutional sustainability of the Project.
e. Building partnerships with other public programs and civil society, together with other
national and international institutions, to assure a more comprehensive approach to the root
causes of biodiversity loss.

ANNEX 2
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This Project is aimed at expanding and consolidating the system of Protected Areas in the
Brazilian Amazon to sustain biodiversity conservation. For the purpose of this Project, the terms
"protected areas" (PAs) and "protected areas" (UCs) include the following categories defined in
Law number 9.985 (July 18, 2000) that established the National System of Protected Areas
(SNUC): Parks, Biological Reserves, Ecological Stations, Extractive Reserves, and Sustainable
Development Reserves. These five categories correspond to two general types of protected areas:
(i) "strict protection" (Parks, Biological Reserves, and Ecological Stations); and (ii) "sustainable
use"(Extractive Reserves and Sustainable Development Reserves). The SNUC law gives the
detailed definition of each PA category and their regulation, including for state and municipal
protected areas.
Component 1: Creation of New Protected Areas
This component will support the creation of new protected areas in priority areas of high
biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon biome. The selection of these priority areas was based on
the PRONABIO Amazon workshop (Evaluation and Identification of Priority Actions for
Conservation, Sustainable Use, and Benefit Sharing of the Brazilian Amazon Biodiversity;
Macapa 1999), WWF-Brazil studies, and Block-B-supported analysis and consultations. The
selection process is described in detail in Annex 13. The scientific community, grassroots
organizations, indigenous peoples, social and environmental NGOs, and government institutions
were actively involved in the PRONABIO workshop, and their concerns are reflected in the
various workshop documents and maps. The priority areas, and their biodiversity and social
importance, are described in Annex 13.
This component will target the creation of 18 million hectares of new protected areas in the five
categories defined above (Parks, Biological Reserves, Ecological Stations, Extractive Reserves,
and Sustainable Development Reserves) over the next four years. The total area corresponds to 9
million hectares of new "strict protection" PAs (Parks, Biological Reserves, and Ecological
Stations), and 9 million hectares of new "sustainable use" PAs' (Extractive Reserves and
Sustainable Development Reserves). The new protected areas of these five categories may be
established at federal, state, and/or municipal levels. These targets will contribute to the overall
long-term program goal of 28.5 million hectares of new "strict protection" protected areas in the
Brazilian Amazon biome by the year 2012. The subsequent phases of the program (Phases 2 and
3, of three years duration each) will target the remaining 19.5 million hectares. The targets for all
five categories of PA for Phases 2 and 3 will be defined at the end of Phase 1.
' Sustainable use protected areas have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the
communities living in them. These protected areas are regulated by management plans that include various
use zones, some of which protect key enviromnental values of these areas, including, in particular, a "strict
protection" zone. ARPA will support only surveillance and enforcement activities in the "sustainable use"
protected areas to ensure ecological integrity and biodiversity conservation.

1.1 Onpoing process of prioritization.
The identification and prioritization of PAs to be further created and regularized under the project
will be an ongoing process. There are 23 different ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon biome that
cover an area of 410 million hectares (4,105 kM2). During the 10-year program, new scientific,
social-economic, and land-use knowledge will provide new information bearing upon PA
creation. Under this subcomponent, the project will provide support for collecting and
consolidating information from a variety of databases (IBGE, RADAM Brazil, State Zoning
Projects, ISA, CI, WWF, among others), with constant update and review of the selected
methodology for identification of new protected areas. The identification team also would
provide an independent assessment of where to create new areas, and ensure that new proposed
areas follow the highest biodiversity priorities, ecosystem representativity, and sustainable-use
potential, ensuring the application of appropriate environmental and social standards in the
selection process.
The activities in this subcomponent will encompass, among others, the following:
a. Collecting information from different sources such as IBGE, RADAM Brazil, state
Ecological and Economic Zoning (ZEE) projects, ISA, CI, and WWF, keeping them updated
in a project database
b. Prioritizing ecoregions and carrying out an ongoing representativity analysis as new
information becomes available
c. Analyzing the biological importance and ecosystems representativity of new areas for
conservation identified by the state ZEEs
d. Recommending new areas to be created according to the following scheme-(i) Priority 1:
areas recommended by PRONABIO and the ZEEs; (ii) Priority 2: areas recommended by
PRONABIO, but not identified in the ZEEs; (iii) Priority 3: areas identified by the
complementary representativity analyses and by ZEEs; (iv) Priority 4: areas recommended by
the complementary representativity analyses
e. Designing mosaics of protected areas to ensure ecosystem function and maintenance
f. Promoting consultation with states and municipalities*
g. Incorporating the results of consultation with local and indigenous organizations,
anthropological reports, and inputs resulting from the participation of local people in the
proposed polygons
h. Sending regularly to the Program Committee lists of proposed new areas
i. Evaluating the effectiveness of the methodology and incorporating changes to improve it
1.2 Identification of new PAs.
This subcomponent will support the necessary studies for the technical preparation of proposals
for the creation of new PAs. The SNUC law establishes that "the creation of a unit of
conservation should be preceded by technical studies and by public consultation that will enable
the identification of the localization, dimension and the appropriate limits for the units." The
activities under this subcomponent will encompass all the steps necessary for the preparation of
the draft "protected areas creation decrees" (decretos de criacdo) following the steps defined in
SNUC. (See Annexes 13 and 15 for the methodology and consultation process.) The areas
identified will be subjected to review by the Scientific Advisory Panel (PCA) described under the
institutional arrangements (Section C.4) in order to certify for their biodiversity importance.
The following measures will be undertaken for the creation of new PAs, before the legal approval
and decree publication in the Official Gazette:

1.3 Establishment of new PAs.
The Project will undertake a series of actions to complete the on-the-ground establishment of a
new PAs zone and to integrate it into the regional PAs system. A set of subactivities, similar to
those defined for Component 2, will be designed to further support the process of establishing and
consolidating new PAs. These will include:
a. Implementation strategies to resolve land tenure conflicts
b. Negotiation of agreements with third parties (private-sector organizations) for the
establishment and management of new PAs (as in Component 2)
c. Where appropriate, contingency plans for land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement
when necessary
d. Elaboration and implementation of PA basic protection plans for "sustainable use reserves",
management plans would be supported following guidelines spelled out in the Operational
Manual.
e. Construction of infrastructure and acquisition of equipment
f. Training and rural extension activities
55



The Project will ensure that state and municipal governments participate in the different stages of
the selection, establishment, and management of new PAs. This will include decentralized
activities such as:
a. Participation in the consultation and technical process for the selection and establishment of
new PAs
b. Participation in the different activities of the technical and scientific studies
c. Direct execution of the activities involved in the establishment and consolidation of PAs,
including the allocation of resources to selected states and unicipalities
d. Signing of agreements between MIMA/IBAMA and private-sector organizations for the
establishment and management of new PAs
e. Participation in the design, development, and implementation of community-development
plans and projects based on sustainable management of natural resources at state and
municipal levels to benefit communities in and around PAs
f. Design and implementation of environmental monitoring and evaluation systems targeting
PAs at state and municipal levels, and to evaluate the Project's outputs
Protected areas in this component will be considered created once they have met the following
two sets of benchmarks, one for the legal creation of the area, and the other for the establishment
of basic management capacity:
Legal creation
* Preliminary environmental and social assessment conducted
* Social communication and public consultation conducted
* Decision on PA boundaries and management category made

infrastructure, equipment, staffing, and demarcation
56



e. Completion of on-the-ground establishment activities for at least 10 PAs of strict protection,
including land regularization, basic infrastructure, equipment, staff, and demarcation
Component 2: Consolidation of Protected Areas
The main objective of this component would be to promote the implementation of existing and
recently created PAs and their buffer zones in the Amazon region. This component will support
activities in a minimum of 15 new "strict protection" PAs (approximately 9 million hectares) and
12 existing "strict protection" PAs (6.7 million hectares). The criteria for selection of these PAs
include the following:
a. Lack of conflicts with indigenous lands or communities
b. Land tenure situation resolved or favorable for resolution
c. Potential for success-logistical feasibility of implementation during the time horizon of
Phase I
d. Local institutional capacity and presence of NGOs-existence of interinstitutional conditions
or other externalities that make the consolidation effort effective
e. High conservation value-strong potential for synergy in the preservation of other areas of
restrictive use
A detailed description of the 12 existing "strict protection" PAs selected is presented Annex 14.
New and existing PAs in this component will be considered consolidated once they have met the
following benchmarks:
a. PA physical limits defined and demarcated
b. Private property assessment conducted
c. Provisional protection plan functioning
d. PAs Management Council established
e. Preparation of management plan
f. Critical management plan subprograms implemented
g. Management plan for environmental monitoring
h. Buffer zone control
i. Protection plan
j. Administration and maintenance
k. Staffing plan
1. Infrastructure and equipment
m. Institutional cooperation
n. PA financial sustainability assessed
2.1 Demarcation and land regularization of existing PAs.
This subcomponent will support activities necessary for demarcation and land regularization of
the 12 existing "strict protection" PAs. It will finance land tenure assessments, including
activities on baseline land registry surveys, ground surveys, private property infrastructure
surveys, and mapping. Demarcation activities to establish the PA perimeter will be financed
where necessary in order to achieve total demarcation for the 12 existing "strict protection" PAs
by end of project. A detailed land acquisition plan will be prepared, and government funds will be
used to finance land purchase where needed. This subcomponent also will finance
workshops/seminars on PA conflict resolution related to boundary establishment.
57



2.2 Basic protection.
This subcomponent is designed to provide support for operation of the PAs while the
management plans are being prepared. Under this subcomponent, the PAs (existing and new) will
be outfitted with basic infrastructure, equipment, and core staff to secure basic services of
protection and community outreach before the preparation and implementation of management
plans. The government will provide a minimum of five staff per "strict protection" PA (one
manager, one technical assistant, and three rangers), and will support the Reserve Associations
for the "sustainable use" PAs. The Project will provide funding for small civil works, emergency
communication and patrolling equipment, and basic training.
2.3 Management planning.
This subcomponent will support activities related to the elaboration and implementation of a total
of 21 management plans for new and existing PAs. The management plans would include the
long-term mission for the protected areas, where the fundamental philosophical approach is
articulated and agreed upon. The experience and lessons learned from the National
Environmental Program Project (NEP I) in regard to PAs management and the development of
management plans will be incorporated into this exercise. The management plans would serve as
the master tool for planning and programming PAs management, and also would serve as
instruments to validate PA categorization, boundaries, and for identifying possible land use
conflicts. Local communities and civil society will participate in the preparation of the
management plans, through mechanisms described in subcomponent 2.4. The management plans
will take into account elements such as socioeconomic conditions, anthropology, archaeology,
landscape, enviromnental education, tourism potential, and land ownership. The management
plans also would include as an objective the implementation of mechanisms to incorporate data
from existing biodiversity monitoring systems to support planning and programming.
IBAMA would be responsible for the preparation of management plans for the federal PAs and
will conduct the activities either directly or through contracts with selected organizations,
including NGOs, academic institutions, and others. At state and municipal levels, the
environmental agencies will follow the same procedures. The plans would be adjusted
periodically (every five years) as the need arises, using additional information from
MMA/IBAMA Remote Sensing Center/SIMBIO, scientific institutions, and NGOs with
experience in biological diversity.
Under this subcomponent, priority would be given to the implementation of the following key
areas of IBAMA's management plan guidelines (subprogramas): (a) environmental monitoring;
(b) buffer zone management and control; (c) protection; (d) administration and maintenance; (e)
infrastructure and equipment; (f) staff; and (g) institutional cooperation.
Implementation of management plans will make full use of the considerable capacity of Brazilian
CBOs, NGOs, scientific and academic institutions, and the civil society in conservation. Civil
society expertise will be especially important in the areas such as PAs management planning,
natural resources management, rural development, community organization, technology transfer,
monitoring and evaluation, and environmental education. This collaboration would be
operationalized through partnership and concession agreements to increase the number of
qualified stakeholders and to facilitate effective participatory management.
58



2.4 Community participation.
Long-term sustainability of PAs depends heavily on the participation and effective involvement
of local communities and civil society. Local communities have a unique and mutual relationship
with protected areas. The Project is aimed at increasing local participation, within levels
compatible with biodiversity conservation. This subcomponent will support community
participation for the establishment and consolidation of PAs. The activities will include the
establishment and/or operation of PAs Management Councils, partnerships with NGOs for PAs
management, and community subprojects, among others. The eligibility criteria for the
subprojects would be spelled out in the Operational Manual.
Protected Areas Management Councils (Conselho da Unidade Conservaqdo), as defined in article
29 of the SNUC law, is the basic mechanism for community participation in PAs management.
The Councils will include representatives from local community organizations, local
governments, and NGOs. Existing Councils would be strengthened by training and by the
provision of improved meeting facilities and resources to support regular activities. The Councils
will provide advice to the management authority of the PA. Work plans and programs will be
developed by Councils at the PA level and under the guidance of the PA approved management
plan. The establishment and development of participatory PAs management also will serve as an
instrument to promote an active participation of women in the process.
Specific activities that will ensure enhanced local participation include: (a) planning and
programming control and protection with participation of stakeholders and local population; (b)
enhancing research activities, and developing links between research and small economic
activities at the community level; (c) conducting workshops and seminars to increase information
dissemination and exchange; and (d) sponsoring environmental education and public relations
campaigns that target the PAs and their buffer zones.
2.5 Training.
Under this activity, the Project will diagnose in situ managerial systems for PAs including
administrative and financial management, and will develop and implement programs to improve
performance. The Project would provide technical assistance to assess existing PAs management
mechanisms and develop a managerial review system to support decision making, and to improve
planning, programming, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting at PA and central levels. The
management system also would include a mechanism to ensure appropriate information flow
between IBAMA, different stakeholders, and civil society. This component also will fund training
of staff and partners involved in PAs management by developing training packages to cover the
following areas:
a. PAs management (participatory planning and programming)
b. Conflict management and resolution
c. Public information management
d. Participatory monitoring & evaluation
e. Gender and ethnicity
f. Fund raising
g. Accounting
h. Transparency, accountability, and reporting
The Project will develop the appropriate indicators to ensure a balanced participation of various
social groups and stakeholders, as well as men and women in training events.
59



2.6 Outputs.
The component outputs include:
a. Nine approved PA management plans under implementation
b. 11 management plans under elaboration
c. 12 federal "strict protection" PAs and three state/municipal "strict protection" PAs with basic
infrastructure completed and equipped
d. A management review system in place at IBAMA and at target PAs
e. PA partnerships and/or concession agreements signed and under implementation
f. Increased and tangible interinstitutional coordination and community participation at the PA
level through a strong buffer zone management program
g. Improved interinstitutional coordination and demonstration of participation from the
communities around the PA
Component 3: Long-term Sustainability of Protected Areas
The objective of this component is to establish mechanisms for the long-term sustainability of
PAs consolidated under ARPA. This component would lay the basis for long-term financial
sustainability by identifying and implementing appropriate financial mechanisms and institutional
capacity to ensure proper post-consolidation PAs management. Under the current shortage of
resources to manage the existing PAs, it is unlikely that the government will have sufficient
resources to properly address the long-term needs of the PAs created and consolidated under
ARPA. Consequently, this component is critical to lay the basis for long-term financial
sustainability of PAs, considering a realistic scenario where financing by the GEF and other
donors will progressively decrease. The component design encompasses the establishment of an
endowment fund for the PA system in the Amazon region, FAP, and the preparation of studies
and subprojects aimed at defining and testing appropriate revenue-generating mechanisms for PA
sustainability. The Brazilian Biodiversity Fund, FUNBIO,2 will be responsible for the
implementation of this component and the administration of FAP, during Phase 1 of the program.
3.1. Protected areas endowment fund (FAP).
This subcomponent will support the establishment and initial operation of a protected areas
endowment fund for the Amazon region (FAP-Fundo de Areas Protegidas) to be created and
managed as a subaccount within FIJNBIO. The Fund will be established as an endowment,
providing long-term sustainable support to finance core costs of Amazon PAs.
The main activities under this subcomponent are: (a) creation of an administrative, financial, and
legal structure (administrative and office team-support that enables FUNBIO to assume the
additional responsibilities of technical, administrative, and financial supervision for the operation
2 FUNBIO was established in 1996 under the GEF Pilot Phase (US$20 million grant from GEF, US$10
million from other domestic and international partners). FUNBIO was designed and is operating under the
best practices stated in the GEF's Evaluation of Experiences with Conservation Trust Funds (1998).
FUNBIO involves an innovative arrangement whereby release of GEF capital for the endowment is tied to
mobilization of matching funds mainly from the private sector. FUNBIO has an independent governing
Board that seeks to assure both representativity and transparency in its activities.
60



of FAP); (b) support of recurrent costs of existing PAs; and (c) developing a fundraising strategy
for capitalization of FAP.
A detailed description of FAP operation and finance is presented in Annex 12. The norms to
regulate the operations, finances, administration, and procedures of FAP, and regulations for the
partnership between IBAMA and the FAP administrator (FUNBIO), will be determined in a
separate FAP Operational Manual with the following contents: (a) decision-making structure; (b)
financial structure and asset manager; (c) mechanism to support PAs operational costs; (d) cost
and financing; (e) disbursements, auditing, and reporting; and (f) monitoring and evaluation. The
final preparation of the manual would be a condition effectiveness.
The selection of PAs to be eligible for funding from FAP investment income shall be made
according to defined criteria and weights, including: (a) the existence of minimum infrastructure
and staff; (b) the existence of management plans that are concluded or under preparation; (c) the
GOB annual budget allocation; (d) the constitution of the Management Council(s); (e) the degree
of threat (human pressure); and (f) accreditation in the National Register of PAs. The full set of
criteria will be included in the FAP Operational Manual.
For Extractive and Sustainable Use PAs, the eligibility criteria include the following: (a) the
existence of approved management plans; (b) the existence of Reserve Associations that are
created and implemented; (c) an updated registry of inhabitants; (d) a Management Council
installed and operational; (e) Commissions of environmental protection, health, and education
constituted and in operation within the structure of the Associations; (f) registration in the
National Conversation Units Registry; (g) POA prepared on the basis of the approved
management plan; (h) a minimum forestry cover of 90 percent; (i) creation before December
2000 or after January 2001; and (j) located within the project area (Poligonos). The full set of
criteria will be included in the FAP Operational Manual.
3.2 Studies and subproiects for PA-based revenue-generating activities.
This subcomponent will provide support to the selection and implementation studies and
subprojects aimed at testing appropriate revenue-generating mechanisms for PA sustainability,
and income-generating activities for communities in buffers zone areas. FUNBIO, together with
IBAMA, will be responsible for developing studies of financial mechanisms for revenue
generation in selected PAs and for the implementation and technical cooperation of 10
subprojects. The subprojects will seek to develop mechanisms for revenue generation (such as,
ecotourism, services, and entrance fees) and for fiscal incentives. The preparation of subprojects
will be preceded by a planning phase that should: (a) contemplate the modus operandi of the
selected mechanisms; (b) review prior analyses of experiences implemented in Brazil or in others
countries; (c) identify obstacles to successful implementation of these mechanisms; (d) develop
strategies for overcoming those obstacles; (e) identify PAs with better potential for application of
those mechanisms; (f) detail the operational and legal aspects for the implementation of pilot
projects; and (g) define potential implementers, selection criteria, and contracting forms.
This plan will be prepared based on consultations with individuals and organizations experienced
in the development of relevant activities and/or mechanisms of financing, and who can be
involved by the Project. The consultations will include: (a) seeking information on the
development of protocols for demands, methodology, and operational plans for inventorying the
biodiversity in the PAs; (b) discussions with user groups to determine the level of demands and
the possibility of investments for appropriate revenue-generating products and services, identified
by inventories; and (c) informning the local and traditional populations about their rights related to
61



cultural and intellectual properties, aiming to prepare them to better negotiate these issues. The
result of the consultation process also will serve to define models of co-ownership and to
implement strategies and work plans.
Based on the plan, the Project Coordination Unit, together with IBAMA and FUNBIO, will seek
proposals for subprojects from other governmental organizations, NGOs, and the private sector.
The proposals would be reviewed by the Program Committee, which will utilize the following
criteria for subproject proposals:
a. compatibility with the PA objectives
b. quality of the financial and technical proposal
c. relevance to the traditional populations and local communities
d. absence of negative environmental impacts
e. replicability of the model
This component foresees the achievement of partnerships between MMA/IBAMA and
organizations from the civil society qualified for the implementation of the pilot projects.
The criteria for NGO eligibility will include:
a. working in areas of high priority for biodiversity conservation, with broad reach, close to
local communities
b. organizational capacity for the activities of conservation
c. experience in alternative activities that ensure sustainable use of resources
d. participatory approach with the communities living in the areas
e. absence of negative environmental impact
The selection of participating communities in the buffer zone subprojects would be done through
a process that would involve PA Management Councils and the communities living in the areas.
The criteria for selecting communities will include: (a) living near high-priority biodiversity areas
of sufficient size within community boundaries; (b) organizational capacity for conservation
activities; (c) community experience with altemative livelihood activities that contribute to
sustainable resource use; (d) participation in networks of communities; and (e) with having no
environmental impact. These criteria would be included in the Operational Manual. The
component also would provide information and technical assistance to the selected communities
to enable them to prepare project-related community preinvestment proposals and/or participatory
community development plans.
62



3.3 Outputs.
The component main outputs include:
a. Make operational and capitalize a PA endowment
b. Implement an institutional arrangement with FUNBIO to administer the protected areas
endowment fund (FAP)
c. Studies and subprojects for revenue generation implemented
d. Study for establishment of an endowment fund for "sustainable use" PAs completed
e. Cost-recovery strategy and program implemented for selected PAs
f. Five PA concession agreements finalized for the implementation of financial mechanisms
g. Improved legal framework supporting PA administrative and financial management
Component 4: Protected Area Monitoring
The objective of this component is to establish an environmental monitoring and evaluation
system for PAs. This component will support the establishment of a biodiversity monitoring
system and analysis for new and existing PAs that will be used to improve the decision-making
process, as well as planning and programming, by making available more accurate and reliable
information on the management effectiveness of the PAs. To this end, the project monitoring
would include core biological variables plus selected variables, such as soil erosion and siltation
from deforestation and road construction, urban growth, planned and unplanned settlements,
overgrazing, and other community-based activities in and around PAs. In addition, the system
also will monitor and measure the fulfillment of the project objectives.
4.1 Biodiversity monitoring system.
This subcomponent will support the activities for design and implementation of a biodiversity
monitoring system for the new and existing PAs. The indicators for this monitoring system will
be developed in coordination with IBAMA's existing biodiversity monitoring system, SIMBIO
(Sistema de Monitoramento de Biodiversidade), currently in the final stages of preparation, and
will be tested before applying it to ARPA. There are many advantages to this coordinated effort,
since SIMBIO will be used to monitor biodiversity in all IBAMA-managed PAs in the country.
The system will be developed in order to ensure that project information feeds into SIMBIO by
using shared indicators (status, pressure, and response type). Data to be collected include: (a)
biodiversity status (key indicator groups); (b) pressure on ecosystems (levels of threat); (c) water
resources and climate; (d) insularization (levels of connectivity); and (e) management
effectiveness.
During this phase, the monitoring system will target four existing PAs on a pilot basis, and will
incorporate the newly created PAs as they are implemented (end of Phases 1, 2, and 3). Baseline
data will be collected for all PAs. A risk analysis methodology developed by the World
Commission on Protected Areas. and by WWF will be applied. Each unit will be classified
according to two levels of risk: Level 1-PAs under high human pressure and threat, resulting in
higher biodiversity loss; Level 2-less vulnerable PAs experiencing lower human pressure, where
other factors threaten biodiversity. The table below provides a list of the four selected PAs.
63

(572,000 hectares)
Level 2:
*  Remote sensing monitoring  Serra do Divisor National Park (605,000  Acre
*  Effectiveness indicators  hectares)
The PAs selected for initial monitoring represent a variety of environments and logistical
problems that will serve as a basis for increasing monitoring capacity for expansion of the system
to newly created and other existing PAs.
Specific key activities under this subcomponent will include, among others:
a. Consolidation of the existing database of information regarding PAs in the Amazon biome
b. Validation of the classification/levels for PA monitoring
c. Development of indicators and methodology based on the best and tested cost effectiveness
for PAs management
d. Collection, analysis, and consolidation of information to complete databases for the five
selected PAs (for example, field work, remote sensing, secondary data gathering)
e. Development of a database for the PAs of the Amazon biome, including a mechanism for
information exchange, to support PA planning, programming, and management
4.2 Training.
This subcomponent will support training activities for PA staff at ground level and central
agencies (IBAMA and state environmental agencies) responsible for data collection and
implementation of the biodiversity monitoring system. This subcomponent also will involve
dissemination activities aimed at preparing local communities to access and provide information
relevant to PA monitoring.
Specific key activities under this subcomponent will include, among others:
a. Elaboration of an Operational Manual to support the learning process of monitoring and
evaluation of PAs, and detailing standard and special procedures, methodology, and outputs.
b. Elaboration of a public information strategy to target local, national, and international
audiences. This strategy will include specific mechanisms to make information available via a
Web site and through the use of traditional public information vehicles in order to reach local
PA populations.
64



4.3 Outputs.
The component outputs include:
a. A monitoring and evaluation system at PA and regional levels, including complete
implementation in five existing protected areas
b. Training methodology and manuals developed and applied
Component 5: Project Coordination and Management
This component would support the set up, staffing, and operational costs of the Project
Coordination Unit within MMA. This unit would be responsible for the overall coordination of
the various components, and would be specifically responsible for: (a) preparation of Annual
Operating Plans; (b) preparation of supervisory reports or any request for information by donors
or the Bank; (c) monitoring and evaluation of project activities; (d) assurance that subsidiary
agreements and financial execution are effectively carried out; and (e) communication and
dissemination activities of ARPA. In addition, this component will support the set up, staffing,
and operational costs of PROARPA (the ARPA coordination unit within FUNBIO) responsible
for procurement functions of the Project, disbursement and financial execution, creation and
operation of FAP, and execution of certain studies and pilot activities under Component 3.
5.1 Operational Manual. Standard project implementation monitoring, based on the Project
Design Summary, will be carried out throughout the project implementation period. An

ANNEX 4
INCREMENTAL COST ANALYSIS
The general objective of the GEF project (alternative) is to support biodiversity conservation and
its sustainable use in the Amazon through the creation and consolidation of new and existing
protected areas under participatory management by federal, state, and municipal governments,
NGOs, and other private sector institutions. The Project intends to achieve these outputs at a total
incremental cost of approximately US$30 million.
1. Context and Broad Development Goals
The goals of the Amazon Region Protected Areas Project are to increase protected areas (PAs) in
the Brazilian Amazon and to consolidate the management of these areas. To date, Brazil has
approximately 12 million hectares of tropical forest under strict protection in the Amazon region.
The Project would incorporate an additional 25 million hectares to reach the goal of 37 million
hectares under strict protection in the next 10 years. It also will create 9 million hectares of
"sustainable use" PAs. Project objectives of the first phase include: (a) creation of 18 million
hectares in new PAs (9 million hectares of "strict protection" PAs and 9 million hectares of
"sustainable use" PAs); (b) consolidation of 7 million hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs;
(c) establishment of long-tern financial mechanisms for PAs; (d) establishment of a biodiversity
monitoring and evaluation system at PA and regional levels; and (e) strengthening project
coordination and management.
2. Baseline
In the Amazon region, the expansion of the system of protected areas is constrained by the lack of
financial resources. Despite this, the government of Brazil is making progress based on a program
of grant and loans, including international cooperation, that is the main source of funding to
conserve the Brazilian Rain Forests. Two states in the Amazon (Rond6nia and Mato Grosso)
borrowed funds for a natural resources project that included a protected areas component. These
loans are in their final lending stage, and it is unlikely that future loans of this nature will be
undertaken by states. Two other projects from the PPG7 are involved in the initial stages of
planning and identifying new areas for conservation: the Ecological Corridors Program and the
Natural Resources Policy Project.
2.1 Creation and establishment of new PAs. Under the Baseline Scenario, the Brazilian
government, with limited support from the PPG7 Biodiversity Corridors Program (US$5 million)
and the Natural Resources Policy Project (US$22 million), will facilitate the identification of new
PAs. However, this process will not necessarily lead to the creation of new PAs. Under the
Baseline Scenario, the government may invest resources in the public consultation and planning
processes to involve state and municipal governments, local NGOs, and indigenous organizations
in the creation of new PAs. However, this consultation and planning, is likely to be limited by
scarce resources.
2.2 Consolidation of existing PAs. The government aims to consolidate 12 priority PAs in the
Amazon region. The operating costs for these areas (including investments and recurrent costs)
have been established at approximately US$200 thousand per year for strict protected areas and
US$50 thousand for sustainable use areas. Considering that these PAs are remote, difficult to
68



access, and under no major threat, the current level of spending in most of these PAs in the last
five years varies from area to area. For instance, considering funds allocated by the Brazilian
government and the first World Bank loan on the environment (NEP I) during 1995 to 1999, most
of these areas are receiving less than 20 percent per year of their estimated yearly operating costs.
Since these spending levels are unlikely to be substantially increased under the Baseline Scenario,
the Brazilian government will continue to consolidate PAs with the only additional support
coming from the PPG7 Ecologial Corridors Program (US$3.8 million). The consolidation of
fewer PAs will therefore be achieved at a slower rate and in a considerably longer period of time.
2.3 Financial sustainability of PAs. Under the Baseline Scenario, the development of innovative
income-generation mechanisms for the financial sustainability of PAs (including a dedicated
endowment fund) will be limited. None of the current initiatives, such as PPG7, NEP II, and
government-funded programs, include long-term financing mechanisms for protected areas.
Under the Baseline Scenario, already existing financial instruments, such as tourism entrance fees
and environmental compensation, might develop in a few PAs. However, additional income-
generating activities based on international experiences, would probably not take place. In
addition, the establishment of a protected areas endowment fund with seed capital from GEF,
making it attractive to bilateral donors, private foundations, and debt for nature swaps and related
instruments, is unlikely to occur.
2.4 Biodiversity monitoring and evaluation. IBAMA with continue to collaborate with
SIMBIO (IBAMA's Biodiversity Monitoring System) and RADAM-Brazil. In the absence of a
dedicated biodiversity monitoring system and limited financial resources, the development of
regional indicators for biodiversity conservation and threats to PAs in the Amazon region will
require a longer period of time to achieve. In addition, the international protocols for monitoring
protected areas being developed by IUCN and WWF (which also are being incorporated into the
ARPA project design), would not be implemented in Brazil and benefit from being tested
worldwide.
The Baseline Scenario would therefore generate limited short-term gains in terms of biodiversity
conservation, but would not constitute a concerted effort to mainstream conservation actions and
resources for PAs in the Amazon region, focusing on long-term social and financial sustainability.
The cost of the activities under the Baseline Scenario is estimated at US$51.5 million.
3. Global Environmental Objectives
The Brazilian Amazon region is the core area of the largest continuous tropical moist forest on
the planet, comprising 40 percent of all remaining tropical moist forests in the world. The
Amazon region is the most important repository of biological diversity on earth, containing
extremely rich biodiversity in terms of unique species, high levels of endemism, and habitat
diversity. Many areas in the Brazilian Amazon hold world records in terms of biodiversity
richness. The Project would, in the next four years, support the addition of 10 million hectares of
new protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon; and would support a more participatory
management approach and the establishment of innovative financial mechanisms as a strategy to
ensure long-term social and financial sustainability.
4. ARPA GEF Alternative
Conservation in the Brazilian Amazon region requires a functional and structured system of
protected areas. Expansion and consolidation of the protected area coverage is essential to
69



maximize the opportunities for achieving long-term sustainable biodiversity conservation and
protected areas management in the region.
Under the ARPA GEF Alternative, the support from GEF during Phase 1 will enable the
Brazilian government to support: (a) the creation and establishment of a total of 9 million hectares
of "strict conservation use" PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use"' PAs through an
intensive consultative process at the local level; (b) the consolidation of 12 existing PAs selected
through a participatory process; (c) the establishment of a broad base of innovative financial
mechanisms and a dedicated endowment fund; and (d) the improvement of environmental
monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to measure the management effectiveness of PAs. Other
key gains enabled by the GEF support would include:
*  Partnerships to leverage GEF financing, to further ensure the generation of global benefits.
*  Enhancement of the decentralization process through participation in PAs management by the
state and municipal governments, with a view to long-term PA accountability at the local
level.
*  Coordination mechanisms to mainstream lessons and actions (Project Coordination Unit); and
financial resources (endowment fund) from the government of Brazil and from multilateral,
bilateral, and private donors, to support PAs in the Amazon region. These mechanisms will
enable the progressive decrease of GEF support throughout the 10-year program.
*  An integrated approach for PAs management that responds to social, economic, and political
realities and a regional long-term vision of the system for PAs in the Amazon.
*  Amazon ecoregional representation within the SNUC, and greater coverage of globally
significant areas.
*  Definition of long-term management needs, management plans, and agreements to share PAs
management responsibility with private sector organizations.
*  Pilot projects based on sustainable use of biodiversity to provide economic incentives for
conservation.
The GEF Alternative would therefore generate medium- and long-term gains in terms of
biodiversity conservation, and would facilitate the efforts to mainstream PAs conservation actions
and resources in the Amazon region, focusing on long-term social and financial sustainability.
The total cost of the GEF alternative is US$81.5 million.
5. Incremental Costs
The difference between the cost of the Baseline Scenario (US$51.5 million) and the cost of the
GEF Alternative (US$81.5 million) is estimated at US$30 million. This represents the
incremental cost for achieving global environmental benefits, and is the amount requested from
the GEF. The following matrix summarizes the incremental costs and benefits.
' Sustainable-use protected areas have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the
communities living in them. These protected areas are regulated by management plans that include various
use zones, some of which protect key environmental values of these areas, including, in particular, a "strict
protection" zone. ARPA will support only surveillance and enforcement activities in the "sustainable use"
protected areas to ensure ecological integrity and biodiversity conservation.

ANNEX 6
PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
A: Proc-arement
1. Procurement Arrangements
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published in January 1995
(revised January/August 1996, September 1997, and January 1999); and Guidelines: Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, published in January 1997 (revised
September 1999, January 1999, and April 2002), and the provisions stipulated in the Loan
Agreement.
1. 1 Procurement methods. The methods to be used for the procurement are described below. The
estimated amounts for each method are summarized in Table 6.1. The threshold contract values
for the use of each method are fixed in Table 6.2.
Procurement of works. Works for Subprojects and for activities financed under the Endowment
Fund shall be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations
obtained from three (3) qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The
invitation shall include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant
drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
price quotation for the required work and who has the experience and resources to complete the
contract successfully.
Procurement of goods. Goods procured under the GEF grant will include office installation and
furniture, computers, printers, software, laser scanners, radios, and so forth, in the amount of
US$0.3 million equivalent. Because these goods will be bought at different times and would be
delivered at different places, such as Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, and Manaus, there will be no
economic advantage in grouping these goods. It will not be possible to group these goods into
larger packages for National Competitive Bidding (NCB); therefore, they will be purchased using
shopping (national /international) procedures based on a model request for quotations (RFQ)
agreed with the Bank.
Consultant selection. Consulting services will be contracted following the guidelines for the
selection and employment of consultants by World Bank borrowers, printed in January 1997
(revised in September 1997, January 1999, and April 2002). These services are estimated to cost
US$5.9 million equivalent for the GEF grant.
Firms. All contracts for firms would be procured using Quality- and Cost-based Selection
(QCBS) procurement procedures, except for small and simple contracts estimated to cost less
than US$200 thousand equivalent, which would be procured using Least Cost Selection (LCS)
procedures up to an aggregate amount of US$300 thousand equivalent, and contracts estimated to
cost less than US$100 thousand equivalent, which would be procured using the Selection Based
on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ), up to an aggregate amount of US$200 thousand equivalent.

Least Cost Selection. The following contracts would be procured following Least Cost Selection
(LCS) procedures: (a) one contract for the development of computer network services, estimated
to cost approximately US$190 thousand; (b) one contract for auditing of the projects, estimated to
cost approximately US$100 thousand; and (c) one training workshop, estimated to cost
US$30thousand. The types of service required will be defined in detail in the Terms of
References (TORs), and are based on well-established practices, standards, and methodologies
that justify the use of LCS for these contracts.
Consultant qualifications. The following contracts would be awarded on the basis of Consultant
Qualifications (CQ) procedures: (a) three contracts for workshops on a legal issues for revenue-
generating activities in PAs, estimated to cost approximately US$33 thousand equivalent each;
(b) one contract for monitoring asset management investments, estimated to cost approximately
US$35 thousand equivalent; (c) two contracts for studies on legal instruments in PAs, estimated
to cost approximately US$25 thousand equivalent each. The simple scope of work envisioned for
these assignments, which does not warrant the need for comparing competitive proposals, and the
small dollar amounts, justify the use of CQ for these contracts.
Individuals. Specialized advisory services, technical assistance, legal services, studies, and so
forth, would be provided by individual consultants. These consultants shall be selected by
comparison of qualifications of three candidates, and hired in accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs V. 1 through V.4 of the Consultants Guidelines, up to an aggregate amount of US$5.2
million equivalent.
Services. Services such as demarcation of the protected areas, logistics for training, reproduction
of documents, and printing, totaling up to US$2.4 million equivalent, will be procured, at
different times, for each individual protected area scattered over the Amazon region. Such
services would be procured through price quotations, based on documentation agreed with the
Bank.
Operating costs. Sundry items, office rental, and utilities would be financed, and would be
procured by FUNBIO using administrative procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Subprojects. The Project also will finance local community initiatives for sustainable use of
biodiversity and revenue-generating subprojects by NGOs and local groups. Individual
subprojects, which may consist of procurements of small equipment, operational costs, services,
consulting services, are not expected to surpass US$30 thousand equivalent. Due to the small
project size, it is expected that the majority of subproject inputs would be procured under
community participation methods, such as national shopping procedures. Eligibility criteria, and
authorized procurement and payment procedures, for the subprojects will be included in the
Operational Manual.
Endowment capital. GEF will finance US$14.5 million equivalent of the endowment capital for
protected areas that have been consolidated under the Project. The revenues from the endowment
fund will be used to cover the recurrent costs for the management of the protected areas.
1.2 Prior review thresholds. The proposed thresholds for prior review are based on the
procurement capacity assessment of the project implementing unit, and are summarized in Table
6.2. In addition to this prior review of individual procurement actions, the plan and budget for the
PCU Operating Costs will be reviewed and approved annually by the Bank.
76



2. Assessment of FUNBIO's Capacity to Implement Procurement
Procurement activities will be carried out by FUNBIO in close coordination with the Ministry of
Environment. FUNBIO will administer the project funds provided by the donors, and the
Ministry of Environment (MMvIA) will administer the funds provided by the federal government.
FUNBIO will maintain one office in Rio de Janeiro and one office in Manaus, which is closer in
location to the PAs. The office in Manaus will carry out all Shopping procedures for the
procurement of small goods demanded by the PAs. FUNBIO's office in Rio de Janeiro is now
staffed by a Project Manager, an administrative unit of three staff, an accounting unit of two staff,
a procurement unit with two procurement analysts and two assistants, and a lawyer. FUNBIO will
hire a Procurement Officer and two more assistants for the office in Rio de Janeiro. For the
Manaus office, FUNBIO will hire two Procurement Officers, two technical staff, who will receive
and distribute the goods to the PAs, and two assistants. FUNBIO also will maintain a
representative in the Ministry of Environment to liaise between the MMvIA and FUNBIO. The
Operational Manual will include, in addition to the procurement procedures, the Standard Bidding
Documents to be used for each procurement method, as well as model contracts for works and
goods procured on the basis of three quotations or shopping.
An assessment of the capacity of PROARPA (the unit within FUNBIO responsible for
procurement) to implement procurement actions for the Project has been conducted and was
approved by the Regional Procurement Advisor on June 21, 2002. The assessment reviewed the
proposed organizational structure and found it reasonable. Training in procurement will need to
be provided to the staff of FUNBIO in Rio de Janeiro and in Manaus.
One of the issues concerning implementation of the project by FUNBIO is the lack of experience
in implementing a larger Bank project. FUNBIO has implemented a previous project in which all
purchases were under the modality of Shopping. The risks identified in the assessment include:
(a) the possibility of interference from inexperienced procurement staff in procurement
management; (b) unrealistic procurement planning; and (c) the need to improve procurement
filing in the Central Unit and to develop a contract monitoring system. A detailed plan was
developed and approved by FUNBIO to address these risks. The plan involves: (a) promoting a
training program for the staff in Rio de Janeiro and Manaus; (b) discussing the procurement plan
with the Bank, creating a monitoring system, and maintaining control of the procurement actions
by using such monitoring system; and (c) hiring one consultant to make recommendations to
improve the filing system.
Monitoring of procurement actions and evaluation of contracts awarded under this Project are key
activities envisaged in the procurement plan, with a specific need of human and financial
resources. Document filing is to improve after the new system is implemented, and is expected to
comply with the Bank's requirements. The new system will specify the procurement documents
to be filed, the PCU staff who would have access to the files, and the internal security measures
for record-keeping.
The overall project risk for procurement is AVERAGE.
3. Procurement Plan
At appraisal, FUNBIO developed a procurement plan for project implementation that establishes
the basis for the aggregate amounts for the procurement methods (per Table 6.1). A timetable of
procurement activities is also being updated for the first year of the Project. The timetable for
77



each year of the Project will be prepared based on the POA (Piano Operativo Annual) that is
annually generated by the government. The POA will contain the demands from each PA for that
year.
4. Frequency of Procurement Supervision
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity
assessment of FUNBIO has recommended one full supervision mission to visit the field for the
purpose of carrying out a post-review of procurement activities. Based on the overall risk
assessment (AVERAGE) for the project, the post-review field analysis should utilize a sample of
not less than one-in-five contracts signed.

'The Operational Memorandum Bank Policy on Financing Income Taxes, issued on June 13, 200 1,
clarifies the Bank's policy against financing local income taxes in Bank-financed operations. One
clarification that came about in this Memorandum is that GEF grants to nongoverrunental organizations can
pay taxes out of the grant proceeds. The rule applies to the proposed project, and therefore the GEF grant
will finance 100 percent of contracts.
2 The donors with commitments for this project are KfW and WWF.

B: Financial Management and Disbursement
1. Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements
1.1 Country issues.
A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) has recently been conducted for Brazil
and a draft report has been prepared, with the final report to be completed following a workshop
including the Bank and relevant government officials. The report presents findings that Brazil has
sound financial management and accounting practices that allow for transparent budget
preparation and execution. The report provides adequate assurance that there are no major
accounting or financial management accountability issues.
1.2 Strengths and weaknesses.
FUNBIO was established in 1996 under the GEF Pilot Phase (US$20 million grant from GEF,
US$10 million from other domestic and international partners). FUNBIO was designed and is
operating under the best practices stated in the GEF's Evaluation of Experiences with
Conservation Trust Funds (1998). FUNBIO involves an innovative arrangement whereby release
of GEF capital for the endowment is tied to mobilization of matching funds primarily from the
private sector. FUNBIO has an independent governing Board that seeks to assure both
representativity and transparency in its activities. On the other hand, FUNBIO will have to
strengthen its current management structure to implement ARPA.
1.3 Implementing entity and staffing.
FUNBIO's organizational structure has been set up in accordance with the terms in the GEF Trust
Fund agreement. FUNBIO is responsible for the management of the funds through an asset
manager, as established in the agreement. FUNBIO has allocated staff of 16 people, and has a
financial management unit in its organizational structure. A temporary financial manager is on
board (see B.7, Action Plan and Conditions, in this Annex) who is responsible for the
maintenance of the financial routines and preparation of the financial reports. The accounting
services have been rendered to a third party accounting firm, which provides FUNBIO's financial
manager with the accounting information needed to prepare the financial management reports.
The accounting transactions are recorded based on the chart of accounts, which reflects the design
of FUNBIO's activities; these accounting records can be easily identified and the Project's
expenditures can be tracked in the accounting books. The balance sheets and general ledger of the
project are prepared on a timely basis by the accounting firm and submitted to FUNBIO's
financial management unit accordingly. According to the GEF Trust Fund agreement, FUNBIO
must have all balance sheets audited by an independent auditor. The Bank reviewed the audit
report submitted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu for the year 2000, and no relevant matters were
reported by the auditors. The Bank's recommendation is that FJNBIO hire a qualified financial
manager to fulfill the financial management requirements as a condition of effectiveness.
82



2. Reporting and Information System
FUNBIO needs to have in place a financial management system capable of generating financial,
physical monitoring, and procurement reports (FMRs). Currently, FUNBIO uses Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets to prepare its reports and SOEs to disburse funds. Based on the results of the
financial management assessment, FUNBIO must put in place a financial management system to
generate FMRs (see B.7, Action Plan and Conditions, in this Annex). This requirement is a
condition of effectiveness. FUNBIO will send the FMRs to the Project Coordination Unit at
MMA, where they will be consolidated for the entire Project, including the expenditures of the
government funds, before being sent to the Bank.
3. Accounting Procedures
In the past, FUNBIO has hired an accounting firm to perform all accounting services. The
accounting firm produces all accounting reports and FUNBIO uses these reports and accounting
records to produce its management reports. Based on the results of the financial management
assessment carried out by the Bank, it was agreed that FUNBIO would establish an accounting
department to manage the financial and accounting activities of ARPA (see B.7, Action Plan and
Conditions, in this Annex). This accounting unit will oversee the financial and accounting
activities of the Special Account and of the endowment fund. The endowment fund does not
follow the same disbursement procedures as the Special Account but, during the duration of the
project, is subject to the same Bank procurement and financial guidelines as is the Special
Account.
4. Flow of Funds, Disbursement, and Special Account
4.1 Project ComRonents.
FUNBIO will establish a special account, in U.S. Dollars, in a commercial bank. The Special
Account will have an authorized allocation of US$2.5 million, based on projected disbursements
for four months. Disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs),
except for goods above US$ 100 thousand equivalent, contracts with consulting firms above
US$100 thousand equivalent, and contracts with individuals above US$50 thousand equivalent.
In these cases, all contractual information must be attached to a Summary Sheet (SS). The
information required for the compilation of SOEs would be maintained by the financial
management unit in the MIS database.
4.2 FAP (Endowment Fund).
FUNBIO will establish the endowment fund (FAP) to receive and manage US$14.5
million from the GEF grant and the other donors' funds (Component 3). The GEF and
matching funds will be managed, by an asset manager selected by FUNBIO, following
Bank procurement guidelines and agreed with the Bank, and under investment guidelines
and spending rules approved by the Bank and detailed in the FAP Operational Manual.
The Bank's approval of the FAP Operational Manual will be a condition of effectiveness.
The GEF funds will be kept separate from other donors' funds. Before disbursements can
occur, two conditions must be met: the asset manager's agreement has been signed; and
the Bank has verified the proof of matching funds. FUNBIO will submit withdrawal
applications to the Bank, with attached proof showing the amount of the matching
83



contribution made to the endowment fund. The Bank provides the "no objection"
decision after verifying that the matching requirements have been fulfilled. Thereafter,
the Bank authorizes the disbursement to the asset manager's account. Proof of matching
can be bank statements or signed contracts with donors. Withdrawal applications may be
submitted for amounts up to US$250 thousand. If FUNBIO has raised less than US$250
thousand, it will not present a withdrawal application until they have proof of a minimum
of US$250 thousand in matching funds to trigger the Bank's deposit. The intervals of
disbursements will depend on the fundraising target reached. The fundraising plan
indicates that approximately US$2 million will be raised every semester. This will trigger
a disbursement from the GEF trust fund to the Endowment of approximately US$ 2
million every semester until the GEF funds allocated to the endowment fund (US$14.5
million) are exhausted.
FAP will be govemed within FUNBIO's Board of Directors and through ARPA's Program
Commission, and according to procedures spelled out in the FAP Operational Manual. Annex 12
describes in detail the operation of FAP.
The KfW funds (US$14.4 million) would be channeled through MMA/PPG7 to a special project
account also managed by FUNBIO. This account would cover direct investments under
Components I and 2. Similar disbursement procedures as described in item 4.1 above (on the
Special Account) will apply to KfW funds and will be specified in the respective agreement
("Grant Agreement") between MMVIA, FUNBIO, and KfW. Funds from WWF (US$16.5 million)
would be channeled directly from the GEF account through FUNBIO into a separate account. A
full description and chart showing the flow of funds is presented in Annex 6, Table 6.2.
5. Financial Management Arrangements
FUTNBIO will establish two separate bank accounts: a US$ Special Account and an operational
account in R$. These two accounts will be reflected in the accounting system of FUNBIO, and
will be subject to reconciliation with Bank's statements. Pending items will be reflected in this
reconciliation.
For FAP's income on investments, FUNBIO will establish an operational account in R$ in a
commercial bank in Brazil. This account will be reflected in the accounting books of FUNBIO.
Results of the Assessment: FUNBIO is staffed with accountants and accounting technicians who
are experienced with Special Account and disbursement procedures.
6. Auditing Arrangements
The Project will have the auditors appointed no later than three months after effectiveness, and
the auditors will submit an opinion letter six months after implementation, stating the adequacy of
the accounting and intemal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial
transactions, and to ensure safe custody of project-financed assets. PROARPA will follow up on
the progress of such hiring. Audited financial statements will be prepared, in accordance with
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, and submitted each calendar year for the Project and
the endowment fund. The auditor will be expected to express separate opinions on the Project
financial statements, the Special Account; the use of the SOEs as a basis of disbursement; and the
endowment fund financial statements. The audit reports will be submitted to the Bank no later
than June 30 of the year following the end of each calendar year.

8. Supervision Plan
Supervision missions will be undertaken at least twice a year, although it is likely that additional
supervision activities will be carried out given the task team leader's frequent missions to Brazil
to work on other projects. The supervision missions will periodically include a financial
management specialist and a procurement specialist. PSRs will be updated after each mission.
When appropriate, these reports will cover all issues related to financial control, audit matters,
and the monitoring of the procurement plan. The major responsibility for procurement and
financial management supervision, and for client assistance in these areas, will be provided
through the Country Management Unit (CMU) Brasilia-based Implementation Team that is fully
staffed to carry out these functions.

'The Operational Memorandum Bank Policy on Financing Income Taxes, issued on June 13,
2001, clarifies the Bank's policy against financing local income taxes in Bank-financed
operations. One clarification that came about in this Memorandum is that GEF grants to
nongovernmental organizations can pay taxes out of the grant proceeds. The rule applies to the
proposed project and therefore the GEF grant will finance 100 percent of contracts.
2 Eligibility criteria and the agreed procurement and payment procedures for subprojects will be
included in the Operational Manual. The Project could finance works, goods, and services for the
subprojects.

ANNEX 11-B
INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF FUNBIO TO ACCOMMODATE ARPA
1. General Conditions
FUNBIO's Board of Directors will be in charge of defining the operational aspects of
implementing the Program Committee's decisions with regard to matters associated with its role
of: (a) performing studies on financial and legal instruments, and pilot projects, aimed at the
financial sustainability of protected areas; (b) procuring goods and services needed for protected
areas with nongovermmental resources foreseen in the Project; and (c) creating and generating an
endowment fund comprised of resources from different donors, as well as from any and all other
activities that may be requested under the scope of the ARPA project's execution. These duties
are detailed in this document.
The Board also should decide on the creation of new units under the scope of FUNBIO's current
structure. Likewise, the selection and hiring of staff required for the performance of FUNBIO's
new functions and responsibilities, with regard to ARPA, shall be executed with guidance from
the Board and in accordance with regulations usually practiced by the institution.
2. Responsibilities of FUNBIO
In order to carry out the duties mentioned above, FUNBIO, in accordance with the guidelines set
by the Project, will be responsible for developing appropriate strategies, providing adequate
technical and administrative infrastructure, and hiring specialized services needed to:
a. Procure the goods and services called for in the POAs approved and submitted by the
Program Committee, according to the regulations established by donors and by Brazilian
legislation
b. Constitute and manage an endowment fund, carry out studies, and develop pilot projects
required to facilitate Component 3 of the Project
c. Manage resources from the World Bank (GEF) and other donors, including the opening of
specific accounts, to deposit, apply, and utilize these resources
d. Oversee compliance with pertinent legal and contractual obligations as well as regulations
and procedures required by donors3, with regard to the Project's financial aspects
e. Specify regulations and operational procedures for the use of Project resources, and prepare
financial management and monitoring documents
f. Prepare and present to relevant authorities, within and outside of FUNBIO, reports and
balance sheets on the use and application of Project resources
3 Note that these should be in accordance with the internal institutional regulations that guide FlJNBIO's
activities.
98



g. Periodically contract independent auditors
h. Establish policies, procedures, and general principles for the financial investment of resources
and the contracting of specialized firm(s) for their application
i. Hire, supervise, monitor, and evaluate asset manager(s)
3. Protected Areas Program (PROARPA)
For the purpose of creating a mechanism to deal with the Project's specific aspects and its
dynamics, a Protected Areas Program (PROARPA) will be established in FUNBIO, similar to
other development programs currently in existence, such as the Sustainable Production Support
Program (PAPS) and the Partnership Funds Program. As envisaged in FUNBIO's Statutes and
Operational Manual, such programs are governed by operational objectives, strategies, and
regulations, and may have different durations of existence.
PROARPA will be responsible for carrying out actions and procedures needed for the
performance of FUNBIO's duties under the scope of the ARPA project. PROARPA's
involvement should be consistent both with the guidelines defined for the ARPA project by
MMA and IBAMA, and with FUNBIO's institutional mission and strategic guidelines.
PROARPA should have its own structure that is suited to the demands placed on its efforts. This
should include the selection and hiring of a responsible professional (Protected Areas
Coordinator), and a technical-administrative staff that is compatible in size and qualifications
with the functions they should perform.
Program staff will be an integral part of FUNBIO's Executive Secretariat. The Protected Areas
Coordinator will be subordinate to the Executive Director, under the guidance and supervision of
the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may delegate to the Coordinator the principal
activities of PROARPA's execution, coordination, and management.
In addition to the Coordinator, the technical-administrative staff who will support the program
should at first consist of professionals in the following activities: secretarial; procurement; and
promotion of studies and projects related to the execution of Component 3 - Maintenance
(Financial Sustainability) of the PAs. The need for human resources will be gradually reviewed
and adjusted in order to deal with the dynamics of the Project's development demands.
The program's financial and administrative management will be supported by the competent
areas of FUNBIO's Executive Secretariat.
4. Technical Commission on Protected Areas
A Technical Commission on Protected Areas (FTC) would be established within FUNBIO to
oversee Project implementation and to manage the protected areas endowment fund (FAP). The
FTC would consist of members of FUNBIO's Board of Directors, government representatives,
CNS, GTA, and private donors. The composition and operation of the FTC would be spelled out
in the Project Operational Manual.
99



FUNBIO's Technical Commission on Protected Areas should act as a liaison between FUNBIO's
Board of Directors and the Program Committee, ensuring proper internalization of their decisions
and political-strategic guidelines, and should be answerable to FUNBIO's Board of Directors
regarding the suitability of these decisions in terms of FUNBIO's mission and the policies in
effect in the institution. The FTC also should guide and supervise the implementation of ARPA
activities by FUNBIO's operational offices.
The Protected Areas Commission's review of the Program Committee's decision should not
cause a delay in its implementation, unless a contradiction is found with FUNBIO's general
principles and guidelines. In this case, the Protected Areas Commission should request
clarification and an eventual review by the Program Committee, as a stage prior to
implementation.
5. Role of Other FUNBIO Commissions
FUNBIO's Technical Commission on Auditing and Finance should exercise its role as a fiscal
council, expressing opinions on financial and accounting performance reports, and on asset
operations carried out, and issuing opinions to the entity's higher-level agencies with respect to
FUNBIO's management of ARPA project resources. It should have free, unrestricted access to all
of the program's books and controls, as occurs with the Fund's other activities.
Other Commissions of the Board, such as that of Monitoring and Evaluation, also should extend
their responsibilities to the Project.
6. FUNBIO Representation
The need to create a post for FUNBIO representation, with headquarters in Brasilia or in a state in
the Amazon region, should be evaluated. Its role would be to: (a) provide guidance and assistance
to PAs in the preparation of their Annual Operating Plans, in order to ensure agreement with
donors' rules; (b) supervise the development of pilot projects for Component 3; and (c) monitor
procurement processes for PAs carried out through FUNBIO.
If it is decided that such a representation post should be created, its costs should be added to the
other costs projected for carrying out FUNBIO's functions under the scope of the Project.
7. Costs
The direct and indirect costs stemming from the internalization of ARPA within FUTNBIO would
be covered by Project resources as determined during the appraisal. Indirect costs will be
calculated in the form of cost sharing. Costs will be reassessed periodically, in terms of normal
adjustments during an implementation phase, as well as initially unforeseen needs.
The initial forecast for FUNBIO's expenses with regard to ARPA includes the need to expand its
technical-administrative apparatus and its physical installations and equipment, as well as to
contract banking services and additional specialized services. These improvements are required in
order to deal adequately with the new functions and responsibilities stemming from FUNBIO's
participation in the Project. The initial forecast also includes costs related to the involvement of
FUNBIO's Board and its Technical Commissions in the Project.
100



8. General Guidelines for Development of Component 3
Among the activities to be carried out by FUNBIO is the responsibility of executing Component
3, which calls for the maintenance (Financial Sustainability) of PAs supported by AF.PA. To that
end, FUNBIO should carry out the following activities: creation and management of an
endowment fund consisting of resources from different donors; performance of studies on
nfmancial and legal instruments; and implementation of pilot projects.
8.1 Endowment fund.
The operation of the endowment fund (FAP) is detailed in a specific document. (See Annex 12.)
8.2 Studies and pilot projects.
FUNBIO, as established in the Institutional Arrangements, will submit to the PCU, a proposal for
carrying out studies and projects. This unit shall forward it to the Program Committee for
approval. If the proposal is fully approved, it will be sent to FUNBIO so that implementation may
begin.
The studies and pilot projects to be performed as part of Component 3 will be aimed at defining
and testing more appropriate mechanisms of generating revenue for the PAs, including:
identification and-adjustment of legal and tax instruments available for this purpose; participatory
design of income-generation programs; design and implementation of 10 pilot projects;
negotiation of income-generation agreements; and training and workshops.
The.contracting of studies and pilot projects will be carried out by FUNBIO, with ARPA
resources, following the selection and contracting procedures usually practiced by FUNBIO. The
executors of these studies and pilot projects may be individuals and public or private
corporations, for-profit or nonprofit.
9. General Guidelines for Procurement
9.1 Regulations and procedures.
As a rule, all procurement using GEF grant funds and their yields must meet stipulations in the
document Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, published by the
World Bank. These regulations shall prevail for all agents who are beneficiaries of Project
resources. These operations and those related to other financial management procedures also
should be in accordance with provisions in Brazilian legislation.
Mechanisms and responsibilities for the technical specifications of goods to be purchased and of
services to be contracted should be defined. Legal forms of transferring goods to supported PAs
also should be indicated and included in relevant legal instruments. These and other procurement
procedures foreseen in approved POAs, through FUNBIO, are detailed in the Operational Manual
of the Project.
101



9.2 Eligible expenses and activities subject to support.
ARPA resources, under the management of FUNBIO, may be used for: (a) payment of salaries to
complementary staff; (b) contracting of consulting services by individuals or public or private
corporations, for-profit or nonprofit; (c) payment of current expenditures, that is, expenditures for
office materials, supplies, transportation, and travel; (d) payment of operational expenditures; (e)
construction of civil works; and (f) purchase of priority goods and equipment.
The activities that may be financed using these resources, provided they are called for in the
POAs approved by the Program Committee, are:
* The development of studies, data collection, and refinement of methodologies that support
the identification and selection of new PAs in the Amazon region, based on their importance
and representativity from the standpoint of regional biodiversity, as well as for defining the
eligibility criteria for the financing of state and municipal PAs

activities for the sustainable use of natural resources existing there
*  Hiring of qualified staff to achieve proposed objectives and targets
10. Financial Management Procedures
In order for its perfonnance in the Project to be supervised by the World Bank and other donors,
FUNBIO should submit, by the respective deadlines, the following documents regarding its
participation in the Project:
*  Annual Operating Plan (POA). The POA presents the specific objectives that are meant to be
achieved the following year, with a detailed description of the activities FUNBIO will carry
out during the corresponding year. (Note: The POAs of supported PAs or participating
government agencies are not included here.)

ANNEX 12
PROTECTED AREAS ENDOWMENT FUND (FAP)
The overall objective of the Amazon Region Protected Areas Project (ARPA) is to expand and
consolidate protected areas in the Amazon region of Brazil. The primary long-term goal is to
increase areas under strict protection, such as parks and biological stations, by establishing up to
41 million hectares under protection. This represents an increase of 28.5 million hectares over the
12.5 million hectares of tropical forest currently under strict protection in the Amazon region. A
1 0-year program would be required to achieve this long-term goal, the first phase of which would
be supported by the proposed project (Phase 1). Phase I objectives and activities are described in
section A in the main text, and in Annexes 1 and 2.
One of the main objectives of Phase 1 is to establish a financial mechanism that can provide for
the long-term financial sustainability of the strictly protected areas (PAs) to be consolidated under
the Project. It also would provide long-term funding for selected "sustainable use" protected areas
(RESEX). The mechanism proposed to deliver this solution is an endowment fund (FAP), which
would be capitalized at a level sufficient to provide investment income that would cover a portion
of PA and RESEX annual recurrent costs over the long term. The remaining recurrent costs
(mainly for core PA personnel and basic utilities) would be covered by the government of Brazil.
On average, annual recurrent costs to be covered by FAP are estimated to be US$200 thousand
per "strict protection" PA and US$50 thousand per Extractive and Sustainable Use reserve. The
types of eligible expenditures are described below. Average annual recurrent costs to be covered
by the government of Brazil are estimated at US$50 thousand per year; these expenditures, as
noted, are mainly for core PA personnel (such as the PA Director) and basic utilities4. Only
selected PAs and RESEXs would be eligible for funding under this mechanism. The selection
criteria are described in Annex 2, paragraph 3.1.
1. FAP Implementation Arrangements
To manage the FAP endowment fund efficiently and effectively, the existing Brazil Biodiversity
Fund (FUNBIO) has been selected. FUNBIO is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation
that was established and funded in 1996 under the GEF Pilot Phase (US$20 million grant from
GEF, US$10 million from other domestic and international partners). As designed, and now with
over five years of implementation experience, FUNBIO is operating under the best practices
stated in the GEF's Evaluation of Experiences with Conservation Trust Funds (1998). Although
FUNBIO's design and objective was focused initially on stimulating private sector participation
in environmental management and conservation, the corporation has played an important role
since inception in helping to shape the government of Brazil's environmental agenda.
Nevertheless, FUNBIO will need to strengthen its current management structure to establish and
manage the FAP fund.
To implement the FAP component, FUNBIO will maintain its existing institutional design, which
is based on the terms of a World Bank operation TF 28310. The basic structure under this first
Bank operation includes a corporate Board, several technical and/or advisory committees with

projections/model. The costs may be revised slightly as a result of the revision of the financial
projections/model currently underway.

oversight of core operational and administrative functions, and a contract with an internationally
selected asset manager that is responsible for investment management of FUNBIO's financial
capital. The selection of the asset manager and the definition of investment management
guidelines have been carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines and supervision
requirements. At the operational level, FUNBIO maintains an Executive Director and a cadre of
well-qualified staff to manage operational, administrative, and financial assignments, including
financial reporting and auditing tasks required under the TF 28310. Routine accounting has been
outsourced to a reputable accounting firm, which provides FUNBIO's financial manager with the
information required for satisfactory completion of financial management reports. In addition, in
accordance with the original GEF agreement, FUNBIO is audited annually by a reputable firm,
most recently Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Audit reports reviewed by Bank staff have been
favorable. In addition, the Bank has carried out a procurement and institutional capacity
assessment of FUNBIO, and has made recommendations regarding additional staffing
requirements necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Phase 1 of ARPA and for the FAP
fund.
2. Responsibilities of FUNBIO
As the managing institution of the FAP fund, FUNBIO will provide the technical and
administrative infrastructure, contracting specialized services and developing appropriate
strategies to:
*  Manage FAP capital proceeds, including the opening of specific accounts to deposit, apply,
and utilize these resources
* Oversee compliance with pertinent legal and contractual obligations as well as regulations
and procedures required by donors5, with regard to the fund's financial and accounting
aspects
* Specify regulations and operational procedures for the use of FAP resources, to be observed
and followed by executing units; and indicate the management and financial monitoring
documents to be prepared by executors
* Supervise, monitor, and control compliance with these regulations and procedures
* Manage the charges, fees, and conditional ties related to FAP contributions
* Prepare and present to relevant authorities, within and outside FUNBIO, reports and balance
sheets on the use and application of FAP resources
* Periodically contract independent auditors
* Establish policies, procedures and general principles for the investment of Fund capital
proceeds, including entering into and supervising contracts with specialized firm(s) for the
same as needed.
* Supervise, monitor, and evaluate the contracted asset manager(s)
Note that these should be in accordance with the internal regulations that guide FUNBIO's activities.
105



3. Characterization of the FAP Fund
The FAP fund will be constituted as an endowment, with the primary objective of maximizing
income and preserving the capital over the long term. Fund administration and recurrent costs for
PAs management under Phase I would therefore be covered primarily by investment income
generated by the prudent financial management of FAP endowment capital.
To achieve this objective, agreed with the Bank, FUNBIO will:
* Enter into contracts with investment management specialists who can advise FUNBIO
regarding prudent asset allocation strategies consistent with investment guidelines agreed with
the Bank
* Enter into contracts with internationally qualified asset managers that can provide efficient and
effective custodial services at a relatively minimal cost
* Develop and implement a fundraising strategy, in collaboration with Phase I initial and
follow-on donors, with the objective of identifying new donors, private sector partnerships,
and/or other mechanisms to attract additional funding for the endowment.
4. Decision-Making Structure
Under FUNBIO's existing Board structure, a Technical Commission will be responsible for
oversight of the FAP fund's day-to-day management. Another Technical Commission, already
existing, is responsible for the oversight of ARPA's day-to-day management. Both Commissions
fall under the general responsibility of FUNBIO's Executive Director. The latter Technical
Commission will include members from the ARPA Phase I Program Committee (including
representatives of the Brazilian government), FUNBIO Board representatives, and donor
representatives. The Executive Director may recruit a technical consultant and/or additional staff
for the fund as needed in order to effectively and efficiently manage the fund's operations.
5. Fund Capitalization and Management of Endowment Capital
For the purpose of initial capitalization of the FAP fund, GEF resources will be disbursed on a 1:1
basis (US$1 from the GEF for each US$1 from other donors), following verification of deposits
by other donors (such as, WWF, KFW, and Brazil Connect). Once the donor's deposits are
confirmed, the GEF will disburse its funds. GEF's initial capital allocation has been estimated at
US$14.5 million. Of the GEF initial capital allocation, US$2.5 million will be disbursed to the
"sustainable use" PAs subaccount, and US$12 million will be disbursed to the "strict
protection"PAs subaccount. This rule will be spelled out in the FAP Operational Manual.
Detailed financial projections, prepared by a Goldman Sachs expert, form the basis for estimated
annual costs to be covered by the FAP fund's investment income, as well as required
capitalization, and capital asset allocation requirements. Summary results from these projections
are presented below; the detailed tables are included with project files. The results demonstrate
that providing for the long-term sustainability of the PAs expected to be consolidated under Phase
106



I requires a fund capitalization on the order of US$50 million6. Since this represents considerably
more than the capital currently available for FAP, the following arrangements have been agreed
to among the initial donors: (a) a Letter of Intent reflecting the broad commitments of the
respective donors to the overall program will be signed prior to the fund's initial capitalization;
(b) during Year I of Phase I implementation, a fundraising strategy will be developed to address
the current estimated funding gap; and (c) during Year 1 of Phase I implementation, a process for
selecting priority PAs to be funded by FAP investment income proceeds will be defined as a
contingency plan in the event that the fundraising strategy fails to address the full extent of the
aforementioned funding gap. As noted above, the endowment capital will be managed with the
primary investment objective of long-term capital preservation. The secondary objective will be
to generate sufficient investment income to cover the aforementioned annual PA recurrent costs.
To meet these objectives, a specific asset allocation strategy, consistent with investment
guidelines agreed with the Bank, will be defined by FUNBIO and reflected in the FAP
Operational Manual (described below). Since financial projections and investment allocation
models are inherently imperfect predictors of inevitable future market variations, the investment
guidelines will include a spending rule policy that will allow FUNBIO a narrow margin of
flexibility to utilize a fraction of FAP capital to cover potential shortfalls in investment income
during a given year. The details of this policy will be reflected in the FAP Operational Manual.
6. Origin of Resources
The assets of the FAP fund may be comprised of:
*  Donations of goods and rights
*  Goods and rights stemming from asset revenue
*  Goods and rights stemming from activities carried out with its support
*  Other sources
Possible revenue of the Fund consists of:
* Income derived from its domestic and foreign investments and financial applications
*  Donations made by individuals or public or private corporations, whether domestic or
foreign, and by international agencies, expressly allocated to the Fund.
Mechanisms should be sought which facilitate donations from foreign partners and other
resources to optimize asset management in different currencies. With this objective, accounts may
be opened for the Fund both in the United States and in Europe.
7. Eligible PAs and RESEXs
The selection of PAs to be eligible for funding from FAP investment income shall be made
according to defined criteria and weights, including: (a) the existence of minimum infrastructure
and staff; (b) the existence of management plans that are concluded or under preparation; (c) the
GOB annual budget allocation; (d) the constitution of the Management Council(s); (e) the degree
6Estimated on the basis of the existing financial projections/model. The final results may vary based on the
revision of the financial projections/model currently underway. Once completed, the summary results will
be reflected in the referenced table.
107



of threat (human pressure); and (f) accreditation in the National Register of PAs. The full set of
criteria will be included in the FAP Operational Manual.
For Extractive and Sustainable Use protected areas, the eligibility criteria include the following:
(a) the existence of approved management plans; (b) the existence of Associations that are created
and implemented; (c) an updated registry of inhabitants; (d) a Management Council installed and
operational; (e) Commissions of environmental protection, health, and education constituted and
in operation, within the structure of the Associations; (f) registration in the National Conversation
Units Registry; (g) POA prepared on the basis of the approved management plan; (h) a minimum
forestry cover of 90 percent; (i) creation before December 2000 or after January 2001; (j) located
within the project area (Polygons). The full set of criteria will be included in the FAP Operational
Manual.
8. Eligible Expenditures
FAP investment income will be used to cover recurrent costs for PAs and RESEXs that meet the
eligibility criteria referenced above. Eligible recurrent costs include: protection activities (fuel,
firebreaks, maintenance of equipment used for enforcement, etc.); training activities; and
monitoring and support to the operation of the Management Councils. The types of expenditures
eligible for coverage by the Fund's resources, defined in a contract signed with donors, should be
approved periodically by the Program Committee based on POAs submitted by their executors.
These expenditures will be detailed in the FAP Operatiorial Manual. The POAs themselves will
be prepared by the PAs and RESEXs eligible to be supported with FAP investment income
proceeds. Approval of POAs will follow the same procedures adopted for the implementation of
other components of the Project.
All procurement executed with GEF resources under the Project, whether as part of or separate
from FAP, will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, published by the World Bank. These regulations shall prevail for all
agents who are beneficiaries of Project resources.
9. Asset Manager(s)
To ensure prudent financial and investment management of the endowment capital, as noted
above, FUNBIO will: (a) enter into a contract with an investment expert qualified to assist with
the definition of an asset allocation and overall investment strategy consistent with the investment
objectives described above; and (b) enter into a contract with an internationally qualified asset
manager, which will be responsible for providing custodial services for the endowment capital.
Both contracts, as well as the roles and outputs of the investment expert and asset manager, will
be consistent with Bank investment and procurement guidelines described above. Both contracts
will be duly reflected in the FAP Operational Manual.
The investment expert's responsibilities may include creation of specific investment portfolios;
provision of information to facilitate the monitoring of investment results and the planning of
future POA requirements; systematic performance of market research and analysis in order to
identify and monitor investment alternatives; identification of long-term strategies and short-term
tactics for resource applications; and provision of analysis and interpretation of investment
reports submitted by the asset manager(s).
108



The responsibilities of the asset manager(s) may include:
* Provision of custodial services, including liquidations of purchases and sale of papers,
preparation of notes for all transactions, collection of dividends, monthly income and capital
statements, as well as maintaining appropriate insurance against negligence, fraud, accidental
damage, and other types of damage.
* Maintaining correspondence with FUNBIO by means of communications, written reports, and
periodic meetings (as needed). Reports should include evaluations, income and capital
statements, and, less frequently, analyses of applications, performance assessed according to
established reference values, market perspectives, evaluations, and summaries of transactions
made.
9.1 Criteria for selection of asset managers. The criteria established for the selection of asset
managers may be grouped into three general categories:
Investment capacity
*  Demonstrated skills and consistent work to reach or exceed established reference values;
flexibility; experience with balanced investment portfolios; independent research ability;
organization and control
*  Representation and investment activities in Brazil; research ability; acuity in dealing with the
proposal; and quality of presentation
*  Response capacity regarding the proposed investment, in terms of creativity, flexibility, and
exactness; and ability to deal with the Fund's specifications
*  Costs in relation to capacity and efficiency
Experience and reputation
*  Years of experience, clientele, types of funds administered
*  Reputation in the market, clientele, references
*  Quality of management and of technical staff, in terms of: experience; ability to maintain
competent professionals; individual workload, within reasonable limits; good client relations;
good research capacity
*  Environmental and social responsibility;, demonstrating the ability to meet the client's
demands in this regard
*  Experience in stock investments of the amount estimated to cover the Project's needs
throughout its life span
109



Security and stability
*  Prudent; professional investment philosophy; history with no records of any type of
condemnation by the regulatory authority regarding activities; ensure protection of assets;
quality of associates
*  Responsibility and reliability in protecting assets and respecting regulations
*  Capacity and flexibility in risk administration, limits utilized, ability to diversify
9.2 Selection process for the asset managers.
The selection of the asset manager(s) will be consistent with Bank procurement guidelines.
FUNBIO should be assisted by the investment expert described above in preparing a preliminary
list of potential Asset Manager candidates. FUNBIO will implement the remaining steps in the
selection process, including request for proposals, evaluation of proposals, and preparation of a
final bid evaluation report. The results of the evaluation report will be submitted to the FAP
donors for their information and "no objection." Subsequently, FUNBIO will negotiate the
custodial services contract with the selected Asset Manager(s), and will submit the final
negotiated contract to the donors for their information and "no objection." The final, signed
contract will be a condition of disbursement of funds to the FAP account.
10. Financial Management System
FUNBIO will establish a specific financial information system for FAP so that accurate reports
on the complexity, diversity, and volume of FAP operations may be provided readily and in a
timely manner to the donors and other interested parties. FUNBIO will draw on its current
financial management experience and system(s) to develop a system for FAP operations. As
needed, subaccounts will be established for each donor, to ensure accurate accounting regarding
the utilization of a given donor's resource allocation.
Independent auditors will be hired to perform external audits of accounting statements and the
balance sheet of the fund, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Audit
reports will note compliance with donors' regulations and practices, as well as separate opinions
on the SOEs of audited projects.
The audit reports of the fund will consider separately the accounts, statements of expenses, and
statements of resources used in the maintenance of PAs, carried out through partner
organizations. An analysis of overall financial management, control mechanisms, and
demonstrated efficiency also will be performed. The annual report will consider the operations of
the asset manager. Six months after the end of each fiscal year, the results of financial audits,
together with copies of balance sheets, should be available to FUNBIO's Board and/or Technical
and Advisory Committees, as well as donors and other relevant interested parties.
' srazil Connect, for example, will allocate US$1.5 million to the FAP capital account to support recurrent
costs for RESEXs. FUNBIO will then establish a separate operational subaccount for the purpose of
disbursing the associated investmnent income to RESEXs and accurate accounting of the same.
110



In order for its performance to be monitored by the Bank/GEF and other donors, the use of FAP
resources will require the preparation of the following documents, to be submitted within the
respective deadlines:
Annual Operating Plan (POA). The POA presents the specific objectives to be achieved the
following year, with a detailed description of the activities to be carried out during that year.
Procurement planning. This should be included in the POA and should contain all procurements
anticipated for the following year.
Semiannual progress reports. These should report on the level of achievement of FAP's
operational physical and financial targets during the previous semiannual period.
Financial reports and submission of accounts in accordance with Bank and other donors'
guidelines.

ANNEX 13
CRITERIA TO PRIORITIZE SITES FOR THE CREATION OF PROTECTED AREAS AND
CHARACTERISTICS OF CANDIDATE AREAS
1. Background
The selection of priority areas for biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Amazon was first
attempted in 1990, when leading biologists convened in Manaus to develop the first map
delineating priority conservation areas for the Amazon basin as a whole.8 The map generated
from the Manaus workshop indicated areas of high biological richness and/or endemism, based
on a synthesis of known information regarding the geographic distribution of major biological
groups. The workshop also pointed out major information gaps, particularly in the less accessible
interfluvial areas. As Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology was still in its infancy
in 1990, the range of overlays that could be incorporated to generate the final map was limited.
Furthermore, the criteria for selection of areas were strictly biological and did not take into
account the rapid, human-induced changes that had begun to impact widespread areas of the
region during the previous decade. Finally, the Manaus workshop took place before recent
advances in the field of conservation biology, which provides evidence for the efficacy of
conservation at larger scales such as ecoregions.9 Commonly referred to as ecoregion-based
conservation, this large-scale approach is designed to incorporate key ecological processes (such
as migrations and hydrological cycles) and to protect against rare or unexpected disturbances
(such as wildfires destroying large areas of Amazon forest).
Despite these limitations, the map generated by the 1990 Manaus workshop provided a critical
baseline for the priority-setting exercise on which this project is based. ARPA's geographical
priorities are based on PROBIO (National Biodiversity Program), a GEF-supported project
launched in 1996 under the auspices of Brazil's Ministry of Environment. As part of this project,
leading national scientific organizations, with the collaboration of scientists and institutions
worldwide, developed comprehensive databases of information relevant to biodiversity. With the
use of GIS, the project generated cartographic overlays showing the geographic distribution of:
(a) ecoregions;' (b) major biological groups; (c) existing protected areas (public and private); (d)
other areas designated for low-impact use (such as indigenous lands); (e) current land use, soil
type, and topography; and (f) existing and planned infrastructure (such as roads, railroads, and
waterways). The actual process of priority setting takes place in workshops that convened both
biological and socioeconomic experts for each of Brazil's major biomes.

da Amaz6nia. Mapa e Legenda, Escala 1:500.000. Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e Recursos
Naturais Renovaveis (IBAMA), Brasilia; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz6nia (INPA), Manaus;
Conservation International, Washington, D.C.
9 Ecoregions are large biological units that share similar biological and physical features, usually at an
intermediate scale between biomes and ecosystems. Ecoregion-based conservation has been adopted as the
conceptual framework for conservation strategies by major environmental NGOs such as the World
Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy. The major ecoregions of Latin America were mapped by the
World Wildlife Fund and the World Bank (Dinerstein, E., D. M. Olson, D. J. Graham, A. L. Webster, S. A.
Primm, M. P. Bookbinder, and G. Ledec. 1995. A Conservation Assessment of Latin America and the
Caribbean. The World Bank/World Wildlife Fund, Washington, D.C.).
' In 1998, WWF reevaluated the ecoregion limits for the region defined by Dinerstein et al. (1995). This
reevaluation defined 23 ecoregions, which largely conform to the region's major river basins.
113



The priority-setting workshop for the Amazon took place in Macapa, Amapa, during September
15-21, 1999. The workshop and prior preparations were coordinated by a consortium of NGOs,
including the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), the Amazon Working Group (GTA),
Conservation International of Brazil, the Institute for Man and Environment in the Amazon
(IMAZON), the Institute for Environmental Research in the Amazon (IPAM), and the Institute
for Society, Population and Nature (ISPN). A total of 226 participants were involved in the
workshop (see complete list of participants and affiliated organizations at
http://www/socioambiental.org/bio/index.htm), including representatives from governmental
agencies (federal, state, and municipal), nongovernmental organizations, social movements,
public and private research institutions, businesses, and press. Among the scientists present were
international and national specialists widely recognized for their biological and socioeconomic
expertise in the Amazon region.
The workshop convened information on 12 thematic groups; six of the groups focused on major
biological taxa: plants, mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, invertebrates (primarily insects),
and aquatic biota (primarily fish). Three additional groups focused on present and potential
threats to conservation, including current land uses, existing and planned infrastructure, and
highly threatened ecosystems that provide critical ecological services. The final three groups
focused on opportunities for conservation: existing protected areas, areas designated for
indigenous peoples and other traditional populations, and areas appropriate for low-impact
businesses such as ecotourism. Coordinated by a leading expert in the corresponding thematic
area, each group generated a map showing areas of critical importance. Gap analysis was used to
designate areas of likely importance where further field research is needed.
A regional analysis focusing on seven divisions defined by few main watersheds was overlaid to
identify and categorize areas of biological importance according to the degree of overlap of
priority areas for each biological taxon defined on the previous day. The highest degree of
importance was given to areas with the greatest degree of overlap (four or more taxa), the second
highest to areas overlapped by three taxa, and the third highest to areas overlapped by two taxa.
Other areas insufficiently known but considered likely to be biologically significant also were
mapped. Using these strictly biological criteria, a total of 524 areas were nominated as priorities
for conservation.
In addition to biological criteria, the areas identified as significant for their threats or
environmental services also were used to add a socioeconomic dimension to the priority setting
exercise. Degree of importance for environmental services, "degree of stability" or connectivity
(that is, insertion within or linkage to existing protected areas or indigenous lands), and "degree
of instability" (that is, proximity to threats such as infrastructure development or advancing
agricultural frontier) also were used in the priority setting process.
The results of the thematic and regional groups were synthesized onto a single map showing
priority areas for conservation in the Brazilian Amazon (see map of entire region, with links to
more detailed subregional maps, at: http://www/socioambiental.org/bio/index.htm'). For each of
the priority areas selected, the workshop participants then provided detailed information on its
location, principal biological characteristics, principal environmental services generated, degree
of connectivity, proximity to threats, and recommended actions (protection, recuperation,
sustainable use of natural resources, need for further studies, etc.). The results of the Macapa
workshop provided the conceptual foundation for the definition of priorities for the creation of
protected areas during the first phase of the Project (years 1-4).
114



2. Criteria to Prioritize Sites for the Creation of Protected Areas in ARPA
The Project will identify priority polygons for the creation of new protected areas" based on the
results of the Macapa workshop described above, with additional landscape gap analysis
whenever necessary.
The establishment of regional orientation is fundamental for the definition of the decision-making
process on land use in all administrative scales (municipal, state, or federal), especially in
complex and extremely diversified regions like the Brazilian Amazon. The creation of a new
protected areas should be the result of consensus among the various stakeholders. Therefore,
orientations will be, whenever possible, practical and quantitative. They also should be flexible so
that, without losing site of the main project objective, they will allow for the incorporation of
municipal and state land use planning initiatives. The basic premises, listed below, will
fundament the selection of areas for the creation of new protected areas (PAs) in this project:
*  A system of PAs should be a mosaic of different categories, and never be composed only of
"strict protection" PAs.
*  Selection of areas for the establishment of new PAs should follow, primarily, the
recommendations of the PRONABIO workshop.
*  The areas recommended at the PRONABIO workshop should be, whenever necessary,
complemented by new areas selected through landscape representativity analysis in each
ecoregion.
*  Areas recommended by the states' Ecological and Economic Zoning processes will be
incorporated into the Project after overlays with PRONABIO and complementary
representativity analysis results in each ecoregion.
*  Large areas, containing large populations of plants and animals, are more adequate than small
areas containing small populations of plants and animals.
*  Areas that are near each other are better than areas separated by considerable distances.
*  Continuous habitats are preferable than fragmented habitats.
*  Interconnected habitats are more desirable than isolated habitats.
  Blocks of habitat that are not sectioned by roads or that are difficult to be reached by humans
are preferable.
*  The ideal minimum-area for the creation of a new "strict protection" PA should ideally not be
inferior to 500,000 hectares.
*  The categories of the new PAs will be defined after field studies, and after consideration by
all stakeholders (local population and government).
*  Ecoregion analysis also will identify areas for the creation of "sustainable use" PAs (RESEX
and RDS), combining representative analysis with demands from local communities.
The methodology proposed for the selection of areas by ARPA is based on the analysis of each
ecoregion, with the objective to protect each landscape unit in the ecoregion within "strict
protection" PAs.
The polygons selected by each working group during the PRONABIO workshop were classified
by group participants according to degree of importance:
" For the purpose of this project, the term "protected areas" includes the following categories defined in
the Law 9985 of July 18, 2000, that established the SNUC: Parks, Biological Reserves, Ecological Stations,
Sustainable Development Reserves, and Extractive Reserves. Protected areas of these five categories may
be established at federal, state, and/or municipal levels.
115



* Polygons of extreme importance: value 5
* Polygons of very high importance: value 4
* Polygons of high importance: value 3
* Polygons insufficiently known but of probable importance: value 2
* New polygons identified by the regional groups: value 1
Polygons were also overlaid by the human disturbance summary map, which was generated by
the combination of the human disturbance map and the map of human pressure by municipality
(generated by social and economic data). This overlay was also classified in five categories of
pressure:
* Over 85 percent
* Between 85 and 65 percent
* Between 64 and 40 percent
* Between 39 and 20 percent
* Below 20 percent
A value was then attributed to each one of the categories:
Table 13.1
Category            Percent, overlay           Value
a)                 Over 85                     5
b)                 Between 85 and 65           4
c)                 Between 64 and 40           3
d)                 Between 39 and 20           2
e)                 Below 20                    1
The values for degree of importance and for percent overlay were added and a single value was
obtained. This result was then used to establish priorities, by urgency categories:
Table 13.2
Single value .;                 Urgency category:
Between 10 and 8                Very high
Between 8 and 6                 High
Between 6 and 4                 Medium

Therefore, for each area that overlaps (PRONABIO polygons and human disturbance polygons),
there is a corresponding urgency category.
An additional analysis of the polygons selected by the urgency categories was carried out so that
biodiversity representativity criteria could be incorporated. Because there are very little data on
biodiversity distribution in the Amazon, a landscape-representation unit map (URP) was
developed as a model for beta diversity distribution, using physical as well as biological
characteristics (geomorphology and vegetation types).
The representativity data used were:
1. Local landscape richness
116



2. Regional landscape richness
Landscape richness was divided hierarchically into two categories (local and regional) because
we believe that polygons with 10 URP of forest vegetation have, probably, a lower biodiversity
richness than another polygon with a combination URP of different vegetation types, such as
forests, savannas, campinaranas, and others.
3. Landscape diversity
4. Size of polygon
A value was then attributed to each one of these variables:

All variables, plus the urgency index were added, obtaining a single value (Map 7). The result
was then used to establish priorities:
Table 13.7 Prioritization Categories
,Si igle valile      !           ; ,> *-Pror  category
Between 18 and 15              Very high
Between 14 and 12              High
Between 11 and 9               Medium
Between 8 and 6                Low
The classification does not imply that only the polygons classified as having high priority will be
analyzed in this project. All polygons of all categories in all ecoregions will be analyzed. The
prioritization categories only enable us to elaborate an order for examnining each Amazon
ecoregion. Nine ecoregions were prioritized to be analyzed in the first year of the Project (Fig. 1).
Despite the fact that the Southwest Amazon ecoregion was not identified as priority, it was
included in the Project's first year because the state government is already using ARPA's
methodology to identify priority areas for conservation. Therefore, this ecoregion is a priority,
even though it does not present any polygon classified as very high priority by the criteria used in
the analysis.
During this process, a complementary landscape representativity analysis will be carried out in
each ecoregion described below to evaluate if the polygons mentioned above incorporate, in the
best possible way, the diversity of landscapes.
The results from the Ecological and Economic Zoning processes in the Amazonian states will be
analyzed and considered by this project only if they coincide with the PRONABIO polygons or
with the polygons identified by the complementary landscape analysis.
In summary, the proposed protected areas will be located within the polygons mentioned above or
in the new polygons identified by the complementary landscape representativity analysis.
The above-mentioned polygons, and the ones identified by the complementary analysis, will be
evaluated according to the following priorities:
*  Priority 1: areas recommended by the PRONABIO workshop and by states' Ecological and
Economic Zoning, concomitantly.
*  Priority 2: areas recommended by the PRONABIO workshop (validated or not by the
representativity analysis).
*  Priority 3: areas recommended by the complementary representativity analysis and by states'
Ecological and Economic Zoning, concomitantly.
* Prioritv 4: areas recommended by the complementary landscape representativity analysis.

3. Compatibility with Other Government Programs
Priority areas were overlaid with information from other government programs, such as National
Resources Policy Project (NRPP), Demonstration Projects (PDA), PROECOTUR, and by
development "axes" defined by the Brasil em A do government plan.
Integration of these programs with ARPA is fundamental to reach project goals. The
implementation of the development "axes"-especially the asphalt of federal highways-
implicitly brings the risk of deforestation through new immigration fluxes and the intensification
of natural resources exploitation.
Considering past experiences when similar infrastructure projects were implanted in the region,
the implementation of the axes defined by the Brasil in A do which prioritize south-north
orientation, could result in an unknown flux of social and environmental impact if rigorous
mitigating and compensatory actions are not adopted, including the creation of protected areas.
The hypothesis of connectivity loss of the Amazon forest should be avoided at any cost. The
creation and consolidation of*PAs under this project, at specific sites along development axes,
could guarantee forest continuity in the long run.
Programns, such as PROECOTUR and PDA could, on the other hand, work as incentives
to communities around the newly created PAs, offering new opportunities and economic
alternatives.
4. Characteristics of Candidate Areas
The table below presents a summary of the analysis of socioeconomic data and threats for three
regional divisions (Eastern, East Central and Western Amazon) indicating the target areas within
each region for the creation of new protected areas.

ANNEX 14
CONSOLIDATION OF EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS
The process of selecting the PAs for Phase 1 was divided into two stages. The first sought to
analyze all existing PAs in light of criteria considered essential for the Project, such as the lack of
conflict with indigenous lands, a favorable land tenure situation; and the logistical feasibility of
consolidation in four years. The second verified the PAs' capacity to put into effect and
disseminate consolidation efforts.
Thus, in order to be considered suitable for Component 2, the protected area of strict protection
first had to meet the following criteria:
Lack of conflicts with indigenous lands or communities. The expression "conflict," for the
purpose of this criterion, strictly relates to the nonoccurrence of overlapping of polygonal areas
between protected areas and indigenous lands (whether demarcated or not), and/or the
nonexistence of disputes and confrontations over the use of natural resources occurring in a
conservation unit by the surrounding indigenous communities.
Land tenure situation resolved or favorable for resolution. Protected areas with an effective lack
of land tenure problems with regard to land possession or those in which land tenure (land
possession) problems refer to less than 10 percent of the total area.
Logisticalfeasibility of implementation during the duration of Phase 1 (4 years). This criterion
deals with the ability to meet the physical implementation targets for infrastructure and
incorporation of staff in four years, due to difficulties imposed by geographic location, size,
social context, and external pressures.
The following table shows the status of the thirty protected areas of strict protection existing for
the Amazon biome, in light of the qualification criteria for Component 2:

A - Meets criterion; NA - Does not meet criterion; (*) - Insufficient data
Next, the Protected Areas that meet the three qualification criteria were evaluated with regard to
their ability to put into effect and disseminate consolidation efforts, according to the following
criteria:
Existence of inter-institutional conditions or other externalities that make the consolidation effort
effective: These externalities may be associated with the presence of companies that collaborate
or may collaborate with the process of consolidating the Protected Areas with NGOs interested
and trained to collaborate with the consolidation of the PAs, or with the expressed interest of
OEMAs in contributing to the consolidation of the PAs.
Strong potentialfor synergy in the preservation of other areas of restricted use. This refers to the
potential expansion of the effects of protection due to the proximity or contiguity among
protected areas, optimizing the efforts of consolidation and protection. The PA that has this
characteristic to a greater degree should take precedence over others that may be classified.

Since the physical implementation of the Serra da Cutia National Park will be initiated by
Component 1, the 12 remaining PAs considered able to be consolidated in four years are:

However, since these protected areas have existed for different lengths of time, they were
analyzed according to the degree of current implementation, and were divided into three groups
which characterize their status with regard to the likelihood of consolidation in four years:
Reduced degree of implementation. Protected areas with reduced or no physical infrastructure;
human resources limited to the Unit Chief or nonexistent; sporadic protection activities carried
out by enforcement staff not belonging to the Unit; nonexistent scientific research.
Low degree of implementation. Protected areas without planning instruments but with some
physical infrastructure and equipment which allow minimum vigilance and protection activities to
be carried out. These units have a small but insufficient number of staff for administration and
management activities.
Medium/High degree of implementation. Protected areas with planning instruments PM "Piano de
Manejo" (Management Plan) or PAE "Plano de Accao Emergencial" (Emergency Action Plan)
which, in some cases, need to be updated; the quantity or quality of their physical infrastructure
and equipment is insufficient to perform more effective activities of protection, administration,
management, and research support; they have a minimal number of staff that needs to be
expanded and trained to fully carry out management and protection activities.

ANNEX 15
PARTICIPATORY PROCESS FOR CREATION OF PROTECTED AREAS
1. Public Consultation Process
The priority-setting workshop for the Amazon that took place in Macapa, Amapa, during
September 15-25, 1999, was the first process to ensure participation of the civil society,
grassroots organizations and indigenous groups in the identification of proposed areas under
ARPA. This process is described in detail in Annex 13 and in Annex 16 of this document.
ARPA has been discussed more widely over the last two years. The proposal has been submitted
for comments to social organizations involved the Amazon (GTA, CNS, CONTAG, COIAB, and
ASMUBIP) and to FUNBIO's Board, which has a broad NGO representation. The government of
Brazil recently gave one additional seat to social NGOs in the Program Committee. The Program
Committee now has six government members (SECEX/MMA, SCA/MMA, SBF/MMA, IBAMA,
State Forum of Secretaries of Environment of the Amazon Region, and municipalities) and six
members from civil society (two social NGOs, two environmental NGOs, one FUNBIO member,
and one donor).
Other participatory processes have taken place since the early phase of project development and
help test the procedures for continued public consultation during project implementation. Two
workshops were organized, one in Rondonia and one in Roraima, financed by the WWF/WB
Alliance, to create a set of new areas and develop a methodology for public consultation during
project implementation. These workshops were carried out in October and November of 2000.
One case study involved the creation of an indirect use area (park) and of two Extractive Reserves
in Costa Marques, Rond6nia. The second case study involved the preparatory workshop for the
consolidation of a mosaic of protected areas of indirect use (parks and ecological stations) in
Caracarai, Roraima. In both cases, the methodology was assessed by a variety of actors and found
appropriate for the proposed objectives of ARPA. The proposed methodology consists of a
continuous and flexible process, which will bring together the main social actors involved with
the created PAs. As time goes by, the stakeholders also will participate in the management
process of the PAs. The results of both consultation workshops are available in the Project's files.
In general, the use of participatory consultation in developing project design, such as the
workshops conducted in Costa Marques and Caracarai, has shown to be valid and fundamental
for an efficient, consistent, and participatory beginning, for the development of the Project, and
for the search of a inter-institutional integration that supports and facilitates the creation and the
consolidation of PAs. The results of the two workshops were integrated by the government team
and presented to the Bank as part of the project documentation describing the procedures and
methodologies that would be used to create and consolidate PAs in the Amazon region. A
summary is presented below.
2. Participation Requirements under ARPA
Law number 9.985, dated July 18, 2000, which approves the SNUC, establishes under the fifth
article that such system must be ruled by guidelines that:
130



* Ensure mechanisms and procedures necessary for society's involvement in the national policy
review and institutional arrangements to manage PAs
* Ensure the effective participation of local populations in the creation, implementation, and
management of PAs
* Seek the support and cooperation of private and nongovernmental organizations and
individuals for studies, scientific research, environmental education programs, recreational
activities and ecological tourism, monitoring, maintenance, and other activities related to PAs
management
* Encourage local populations and private organizations to establish and manage PAs within
the national system
*  Ensure that the process of creation and management of PAs would occur in conformance with
the surrounding land and water administration policies, and as deemed appropriate for local
economic and social conditions and needs
* Guarantee alternative subsistence forms or a fair compensation for the loss of resources used
by traditional peoples whose subsistence depends on the use of resources inside the PAs
Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 22 of SNUC, state that the creation of PAs should be preceded by
technical studies and public consultation which would identify the unit's localization, size, and
borders more adequately and according to the regulation. During this public consultation process,
Public Power is forced to provide adequate and clear information to the local population and
other interested parties. It would include the participation of representative indigenous groups
nation-wide and that live near the area of the parks.
The regulation of the SNUC legislation is currently under preparation by the Ministry of
Environment following an extensive public consultation process. The methodology hereby
proposed could be modified due to adjustment of the approved regulation plan and, once passed,
would be adopted in a new version of the Project Operational Manual, to be reviewed by the
Bank.
The search for the definition of a procedural plan in order to establish local inter-institutional
arrangements for the creation, implementation, and sustainability of PAs was reflected in the
document "Marco Conceitual das Unidades de Conservagao Federais do BrasiP'
(MMA/IBAMA/DIREC, 1997), which has DIREC/DEUC policies and guidelines for
participative or shared management of PAs. These policies and guidelines recommend to
stimulate and promote participative processes between the PA managers and the main social
groups that are directly or potentially involved with PAs management. This process aims to
prevent or solve conflicts and to deepen the links and cooperation with society and institutions,
which guarantees more effective protection of the unit ecosystems and an increase of positive
results for the society. This proposal considers as "social actors" all the groups, people, and
institutions whose characteristics and points-of-view about the PA are important to know for its
creation and consolidation.
3. Methodology for the Consultation Process
3.1 Objectives.
The general objectives of the consultation process for the creation of PAs require that different
institutions participate on the local, municipal, state, and federal levels. The consultation process
here proposed should have the following specific objectives:
131



*  Clarify the reasons and objectives for the creation of the PA so that the local society can
understand the reason of its creation
* Identify and understand each social group's interests and concerns
*  Identify the capabilities, objectives, and potential contribution of each social group
*  Improve the understanding of conflict problems and situations relating to the creation of the
PA
*  Obtain support for PA's management actions
3.2 Implementation Strategv.
The consultation process will be executed in three different stages: technical site visit,
consultation workshop, and consolidation of the results. The environmental agency, either at
federal, state, or municipal levels, responsible for the creation of the PA will establish a team of
staff and a consultant ad hoc, to be hired by the Project. The environmental agency technical staff
will take part in all three stages, and will offer orientation and subsidies to its development. The
hired consultant will be responsible for preparing the documents produced during the process.
The agency responsible for the consultation process-including all the contacts with the involved
governmental or nongovernmental institutions and other social groups-should be the Manager
of the PA to be created so that a real identity between these entities and groups and the PA is
established early on, and to promote greater involvement in and commitment to the PA by the
social actors, without mediators. A specific training program would be available to empower
managers for planning and executing such activities.
Three stages of the consultation process, with their objectives, methodological procedures, and
participants, are described below.
First Stage: Technical Site Visit
a. Objectives. The objectives of the technical site visit are to: (1) preassess the institutional
framework in the region where the PA will be created, identifying the different social actors
directly involved or those that would be important to be involved in the future; (2) assess the
different social actors' understanding about the PA to be created, their awareness about its
objective, and the values that they attribute to it; (3) conduct a preliminary survey on the
threats that the PA will face and possible ways to protect it; (4) identify possible conflicts by
different social actors regarding the natural resources of the proposed area for its creation; (5)
identify the participants for the consultation workshop; (6) prepare a brief document about
the current situation of the PA to be created, based on the information collected and to be
presented during the opening ceremony of the consultation workshop; and (7) plan the
logistics of the workshop and present them to the municipality nearest to the area in which
the PA will be created.
b. Participants. The workshop would be conducted by environmental agencies, technical staff
responsible for the proposed PA creation, and an ad hoc consultant.
c. Methodological procedures. The workshop should acknowledge the proposed PA and the role
for nearby municipalities, define where the event that will identify the area will take place,
draft the invitation to local social actors, produce the list of participants, and take care of the
workshop logistic planning.
132



Secondary data also should be collected (technical reports, publications, etc.) about the
current situation of the proposed area and the social-economic and historic-cultural contexts.
The most important aspect of the technical site visit is the interview with the representatives
of the main social groups and institutions, and to inform them about the proposed PA, the
reason for its creation, and the workshop. The interviewer's interest, conflicts, and
expectations regarding the proposed area should be registered in order to anticipate the issues
to be dealt with during the workshop. The communities living inside the proposed area or in
the buffer zones will be given special attention. The indigenous peoples living in the buffer
zones will have a strong voice. The preparatory technical work must foresee the site visit to
all the human settlements directly related to the PA to be created to carry out an informative
meeting about the workshop objectives with local representatives. This meeting should be
communicated and coordinated with local leaders to make possible the participation of a
significant number of community members. When communication problems will make it
difficult.or impossible to have prior contact with the community representatives, the site visit
should last the necessary time to reach the community representation.
The objective of the pre-workshop site visit will be to clarify the main questions regarding the
PA (historical creation, functions, objectives, operation process, natural resources usage
restrictions, geographical borders), and to convey the workshop's objectives, logistical issues,
and the opportunities for the representatives' participation. The meeting also would offer the
community the opportunity to express their concerns, aspirations, and needs that could
conflict with the proposed PA's requirements. In order to adequately expose this information,
it will be necessary to use tools to visualize them in an intelligible language.
The goal of the pre-workshop site visit is to overcome any obstacles to the participation of
local-area representatives. This should result in a better preparation for the workshop,
optimizing the timing for the realization of this event. The community meeting also will
enhance understanding of the social actors' real life conditions. With respect to the
indigenous peoples, contact with the state FUNAI office via formal correspondence will be
established to inform them of the workshop, its objectives, and general topics. One technical
staff from the project will facilitate contact with the local indigenous leaders, to guide the
visit and to take part in the meeting. The date for this technical site visit should be flexible,
adjusting to the local needs.
The period of time between the end of the technical site visit and the beginning of the workshop
should not be less than two weeks in order to allow the participants sufficient time to prepare for
the meeting, and to minimize absences. During this period, the environmental institution
responsible for the proposed PA will send an official invitation to each one of the social actors
identified during the site visit. The invitation will inform them about the workshop's objectives,
length, program, and logistics, as well as what to expect regarding participation.
All of the expenses of the participants (especially of the social group representatives), such as
transportation, lodging, and meals, will be fully covered by the event.
Second Stage: Consultation Workshops
a. Objectives. The objectives of the consultation workshops are to: (1) understand the problems
and difficulties that could be raised by the creation of a new PA; (2) clarify and discuss with
local society the objectives of the creation of the PA, seeking consensus on its objectives and
the importance of PAs creation; (3) identify and understand the concerns and interests of
each social group involved in the process; (4) identify the objectives, capacities, and
responsibilities of the social actors with regard to creation of the PA; (5) establish local
133



institutional capacity, social consequences, possibility and interests for creation of the PA; (6)
obtain support for these actions and for the future management unit; and (7) determine the
best category of PA that could be adopted (that is, park, Extractive Reserve, etc.).
b. Participants. Between 20 and 25 (maximum) representatives of the main social actors who are
directly involved with the process, identified during the pre-workshop site visit; three or four
representatives of the institution responsible for the creation of the area; one local
representative of MMA/SCA (optional); two representatives of the team who conducted the
study (environmental and social diagnostic) on the proposed area; one representative of
ARPA (optional); one facilitator (optional); and one administrative support.
The Facilitator could be one of the team members or be hired through the Project.
c. General guidelines. The workshop will take place subject to the following conditions being
met: (1) a two-way dialogue exists between the workshop organizers and the participants; and
(2) open group discussions are held on the raised issues to support its interpretation and
evaluation process. The workshop will include dynamics and visualization techniques to
enhance participation. There will be open sessions (plenary) and working groups for specific
issues, followed by a ftnal group presentation. By maximizing participation of all the
different actors involved, the workshop will establish synergy among the participants, and
facilitate the analysis and subsequent assessment of problems and solutions. Achieving a
consensus among participants is not the focus. Conflicts will be settled at the time they arise.
d. Methodological procedures. Given that the workshop is a participatory process and that, in
the first stage, participants are not yet directly involved with the creation of the PA, the
.workshop should not exceed two days. This limitation will support effective participation
without overwhelming the participants, and will minimize interruption to their own
responsibilities.
The workshop should start with a dynamic introduction of the participants and by informing
them about the workshop's objectives and the agenda. Thereafter, the workshop coordinators
or the representative of the environmental institution in charge of the proposed PA should
make a brief presentation on the current SNUC law, stressing the importance of managing
PAs.
This will be followed up by a presentation on the status of the proposed PA creation and its
importance. During this session, it is very important to allow attendee participation. These
talks will be audio tape-recorded by the workshop coordinator, for use later on in the
workshop as a strong tool for consensus building and resolving discrepancies.
The workshop will focus on the following results:
An analysis of the involvement of different social actors
* An analysis of the status of the PA: strength, threats, or problems; weaknesses and
opportunities
* A recommendation to define an effective plan for the PA
* The "involvement analysis" of the different social actors will be developed in two
phases. In the first phase, each social group should respond to the following questions:
* "Who are we?"
* "What do we do?"
* "What are our expectations?"
134



Each participant could answer these questions on a piece of cardboard so that a matrix can be
built. Once complete, the matrix should be hung so that everybody can view it during the
workshop. The results will be presented in the overall session.
In the second phase, each social group should reply to the following questions:
*  "Are we taking advantage of the unique opportunity provided by this workshop?"
*  "Has lack of interest been shown?"
*  "How does it happen?"
*  "What are the expectations/interests in relation to the PA?"
*  "What is the value added to the proposed PA?"
* "What is our position or interest (support, refusal, unconcern) on the creation of the PA?"
Applying the same method as described above, each social group will respond to these
questions on a piece of cardboard or flip-chart, so that all participants can view each others'
responses during the workshop. The open session format will depend on its structure. In the
event there is more than two social group representatives, they should get together and
provide discussion among them, and, thereafter, present the conclusions in the open session.
In the event there is only one representative of each social group (which usually happens),
they attendees can choose to provide responses separately or to work in small discussion
groups with the various representatives of social groups, related or not, for the purpose of
clarifying ideas and airing doubts; thereafter, each group should respond to the questions on a
separate sheet and present the results in the open session.
The purpose of the "situation analysis" is to identify weaknesses, threats, or problems relating
to the PA, and to strengthen opportunities for creating the PA. The following should be
considered:
*  The weaknesses are conditions or intricacies characteristic of the area to be created and of
the institution responsible for the creation which will impede the PA creation.
* The threats or problems are situations, tendencies, or facts external to the area to be
created and to the institution responsible for the creation which could irnpede the PA
creation.
*  The strengths are the conditions or characteristics specific to the area to be created and to
the institution responsible for the creation which will assist with or contribute to the PA
creation.
* The opportumities are situations, tendencies, or facts external to the area to be created and
to the institution responsible for the creation which can contribute to and assist with the
PA creation.
For the "situation analysis," four different subgroups will be set up. Each subgroup will be
responsible for the identification of the aspects/concerns raised above (weaknesses, threats, or
problems; strengths and opportunities). Each subgroup shall be composed of social group
representatives, based on their specific areas of responsibility or work schedules. In the event
there is more than one representative for each social group, a distribution between groups is
strongly recommended.
135



The results will be presented and discussed during the wide session (plenary), to promote a
consensus. Those who cannot agree will be documented as such.
To define an action plan for PA creation, participants will consider:
-  to capture identified opportunities?
-  to catalyze potential strengths?
What can be done. . .  -  to minimize or resolve threats and problems?
-  to neutralize or eliminate weaknesses?
The group's recommendation for each of these questions must be discussed, and an answer
sought to the following questions:
* How to proceed with these different recommendations?
* How to set up responsibilities among the social actors in order to implement smoothly the
different recommendations?
The recommendations and suggestions for implementation could be identified by the
subgroup "Analysis of the situation". The recommendations received for the strengths,
threats or problems, opportunities and weaknesses should be compiled. The results will be
presented during the plenary session and analyzed by the participants. Any recommendation
that did not reach a consensus will be recorded for later discussion.
At the end of the workshop, the participants will address the proposed issues. It also is
recommended that an overall evaluation be made of the workshop's logistics, proposed
issues, agenda, participants, and workshop methodology assessment.
The proposed format for the workshop (that is, using work groups for analysis and to
generate recommendations, followed by a plenary session for consensus building) is highly
effective. It facilitates flow from one segment of the workshop to the next, enhances attendee
participation, and improves the potential for a consensus to be reached. Therefore, during the
recommendation phase, close monitoring of group participation is highly appreciated to help
the group in its objectives regarding the importance of PAs creation.
e. Workshop schedule. The workshop duration is approximately two days. The workshop
should follow a detailed timetable, adapted to the particular venue, with breaks among each
period. For a two-day workshop, the following schedule is recommended:
First Day:
[Morning]
Kickoff - participant identification, distribution of workshop material, etc. (30 minutes)
Opening - Workshop objectives (10 minutes)
Introduction of participants (20 minutes)
Brief presentation on the current SNUC and the meaning and importance of PAs
management (45 minutes)
Conference on the status of the proposed PA and the importance of PAs creation (30
minutes)
136



Open session for participants' comments and suggestions
[Afternoon]
Analysis of Involvement - Start with analysis of the real situation (status)-identification of
the current activities in the proposed creation area (suitable or divergence); identification of
the consequences or negative effects caused by activities in place of the proposed PA.
Second Day:
[Morning]
Continuation of analysis of the real situation (status)-strengths, threats or problems,
weaknesses, and opportunities
[Afternoon]
Identification of recommendations to define the PA implementation plan;
Directions.
Third Phase: Consolidation of the Results
a. Objectives. The objectives of the third phase are to:
* Compile the information received
*  Provide a strategic assessment for the articulation of the inter-institutional area
* Prepare Workshop final documents.
b. Proceedings. The consultant will assemble the results of the Workshop to obtain a better
understanding of the issues involved, evaluate the creation, and develop a strategy for the
articulation of the inter-institutional area to be created.
For this, the consultant should prepare a document including at least the following:
*  A detailed local-institutional capacity assessment and how it will apply during the project
implementation (ARPA)
*  A comparison between the social consequences of and the local interests on the PA
creation, and how interests are linked to PA creation
*  An analysis on the Involvement and on the Status, with a matrix of opportunities,
Threats, Strengths and Weaknesses of the proposed PA
*  Establish a rate for each social actor who is directly involved with the PA, as per the
previous analysis
*  A preliminary plan for the effectiveness of the proposed PA.
137



ANNEX 16
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES STRATEGY
ARPA adopts the full involvement of local, regional, and national societies as a basic principle
for the creation, consolidation, and maintenance of protected areas (PAs). Therefore, the Project
will seek to ensure that participatory mechanisms for traditional people, quilombolas,"2 and
indigenous peoples are in place, and that their representative organizations, interested in the
activities to be developed during project implementation, are able to participate.
The Project will use an innovative methodology (see Annex 15 - Participatory Process for
Creation of PAs), developed to effectively assure the rights of indigenous and traditional peoples,
to assess the situation of people living within the boundaries of existing or future PAs..
The main Project strategy, to create new PAs in a mosaic of different management categories (see
Annex 13), is based primarily on the Constitutional prerogative that warrants indigenous peoples
and quilombolas permanent occupation and use of their land. That is, in any given situation and at
any given time, occupation of indigenous land and quilombo lands is assured to the indigenous
peoples and the quilombolas (Federal Constitution: Article 231, Temporary Provisions: Article
68). In addition to their Constitutional rights, representatives of indigenous peoples, quilombolas,
and traditional populations are assured participation in the Program Committee.
Unsolved problems that might persist in existing PAs to be consolidated under the Project, will be
addressed by the Conflict Resolution Mediation Committee. The Committee would be called by
the Project's Executive Coordinator (see Annex 11 - Institutional Arrangements), and will allow
the Project to apply differentiated policies and tools, where pertinent, to particular situations.
1. Context
ARPA is part of a 10-year Brazilian Government program for the establishment and consolidation
of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. The first phase of this program (four years) seeks to
protect 18 million hectares with the creation of new PAs (9 million hectares in "strict protection"
PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use" PAs); to consolidate 7 million hectares of
existing "strict protection" PAs; and to establish an endowment fund (FAP) to finance recurrent
costs of selected "strict -protection" PAs, and vigilance of "sustainable use" PAs (see Annex 2 -
Detailed Project Description). Thus, the Project will contribute to the implementation of Law
9985 of July 18, 2000, which created the SNUC, in which PA categories are defined, each with
its respective management system.
The SNUC law distinguishes two main categories of PAs: (a) Strict Protection, the primary
objective of which is conservation, and which stresses a strict protection regime including the
prohibition of productive activities and natural resource exploitation (for example, National
Parks, Biological Reserves, and Ecological Stations); and (b) Sustainable Use, that allow for the
direct use and exploitation of natural resources within certain conditions agreed upon and defined
in the management plan (for example, Extractive Reserves and Sustainable Use Reserves). The
SNUC law covers federal, state, and municipal PAs, as well as private protected areas.
12 The term "quilombolas" refers to traditional populations of African origin, remaining from
communities formed by runaway slaves (quilombos).
138



The federal government's general strategy with ARPA is to create a mosaic of PAs in the
Amazon region in which each PA would correspond to specific priorities for environmental
conservation, as well as to the demands of traditional peoples, indigenous groups, and quilombola
populations. Thus, the core premise of the Project is the involvement and active participation of
local populations in light of their importance for the long-term sustainability of the Protected
Area System in the Brazilian Amazon.
2. Principles to be Adopted by the Project
Among the basic principles that will be adopted by ARPA is to impede the creation of PAs
overlapping with existing Indigenous Lands (Terras Indigenas) or any other types of indigenous
area not yet fully identified or demarcated. Not only is this a basic principle for Project
implementation but also a Constitutional determination regarding indigenous areas. In this sense,
there will be no need to open a negotiation process with the indigenous peoples that occupy
demarcated areas, they will remain in their traditional living sites.
ARPA will focus on the following situations: (a) overlap between an Indigenous Land and an
existing PA; (b) the presence of indigenous peoples in potential areas for creation of new PAs;
and (c) close proximity between an Indigenous Land and a PA. During the studies phase, if
isolated indigenous groups or non-isolated groups whose lands are yet to be demarcated, are
located in an area being considered for PA creation, the Constitutional provision will be met, and
a process will be started to demarcate an Indigenous Land through FUJNAI.
3. ARPA and Indigenous Peoples
The Project will potentially benefit indigenous peoples in the vicinity of the PAs, as the PAs
could function as buffer zones preventing frontier encroachment and illegal activities on
indigenous lands. In addition, PAs are designed for protection of water resources, wildlife, and
natural vegetation cover-a benefit for neighboring areas and for society as a whole.
ARPA, through its participation in the Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain
Forests (PPG-7), will work closely with the Demonstrative Projects for Indigenous Peoples
(PDPI) for prioritization of activities in the vicinity of PAs assisted by ARPA, and also with the
Project for the Integrated Protection of Indigenous Amazonian Populations and Lands (PPTAL)
during demarcation of new indigenous lands and new PAs.
Indigenous peoples will have direct involvement in the Project through their representatives in the
Program Committee, and through the PA Management Councils established in the areas
surrounding Indigenous Lands.
4. Brazilian Amazon Indigenous Peoples
According to the National Foundation for Indigenous Affairs (FUNAI), the indigenous population
in Brazil amounts to 326,000 people. Indigenous Lands cover some 946,452 square kilometers,
which corresponds to 11 percent of Brazilian national territory, and to 22 percent of the Legal
Amazon area. Experts estimate that there still are some 2,000 indigenous people living in isolated
groups in the Amazon who have not yet had significant contact with the national society.
139



However, it is well known that a majority of indigenous groups in Brazil today have close
relationships with the regional and national societies, being involved in commercialization of
products, utilizing public services (health and education), and participating in public life,
including electoral processes at different levels (municipal, state, and federal). In this sense, it is
necessary to ensure the indigenous peoples' access to markets, to means of transportation, to
public services, and to natural resources. The Ministry of Environment recognizes the possibility
that the creation or consolidation of a PA could modify the indigenous groups' accessibility to the
resources mentioned above, and, therefore, will assist with the maintenance of the current social
and cultural patterns of the indigenous group involved.
For a long time, indigenous peoples have used tropical forest ecosystems for their subsistence and
trade without causing major environmental degradation. Many scientists consider as exemplary
the indigenous knowledge in natural resources management. However, indigenous peoples are
vulnerable to changes occurring in the Amazon. While problems and issues are diversified across
the region, the majority of observers agree that the legalization of indigenous areas is a
precondition for their survival.
Whereas ARPA does not focus on resolving the grave problems faced by indigenous peoples in
the Amazon, it will certainly contribute to improved conservation and management of natural
resources in PAs surrounding indigenous lands, and it also will facilitate the possibility of access
to financial resources from other PPG7 projects for an indigenous land surrounded by a selected
PA.
5. Project Components and their Relation to Indigenous Peoples
5.1 Component 1 - Creation of new PAs. In this component, there will be no displacement of
indigenous peoples, in accordance with the Constitution and other existing legislation. As stated
before, if the presence of indigenous populations is detected in a priority area for creation of a
new PA, FUNAI will be called upon to start the identification and demarcation process.
Established legal procedures and the Project's participatory process will ensure effective
application of this policy. Preparatory actions for the selection and the establishment of new PAs
will be developed according to a successfully tested methodology (see Annex 15), which
includes, among other activities, the consultation with government and nongovernment agencies
aimed at ensuring that there will not be any overlap of the boundaries of proposed PAs with
demarcated Indigenous Lands, or indigenous areas under demarcation or potential demarcation.
In this manner, during the process of the creation of PAs, the following steps will be taken by
MMA or any of ARPA's implementers:
a)During the studies phase, the PCU team will verify through consultations with FUNAI,
civil society organizations, and when needed, through field visits, the possibility of overlap with
an indigenous land or with existing isolated indigenous people in the geographical area proposed.
b) If the presence of indigenous people is observed, MNMA and the ARPA Project would
suspend the process of creation of a PA in the proposed area until the indigenous land has been
identified by FUNAI.
c) If the absence of indigenous land or people is confirmed in the proposed geographical
area, the process of creation of a new PA will proceed.
5.2 Component 2 - Consolidation of existing PAs. In regard to PA consolidation, a Working
Group will be created involving MMA, IBAMA, INCRA, FUNAI, and other interested
institutions, in compliance with Article 42 of the SNUC law and the draft regulations for this law
140



which have been approved by CONAMA'3 and amended by MMA (see the letter of April 4,
2002, from the Minister of Environment to the CMU Director in the Project's files). This
Working Group will have up to one year after the problem is detected to review a detailed report,
prepared by IBAMA, on the social problems related to the consolidation of existing PAs. Each
situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Additional surveys will be conducted as needed,
and a participatory process for conflict mediation will be established, to propose guidance for
problem solving, always ensuring indigenous peoples the access and possession of their lands.
As a condition for investment in the consolidation of existing PAs (see Annex 14 for details) and
in the other analyses to be conducted by ARPA, a detailed analysis of potential overlaps with
and/or conflict on natural resource use in indigenous areas within or in the vicinity of PAs, will be
conducted with participation of the affected indigenous group. Based on the results of this
analysis, a specific plan (Indigenous Peoples Plan) agreed with the indigenous communities to
resolve the overlaps and/or conflicts will be proposed and implemented. The plan will include a
definition of the priorities actions and the means to implement them (i.e. budget financing,
timetable, institutional arrangements and monitoring and evaluation arrangements). This plan will
take into consideration the Constitutional rights of the indigenous peoples, and will propose, as
needed, redefinition of PA boundaries, incentives for alternatives to natural resource use, and
other activities of potential interest to indigenous groups. Financial resources from ARPA or
other government projects could be used to solve these potential problems.
In this manner, for the Consolidations of existing PAs, the following steps would be followed:
a) The Working Group would present a list of all the PAs with "social conflicts" (ie.
overlap with Indigenous Lands).
b) Based on this list, the government will do an analysis case by case, propose solutions
always ensuring the participation of the interested ones and the rights of the indigenous people,
quilombolas and traditional populations.
c) The ARPA Program Committee with the support of this analysis and documents,
would be responsible for the preparation and implementation of the Indigenous People Plan.
This plan could be jointly prepared with the PPG7 program "Indigenous Peoples Demonstrations
Project" or by FUNAI and would be financed by the Brazilian government.
d) The indigenous peoples from the buffer areas of the ARPA PAs, would prepare and
implement Indigenous Peoples Plans, under the supervision of the Program Committee. These
plans could be jointly prepared with the PPG7 program "Indigenous Peoples Demonstrations
Project" or by FUNAI and would be financed by the Brazilian government.
5.3 Component 3 - Endowment Fund. Resources from the endowment fund (FAP) will be used
for financing selected activities in the vicinity (buffer areas) of specific PAs, and thus may benefit
existing indigenous groups in these areas.
5.4 Component 4- Protected Area Monitoring. The monitoring of PAs includes the design of
specific systems to follow up and evaluate human activities within and in the vicinity of selected
PAs.
5.5 Component 5 - Project Coordination and Management. Funds are allocated in this
component for the implementation and functioning of a Conflict Mediation Committee, which
will be composed of government and civil society representation, and will function as a chamber
for solving conflicts involving PAs and people within the scope of ARPA. The Executive
'3 CONAMA, The National Council for the Environment, is the official body that approves all
federal environmental regulations.
141



Coordinator will ensure that the technical preparatory activities for creation of new PAs will
involve site visits to all indigenous nuclei in a given area, in order to promote meetings for
information of the local indigenous groups and to assess their aspirations and grievances. If
indigenous groups exist in the vicinity of a proposed area, direct contact will be established
through FUNAI representatives at the state and local levels, by official means, informing the
indigenous groups of proposed activities and requesting assistance from the indigenous leadership
to designated FUNAI staff in the preparation and implementation of site visits and meetings.
6. Facilitating Access to Funds Outside the Project
The Project Executive Coordinator will assist and facilitate indigenous peoples in gaining access
to funds from other existing projects within the PPG7 program, such as financing and technical
support available for the Demonstrative Projects for Indigenous Peoples (PDPI), which is
bilaterally financed by KfW and other agencies, with counterpart funding from the Brazilian
government.
PDPI is a grant program for indigenous development with three topic lines: (a) indigenous land
protection and monitoring, (b) sustainable economic activities, and (c) cultural revival. PDPI
might support activities in indigenous lands surrounding selected PAs to be consolidated by
ARPA. Existing indigenous peoples in the surroundings of ARPA PAs, who will be assisted by
the Project, will be fully informed on PDPI procedures. Before Project effectiveness, the Project
Coordination Unit will conduct consultations with the PDPI and PPTAL, FUNAI, and other
existing and potential donors to develop a mechanism that ensures the satisfaction of indigenous
peoples' requirements that might arise from implementation of ARPA. Such consultations will be
conducted with appropriate coordination in order to avoid duplication of efforts.
7. Determining Indigenous Peoples Presence
7.1 During proiect preparation. ARPA project design is based on the results of the PROBIO
Macapa workshop that took place in September 1999 for the purpose of defining priority areas for
biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Amazon (see Annexes 13 and 15). The preparatory
phase and the workshop were coordinated by the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), an
organization that works with indigenous causes. This project included indigenous organizations,
such as the Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Rio Negro (FOIRN), Roraima
Indigenous Council (CIR), and the Coordination of Indigenous People of the Brazilian Amazon
(COIAB). Before the workshop, several assessments were undertaken and maps drawn, with
primary focus given to the location and status of indigenous and traditional peoples. The Macapi
workshop generated the priority polygons adopted by ARPA for the establishment of new PAs;
and, based on available data, it provided a preliminary indication that none of the priority
polygons identified by ARPA overlapped with Indigenous Lands, although several would share
boundaries with existing indigenous lands. In addition, during preparation of ARPA, FUNAI's
and IBAMA's official maps were consulted in order to determine which of the existing PAs
would be targeted for consolidation, and to assess one of the selection criteria-the absence of
overlaps or conflicts with indigenous lands (see Annex 14).
7.2 During project implementation. Determining indigenous peoples' presence within or in the
vicinity of PAs, and identifying indigenous land status, will be clarified through: (a) official
consultation with FUJNAI, which will issue an official document regarding the presence or
absence of indigenous groups in the area proposed for creation of a new PA; (b) specific social
142



assessment with indigenous groups and other social groups in and around the proposed area for
creation of a new PA'4; (c) consultation of all relevant government databases; and (d)
consultations with nongovernmental organizations and/or academic organizations, such as the
Brazilian Anthropology Association (ABA), ISA, Center for Indigenous Work (CTI), Missionary
Indigenous Council (CIMI), among others.
It is acknowledged that certifying the presence of isolated indigenous groups without regularized
areas is a bigger challenge than identifying groups in established Indigenous Lands. Additional
research and numerous field visits may be required. ARPA will make every effort to verify the
existence of indigenous peoples in the proposed priority polygons, and to establish whether
indigenous peoples make use of natural resources within the expected perimeter of a proposed
PA.
Eventually, if overlaps of PAs and indigenous lands are identified, the Project will stop any
ongoing activity without regard to the stage of PA implementation, and will redefine procedures,
including the preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Plan for this particular case in order to retain
the original rights of the indigenous peoples.
The ARPA Project will not finance the creation of a new PA that borders an indigenous land until
the land has been officially identified by FUNAI. Also, the preparation of a social assessment (as
described in the footnote) of the groups involved will be needed. The ARPA Project through its
participation in the PPG7 will formalize a Cooperation Agreement with PPTAL and an
Implementation Agreement with the Indigenous Peoples Demonstration Project (PDPI). The
purpose of these agreements is to ensure that these two PPG7 programs can prioritize ARPA' s
activities. An operational agreement will be signed between MMA and FUNAI to collaborate in
the implementation of the strategy laid out in this document and will include, the certification of
no-overlap with Indigenous Lands, to promote the official identification of Indigenous Lands for
the project, the agreements with the principles and means presented in this agreement and that
would be spelled out in the Operational Manual. FUNAI will finance these activities as part of
their regular operations. MMA will coordinate and monitor the execution of the Indigenous
Peoples Plans.
8. Legal Context
The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 provides the legal framework for the recognition of the
indigenous peoples' right to their traditional territories, except for the right to exploit the
subsurface resources.
Indigenous land regularization in Brazil is FUNAI's responsibility. It is a multiphased process to
identify, demarcate, register, and homologate Indigenous Lands. The regularization process of the
land is regulated by decree number 1775 of 1996.
14 For indigenous groups, the social assessment will consist of: identifying the existing ethnic groups in the
area; generating demographic data and maps of areas occupied; direct consultation with the groups in a
culturally appropriate manner; analysis of the indigenous economy and its relationship to the natural
resource base; analysis of the relations with the regional society; analysis of the legal situation of the area;
and analysis of the existing institutional capacity for dealing with indigenous group requirements. Normally
this assessment is conducted by experts (anthropologists or other social scientists) with recognized
knowledge on the region's indigenous groups.
143



Although the Brazilian legislation that established the National Protected Areas System (SNUC,
Law 9985 of July 18, 2000) refers to the cooperation between the PAs and Indigenous Lands, its
regulation has not yet being approved.
In compliance with Article 57 of SNUC, which requires the establishment of a working group of
federal agencies responsible for indigenous and environmental issues, a Working Group has been
created but not formally established. The government has established an advisory working group
linked to the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA) to support this Working Group.
The advisory group is composed of representatives of indigenous organizations, indigenous
peoples, social and environmental experts, as well as of representatives from the Association of
State Environmental Departments (ABEMA).
The SNUC law sets up the legal framework for "traditional peoples"' participation in the
establishment and management of protected areas. This includes local populations' participation
(including the participation of indigenous people) in the creation, implementation, and
management of PAs, and in the establishment of PA Management Councils, including local
communities and buffer zones representatives, among others.
144



ANNEX 17
RESETTLEMENT POLICY AND PROCESS FRAMEWORK FOR ARPA
The Brazilian government is a signatory of the major international conventions limiting and
conditioning compulsory resettlement of populations, resulting in resettlement activities. In
addition, the Brazilian legislation is very restrictive regarding this planning tool, due to public
interest, it is limited to expropriation cases. However, the law that created the SNUC includes the
following provisions: (a) "Article 9,  1`- The Ecological Station is of public property and
dominion, the private areas included inside its limits will be expropriated according to the law";
(b) "Article 10,  1- The Biological Reserve is of public property and dominion, the private areas
included inside its limits will be expropriated according to the law"; (c) "Article 11,  1- The
National Park is of public property and dominion, the private areas included inside its limits will
be expropriated according to the law"; (d) "Article 42 - The traditional populations residing
inside Protected areas in which their presence is not permitted will be indemnified or
compensated for the existing improvements and appropriately resettled by the Public Authority,
in locations and conditions agreed by the parties.  11 The Public Authority, through the suitable
institution, will prioritize the resettlement of the traditional population to be reallocated.  2 Until
it is possible to carry through the resettlement defined by this article, norms and specific actions
will be designed to make the presence of resident traditional populations compatible with the
objectives of the Conservation Unit, without harm to their way of living, their subsistence sources
and their dwelling places, assuring their participation in the definition of these actions and norms.
 3 In the case of  2, the norms regulating the length of residence and its conditions will be
established in the regulations."
Until now, the Brazilian government has almost never used this tool (resettlement) in the process
of creation, implementation, and consolidation of protected areas (PAs). The above-mentioned
SNUC law creates different management categories for PAs that makes it possible to create
mosaics of PAs in which both social and conservation demands are satisfied.
The SNUC law considers the possibility of resettlement arising out of existing social situations in
some PAs created before the enactment of the law; as the status of local populations was not
taken into consideration when boundaries were defined (or, people may have settled inside PAs
after their creation). However, SNUC limits the use of resettlement to "traditional populations";
that is, "people whose livelihood depends on the exploitation of natural resources in systems
developed locally over many generations, and adapted to the local environmental conditions"
(Article 37, item I of the consensual proposal to regulate SNUC). The law also mandates for the
population requirements to be met.
ARPA is one of the Brazilian government major projects to implement SNUC to date. In this
document, principles are stated that will guide Project activities in relation to possible situations
for population resettlement of traditional populations.
1) One of the basic principles adopted by ARPA is the creation, consolidation, and maintenance
of PAs with full involvement by local, regional, and national society. In this sense, the Project
seeks to ensure that mechanisms for traditional, quilombolas, and indigenous peoples'
participation are in place (see Annex 15), and that their representative organizations, interested in
the activities to be developed during project implementation, are able to participate.
145



2) The Project also considers that the existence of populations within the boundaries of the PAs
under implementation and/or consolidation will be a recurrent fact; thus, it will use an important
methodological innovation related to effective participation of society in PAs creation and
management.
3) The Project's strategy of new PAs in a mosaic of different management categories (see Annex
13) is based primarily on the Constitutional prerogative that assures indigenous peoples and
quilombolas permanent occupation and use of their lands. The Project's Institutional
Arrangements (Annex 11) foresee the establishment of a Program Committee with equal
representation from government and civil society, and a Conflict Mediation Committee that will
allow for the application of policies and differentiated tools regarding specific situations of
permanence or eventual resettlement of these populations.
1. Context
ARPA is part of a I 0-year program by the Brazilian government for the establishment and
consolidation of protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon. The first phase of this program (four
years) seeks to protect 18 million hectares with the creation of new PAs (9 million hectares of
"strict protection" PAs and 9 million hectares of "sustainable use" PAs); to consolidate existing
"strict protection" PAs totaling some 7 million hectares, and to establish an endowment fund
(FAP) to finance the recurrent costs of selected PAs of "strict protection" and environmental
control and enforcement of PAs of "sustainable use" (see Annex 2 - Detailed Project
Description). Thus, ARPA would contribute to the implementation of Law 9.985 of July 18,
2000, which created the SNUC, in which PA categories are defined, each with its respective
management system.
The SNUC law distinguishes two main categories of PAs: (a) Strict Protection, the primary
objective of which is conservation, and which stresses a strict protection regime including the
prohibition of productive activities and natural resources exploitation (for example, National
Parks, Biological Reserves, and Ecological Stations); and (b) Sustainable Use, that allow for,the
direct use and exploitation of natural resources within certain conditions agreed upon and defined
in the management plan (for example, Extractive Reserves and Sustainable Use Reserves). The
SNUC law covers federal, state, and municipal PAs, as well as private protected areas.
The federal government's general strategy with ARPA is to create a mosaic of PAs in the
Amazon region in which each PA would correspond to specific priorities for environmental
conservation, as well as to the demands of traditional populations, indigenous groups, and
quilombola'5 populations. Thus, the core premise of the Project is the involvement and active
participation of local populations in light of their importance for the long-term sustainability of
the Protected Area System in the Brazilian Amazon.
This annex deals with resettlement of populations, which eventually might occur with the
implementation of ARPA. Although the SNUC law provides for the resettlement of populations
residing within the limits of "strict protection" PAs, the Ministry of Environment's policy in
designing the Project is to avoid or minimize the need for population resettlement, taking all
necessary measures to refrain from using this tool, whenever possible. Resettlement is considered
as the last resort and it will only be used when all alternatives (mosaic of different categories of
15 The term "quilombolas" refers to traditional populations of African origin, remaining from communities
formed by runaway slaves (quilombos).
146



PAs, redefinition of PA limits, and so forth) have been exhausted and it has been demonstrated
that the presence of traditional populations is incompatible with the objectives of the PA.
2. Principles Adopted by the Project
One of the basic principles adopted by the ARPA is to avoid the establishment of "strict
protection" PAs where traditional populations are present. Therefore, in general, for the new PAs
to be created under ARPA, there will be no need to displace traditional, indigenous, or
quilombolas populations, who will remain in their traditional sites, while their land may be
managed as "sustainable use" PAs or Indigenous Lands.
During the studies phase, in the case of an area under consideration for the establishment of a new
PA, whenever the existence of traditional population, or of isolated groups of indigenous people
or quilombolas, is identified, preference will be given to the creation of a "sustainable use" PA
(see Annex 16 for the case of indigenous peoples). In some situations, where requests have been
made for creation of a new RESEX or RDS in a different location, the government of Brazil may
agree to such request. If the presence of indigenous peoples is detected, MMA or any ARPA
implementer would seek assistance from FUJNAI and if the presence of quilombolas is detected,
Fundacao Palmares would be sought.
In the case of unavoidable need for resettlement of people due to the incompatibility of their
presence with the objectives of biodiversity conservation, the Project's Coordination Unit (PCU)
will prepare (or contract preparation of) a specific plan (Resettlement Plan agreed with the Bank),
based on a social assessment, a cadastre, and an economic valuation of all assets, considering: (a)
the social structure; (b) the economic basis; (c) the affected population's preferences regarding
the new location; (d) the measures necessary to reestablish the economic and social structures; (e)
a timetable of activities; () a defined budget for financing the activities involved; (g) the source
of funds; and (h) the institutions responsible for implementing the required steps and activities.
The preparation and implementation of resettlement plans would be done in accordance with the
directives from INCRA and with the principles and means (i.e. budget, financing, timetable,
institutional arrangements and monitoring and evaluation arrangements) established in the
Operational Manual of ARPA. The preparation and implementation of the resettlement plans will
be financed with the regular budgetary allocations of INCRA.
3. Project Components and their relation to traditional populations
3.1 Component I - Creation of new PAs. Under this component, it is highly unlikely that there
will be involuntary resettlement of traditional populations, quilombolas, or indigenous peoples. If
the presence of one or more of these populations is detected, the Ministry of Environment
(MMA) will propose the creation of Extractive (RESEX) or Sustainable Use (RDS) Reserves, or
the demarcation of remaining quilombos areas, or Indigenous Lands. The existing legal
procedures and the innovative participatory process for selection of new PAs under ARPA will be
applied. Regarding the non-traditional populations, such as gold miners, commercial farmers,
cattle ranchers, and others, IBAMA will develop compensatory activities, on a case-by-case basis
in consultation with the affected populations. Whenever necessary, regarding the small producers,
resettlement procedures will be implemented by INCRA, under a legal agreement to be signed
between MMA/IBAMA and INCRA; the procedures will always be executed in consultation with
the populations affected. In these cases, a resettlement plan would be prepared and implemented
following the methodology described in this document.
147



3.2 Component 2 - Consolidation of PAs. In relation to consolidation of PAs, a Working Group
will be created involving MMA, IBAMA, INCRA, FUNAI, and other interested institutions, in
compliance with Article 42 of the SNUC law and the proposed regulations of this law which were
approved by CONAMA and amended by MMA (see the letter of April 4, 2002, from the Minister
of Environment to the CMU Director in the Project's files). IBAMA will provide the Working
Group a detailed report on the social problems related to the consolidation of existing PAs, within
90 days after a problem is detected. The Working Group will have up to one year to assess the
report, to propose solutions, and, on a case-by-case basis, to undertake supplementary research, as
well as to establish a participatory process for conflict mediation. The Project, in accordance with
the SNUC law and its proposed regulation, and stemming from its Program Committee, may
consider signing a Commitment Term between IBAMA and the concerned populations during
this period as a preliminary and necessary activity for participation in the existing PAs.
The resettlement of traditional populations will only be undertaken (after having exhausted all
other alternatives to avoid it) following the criteria stated above, on a participatory basis and
taking into consideration the social and economic needs of the affected populations. Among the
possibilities to be considered, there is the option of reclassification of a PA of sustainable use
category or to an INCRA sustainable development project (Projetos de Assentamento de
Desenvolvimento Sustentavel. The relocation procedures will always take into consideration the
consultation with the affected populations and the maintenance of the population's social and
economic capacities.
Involuntary resettlement of nontraditional populations-living in the site regardless of legal status
(owners, tenants, and leaseholders among those most likely to be served by the Federal
Government Agrarian Reform Program)-will be undertaken according to legal provisions
through compensation or support to move and settle in another site, based on a legal agreement to
be signed between MMA/IBAMA, and INCRA. These procedures will always take into
consideration the consultation with the affected populations and the maintenance of the
population's social and economic capacities, given that their activities are legal.
3.3 Component 3 - Endowment Fund. Resources from the Endowment Fund (FAP) will be used
for financing selected activities in the vicinity (buffer areas) of specific PAs, and thus benefit
traditional populations in these areas.
3.4 Component 4- PA monitoring. PA monitoring foresees designing of specific systems to
monitor anthropic activities.
3.5 Component 5 - Proiect coordination and management. The Project Coordination will set
aside the appropriated funds for the implementation and functioning of a Conflict Mediation
Committee, which will be composed of government and civil society representation and which
will function as chamber for solving conflicts involving PAs and people within the scope of
ARPA.
4. Creation of New PAs
MMA will use the appropriate legal instruments and the Project's Participatory Consultation
Process for creation of new PAs, ensuring the rights and permanence of indigenous peoples and
148



quilombo communities. It also will meet the demands of traditional populations by creating
"sustainable use" PAs.
5. Resettlement
The principles to be followed by the Project include: (a) to avoid resettlement as much as
possible; (b) to avoid disruption of community life as much as possible; (c) to restore livelihoods
by assuring at least the previously existing standard of living; (d) to ensure the participation of
affected populations in planning and implementation of any resettlement activity; (e) to conduct a
cadastre of affected people before deadline; (f) to carry out a social assessment of the population
affected; (e) to evaluate the different alternatives of resettlement; (g) to ensure proper application
of the eligibility principles outlined below; (h) to assure that resettlement does not take place
before providing agreed alternative compensations; and (i) to carry out adequate monitoring and
evaluation of any such project.
5.1 Affected population size. It is not possible to estimate the size of any populations that will be
affected at this moment because of uncertainties regarding the boundaries of new PAs, possible
reclassification of areas of existing PAs, and so on. Such estimates would be made on a case-by-
case basis through field surveys, social assessments, and broad consultations with affected
peoples. As the goal is to avoid resettlement, as much as possible, it is estimated that very few
people will be actually affected.
5.2 Description of Resettlement Plans preparation and approval process. Assuming that the
options to avoid resettlement have been exhausted, the process would include the following
activities: (a) Preparation and implementation of a legal agreement to be signed by
MMA/IBAMA, and INCRA for preparation and implementation of the Resettlement Plans (the
signature of this agreement is a condition of effectiveness for the Project); (b) Census surveys of
the affected populations including, among others, the data needed for the application of the
eligibility criteria for claims, land tenancy studies including the documentation related to assets
that would be lost (for example, pastures, perennial crops, fences, houses), and the documentation
on community infrastructure that would be lost (for example, schools, churches, football fields,
etc.). The report would include the census data, photographs of houses and other infrastructure
(dimensions, types of buildings, and other features), and the estimated costs for reposition at
current market values; (c) Cut-off date; that is, after concluding the cadastre of affected
populations, it will be widely disseminated that no compensation would be paid for investments
made after that date, and that new families settling in the area after that date would not be eligible
for any compensation or resettlement; (d) Participatory socio-economic studies to supplement
census data, which would include detailed information on livelihood, formal and informal
economic activities and natural resources use, income levels, social-cultural features, local
organizations and assistance, community infrastructure, and existing services such as sanitation,
health, and education, among others; (e) Analytical report on alternative solutions and the
characterization of the resettlement area, including a description and evaluation of the predicted
resettlement area (for example, physical, social, and other conditions); and (f) Definition of
eligibility criteria and compensation packages.
5.3 Eliaibilitv criteria Resettlement criteria would be based on census surveys and on evaluation
of assets with basis on the following table:
Table 17.1 Resettlement Criteria
149



Eligibilitv' -         I ;.. f "Co m                      sation
Property owners with legal titles or regularized land claims  Compensation at market value
with total assets evaluated at prices higher than R$100,000  for land, replacement value for
(one hundred thousand Brazilian Reais)             assets, and moving allowance.
Property owners with legal titles or regularized land claims, Will be entitled to two options:

allowance; or (b) incorporation
into INCRA or another
settlement project in the nearest
possible area, rehabilitation
assistance, and moving
allowance.
Squatters and other temporary dwellers with less than two  Moving allowances and
years' residence, fishermen and hunters with permanent  reference to INCRA for
residences outside the area.                       inclusion in other settlement

conditions of the affected
population.
Gold miners and lumberjacks.                       Moving allowances.
* It is understood that many of the populations that fit this category are considered traditional
populations by MMA and, therefore, their demands could be accommodated by creating new PAs
of sustainable use, without the need for resettlement.
5.4 Organizational procedures for delivery of entitlements. IBAMA would address the
compensation process and, if a resettlement tool were needed, an agreement among MMA,
IBAMA, and INCRA would be signed. Areas to receive resettled families would be identified and
ranked according to the preferences of beneficiaries; proximity to the current residences; adequate
soils, water and other natural resources; and the availability of services such as health posts,
transportation, schools, and so forth. Affected families would have an opportunity to visit
proposed sites and to participate in planning of housing, services, etc.
6. Compensation Related to Natural Resources Access Limitation
There are a number of scenarios where local populations might lose access to use and exploitation
of natural resources to which they previously had access: (a) neighboring population (outside
demarcated PAs) relying on natural resources, such as game, fish, and plant materials inside the
PA to which they would no longer have access; (b) studies point to the need to limit unsustainable
natural resources uses in the PA buffer zone, such as harvesting of endangered stocks of fish or
plants; and (c) local residents are engaged in unsustainable or illegal natural resource practices
(for example, the sale of wild fauna) that would be limited or prohibited under a new
Management Plan.
The access limitation described in the three scenarios above would be addressed within the
framework of the management plans that would be prepared and implemented for the PAs that
are part of the Project
6.1 Characterization of local communities and PAs. As stated previously, the vast majority of the
150



local communities throughout the Amazon-and especially the most vulnerable populations-
practice mixed agricultural and extractive activities that, similar to many indigenous peoples, are
based on traditional environmental knowledge and are of relatively low environmental impact,
hence, they are largely sustainable. MMA does not intend to provide compensation for the loss of
access to illegally obtained natural resources. However, it may seek to provide sustainable
alternatives to such activities that will serve to discourage activities such as fishing, hunting, or
capturing wild species for sale where prohibited.
6.2 Eligibilitv criteria for affected populations. Persons considered eligible for compensation or
assistance for loss of access to natural resources from the creation or consolidation of PAs would
include those identified in the aforementioned surveys, with special attention provided to the most
vulnerable populations (including, among others, low income, landless, the elderly, women and
children). Local people whose living does not depend on natural resources use (for example,
shopkeepers, teachers, and so forth) as well as illegal users of natural resources would not be
eligible. Merchants or artisans dealing in legally obtained natural commodities may be eligible.
6.3 Measures to assist affected populations. Nonphysical resettlement under the Project would be
addressed by two major methods: (i) first, by means of the participatory management plans to be
formulated for the PA and its buffer zone, and for reserves; and (ii) by financing alternative
income-generating activities for local buffer zone populations.
a. In the case of recently established "sustainable use" PAs, it is expected that the participatory
approach would facilitate the following: (1) The participation of neighboring communities in
the Management Plan design for the environmental protected area; (2) Local stakeholders'
participation in the Management Plan for the buffer zone; and in particular cases; and (3)
Joint-management arrangements between PAs officers and local communities through the
PAs Management Councils. Local government and stakeholders' representatives will
compose PAs Management Councils, mandatory under SNUC. During the preparation of the
Management Plans, resources management alternative regimes or other alternative economic
activities would be identified for proper compensation due to limitations on the access to
natural resources. Finally, the decision on management routines in the PAs and in the buffer
zones would be taken by experts, but no losses of legally obtained resources will be allowed
in the Project without due compensation through alternative income generation, culturally
and socially appropriated activities.
b. The Management Plans could, as appropriate, identify and promote income-generating
activities and training activities designed to offset prohibitions on the use of PA resources or
possible restrictions on certain types of exploitation in the buffer zones. These could include
support for fish farming, game farming, handicraft training, and other forms of support and
training. MMA also would facilitate access by buffer zone populations to other public and
private sector financing sources for improved natural resource use and management, and
income generation.
c. Last, extractive or sustainable development reserve populations would have the responsibility
primarily in designing the Management Plans, which would take into account both social and
conservation goals, including the need to maintain and improve life conditions of the
populations.
6.4 Legal basis for restrictions on use of resources. The federal, state, and municipal
governments have the Constitutional authority, and through the SNUC law, to establish by decree
areas in which restrictions on the use of natural resources is enforced.
151



6.5 Monitoring and Evaluation: The Program Committee, through reports and analyses prepared
by the PCU, would carry out the monitoring of the activities related to this annex. With respect to
the resettlement of small producers affected by ARPA, the PCU could contract out independent
evaluations by qualified specialists that would be responsible for verifying that the affected
population could re-establish their income and subsistence and has identified other means to
reach their objectives. These evaluations would be carried out within a reasonable time after the
resettlement so that, if needed, measures to correct possible problems can be taken. Monitoring
would also be done for activities that limit access to resource use.
152



ANNEX 18
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
Environmental Category: B (Analysis provided through this Annex of the PAD)
The goal of ARPA is to support the protection of certain types of protected areas under the
recently passed SNUC legislation. This law defines the different categories of protected areas that
constitute the Protected Areas System, and characterizes the management rules that apply to each
type of protected area. ARPA will support protected areas that have a clear goal of conserving
and protecting biodiversity; this includes: National Parks, Ecological Reserves (strict use
protected areas), and Extractive Reserves and Sustainable Development Reserves (indirect use
reserves) that also have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the communities
living in them.
The overall strategy of the Brazilian government is to create a mosaic of protected areas in the
Amazon region, where the design of protected areas responds to the specific environmental and
social conditions of each area. In this manner, and because the identification of new protected
areas and the definition of their category will be done through the combination of
scientific/technical information as well as socio-economic information, the ultimate design and
implementation will be more socially and ecologically sustainable in the long term.
ARPA will not support the creation of Indigenous Reserves and National Forest Reserves; these
have been supported under the PPG7 pilot program. Unlike Extractive Reserves, commercial
logging operations are allowed in National Forest Reserves. In Extractive Reserves, community
forestry has been only recently allowed under the newly passed SNUC law. ARPA will
coordinate closely with these projects to ensure that the mosaic of protected areas is designed for
the Amazon region. The regulation of the SNUC law is currently being drafted. Since it is not
complete, the Brazilian government has prepared the rules that ARPA will operate under in
applying environmental and forestry safeguards (see below). These will be spelled out in the
Project Operational Manual. If the Regulation passes before the end of ARPA, the Operational
Manual could be revised to apply the new rules.
1. Project Activities Where the Environmental and Forestry Safeguards Could Apply
The Project will not support activities that could seriously harm the environment. In Component
1, the identification and create of new protected areas will be supported. This activity does not
have any impact on the environment. The social impact of the activities of Component 1 are
discussed in Annexes 16 and 17. Under Component 2, the consolidation of Parks and Reserves
will be supported. However, ARPA will not participate in the consolidation of Extractive
Reserves and Sustainable Use reserves. These have been taken care of by other PPG7 and
government programs. According to the Law, Parks and Ecological Reserves have a very
restrictive use and, therefore, no environmental harm is expected from the project activities. The
management of the buffer areas around the parks and reserves under this component (Component
2) could support a limited number of sustainable-use activities for the communities living around
the Park. These will be screened for environmental impacts (see next section on details of this
process). In Component 3, two major activities are expected: (a) Pilot projects to test income-
generating activities for PAs; (b) Endowment Fund that will support the recurrent activities of
PAs. The Endowment Fund will draw funds to pay for the recurrent activities of Parks and
153



Extractive Reserves. Under this component, screening procedures will be observed to ensure that
the recurrent activities and pilot subprojects do not violate any of the Bank safeguard policies;
rules will be applied. But no or minimal environmental impact is expected from the activities of
Component 3.
2. Procedures to Observe the Environmental and Forestry Policy Safeguards
2.1 Natural Habitats Policy OP4.404. BP 4.04. ARPA has no impact on the Natural Habitat
policy, since the goals of ARPA are actually to protect Natural Habitats.
2.2 Environmental Policy OP 4.01. BP 4.01. The subprojects in the buffer zones of PAs could
support sustainable activities with minimum environmental impact. These sustainable-use
activities could be supported under Components 2 and 3 of ARPA. These activities need to
strengthen the conservation activities of the protected area and would be identified in the context
of the Management Plans. No disbursements for sustainable-use activities would be done until the
management plans for the areas have been approved. Once they have been identified, proposals
would be prepared to request funding from ARPA. Proposals for these subprojects would be
submitted to the Program Committee (PC), which would assess their value and would identify
whether they are eligible for ARPA funding; if they are not eligible, the PC could recommend
other funding sources. The proposals would include a section on the environmental issues of the
activities and explain how they either have no irnpact or, if they have impact, how these will be
mitigated. IBAMA or the state environmental agency, depending on whether it is a federal or
state PA, will screen for the environmental impact of these proposals before they go to the PC for
final approval. Eligibility criteria would be included in the Project Operational Manual. The
screening will be performned according to the list of eligible activities listed below. It is worth
mentioning that the Management Plans that will be required to include a zoning plan that takes
into account the ecological fragility and biological importance of different zones within the PA,
as well as the uses that are permitted within each zone. IBAMA, or the state environmental
agency, will also ensure that the proposed sustainable-use activities adhere to the zoning
proposal. Finally, no roads will be built in the PAs with any of the project funds.
Because FUNBIO will support the implementation of pilot subprojects under Component 3,
FUNBIO will be responsible for the screening of any of the environmental impacts of the
proposals for sustainable-use activities, following the same mechanism described above.
The protected areas endowment fund will support recurrent activities in a limited number of PAs.
The eligibility criteria have been defined and they include, among other requirements, that the PA
has an approved management plan.
2.3 Forestry Policy OP 4.36. In Extractive Reserves, community forestry has been allowed only
recently under the newly passed SNUC law. Community forestry was not allowed in Extractive
Reserves before the passing of this law. RPA will ensure that any activity of this type is done
according to the Bank's Forestry Policy. In the SNUC law, Article 7 says that the exploration of
timber resources in Extractive Reserves will only be permitted under sustainable schemes and in
special circumstances, and should be complementary to the other activities developed within the
extractive reserve, according to the dispositions in the regulations and based on the management
plan from the Reserve. (7A exploraQdo comercial de recursos madeireiros s6 serd admitida em
bases sustentdveis e em situa,des especiais e complementares as demais atividades desenvolvidas
na Reserva Extrativista, conforme o disposto em regulamento e no Plano de Manejo da unidade.)
154



To ensure that the Forestry Policy is applied, the following has been agreed:
a. Bank's review of Management Plans under Component 1: The unit at IBAMA responsible for
overseeing the Extractive Reserves is CNPT. Any Extractive Reserve cannot undergo use
before a management plan is approved. Management plans for Extractive Reserves will be
supported under ARPA. ARPA coordination will ensure that these management plans are
developed according to IBAMA's rules. Management plans will follow similar guidelines
(Roteiro Metodologico do IBAA1) in preparation as the management plans used by DIREC
for Parks and Reserves. The management plan will consist of four major sections: Utilization
plan, Development plan, Business plan, and Duration. Detailed guidelines of these
management plans for Extractive Reserves will be included in the Operational Manual. A
study carried out by CNPT shows that in the past, Extractive Reserves have the potential to
generate income from activities such as rubber, nuts, ecotourism, timber, and environmental
services,. The management plans will discuss all of the alternatives. In the Extractive
Reserves implemented by CNPT, the management of timber is executed as an artcraft more
than for the selling of whole logs. The management plans are prepared by the communities
living in the areas and are approved by IBAMA. If the communities request timber extraction
as part of a larger program of utilization of the Reserve, the section of the utilization plan
would include, among other things, species inventories, mode of extraction, quantity,
reforestation procedures and, if available, certification schemes planned.
The procedures explained above are described in greater detail in Annex 18 and will be part
of the Implementation Letter. If the regulation of the SNUC law is passed and the new
regulation changes the guidelines that apply currently to preparation of management plans,
the Bank will revise the context of the new regulation and its effect on the current project,
and if necessary, request the Brazilian government to modify the procedures spelled out in the
Implementation Letter.
b. Eligible activities under Component 3: Once the management plans of Extractive Reserves
are approved by the Program Committee and IBAMA, and they are reviewed by the Bank,
some Extractive Reserves might become eligible to receive funds from the Endowment Fund.
The activities eligible have been limited to surveillance and enforcement activities in the
intangible area of the Reserve. Additional eligibility criteria would be applied to select an
Extractive Reserve for funding. The eligibility criteria are: (1) approved management plan;
(2) local inhabitants' association of the Reserve created; (3) cadastre of the Reserve
population completed; (4) the Local Advisory Committee established; (5) have an approved
POA; (6) the PA needs to have at least 90 percent of its original forest cover; and (7) has
fulfilled all the Bank safeguards.
3. Monitoring and evaluation
The M&E program for ARPA (Component 4) includes detailed indicators on changes in land uses
and ecosystem health as well as indicator species and social indicators. The M&E system is
designed to give early warning to managers of protected areas to permit mitigating actions. The
indicators will fully reflect the Project and the EMP. The M&E program will assist and guide the
development of activities to be permitted in the parks and reserves.
Category B project is intended to be entirely positive from an environmental standpoint,
particularly by promoting the conservation of biodiversity in protected natural areas.
155



4. Capacity Building in Environmental Assessment
Workshops will be held with Directors and staff of the protected areas of the project to improve
their capacity to evaluate environmental impacts, implement the legislation, and design mitigation
measures. They also will be given an opportunity to improve on the checklist of activities that
will require environmental assessments and activities that should not be permitted, as well as the
methods for implementing the checklists to ensure that the rules reflect the practical need in the
field.

Environmnental assessment for activity types a and b will be done through a checklist, because
they are not expected to have any significant negative impacts on the environment or biodiversity.
Project activities of type c, marked with *, include those that may have low or significant
environmental impacts. These will receive a more thorough screening and, if needed, preparation
of full documentation to be presented to the responsible agencies in accordance with the SNUC
law. The Environmental Assessment or the Management Plan needed to obtain authorization
previous to the development of the Project, shall be financed by the Bank. The remaining
activities of type c are not expected to have any negative impacts.
In order to determine the projects that may be implemented in the natural protected areas through
SINAP II, an analysis of different documents was carried out.
One of the documents was World Bank Operational Policies and Directives, the primary
objective of which is to ensure that Bank operations do not cause adverse impacts and that they
"do not harm." The projects were screened according to these safeguard policies, in order to
exclude the project that the Bank would not support, or to apply the environment policies and
procedures to prevent environmental impacts. These policies are listed below:

ANNEX 19
STAP TECHNICAL REviEW
STAP Reviewer Comments
Kenton Miller, Ph.D.
Vice President, World Resources Institute, and
Chair, World Commission on Protected Areas
1. Key Issues
a. Scientific and technical soundness of the project. The methodology of the project proposal
is drawn from tested and peer-reviewed approaches to the design and selection of protected
areas, including the establishment of site priorities (Annex 13). The analysis of
socioeconomic data, and threats for the regions of the Amazon, are explicit and particularly
helpful. Similarly, for the consolidation of existing PAs, Annex 14 provides a solid
methodology for addressing a fundamental task of the Project. Other dimensions of the
Project, such as methods for participation and engagement of local communities and
indigenous peoples, are likewise sound technically.
b. Identification of the Global Environmental Benefits and/or Drawbacks of the Project.
The global benefits center on the preservation of biodiversity in the Amazon Basin, the
richest set of ecoregions in the world. An extensive system of protected areas represents the
most strategic approach for this purpose. What is learned in this endeavor will be of value
beyond the immediate set of sites of the Project, including surround regions of Brazil, and
also neighboring countries in the Basin. Naturally, with the preservation of such an extensive
forest cover, there will be significant global benefit vis-a-vis watershed values and carbon
storage in the biomes.
c. How the Project Fits within the Context of the Goals of the GEF, as well as its
Operational Strategies, Programme Priorities, GEF Council Guidance and the
Provisions of the Relevant Conventions. The project design fits with the goals, strategies,
and priorities related to forest biomes, biodiversity, water, and carbon sequestration. Most
specifically, it supports CBD Article 8 a, b, and j.
d. Regional Context. As explained, the Amazon ecosystems are subject to rapid transformation
into agriculture, forestry, and infrastructure development. Many of the new crops are farmed
as monocultures (soy), and employ extensive agrochemicals and cropping methods that will
have major impact on surrounding natural species, populations, and communities. Thus,
efforts to preserve examples of the biodiversity of each ecoregion will have to involve
relatively large geographic spaces (500,000 hectares and above), and these spaces have to be
connected by biological corridors to insure against isolation and excessive fragmentation of
forest cover.
e. Replicability of the Project. The lessons learned from applying the proposed methods can
be expected to serve the design and management of Pas elsewhere in the Amazon region and
161



neighboring ecoregions, such as the Guyana Shield, upper Parana, and lowland Bolivia and
Paraguay. Furthermore, if these lessons learned are made available, they can be of value
beyond Brazil, including in the Congo Basin. Of particular interest will be the lessons
gathered from the social and institutional aspects of the work, including participation, local
communities, and indigenous peoples.
f. Sustainability of the Project. Steps have been taken in project design to ensure its
sustainability, including funding mechanisms that remain as a legacy to the 10-year program
cycle. By working with the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund, for example, the project establishes a
long-term financing mechanism. The stakeholders with the greatest self-interest in the areas
are fully engaged in the design and execution of the project. Power is decentralized to local
stakeholder groups. The blend of both strict PAs and sustainable-use reserves provide ways to
both protect biodiversity and options for the direct use of goods and services of the managed
ecosystems.
2. Secondary Issues
a. Linkages to Other Focal Areas. The Project can be expected to provide significant value to
water and watershed conservation, and to carbon sequestration. Depending upon the exact
location of the PAs in the system, further values can be anticipated from bio-prospecting,
agricultural and pharmaceutical improvements, and ecotourism.
b. Linkages to Other Programs and Action Plans at Regional or Subregional Level. The
Project links fully with the Brazilian Rain Forest Pilot Program, the endeavor to recognize
indigenous land claims, and the Program for Prevention and Control of Burnings and Forest
Fires. It also ties into the upper watersheds of the Pantanal, and the planned downstream
development programs.
c. Other Beneficial or Damaging Environmental Effects. The model and methods proposed
for application in the Project will be of particular interest to PA managers and policy makers
around the world, especially from forest regions. This is a test of various aspects of PAs
management, particularly at such large scales. Also, it represents perhaps some of the most
advanced methods and approaches regarding the role and relationship of indigenous peoples
to biodiversity conservation.
d. Degree of Involvement of Stakeholders in the Project. The participatory approach (Annex
15), indigenous peoples development plan (Annex 16), resettlement framework (Annex 17),
and the main text (p. 33) suggest some of the most advanced methods for stakeholder
involvement. The project is to be praised for such an extensive commitment to this aspect of
the work.
e. Capacity Building Aspects. There is very little mention of capacity building per se in the
proposal document. While there is considerable work on institutional development, funding
mechanisms, and planning, the human factor appears to play a minor role. This is perhaps the
greatest weakness of the proposal. How will staff of the related institutions learn by doing the
various tasks of the project methods? How many will be involved? How will the new staff to
manage the consolidated and new PAs be recruited and prepared for their responsibilities? It
is not a simple matter of training or participating, but of learning through engagement in these
central components of the management effort.
162



f. Innovativeness of the Project. The project is very innovative. The methods on PA
consolidation and the participation of the communities and indigenous groups are particularly
noteworthy. A good case in point is on p. 47, regarding the establishment of new PAs with
consultation and participation including the resolution of land tenure conflicts. The idea that
indigenous land claims come first, prior to designation of PAs, is novel.
Bank's Response to STAP Reviewer's Comments
The Bank wishes to thank the STAP reviewer for all the positive comments received. Regarding
the only concern raised by the reviewer on the need to ensure a stronger capacity building
element to the project, the Bank team has included additional training activities in different
components. Component 2 has a training sub-component to strengthen the PAs personnel and
partners in the following areas of expertise: PA management, conflict resolution techniques, fund
raising, accounting, reporting, etc.. Component 4 has included training activities in monitoring
and evaluation and Component 5 has included training in procurement and financial management.
In addition, only recently, GTZ has agreed to provide technical assistance to the project in the
following areas of expertise: institutional strengthening, technical issues of PA management,
monitoring and evaluation and financial management.
