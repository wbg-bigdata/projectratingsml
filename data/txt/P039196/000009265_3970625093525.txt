STATE REFORM PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. COUNTRY AND STATE BACKGROUND
Country Context
1.1   Brazil's public sector is highly decentralized. Its government is comprised of the
Federal Government, 26 state governments, a federal district, and approximately 4,300
local governments or municipalities. Approximately half of budgetary public expenditures
are made by sub-national governments. Democratizafion and constitutional revisions in
the 1 980s increased the degree of resources under sub-national control, and the degree of
local political autonomy in their allocation. Federal transfers to states and municipalities --
as well as state transfers to municipalities -- have also increased.
1.2   Through the last decades, intergovernmental relations have suffered considerable
strain. This has been exacerbated by recent resource constraints at both the national and
state level, as well as the unclear jurisdictions set forth in the Constitution. Despite their
findamental importance to macroeconomic policy formulation and implementation, state
finances have historically operated semi-independently of the Federal Govermnent, driven
by their own tax bases, formula-driven transfers and borrowing. While states have
enjoyed federal bailouts or emergency loans when financial troubles arose, the relationship
between these two branches of government has not been smooth. In spite of the lack of
clarity in the division of responsibilities, many services such as elementary and secondary
education, health care, water, electricity and roads are increasingly being provided by sub-
national governments.
1.3   The performance of state and local governments is a source of concern for both
micro- and macroeconomic reasons. From a microeconomic perspective, it is believed
that the efficiency of large volume of resources allocated to them could be improved; i.e.,
staff productivity could be increased, and the economic soundness of investments and the
design of programs could be improved. This concern was exacerbated by the 1988
Constitution, which augmented the resources available to state and local government by
increasing the scale of federal revenue sharing and reassigning taxes to them. From a
macroeconomic perspective, the indebtedness of the Brazilian states has reached crisis
proportions, posing a serious threat to macroeconomic stability.

Recent Country Economic Policies and Developments
1.4   The most prominent feature of Brazil's recent economic history has been chronic
and rising inflation. Monthly inflation peaks of 80 percent and 50 percent were reached in
1990 and 1994, respectively. Large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits and an over-extended
public sector were major factors underlying this phenomenon. Inflation at these levels
slowed growth and investment, distorted the pattern of economic activities and
exacerbated the maldistribution of income. Successive stabilization plans were introduced
in the 1980s--most of them with price and wage freeze components--but these were
successful in containing prices only for very limited periods of time.
1.5   In mid-1994, when Minister of Finance in the prior Itamar Franco administration,
now-President Cardoso introduced the Real stabilization plan. This plan included an initial
fiscal and wage adjustment, an exchange rate anchor (modified later in 1995, and made
less rigid) and tight monetary policy. The plan has had remarkable success. Annual
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation fell from 929 percent in 1994 to 22 percent in 1995
and to about 10 percent in 1996. The balance of payments also remains strong. Gross
international reserves have continued to accumulate, reaching US$60 billion by November
1996, or 11 months of imports of goods and nonfactor services. This has occurred despite
a weakening of the current account deficit to around 3.0 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP). These positive outcomes for inflation and the balance of payments appear
set to continue in the medium term.
1.6   Concomitant with the Real stabilization plan, the Cardoso government introduced
a wide range of structural reforms. These include a new concessions law, the abolition of
state monopolies in petroleum and telecommunications1, and the abolition of the
distinction between Brazilian and foreign companies. In order to accommodate these
changes, however, the Constitution needed to be amended. The Cardoso government is
also continuing the privatization program initiated in 1991, and trade liberalization within
the Mercosul common market. There are further constitutional amendments being
considered for reforms of the social security system, administrative rules and taxation.
These reforms are critical to bringing about an enduring fiscal adjustment, without which a
low inflation regime cannot be sustained.
1.7   Since Brazil is a highly decentralized federation, complementary reforms are
needed at the state level. In 1996, state and local governments' operational deficits
totaled 2.7 percent of GDP, or about half the consolidated public sector operational
deficit. The average tax/GDP ratio in Brazil is already high, so adjustments are best made
largely through a reduction in expenditure and, more broadly, through a reduction in the
direct role of the state in non-essential areas. Privatization of state-owned banks, sources
of quasi-fiscal losses in the past, is especially important. Annex A provides a further
discussion of macroeconomic policies and prospects.
The breaking of the monopolies does not imply privatization. However, it implies that the state does
not have to authorize only publicly-owned companies to operate in the relevant areas.

The Urgency of State Reform, State Debt Crisis and Links to the Macroeconomy
1.8   The urgency of state reform has increased with the Real stabilization plan, which
had a major and somewhat unexpected impact on state finances, and, consequently, on the
consolidated finances of the government. A tightening of monetary policy as part of the
plan led to an increase in average annual real overnight interest rates from 19.5 percent in
1993 to 21.8 percent in 1994 and 25.5 percent in 1995. Much state debt was at fixed
interest rates; only state bonds had variable interest rates. As a result, about half a dozen
states with significant bonds outstanding became unable to service them at such high
interest rates. The indebtedness of the Brazilian states now poses a threat to
macroeconomic stability. The states' debt was about US$86.5 billion in May 1996, and
they were in default on roughly half of it. With the states in default, the stock of debt
continues to grow in accordance with domestic interest rates. Three quarters of this debt
is in the hands of the Federal Government and its agents--the Central Bank, Caixa
Econ6mica Federal, and the Banco do Brazil. Most of it is owed by the economically
most important states in the country. Rio Grande do Sul (RGS) owed Rs. $8.2 billion in
June 1996 (Table 2.1), or about 10 percent of the total state debt.
1.9   State-level financial problems were also exacerbated by the 1994 elections and
transition to new governments. The outgoing administrations spent liberally and ran up
arrears to contractors and suppliers. The new administrations tried to refinance these
debts through short-term loans, payable in one year, but were unable to pay them off in
the face of continually rising interest rates. Another past mechanism of internal financial
control had been the ability of the state governments to reduce real salaries and payments
via inflation; this mechanism was no longer available in 1995. Moreover, since inflation
rates fell faster than expected at the time of the nominal wage increase in May 1995, the
state governments ended up paying more in real terms than projected. By 1996, many
states were undergoing fiscal crises. Even when they deferred paying much of their debt
and began cutting capital outlays drastically, they still had insufficient funds to pay wages.
1.10 The Federal Government faces a difficult choice. Forcing the defaulting states into
bankruptcy could have a crippling effect on the national economy and the financial system.
On the other hand, allowing the state debt to keep growing would have equally adverse
consequences. The various entities of the Federal Government, the creditors of the states,
have in turn financed the debt through domestic borrowing. If the states do not pay their
debt, the Federal Government would have to dramatically reduce its own spending, raise
taxes, or resort to inflationary financing.
1.11  To address these debt issues, the states are currently discussing debt workout
programs with the Federal Government. RGS has already agreed on a debt workout. The
terms of the agreement are discussed in paragraph 2.9.
1.12  Furthermore, the vicious cycle of higher interest payments and larger deficits
leading to yet higher public borrowing requirements and higher interest rates needs to be
broken through a comprehensive program of state structural and fiscal reform.

State Structural and Fiscal Reforms and Links to the Bank Assistance Strategy to
Brazil
1.13  Important to the success of the Real Plan are reforms by the states, such as those
being pursued by RGS. The major Brazilian states, including RGS, are not poor. They
have diverse, robust economies and a tax instrument -- the ICMS -- capable of extracting
revenue. But they could be managed better. Budgets are exhausted in paying the salaries
of a large civil service, on subsidies, and on politically-motivated capital works. It would
appear that the majority of states could service much of their debt if they made a more
rational use of the resources at their command. Major reforms are needed if this potential
is to be realized. Given the predominant role of the states in Brazil's public sector, major
privatization of public services and improvements in state management for those services
that remain a state prerogative would have demonstrable effects on the efficiency and
responsiveness of the public sector as a whole.

1.14   State and local governments have large financing requirements which the Federal
Government and federal banks have been forced to meet. In 1995, these stemmed from:
(i) large operational deficits, which reached 2.5 percent of GDP in 1995; (ii) the need to
refinance short term bonds (around 4.5 percent of GDP) due to domestic private creditors
who withdrew credit to state governments in light of deteriorating creditworthiness; and
(iii) deficits and bad debts in state-owned commercial banks. Reducing state government
financing requirements is essential for consolidating the stabilization program.

1.15  The more immediate concern is a macroeconomic one. Table 1.1 gives the
consolidated public sector deficit in Brazil during the 1991-96 period, broken down by
level of government. Given the high level of inflation prevalent prior to 1995, the primary
and operational measures of the deficit are more relevant for purposes of comparison than
the nominal deficit (the PSBR). A prominent feature in the data is the sharp deterioration
in the fiscal stance of the state and local governments in 1995 and 1996. The primary
surplus of 0.86 percent of GDP in 1994 changed to a growing deficit in 1995 and 1996.
The corresponding shift in the operational deficit was even more significant, from about
0.5 percent of GDP to 2.7 percent. More than half of the consolidated deficit in 1996
was due to the state and local governments.
1.16  The principal reason behind the deterioration in the primary balance at all levels of
government in 1995 was an increase in wages. Generous wage increases were conceded
by the outgoing governments at both federal and state levels towards the end of 1994,
some of it representing a recovery in real levels. These wage increases were reinforced by
fresh increases in the number civil servants in early 1995. At the federal level, for
instance, the wage bill grew by 30 percent in real terms in 1995. At the time, the
expectation was that much of the nominal increase would be eroded by inflation as has
usually been the case in Brazil. However, inflation was much less than expected in 1995
and the real gains persisted. Non-wage current expenditures also rose in 1995, partly
reflecting a spillover from contracts agreed to at the end of 1994, an election year.
1.17  At the same time, the operational deficit worsened even more because of the high
interest rates that prevailed in 1995. The real average annual overnight rate in 1995 was
26 percent relative to 22 percent in 1994. The Government adopted a policy of tight
control over base money in order to contain inflation. Together with a relaxed fiscal
stance, this implied growing internal public debt. Internal debt as a percentage of GDP
rose from 20.3 percent at end-1994 to 29.9 percent at end-October 1996.
1.18  Continuing high fiscal deficits financed by debt are incompatible with stabilization
in the long run, even though Brazil's overall net debt to GDP ratio of 34.2 percent is
relatively low by international standards. Accordingly, adjustment is planned at both the
federal and state levels.
1.19  Federal civil servants received no wage increase in 1996. A number of states have
signed loan agreements with Federal financial institutions promising to adhere to this
guideline. Interest rates declined temporarily during mid-1996. The overnight rate
declined to below 10 percent in real terms during May-July 1996 and averaged 16.4
percent for 1996. Nevertheless, the consolidated operational deficit remained at 4.3
percent of GDP during 1995 and 1996. At the level of the state and local governnents, the
primary deficit worsened from 0.18 percent of GDP in 1995 to 1.0 percent of GDP in
1996.
1.20 The overall primary balance deteriorated from the 0.4 percent of GDP surplus
achieved in 1995 to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP. The operational deficit remained
constant at 4.8 percent of GDP. Bank projections indicate that this level of deficit can be
financed internally without danger to economic stability, even though it will lead to some
rise in the debt to GDP ratio.



6
1.21  During 1994-1996, state and local governments as a whole had an increasing
operational deficit. In the case of the larger states, Rio de Janeiro, RGS, Minas Gerais and
Sao Paulo, the operational deficit was driven by the high interest payments on their debt in
the form of bonds. In November 1996, total outstanding bonds (net of state treasury
holdings) amounted to Rs.$49.0 billion. Of these, 37.5 percent were liabilities of Sao
Paulo, 17.6 percent of Minas Gerais, 13.1 percent of RGS and 11.9 percent of Rio de
Janeiro. This profile provides the justification for the initial concentration of Bank lending
for state reform to the large south and south-eastern states of Brazil.
1.22  The World Bank strategy envisages assistance in three, and possibly up to five
states. This approach confronts the macroeconomic problem by developing reform
programs in a critical mass of the larger states that help bring down the consolidated
public sector deficit to a level consistent with sustainable price stability and reasonable
interest rates. These reform programs should help contain the fiscal deficit during the 1997
-1999 period.
RGS Economic Development
1.23  RGS' economic development is above Brazil's average. Its per capita income was
US$3.280 in 1995, ranking fifth in Brazil and exceeding Brazil's average by 19.6 percent.
It accounts for 7.5 percent of Brazil's GDP, 12.2 percent of exports, and 6.2 percent of
the country's population. RGS' industrial value added amounted to 32 percent of its GDP
in 1993 (compared with Brazil's average of 39 percent), with strongest development in
manufacturing of capital and durable consumer goods. Nevertheless, recent economic
growth has been disappointing. Like Brazil's, the state's annual per capita income growth
averaged about 1 percent per year during the 1980s and early 1990s. GDP per capita
growth was 1.5 percent in 1994, -1.5 percent in 1995, and is expected to reach only about
1.5 percent in 1996. This recent performance has been below the average for Brazil.
RGS Public Sector Background
1.24  Weak public administration has led to a waste of resources that resulted in
financial distress for the public sector and poor delivery of public sector services. The
most dramatic evidence of weak public administration has been excessive employment and
wages in the state that resulted in labor expenses of 82 percent of disposable revenues
(i.e., net of transfers to the municipalities) in 1995 -- with 37 percent of the wage bill spent
on retiree benefits --, thereby undermining the state's capacity to undertake investment.
Other important symptoms of weak public administration include poor tax collection,
expanding indebtedness to finance uncontained expenditures, inadequate funding of
pension and survivorship benefits, no allocation of responsibilities for the delivery of
public education and health, poor road maintenance, and low productivity in the delivery
of ports services.
1.25  The financial performance of public enterprises has not been good. Furthermore,
state ownership of these enterprises has constrained private sector investment and led to a
deterioration of the quantity and quality of services delivered in those sectors. The state
has virtually monopolized delivery of power, telephone and water services. The state also



7
has ownership interests in financial sector enterprises, including two commercial banks, an
insurance company, and a warehouse. The state also retains a significant role in the
operation of ports services. In most or all of these enterprises the lack of profit-
maximizing objectives has led to excessive employment, financial distress, and poorly
provided services.



2. RGS STATE REFORM PROGRAM
2.1   RGS is strategically positioned to take advantage of trade creation under the
Mercosul common market. This condition will challenge the State's economy to become
more efficient so as to be able to compete under more open trade relations. As discussed
above, RGS' economic development has been insufficient to improve average economic
welfare or reduce poverty. Expanded growth will require an improvement in
competitiveness. RGS' Government is presently in a position to undertake important
reforms in pursuit of improved growth and competitiveness. Under the leadership of a
strong reform-minded Governor, the Government has demonstrated unusual ability to
obtain parliamentary approval of far-reaching changes, despite a heterogeneous
representation in parliament and federal constitutional restrictions. The present Governor
was elected following a second round of elections and the Government's majority in
parliament remains an alliance of about five parties' where consensus building is not easy.
Federal constitutional restrictions, including mandated stability of the civil service and
excessive pension benefits, have also constrained the scope of reforms. Nonetheless, the
state's track record of approved reforms has been good (only two major defeats and over
one hundred approvals), and the present combination of a reform minded Governor and a
majority coalition provide an exceptional window of opportunity to undertake many of the
changes that the state requires to improve its economic performance.
2.2   RGS' economic strategy focuses on addressing two problems that undermine the
state's economic development: a deterioration of infrastructure and a deterioration of the
public sector. To address these problems, the Government seeks to encourage private
sector investment and improve the performance of the public sector. RGS' State Reform
Program, covering public finance and debt, administrative reform, and
privatization/concessions, has been designed to strengthen the state financially and foster
investment in strategic sectors. The Government has described its program in the Reform
Program Letter (Annex A of MOP). The remaining sections of this chapter discuss this
program.

Partido da Frente Liberal (PFL), Partido Progressista Brasileiro (PPB) and Partido Trabalhista
Brasileiro (PTB).

Public Finance and Debt
2.3    Background. The State of RGS ran primary deficits (non-debt expenditures minus
current revenues) for a number of years that contributed to increased indebtedness. As
shown in Chart 1, the primary deficits remained a significant percentage of net current
revenues during the early 1980s. As a result, the state's debt (Chart 2) increased up to
350 percent of net current revenues (i.e., current revenues less constitutionally mandated
transfers to state municipalities) in 1990. During 1990-94, the primary balance was
positive but insufficient to meet debt service obligations.

2.4    By 1995, RGS primary deficit (Rs.$154 million) amounted to four percent of net
current revenues. This deficit was due chiefly to nominal salary increases that -- under
Brazil's unprecedented stabilization -- translated into an increase of 40 percent in the real
value of the payroli between 1994 and 1995. The overall deficit (Rs.$1.758 billion) --
the primnary deficit less interest obligations on bonds and other contractual debt --
amounted to 47 percent of net current revenues. Seventy-four percent of this was
financed by deferring debt service. The remainder was largely financed through arrears and
short term borrowing. In the first semester of 1996, the state borrowed to pay off these
arrears, and undertook a series of measures to reduce personnel costs. Nevertheless, the
prognosis for 1996 is again an overall deficit of about Rs.$930 million. Furthermore,
subtracting amortization, the net cashflow before borrowing (Rs.$1.195 million) will
amount to 29 percent of current revenues. Interest and amortization reflect a stock of
debt that amounted to Rs. $8.2 billion (excluding arrears) by mid-1996 and was twice
the level of revenues.
2.5    Issues and Reform Program. The state's financial difficulties are attributable to
three issues: (1) a massive stock of debt; (2) excessive personnel costs, and (3) a stagnant
tax base. The following paragraphs provide details and the Government's program to
address these issues.



10
2.6   Debt. Roughly Rs.$500 million of RGS Rs.$8.2 billion debt (Table 2.1) consists of
short-term debt, comprised of two recent short-term loans from the Caixa Ec6nomica
Federal (CEF), and revenue anticipation borrowing (AROs). Maturities on this debt are
obviously short, ranging up to 30 months (in the case of CEF loans). Real interest rates
have been high. The real rate on CEF loans averaged 18 percent in annual terms from
August 1995 through July 1996. It declined to about 15 percent in November 1996.
2.7   In addition, the state has Rs. $7.7 billion in bonds and long-term contractual debt.
Bonds are by far the largest component of the debt stock. As shown in the table below,
RGS had Rs.$5.9 billion in bonds outstanding as of June 30, 1996. As the bonds are no
longer salable in the private market, the Central Bank permits the state to temporarily
exchange them for federal bonds, or Letras do Banco Central (LBCs) in the Central
Bank's portfolio. The Central Bank charges a rate of interest based on the LBC rate, but
(under Senate rulings) allows the state to capitalize the interest into the existing stock of
debt. As the LBC rate has averaged 24 percent in real terms over the last twelve months,
the stock has grown rapidly.
2.8   The state also has Rs.$1.9 billion in          Table 2.1
long term contractual debt. Eighty-five          Rio Grande do Sul
percent of this is owed to the federal              (US$ million) 
treasury under previous rescheduling   Lgea             Bonds
agreements (Laws 8727 and 7976). This   Bonds                           5857
debt is subject to a nominal interest rate,
plus (in the case of rescheduled domestic  Rescheduled (7976,8727)       1622
debt) a principal indexation factor (TR). As   Other LT internal          116
the TR averaged five percent in real, annual  LT external                 166
terms between August 1995 and July 1996    subtotal long term            7761
and the nominal rate on the loans average    Short term
8.5 percent, the combined interest rate was   CEF (Res 162, AROs)        481
roughly 13 percent (Rescheduled external   Total                         8242
debt is indexed to LIBOR and the foreign exchange rate). Like the bonds, rescheduled
debt is subject to debt service deferral mechanisms. First, any real growth in outstanding
principal due to principal indexation is automatically added to the stock of debt--in effect
constituting an automatic loan. In addition, any debt service above 11 percent of revenues
has also been automatically deferred and incorporated into the stock of outstanding debt.
2.9   The state has recently obtained federal relief for both its short- and long-term debt.
Under the agreement reached in September 1996, both the bonds and the short term Caixa
Ec8nomica Federal debt will be transformed into a debt to the Treasury and refinanced, at
a real annual interest rate of 6 percent, for 30 years. This debt will be included in the
rescheduled debt subject to the debt service ceiling, although the ceiling will be raised to
13 percent of revenues. While there will be no upfront liquidation of debt in exchange for
assets, the agreement requires the state to transfer a minimum of Rs.$810 million in stock
and other assets to the Federal Government. This would be placed in a special account
and credited against state obligations only when the enterprises are actually sold.



11
2.10  Bank staff calculations suggest that such an agreement would result in a very
gradual reduction in the stock of existing debt after 1997. This would be offset, however,
by the state's program of new borrowing. As a result, the total stock of debt would
continue to grow in real terms until the year 2000. It would subsequently decline, reaching
a sustainable level (as indicated by a debt/revenue ratio of 1: 1) in the year 2007.
2.11  Personnel. As with several other states, personnel costs in RGS' public sector --
including payments to active and retired staff in direct administration, foundations, and
autarchies--account for a major fraction (83 percent in 1995) of net current revenues.
Costs have increased (from about 60 percent of revenues in 1993) due to prior expansions
in staffing, the rising burden of retirees and survivors, and increased real wages in 1995.
The Government's ability to control personnel costs is constrained by the Federal
Constitution. Under the Constitution, statutorially confirmed staff cannot be dismissed
(except for cause) and their salaries cannot be reduced in nominal terms. Generous
retirement benefits are also constitutionally guaranteed. Staff are permitted to retire after
only 35 years of contributions (five years less for women, and an additional five years less
for teachers of either sex), and are guaranteed a retirement benefit equal to their exit
salary.
2.12  As discussed in the civil service reform section (paragraphs 2.24-2.31), the state
undertook a voluntary-separation program (PDV) in May of 1996 and has implemented a
freeze on nominal salaries. The state is making use of attrition to reduce the number of
active staff still further, and inflation may reduce the level of real salaries and retirement
benefits in real terms. As a consequence, spending on personnel is expected to drop by 12
percent, in real terms, between 1996 and 1999.
2.13  Revenues. Of RGS' $3.7 billion current revenues (net of transfers to
municipalities) in 1995, 19.4 percent consisted of federal transfers and 67.3 percent of the
value added tax collected by states (ICMS). In 1995, the ICMS accounted for 96.9
percent of tax receipts. It has been equivalent to 6-8 percent of RGS' GDP since 1990 (up
from 4-6 percent prior to 1990, when a tax rate hike came into effect). Real ICMS
receipts have grown slowly over the last nine years, except for the most recent increase--
an 18 percent rise between 1993 and 1995--which was due to the Tanzi effect of the
Plano Real and has since ceased. Real revenues in the first six months of 1996 are below
levels in 1995. Because of the complexity of the collection system, outdated collection
methods, and contributor fraud, the state continues to lose substantial amounts of
revenues.
2.14  As the state has little control over the rate of the tax, the level of receipts is largely
a function of the rate of growth in the tax base, and the effectiveness of collection
enforcement. Based on the available information, growth in state GDP is expected to be
modest (3 percent). The state does, however, intend to increase revenues through
improvements in tax administration. An important element of the Reform Program is the
modernization of the tax collection system. Under a proposed IDB-financed project, the
state would improve coverage and enforcement through the following elements:



12
*  Update and correct the taxpayer cadastre that allows for a more accurate
cross-checking and auditing of ICMS payments;
*  Improve legal enforcement (e.g., removing a requirement that delinquent
taxpayers be notified in person, which would result in a one-time increase in
the level of arrears subject to prosecution);
*  Pursue delinquent contributors, including an update of outstanding taxpayer
debt, and support the judicial process with an improved management
information system;
*  Increase the number of tax auditors (to ensure that all sales are represented
by tax receipts and that sudden changes in payments by major taxpayers are
investigated), including training programs;
*  Expand the number of interior tax collection stations and improve data linkages
to the Finance Secretariat (SEF), with equipment upgrading at tax
checkpoints (to verify that goods in transit have corresponding tax receipts).
*  Establish an information network linking a central ICMS data base to regional
ICMS collection offices; and
- Improve auditing software and hardware to support modernization efforts.
2.15  This is expected to yield a one-time increase in the level of tax revenues by five
percent. The state has signed an agreement with the Federal Government for an IDB loan
providing a detailed plan for the purchase and installation of hardware and software to
support the modernization, the training of ICMS auditors and tax collectors, the
improvement of frontier collection posts, and mobile auditors (highway checks).
2.16 Rationalization of Public Expenditure. In addition to these measures, the
Government intends to limit transfers to public enterprises, and ensure the efficiency of
the investment budget. Operating transfers to public enterprises increased significantly in
1995 (from Rs.$2.5 million in 1994 to Rs.$22.7 million in 1995). The Government is
presently undertaking a monitoring program of public enterprises. Management contracts,
introduced in 1995, commit public enterprises (PEs) to meet profitability, service quality,
and productivity targets. The agreements for 1995 covered the five most important PEs
(CRT, CEEE, CORSAN, PROCERGS, and CRM) and resulted in a modest improvement
of PE operational results and service delivery indicators. The Government also decided to
keep operating transfers to PEs to a minimum (Rs. $2.0 million each year at 1996 prices)
during 1996-98.
2.17  The Government also intends to confine new capital investment spending to a
limited number of high priority programs. The Government proposes to spend about
Rs. $770 million annually in 1997 and 1998 on capital investments. Roughly half of this
would be financed from current savings, with the remainder financed through new debt
and revenues from privatization. Implementation of this program will depend on whether
the Government's expected current savings and privatization proceeds materialize. The
appraisal mission reviewed the state's major planned investments for 1997-1999 and



13
concluded that they do not include any clearly unproductive projects. Five of the six
major projects--accounting for 45 percent of total capital spending--are to be financed by
the World Bank or IDB.
2.18   Evaluation of Program. To evaluate and monitor the impact of project-related
structural reforms, combined with other state actions and changes in the economic
environment on the state's overall financial condition, the appraisal mission prepared fiscal
projections. A detailed projection model was used, incorporating the principal factors
affecting the state's fiscal position. These factors fall into two groups:
*   reform policies: including changes in the number and average wage of active
civil servants, the average benefit of retired civil servants, the level of
revenue-financed capital works, gross borrowing, and changes in tax effort.
*   exogenous factors: including changes in GDP, changes in the rates and
indexation factors that determine real interest rates on existing and proposed
debt (LBC, TR, LIBOR and foreign exchange rates).
The resulting financial outlook for RGS calls for steady, albeit slow improvement. The
table below shows a projection of the state's financial prospects, based on the state's
program of tax improvements, personnel cuts, and investment spending along with fairly
conservative projections of state GDP and interest rates. As shown, the overall revenue
envelope is expected to grow only slowly, due to slow growth in state GDP. State
spending policies will, however, reduce two of the largest items of expenditure--personnel
and investments--very substantially. As a result, the primary deficit is projected to become
a surplus in 1997. The recent debt agreement--which reduced the real interest rate on
bonds from 24 percent (Aug. 94-July 95) to 6 percent (effective March 1996)--will
substantially reduce the state's debt service obligations in accrual terms. This will produce
a steady shrinking of the overall (operational) deficit. Restraint on new borrowing,
combined with steady amortization of existing debt, is projected to gradually reduce the
debt/revenue ratio (see Annex C, Table C.2, for more detailed projections). Even with
sharply reduced investment spending, however, the state is not expected to achieve a
sustainable level of debt until the year 2007.

Civil Service and Administrative Reform
2.19   The state's civil service and public administration reform aims at improving both
the state's fiscal performance and its service delivery. In addition to controlling the state's
wage bill, civil service reform seeks to rationalize the structure of state government,
eliminating redundant or extraneous administrative units, and restructuring the staff and
skill composition of the civil service to better match the state's functional requirements.
The reform program will also improve the funding of pension benefits and thereby help
defuse any "time bomb" that may come as a result of expanding benefits and higher
dependency ratios (currently, retirees account for 37 percent of the government's labor
expenses). These areas, with specific actions and expected results, are discussed below.
Restructuring, Staffing and Wages
2.20 Background. Together with actions to improve collection of the ICMS, control
of staffing and wages is the major area where the state is implementing actions to improve
its fiscal situation. To control personnel costs, the state has already: (i) imposed an
indefinite freeze on the creation of new positions (unless corresponding existing posts are
eliminated), effective June 1995; (ii) closed five state agencies or enterprises with about
1,200 employees; (iii) eliminated approximately 3,500 positions not covered by the civil
service tenure net2, effective June 1995; (iv) incorporated all benefits, with the exception
of tri-annual or quinquennial length of service salary adjustments, to the total
remuneration subject to the established salary ceiling (defined as the salary received by the
head of a secretariat, or Rs. $6,000 today); (v) passed legislation authorizing a two percent
deduction from wages to finance retirement costs, effective mid-March 1996; (vi) passed
legislation reducing automatic increases for time of service;3 (vii) implemented a program
of voluntary departures which resulted in a departure of about 10,000 civil servants (and
about 3,200 from public enterprises)4. This reduction is equivalent to about five percent
of the total number of active staff in the public sector in December 1995 (227,148). All in
all, by September 1996, the number of labor contracts in the public sector had decreased
by about 25,000, or 11 percent of the level in December 1994 (Annex E). In June 1997
the Government will complete an audit of all personnel records to find and eliminate
payment irregularities. It will also fully computerize the payroll (42 percent of the payroll
is prepared manually today). The Government has already completed a review of
2 Because most positions were occupied by statutory staff, the effect of this measure was to reduce
salaries, rather than positions.
3The legislation reduces the automatic increases from 5 percent to 3 percent, and eliminates the
additional bonus granted after 15 and 25 years. These changes apply only to new staff, and thus
have little short term impact.
4 Based on legislation approved by the Assembly, the Government offered four options to staff: voluntary
dismissal; early retirement with a lump sum payment, early retirement with reduced pay, and unpaid
leave. The terms of these alternatives are shown in Annex D. In order to avoid losing staff in key
areas, the Government reserved the right to reject volunteers that it considered priority staff. This
was implemented through negotiating specific targets with each agency. The program was concluded
on May 17, 1996.



15
retirement beneficiaries, which resulted in about 3,000 being excluded from the payroll
beginning in May 1996.
2.21  Issues. Despite its success, the voluntary departures program (PDV) implemented
in April-May 1996 did not attract enough participants to bring about the required
reduction in the government's personnel expenditures. The main issue is that the burden
of personnel costs remains unsustainable, at close to 80 percent of net current revenues.
This burden has left the state with minimal resources for investment and no debt service
capacity. Under the federal Lei Camata, the Government will need to reduce labor costs
from 82 percent of its net income (receita liquida) in 1995 to 74 percent, 67 percent, and
60 percent respectively over the period 1996-98. In the absence of a constitutional
amendment repealing the civil servants' employment stability, these benchmarks are
unlikely to be achieved. In the immediate term, the state regards the personnel issue as a
fiscal one--spending on personnel absorbs resources that might otherwise be spent on
debt liquidation or investment. In the longer run, personnel is also a management issue;
since changes in the number and allocation of staff and in the incentive structure will be
needed to improve the efficiency of the state's administrative machinery.
2.22   Further Actions. Given that the number of participants in the voluntary
departures program was not high enough to achieve financial balance, the state will need
to implement further reductions of the wage bill under the following options:
(i)    undertake a second round of staff reductions. This round would be
implemented through a new PDV or dismissals. A review of some state
agencies corroborates that the degree of overstaffing remains large, despite
the first round of departures. The possibility of significantly reducing staff
through a second round of voluntary departures is limited unless the
severance benefit were increased significantly. The possibility of staff
reductions through dismissals is limited because RGS has virtually no
workers who are not constitutionally protected (i.e., contractual workers)
paid from the Treasury. With approval of a federal constitutional
amendment repealing employment stability, RGS could dismiss a significant
number of staff.
(ii)   maintain salaries in nominal terms. Even if nominal salaries remain
constant, inflation during 1996-98 will allow salaries to be reduced in real
terms. Relatively small cuts in real salaries would have large impacts on
total personnel costs, as the salaries of active staff are used to determine
the level of retirement benefits. The scope for reducing real salaries is
large, as salaries increased by at least 40 percent between 1994 and 1995;
(iii) continue the freeze on hirings, which will allow further staff reductions
through attrition. As currently proposed, the state would refrain from
replacing retiring staff, except for teachers and police (where the state
would replace one-half of the positions vacated). This is expected to



16
reduce the number of active personnel by about two percent (3,000) per
year.
2.23  In retrenching active staff, the state hopes to avoid losing its most qualified
personnel or concentrating the departures in key functions (such as education). The
Government will undertake an analysis of its functions and staffing requirements as a basis
for further dismissals. The analysis, to be carried out by external consultants, would: (i)
determine redundant organizational units; (ii) determine staffing needs in each unit using
standard organizational tools; (iii) prepare a new career development structure to enable
the state to attract and retain qualified staff and strengthen staff performance. Once the
administrative reform to the Federal Constitution permits unilateral dismissals, this would
provide the base for identifying staff to be dismissed. Alternatively, if administrative
reform is not passed, the functional and staff requirements would provide a better basis for
targeting new voluntary departure programs.
2.24 Evaluation of Personnel Measures. The fiscal impact of these measures on
personnel costs was indicated in the previous section. The additional measures, including
revenue measures, would reduce personnel costs from 84 percent of revenue in 1996 to
70 percent of revenue in 1999. Additional personnel cost reductions (i.e., beyond those
caused by the voluntary reductions program of April-May 1996 and other prior measures)
would occur through a decline in the number of civil servants from 171,000 in 1996 to
162,000 in 1999 and through a decline of about 14 percent in real benefits paid to
retirees5. The overall impact on real personnel costs would be a reduction of about 12
percent between 1996 and 1999. With an amendment to the Constitution permiting
unilateral dismissals, the state could reasonably expect to reduce the burden of personnel
costs to about 65 percent of net revenues.
2.25   The reduction in staffing will improve economic efficiency. It is widely
acknowledged that the RGS government is oversized in terms of staffing. The voluntary
departures program has endeavored to reject voluntary departure applications in places
where particular skills are scarce. The most important example is education, where staffing
in a number of areas (e.g., math and science) is not excessive. As a significant percentage
of staff leaving the civil service will be employed more productively elsewhere, departures
of civil servants are expected to have a positive effect on economic efficiency.
2.26  Labor cost reductions, however, have no guarantee of sustainability. While the
present government is clearly committed to sustaining these reductions, there is no
guarantee that a future government will not reverse these measures, either through
granting new salary increases or by increasing employment Nevertheless, reversibility is
somewhat constrained by the state's financial duress, which is expected to continue in the
medium term. Under binding commitments to service debt and the need to increase
investment, future governments will not have much leeway to increase labor expenses.
5A decline in real benefits to retirees would occur because retirees do not earn the automatic wage
increases for length of service that active staff earn.



17
Pension and Survivor Benefits
2.27   Background. A fundamental culprit of high personnel costs is retiree and survivor
benefits. The federal constitution mandates generous retirement and survivorship benefits.
Partial retirement benefits begin with 25 years and 30 years of service for women and men,
respectively. Full retirement benefits begin with 30 years and 35 years of service
respectively for women and men. The full benefit is equivalent to 100 percent of the
employee's last salary, with a pro-rata benefit for early retirement. Eligible survivors
include female spouses, sons up to 18 years of age and daughters up to 21 years of age
(single daughters of employees that began employment prior to 1974 are also eligible
regardless of age). Survivor benefits (administered by the Instituto de Previdencia)
amount to 45 percent of retirement benefits plus 5 percent per survivor.
2.28  Retirement benefits are paid out of the state budget, and accounted for 37 percent
of payments to labor in 1995. If deductions and payments to dependent survivors are
considered, this proportion rises to 42 percent. Policies to improve pension financing
include recently approved pension legislation that established a 2 percent contribution
from the payroll to finance retirement benefits. Survivor and health benefits are paid out of
a nine percent payroll contribution by active and inactive staff (5.4 percent for survivor
benefits and 3.6 percent for health insurance) and a 3.6 percent payroll contribution by the
state. The government is considering an increase in the contribution for survivor benefits
from the present 9 percent (applicable to all staff and retirees) to 10.8 percent in order to
cover male spouse survivors and to increase survivors' contributions for the medical
assistance program from 2 percent to 7.1 percent. Furthermore, costs of the Instituto de
Previdencia have been reduced from 17 percent to 12 percent of receipts through
administrative reform, and are expected to decline further to 10 percent of receipts
through a reduction of 700 staff coupled with increased data processing equipment.
2.29  Issues. The key issue for the Government remains how to increase financing of
retiree and survivorship benefits costs. The growth in the number of retirees is about 3
percent per year. Given the constraints imposed by the federal Constitution (which would
not be significantly altered by the version of the social security reform now under
consideration by the Senate), the state has little latitude to reduce its retirement and
survivorship benefit costs. Because retirement benefits are indexed to salaries of active
staff, the proposed partial freeze on nominal salaries will, nevertheless, reduce average
retirement benefits by about 5 percent per year in real terms.
2.30 Pension Financing Program. By law, the Government will need to submit draft
legislation on the establishment of a pension fund for civil servants. During preparation,
Bank missions offered considerable assistance to the Government with regard to its
options regarding pension reform (see Annex F). Unfortunately, the high level of federally
mandated benefits preempts the creation of an actuarially financed fund. The actuarially
required contribution rate -- from employees or government -- is simply too high to be
feasible. The Government will most likely submit draft legislation to increase the payroll
deduction to help finance retirement obligations. The new fund, however, is unlikely to
receive the required high contribution rates that would cover mandated benefits. The new
fund will therefore ultimately be only partially funded.



18
Descentralization of Primary Education
2.31  Another action to improve public sector service delivery is decentralization of
primary education. Transferring primary education to municipalities is expected to raise
service standards through greater autonomy and closer involvement of communities. The
scope of the program is limited by budget constraints at the municipal level, and
implementation relies on essentially voluntary negotiations between the state and
municipal governments. The Government aims that some 32,500 students per year will be
transferred during 1996-1998, raising the share of municipalities in primary education
from 38 percent (581,415 students out of a total of 1,535,192 in public elementary
schools) to 50 percent. The Law of Democratic Management of Public Schools provides
the basis for the implementation of the current government's policies. These policies seek
to increase efficiency and improve the quality of education by giving state schools greater
pedagogical, administrative, and financial autonomy. One way of implementing these
policies is by delegating power to democratically elected school directors and school
councils at each school. For example, to increase financial autonomy, control over
purchasing of school materials and contracting of small repairs is being transferred to the
school director and council of the schools. A more detailed analysis of education
expenditures and policies is available in the project file.
Privatizations and Concessions
2.32  The most ambitious actions to improve service delivery are to privatize the
telecommunications and power utilities and to award concessions for water, ports, and
road services. Actions to increase private sector involvement in the delivery of goods and
services include divestiture of state ownership in the electricity company and the
telecommunications company. Furthermore, the state is implementing concessioning
arrangements with the private sector to improve service delivery in water and sewerage,
ports, and roads.
Energy
2.33  The Government's key action in the energy sector will be to privatize about 67
percent of power distribution. The State of RGS owns 99.9 percent of a power company
(Companhia Estadual de Energia Eletrica (CEEE)) which has the concession for power
distribution in the state (ELETROBRAS, a federal monopoly, owns the remaining 0.1
percent of voting shares). The Government owns 95.3 percent of CEEE directly and 4.6
percent through the Caixa de Administra9ao da Divida PuTblica (CADIP).



19
2.34  Generation. CEEE generates around 30 percent of its requirements and imports
70 percent from Itaipui and ELETROSUL (a federally owned company). CEEE has an
installed capacity of 1,374 MW (866 MW hydro and 508 MW thermal). In 1995 it
generated 4,920 GWh (3427 from hydro-plants and 1493 from thermal-plants) and bought
12,289 GWh totaling 17,209 GWh of generation requirements. The thermal plants owned
by CEEE are coal-based and were very expensive, creating a real economic burden for the
company. In addition, it has one plant under construction (Candiota III) with works
stopped, equipment                            Table 2.4

CEEE forecasts that the market will continue to grow at about 5 percent per annum in the
next five years. The state is totally electrified and is strategically located in relation to
MERCOSUL. Net total sales in 1995 have reached the equivalent to US$1,081 million.
2.36 Commercial Performance: The company has a decentralized commercial system
with private sub-contractors performing services of meter reading and bill delivery. The
time lag between reading and bill delivery is 7 days (which could be improved). There are
60,000 customers without metering (down from 117,000 in July 1995 and 91,000 in
December 1995). Losses remain high at 11.9 percent. The tariff margin is reasonably
good: CEEE buys at an average price of US$35/MWh and sells at an average of
US$82/MWH, therefore making a profit of US$47/MWh. Net total sales reached the
equivalent to US$1,081 million in 1995.
2.37  Issues: A detailed sector analysis is available in the project file. The major issues
facing the power sector in RGS are:
(a) CEEE's Management. CEEE has traditionally been very badly managed, with
corresponding low efficiency and high losses (11.9 percent). It is overstaffed (around
9,500 employees with expected reduction to 8,600 by end-1996) and has very high
operational costs. CEEE has around 3,500 retired employees that (under an old law) are
considered equivalent to public employees and therefore receive a pension in the same
amount as if they were working. This cost represents US$70 million per year. The
benefits paid to the employees are also generous. The average monthly salary (defined as
the cost of personnel per employee) is US$3,230.



20
(b) CEEE 's Financial Situation. CEEE's financial situation is very difficult. The
financial statements show fixed assets of Rs. $4,029 million. The total obligations (as of
December 31, 1995) are Rs.$2,102 million. Total debt is US$1.5 billion. Net income

financial operations raised the
net result to US$91 million. The debt to be served from 1996 to 2014 amounts to
US$1,474 million, with US$247 million due in 1996 and US$1,227 million due in the long
term.
(c) the power sector in RGS requires investments in generation of US$3.0 billion
in the next decade. Neither CEEE nor the government has the prospect of funding these
investments.
(d) private investors regard investments in power generation as very risky because
of CEEE's poor track record in meeting payment obligations.
2.38  Strategy for Reforms. The State of RGS has developed a clear and satisfactory
strategy for reforming the power sector in the state. It consists of splitting CEEE into
several companies by activity and privatizing some of these companies. Under recently
approved legislation, the following companies will be created:
(a) a hydro generation company concentrating all hydroplants presently owned by
CEEE. This would remain a state owned company.
(b) a thermal generation company concentrating all thermal plants presently owned
by CEEE, which would initially be a state-owned company but which the government
would try to transfer to the Federal Government as part of payment of debts. This
company would subsequently be privatized.



291
(c) a transmission company concentrating all transmission lines presently owned by
CEEE. It would be a state-owned independent company operating in an open access
scheme, transmitting power from generators to distributors, or transmitting exchange of
power among generators or distributors. This company would be in charge of load
dispatching in the state.
(d) three distribution companies: one in the north area of the state and part of the
Porto Alegre region, with 1,120,000 consumers; one in the West area of the state and part
of the Porto Alegre region, with 720,000 consumers; and a third one in the south area of
the state and part of the Porto Alegre region, with 910,000 consumers. The first two
distribution companies, representing 67 percent of the market would be privatized under
the proposed project. The third one would be kept as state owned initially, but would be
prepared for future privatization.
CEEE's present debt stock would be transferred to the companies to be created without
any transfer to the state. The final scheme for maximizing the value of the companies to
be privatized and improving the financial situation of the remaining companies has been
studied through financial simulations carried out by consultants during project preparation.
Based on this study, a temporary holding (participaq6es) will absorb some of the debts
and companies to be privatized, and use the proceeds or privatization for debt reduction.
2.39 The legislation authorizing the splitting of CEEE and allowing privatization was
approved by the State Assembly on December 22, 1996. Consultants will be required to
help in the privatization process. The Government intends to issue bidding documents for
hiring these consultants in early 1997. Additionally, a draft concession contract will need
to be agreed with the federal regulatory agency in advance, and should be included in the
bidding documents in order to show greater transparency and attract the maximum
number of private investors.
2.40 Impact of the Reform. The proposed power sector reforms will improve sector
efficiency. The separation of generation, transmission and distribution, with open access
to transmission for new generators, will introduce competition at the generation level and
reduce generation costs. It is expected that a minimum 20 percent reduction of generation
costs can be achieved. This could result in tariff reductions of up to 10 percent to final
consumers. The systems distribution will also become much more efficient, since 67
percent of it will be privatized. The index of energy sold per employee should double with
resulting cost reductions. Furthermore, the reforms would enable increased investment to
meet demand growth of about 5 percent per year.
2.41  The proposed reform would also help improve the state's fiscal situation. First,
CEEE's restructuring and partial privatization will allow a reduction of the state's bonded
debt (divida mobiliaria) through partial payment of this debt with privatization proceeds.
It will also reduce the state's exposure to CEEE's debts (through eliminating existing
guarantees) by splitting CEEE's debt (about US$1.5 billion) among the several companies
resulting from CEEE's re-structuring, including the privatized companies. Furthermore,
the privatization of 67 percent of CEEE's distribution will create two private distribution



22
companies that will better and more aggressively supply the market, resulting in more sales
and state tax collections (ICMS). Profits from improved management of the privatized
companies will generate higher income taxes (to the Federal Government). Finally, it is
expected that the reforms will reduce by US$3.0 billion the need for public investments in
power generation during the next decade.
2.42  Strong government ownership of the reforms and the financial feasibility of the
proposed privatizations are likely to drive successful implementation. The Government
acted quickly to develop the reform proposals. A further test of commitment is the draft
legislation that was submitted to the State Assembly and approved in December 1996.
Furthermore, there is a strong financial potential that privatization will attract private
investors. Good financial results are likely to result since CEEE has an attractive market,
the tariff margin (US$46/MWh) is good, and there is room for reducing costs (sales could
be increased quickly by reducing losses from the present 27 percent to 13 percent through
commercial actions). The proposed reforms are likely to be sustained because
privatization of 67 percent of CEEE's distribution market is very unlikely to be reversed
by a future government. Indeed, if successful, the reforms could lead to further
privatizations.
Telecommunications
2.43  In Brazil, telecommunication services are generally provided by Federally-owned
companies of the Telebras holding company. The State of RGS is an exception, because
Companhia Riograndense das TelecomunicaV&es (CRT) is a state-owned company. The
concession grants CRT the right to provide local and inter-city telecommunications
services throughout the State.
2.44  CRT is a mixed economy corporation created by State Law No. 4073 of
December 30, 1960, and incorporated on April 4, 1962. The ownership structure of the
company (Table 2.6, prior to privatization) is divided into two classes of shares: ordinary,
which give its owners the right to vote, and preferred, which do not. CRT provides
services in the whole State of RGS, with the exception of the municipalities of Pelotas,
Capao do Leao and Morro Redondo, which are operated by Companhia Melhoramentos e
ResistOncia (CMR, of the Telebras Holding), based in Pelotas.
2.45 Existing Facilities and Quality of Service. As of March 31, 1996, CRT had
711,147 telephone lines in service. Since RGS has a population of 9.8 million, this
number represents a density of about 7 lines per 100 inhabitants. CRT had 85,738 cellular
lines in service at the end of March, 1996. CRT had installed 981,305 telephone lines by
the end of 1995 of which 273,616 were digital lines. A total of 60 percent of lines were
installed in residences, 32 percent in businesses, 7 percent in trunks of private exchanges
(normally for business or Government use), and 2 percent in public coin-operated
telephones. Most of the network is automatic and provides Long Distance and
International Direct Distance Dialing, with the exception of 7,000 lines of 92 rural manual
exchanges. Some 40 percent of the network is digital, and the rest is electromechanical
crossbar, distributed among 442 automatic exchanges. Capacity utilization is 89 percent as
a result of the high unsatisfied demand for lines.



23
2.46   Quality of service is generally good, and CRT keeps a line fault repair ratio of 3
percent of the lines. CRT customers completed 51 percent of their long distance calls
successfilly, which compares with a 65 percent ratio in good networks of OECD
countries. This is due to congestion of the electromechanical exchanges as customers use
the existing lines more time than usual (data of October 31, 1995).
2.47   Sector Issues. The main sector issues are: (a) the large unsatisfied demand for
services; (b) the state's inability to finance new CRT investments; (c) the conflicting
roles of Government in policy setting, regulation, and operations; (d) unbalanced tariffs;
(e) the inefficiency of CRT; and (f) legal and regulatory obstacles to the privatization of
CRT.
2.48 Demandfor Service. CRT had 400,000 waiting applications for new service,
including 60,000 business requests. Demand is conservatively estimated, using countries
with comparable GDP, at 1.4 million, leaving an unsatisfied demand of 700,000.

other shareholders. In the last category are all telephone subscribers, who are required to buy a share of CRT to gain access to a telephone.
Meeting these demand estimates would increase telephone density to a still low number of
15 lines/100 population, for developed country standards (OECD average 40 lines/100
population), but higher than the Latin American average (10 lines/100 population).
Telephone service is essential for business and other economic agents. Residential
telephone service is also a basic social need today, considering among others, productivity,
energy saving, and security factors6. CRT still also has to meet the demand for other
services, especially business services, such as cellular phones. CRT has a waiting list for
cellular of 300,000. CRT does not provide other more sophisticated services, such as high
speed data ("Frame Relay"), broadband Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN),
cable TV and others.
2.49 Financing CRT Investments. To satisfy the demand, CRT would need to invest
US$740 million. To increase the variety of services (i.e. cellular, high speed data and
6 See, for example, Saunders, Wellenius, et. al. "Telecommunications and Economic Development", 2nd.
edition, Princeton University Press, 1994.



24
others), CRT would have to invest an additional US$250 million. To improve the quality
of service to international standards, CRT will need to replace the old exchanges by digital
exchanges, at a cost of $100 million. To expand long distance capacity, CRT will need to
replace the analog long distance network with fiber optic cable, US$150 million.
Therefore, total needs amount to US$1,240 million. The Government does not have the
resources to finance this amount, and even if it had, other investments in social
infrastructure would have higher priority.
2.50 Conflicting Roles of Government. The Government has conflicting roles. It
defines policy, but also regulates CRT and operates services. These conflicting roles result
in a lack of clear policy, loose regulation and poor operations.
2.51  CRTEfficiency. CRT had 5,800 staff in March 31, 1996. This means about 8.2
staff are employed per 1000 lines in service. This is about double the amount in efficient
companies. CRT is also restricted by many state and federal administrative legislation in
the purchasing, procurement, staffing, and in general, administrative areas, which obliges
CRT to comply with lengthy bureaucratic procedures. This is not proper for a modern
telephone company which needs to react swiftly to changing technology, markets and
competitive pressures.
2.52  Tariffs. Tariff setting is a prerogative of the Ministry of Communications (MOC).
Tariffs in Brazil have been unbalanced: international tariffs, much higher than costs,
subsidize local tariffs. This is the case of CRT (Table 2.7). The MOC is trying to correct
past imbalances. Tariffs were increased on November 28, 1995. Residential charges were
increased from Rs.$0.63 to Rs.$3.73 per month (600 percent). It appears that the Federal
Government's intentions are to increase again this rate to about Rs. $6 to Rs. $7 per month
in 1997, eliminating subsidies. The comparison in the previous table should be viewed
with caution. CRT uses the "autofinancing" method of raising funds for its capital
expense program. New subscribers are asked to contribute about Rs.$1,000 to CRT
through the purchase of preferred shares. They then need to wait about two years to
receive a new telephone line. Brazil implemented this scheme during the debt crisis in the
1980s to help the companies to raise money for their investment program, a practice
which has yet to be reversed.
2.53   CRT Privatization. To help address the issues discussed above, the state sold 35
percent of the ordinary shares of CRT to a strategic investor in December 1996. Law No.
10682 of January 2, 1996, authorized the sale of the shares of CRT up to the legal limit,
requiring the state to retain more than half of ordinary (voting) shares. Since Telebras
owns about 14 percent of the shares, the state effectively still retains 51 percent.
2.54  The state assumes the responsibility of promoting the expansion of services
through investments of the privatized CRT. The autofinancing scheme will be phased out
gradually, as the new company increases its financing capacity, and will be replaced by an
installation fee of about Rs.$ 150 in five years.

2.55   The Government prepared a new Shareholder's Agreement for CRT. The new
contract will include the new service obligations of CRT, as well as a tariff regime and
adjustment mechanism based on a price-cap methodology. Tariffs will be grouped into
one or several baskets. CRT would be allowed to adjust the price of the basket to account
for inflation and productivity increases. Individual tariffs within a basket may change but
the overall price of the basket should be capped to the agreed formula.
2.56  The state is not considering to grant any additional exclusivity to the new strategic
investor. The Federal Government plans to open all services to competition on a gradual
basis. Therefore, the Shareholder's Agreement will not contain exclusivity protection for
CRT.
2.57  With the assistance of advisors, the Government is also preparing a new
management contract to enforce the application of the Shareholders Agreement conditions
with its strategic partner. The new contract will define the obligations and rights of the
parties in CRT and provide guarantees to compensate for deviations from the agreed
parameters.
2.58  The Government is also negotiating with Telebras the sale of at least one half of its
stake in CRT (about 6.5 percent) to be included in the transaction. This agreement, if
finalized, will give the strategic investor additional shares in CRT and provide more
comfort about its relative position in the company.
2.59 The Government has changed the by-laws of CRT to transfer as much
management control of the company as legally possible to the strategic investor. The
strategic investor will have three executive directors: the Superintendent, the Finance and
the Operations Directors. The state will also have three directors, including the President,
7OECD countries.

26
the Technical and the Administrative Directors. Any ties in voting would be resolved by
the President. By delegating key managerial functions to the state's investor, the
Government expects to improve CRT's efficiency. The strategic investors will be
responsible for coordination, planning and organization of technical, operational,
administrative and financial areas of CRT. In particular, the Superintendent will be
responsible for formulating all expansion plans for the company and executing such plans;
purchasing and coordinating all equipment, materials and services in the company,
preparing the budget and the company's three year plans; making all marketing plans and
activities; and substituting for the President in his absence.

2.60 Evaluation of the Program. Through privatization of CRT, RGS expects to
improve telecommunications service delivery and to improve CRT's efficiency. Projected
improvements are summarized in Table 2.8. As the table shows, a privatized CRT is
projected to meet demand for telephone service in full by the year 2005, and will
furthermore be able to satisfy all of the business demand by the year 2000. The State of
RGS would be able to compete internationally against other states of Brazil and other
countries, and telecommunications will cease to be a major bottleneck to its economic
development. Also, major investments will take place in RGS, as CRT is able to increase
its capital program due to its increased productivity. Investments in the year 2000 will
exceed US$300 million per year, and by the year 2005 they would exceed the US$500
million per year mark. CRT productivity will increase from about 9 staff7IOOO to about
4.1 staffl1000 lines by the year 2000, and is projected to continue increasing to reach 2.3
staffl1000 lines by 2005.
2.61  Privatization of CRT is taking place under an increasingly competitive
environment. A private competitor in cellular telephone services is likely to be awarded a
federal concession of the B-Band by March 1997 (CRT, which owns a concession for the
public A-Band for cellular services, cannot bid for the B-Band space for cellular services).
Other sources of competition to CRT telephone services will include private networks and
satellite services. Value-added services (e.g., the internet) are already being provided by
other operators. Increased competition will encourage CRT to improve its economic
efficiency.

2.62 Financial Analysis. Table 2.9 shows that CRT's financial situation is expected to
improve substantially. Revenues would increase from US$675 million in 1996 to
US$1,119 million in the year 2000 due to the increased number of lines and normal traffic
growth. Expenses are expected to increase at a slower pace, from US$651 million in
1996 to US$917 million in the year 2000, due to increased labor productivity. As a result,
net income before tax will increase from US$24 million in 1996 to US$202 million in the
year 2000. Even as the income tax rate is reduced to 25 percent (as projected), income
tax contributions will increase to US$51 rnillion in the year 2000. Net income after tax
and social contributions will increase from US$12 million in 1996 to US$152 million in
the year 2000. This expected results will make CRT a very attractive company for
investors, and will also make good returns to the state, in the form of taxes and dividends.
In addition to the income tax, the state receives the ICMS for telephone services at a rate
of 24 percent of gross revenues. For the years 1997 to 2001, CRT is projected to pay
US$1,834 million in ICMS taxes to the state.
2.63   The previous financial analysis does not assume a change in current tariffs, with the
exception of the elimination of the self-financing scheme. However, the Federal
Government may be willing to increase the local fee further to about Rs.$7 per month, and
decrease the international rates accordingly. This tariff rebalancing will not affect the
financial situation of CRT due to the fact that increased revenues from local service will be
offset by decreased revenues from international and long distance services. Currently,
CRT enjoys a monopoly in both services. However, the introduction of competition in the
near future will probably affect CRT more under the current tariffs, since new entrants will
focus on the long distance service which is more lucrative. Therefore, the proposed
Federal tariff rebalancing would be a move in the right direction, as it would ensure the
new strategic investor that the future revenues of the company would become less
dependent on the competition.
Water and Sewerage
2.64  The State of RGS expects to partially privatize its water and sanitation sector
(hereafter, the water sector) as part of the State Reform Program. Partial water sector
privatization will take place through concession contracts to and full service management



28
contracts with private operators. With the Water Sector Reform Program the government
addresses the sector's urgent need to establish appropriate institutional foundations,
including an efficient, credible and autonomous regulatory framework. Privatization and
other complementary measures will address the fundamental cause of poor sector
performance: the lack of separation between operational and regulatory roles within the
sector and the politicization of its management.
2.65  Background and Issues. The water sector faces the typical problems of a poorly
run public sector. The sector is dominated by a state enterprise, the Companhia
Riograndense de Saneamento (CORSAN) -- a utility with poor financial performance with
much room for improving the quality of service. CORSAN provides water services in 304
(71 percent) of the 427 state municipalities, serving an area that houses 70 percent of the
state's total population (9.8 million people). CORSAN's coverage of water (93 percent) is
average by international and domestic standards, but its coverage of sewerage (9 percent)
is low by both international and domestic standards, i.e., there are about 0.4 million
people without water service and about 5 million without sewerage service in CORSAN's
territory.
2.66 CORSAN operates in a difficult market. The state capital, Porto Alegre, and five
of the state's largest cities (Sao Leopoldo, Caxias do Sul, Pelotas, and Bage and Santana
do Livramento), refused to sign concession contracts with CORSAN when the company
was created in 1965. On the other hand, in a state with many small towns, more than 55
of the systems CORSAN operates today serve towns of less than 1,000 people, 230
systems serve towns of more than 1,000 and less than 25,000 people, and only 10 of its
systems serve cities of more than 100,000 people. The implementation of cross-subsidies
from large (and supposedly rich) systems to small (and supposedly poor) systems,
PLANASA's main operational arrangement, has then been more difficult to apply in RGS
than in any other state. CORSAN's market however is not the cause of CORSAN's poor
performance. CORSAN's water losses are high (about 43 percent) and its metering level
(62 percent) is low. Its labor productivity is significantly below best practice (4.3
employees for every 1000 water connections) and its personnel costs are high (Rs. $23,638
per employee per year). The result is that 56 percent of CORSAN's billing is devoted to
covering the personnel costs originating from 5,513 permanent staff.
2.67 Despite state transfers of US$205 million during 1985-95, CORSAN's long-term
debt was US$438 million at December 31, 1995 (of which US$250 million resulted from
the 1994 refinancing of its debt with Caixa Econ6mica Federal). CORSAN's financial
prospects are particularly worrisome because of the large size of its long-term debt
(equivalent to about 1.7 times the company's 1995 operational revenue) and very high
operating costs (about 20 percent higher than its operational revenue). This situation,
which exists despite CORSAN's very high rates -- US$0.80/m3, makes it unrealistic to
imagine a scenario where the company, as it is institutionally organized today, becomes
financially self-sufficient.
2.68 RGS Water Sector Reform Program. The general objectives of the water sector
reform program are to:



29
*  reduce or eliminate the reliance on state treasury funds for the water and sanitation
sector;
*  clarify the legal and regulatory framework of the sector, with appropriate inclusion in a
cross sectoral regulatory agency (paragraph 2.132) and in appropriate environmental
protection provisions (paragraph 2.74);
*  increase operating efficiency; and
*  improve the quality of service and expand service coverage.
Through achievement of these objectives, the government expects to reduce CORSAN's
size to a competitive level by making its assets financially profitable, increasing investment
in the collection and treatment of sewage, reducing water tariffs, and allowing yardstick
regulation and competition in the state's water industry market.
2.69 Reform Strategy. The Government plans to meet the reform objectives by
restructuring the sector, increasing the degree of private participation, creating a
competitive environment for the service providers, and redefining the sector's social
policy. To explore alternative strategic options, the state will hire through the Water
Sector Modernization Project (Loan 3442-BR), a consulting firm to provide
recommendations regarding these options, clear guidelines regarding the appropriate steps
to take, and a timetable for implementation. The main strategic options to be studied
include restructuring the sector, increasing and implementing private sector participation,
and revising the sector's legal and regulatory framework. These options are examined
below.
2.70  Sector Restructuring. The selection and implementation of an appropriate industry
structure is the first condition towards the diversification of water sector ownership. The
most interesting among the different available options seem to be:
*  award one or more of the integrated systems serving municipalities which are part of
the Porto Alegre Metropolitan Region (PAMR) to private concessionaires;
*  have CORSAN award one or more full-service management contracts (FSMC) to
private firms for the operation of the medium- and small-size systems serving a number
of small-size municipalities, villages and towns located close to each other. FSMCs
will be awarded through a public bidding to serve estimated populations of about
150,000-200,000 people. Besides the responsibility for operating and maintaining the
systems, the contractor would also be responsible for implementing an investment
program to be defined in the bidding document. Each municipality and district
covered by an FSMC will bid for a new concession at the end of its concession to
CORSAN or at end of the five year contract, whichever comes first. The private firm
operating the systems under FSMCs will be allowed to participate in any or all of the
public biddings that will take place to select the new concessionaires; and
* award to cooperatives an undetermined number of very small-size systems, mainly
serving rural areas. The state will promote the formation of these cooperatives in



30
those cases where, without any risk of lowering the current levels of service quality, a
less expensive service would result from disengaging these systems from CORSAN.
An alternative option to be explored by the consultants is the possibility of selling either 51
percent of CORSAN's shares to a group of private investors or selling majority control of
a number of CORSAN's proposed geographic regions. The state government's target is
that by mid-1998, a number of water systems serving municipalities with a total urban
population of at least 800,000 people will be under private sector operation (either
concessions contracts, full service management contracts or private firms).
2.71   Concession Design. The concessions' design and the basis on which concessions
will be awarded are issues to be resolved. The government's intention regarding the
awarding mechanism is to fix all other parameters (service quality, investment, and so on),
and award both the concessions and the FSMCs on the basis of the lowest offered tariff.
By selecting this awarding mechanism, the government expects to guarantee maximum
transparency to the process; end the economically inefficient practice of unified tariffs;
and, more importantly, challenge the present assumption that large subsidies are needed by
any small-size system, the main argument of those who resist the idea of reducing the size
of Brazil's state water companies.
2.72   The levels, of service coverage written into the concessions and the FSMCs will be
geographically related dated targets for water supply, sewerage, percentage of sewage
treatment, and percentage of metering. In deciding about targets for coverage, the
government will study and balance the existing trade-offs between targets and tariffs,
taking into account the population's payment capacity.
2.73   The levels of service quality written into the concessions and the FSMCs will
comprise parameters to be regulated such as drinking water quality, quality of sewage
discharges, continuity of service, accuracy and frequency of billing, and response to
customer complaints.
2.74  Environmental impact andfuture environmental sector regulations. Changing the
environmental regulations creates instability in the implementation of private concession
contracts. Contract clauses particularly vulnerable to change are the speed at which the
concessionaire has to comply with targets for sewerage coverage and treatment.
Therefore, it is of critical importance that a consistent set of environmental targets and
obligations for the utilities be developed early in the concession process through
coordination between the water and environment sectors, so that the implications of
alternative options for investment requirements, tariffs, and environmental quality can be
fully assessed by future concessionaires (see details in paragraphs 3.13-3.15).
2.75  River basin management agencies will eventually take over the responsibility for
achieving targets set at the federal or state level. These agencies will have the power to
levy charges and fines in order to meet the targets at least cost. They will include the main
users of every river basin, and hence concessionaires will be key players both in terms of
water abstraction and wastewater discharges. Their discretion will be offset by the fact
that the decision-making powers will be with the users of the basins. If the agencies do
not operate as planned, then penalty mechanisms are envisaged in which state or federal
entities will act to impose charges on all parties in a uniform fashion.



31
2.76  Treatment of CORSAN's Debt and ExistingAssets. The state government has
already decided against a debt write-off by the state. Remaining questions are whether the
concessionaires will pay the debt at the time of the bids or assume it, and how the debt will
be allocated among concessionaires and, in particular, among municipalities willing to
separate from CORSAN. To allocate the debt based on the revenue earning performance
of each concession and municipality is an attractive option that will be considered by the
government. How the payment of CORSAN's debt is resolved could also provide a
solution for how to deal with CORSAN's existing assets. The solutions to both questions
could be linked by making CORSAN's existing debt equivalent to CORSAN's existing
assets, (i.e. assuming that the government's equity is zero).
2.77 CORSAN's Current Employees. Dealing with CORSAN's current employees is
another issue to be resolved by the government. Two available options are to allow the
private operator to finance the redundancies or to discharge the redundant labor force
prior to signing the concessions. The two options are not mutually exclusive. A package
could include, for instance, some public financing as well as further cuts by the
concessionaire. One question is whether the public funds would be used at an early stage
to finance the reductions, or whether the funds would be provided to the winning
concessionaire.
2.78  Water Pricing. Water pricing is the final area in which important government
decisions need to be taken. Although CORSAN has attempted to simplify its tariff
structure in the recent past, it still lacks simplicity and transparency because of the
introduction of a complex exponential equation for calculating applicable rates. The two
main elements upon which a decision will need to be made are the form of tariff regulation
(that is, when and how often will the average level of tariffs be adjusted) and whether and
how the tariff structure should be amended. Key questions that will arise include the
leeway concessionaires will have to adjust the tariff structure within the overall cap on the
average level resulting from the bidding process; the role the government's social policy
will play when adjusting the tariff structure; the timing for implementing new tariff
structures (before or after the concessions are awarded); the role "revenue neutrality" will
play when the implementation take place after the concession has been awarded; the role
seasonal or peak load pricing will play; and the extent to which water bills will result from
metering actual consumption.
2.79  Social Policy. RGS water sector policy needs to address key questions related to
the objectives, sources, and instruments of the state's social policy. Is the objective of the
policy to facilitate access to the services to the very poor families or to pay for the
consumption of the poorest families? What sources of funds will make possible the
implementation of the policy? Which instruments will be used to implement the policy?
These questions need to be addressed in a clear and transparent manner to determine the
contractual obligations to be included in the bidding documents and the negotiation of the
conditions by which existing systems would be returned to municipalities willing to
become independent.
2.80 Program Cost. In addition to the study of alternative strategic options for
restructuring the sector, increasing and implementing private sector participation, and



32
revising the sector's legal and regulatory framework, implementation of the water sector
reform program will require the services of legal, financial, and administrative advisers to
assist and advise the state and municipal governments in the implementation of the agreed
privatization strategy, including negotiations and finalization of contracts after the award
is made; international advertising of the privatization process; public hearings;
environmental audits of facilities to be concessioned or sold; and the establishment of a
water division at the regulatory agency(ies). The cost of these activities has been
estimated at about US$2 million.
2.81   Evaluation of the Program. The water reform is the riskiest component of the
RGS State Reform Program. Because of the water sector's municipal nature, the state
government commitment to privatize it is not as clear as in other sectors. Chances of a
wider and stronger political opposition to the reform are greater in the water sector
because each municipal council and mayor can refuse, at any moment, to support or join
the state government in its privatization effort.
2.82  However, the risk is worth taking because the benefits will be large if a significant
number of municipalities decide to award concessions of water services or agree to
FSMCs. Concessions or FSMCs to private operators will improve efficiency in two ways.
First, water will be produced and distributed at lower cost through cutting water losses,
increasing metering levels, and raising labor productivity. Second, concessions will allow
private investment to improve infrastructure of production and distribution. The scope for
such efficiency gains is large, given present operational costs and service shortfalls
(paragraphs 2.66-2.68).
2.83   Furthermore, the program can work as the most effective catalyst for motivating
other state and municipal utilities to undertake the painful but required sectoral reforms.
Privatization has been frequently opposed on the grounds of its close association with rich
and large capital cities. Private operators would only be interested in "cherry picking",
especially in developing countries. The proposed strategy would show that privatization
could also work in medium- and small-size localities. Many of the efficiency gains
associated with serving large cities come from economies of density. But this argument
does not necessarily mean that it is optimal to serve an agglomeration of small localities as
if they were a large city.
2.84  Finally, the chances of success are greater than ever due to CORSAN's high level
of current tariffs; the relatively good information that is available on the condition of its
assets; a widespread lack of satisfaction with CORSAN's service provision, in particular in
larger municipalities; and the good chance that exists of having a clear regulatory
framework agreed and in place in the near term.
Ports
2.85   Background. The State of RGS has played an important role in the development
of the region's transportation and commerce, due primarily to its almost 2,000 km of
navigable waterways. The state is linked by the tributaries of the Rio Uruguay, the south-
east basin, two main inland ports of Pelotas and Porto Alegre, and the ocean port of Rio



33
Grande (PRG). Due to its proximity to Argentina and Uruguay, Rio Grande has been a
key player in regional trade. Regional trade has become even more important in recent
years; trade with the US alone in 1994 reached US$12.2 billion, which registered an
increase of 20.4 percent from the previous year.
2.86  Since 1934, the State of RGS has operated its waterways under concessions
granted by the Federal Government. Through the Ministry of Transportation, the Federal
Government oversaw all modes of transportation, including the ports. In 1951, the
Departamento Estadual de Rios, Portos e Canais (DEPRC) was established in RGS to
administer and operate the state's ports. DEPRC's main clients have been the state's
agricultural, agroindustry, and industrial producers.
2.87  Currently, five of PRG's 14 ports are rented to private operators, with the others
operated directly by the state. PRG handles 11.4 million tons of cargo per year and has
depths of up to 40 feet. The private terminals in PRG have increased their share of
merchandise from 38 percent in 1993 to 50 percent in 1995. The Port of Porto Alegre
has 21 terminals (19 of which are privately operated), with depths of up to 17 feet.
2.88  Issues. RGS' publicly operated ports, like many others in Brazil, have suffered
due to years of less than optimal capital investment. This, in conjunction with excessive
centralization, restrictive labor practices, and a number of disincentives for private sector
participation has left the sector with obsolete equipment as well as poor investments,
administration and operation. Brazilian ports have become obstacles in the further
expansion of trade. The influx in imports brought about by lower inflation rates and
relaxed trade regulation under the Plano Real has created further strain on an already
overtaxed system, resulting in long shipping delays in Brazilian ports. The ports operated
by the State of RGS, like the Port of Santos in the State of Sao Paulo, have become
increasingly less competitive within the Mercosul trading bloc. This drop has taken place
over the last three years; over 60 percent of the region's container trade is currently being
routed through the ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo.
2.89  A major factor in this shift has been labor costs. Labor costs alone per item
shipped are one and a half times more than those of the neighboring ports. Payments for
both active and inactive workers currently absorb 80 percent of DEPRC's operating
budget due to high wages and low physical productivity in the state's ports. Labor
assignments are often poorly planned and inefficient, resulting in long waiting and service
times. In some cases, full gangs of 12 workers are required despite the fact that a crew of
three could effectively work with cranes and unload the cargo. Labor unions have
attempted to maintain their monopoly over labor in the ports, and have been successful in
disrupting trade with strikes in other Brazilian ports. High labor costs are partly passed on
to users via port fees, and also result in dwindling maintenance and investment. Excessive
costs have also led to soaring DEPRC indebtedness, which reached Rs. $131 million in
1995.
2.90 The Federal Government's objectives for modernizing ports include: (a) granting
of private concessions to operate public port facilities; (b) the privatization of port
services; and (c) restructuring the various port administration companies to make them
more responsive to shippers. Two important federal laws were passed to modernize the



34
country's ports system. Federal Law 8630, passed on February 25, 1993, established two
separate and independent entities to administer ports: an independent labor organization
(the Orgao de Gestdo de Mao de Obra) and the ports authority council (Conselho de
Autoridade Portuaria). These two entities were created to address some of the most
salient administrative and operational obstacles by ending union control over labor
provision within the ports. The law set a rate of early retirement/voluntary dismissal
compensation for union workers, as well as a bonus for those workers wishing to continue
working in the ports as non-union labor. The law also created a new, smaller entity,
comprised of representatives of the federal, state, and municipal governments, non-union
ports workers, and port users to administer the ports.
2.91  Federal Law 8987, passed in February 1995, officially established the concessions
for ports, ports services, and ports installations (e.g., silos, docks, warehouses, etc.).
Moreover, the law established that all concessions would be granted only after a
prescribed process of public hearings (audienciaspziblicas), and bidding. The law also
allowed for the leasing of undeveloped portions of coast line under the government's
jurisdiction to private exploration. On July 21, 1995, a presidential decree established the
date of April 26, 1996 as the final date for restructuring the country's principal ports,
which includes the Port of Rio Grande. The project is necessary to help accelerate this
restructuring.
2.92 RGS Ports Reform Program. The current administration is reforming the ports
system as a means of improving overall efficiency in the sector, modernizing and
improving its infrastructure, participating more fully in regional trade, and improving
financial performance. The components of RGS ports reform follow below.
2.93 Reorganization of ports administration: Following changes in Federal Law, the
state has reorganized the ports by law, and has divided up the administration of the ports
to optimize the comparative advantages of the Port of Rio Grande in regional trade. Under
Law 10722, DEPRC was charged with the administration of the interior ports, canals, and
waterways. As with the federal law, all services would be concessioned out. The other
entity, the Superintendencia do Porto de Rio Grande (SUPRG), was created under Law
10723 to administer PRG. In addition, this law specifically charged SUPRG with
proposing a plan for zoning and further development of the ports area. SUPRG was also
to create a plan to revitalize the inefficient or unused portions of the existing ports. The
state has also sought to reduce its labor costs by implementing a port corporation,
comprised of representatives from local business and maritime operations as well as
federal, state, and municipal governments, to oversee and administer the ports.
2.94 Reductions in labor costs: The state has already abolished 1,666 vacant positions
within the docks. In addition, as part of the state port reorganization, DEPRC's remaining
staff will be reduced by about 70 percent (or 1,153 staff positions) over three years
through the state-sponsored plan of voluntary departure and early retirement. The number
of staff employed by the ports authorities (DEPRC or SUPRG) declined from 4,222 in
December 1994 to 3,324 in June 1996. Most of this decline was achieved through the
state's early retirement and mutually agreed separation program implemented during
April-May 1996. By further implementing the Federal Ports Modernization Law, the state



35
also intends to entice remaining temporary workers (avulsos) to retire with a bonus of
Rs. $23,300, as determined by the 1993 law. Most importantly, the state is seeking to
reduce its astronomical labor costs by replacing the current union of temporary workers
(avulsos) with independent port operators.
2.95 Granting of private concessions. Under state law, SUPRG will only administer
concessions in the Port of Rio Grande, but will leave the operation of the ports to private
entities. DEPRC will similarly administer all other (interior) state ports. Six public
commercial docks in Rio Grande and one in the Port of Porto Alegre are being
concessioned through rental of the facilities over the next three years. Each concession
will be for 25 years and would be renewable. Included in the concessions will be a
petroleum pier (already awarded); a refrigeration pier; a container terminal and its
installations in Rio Grande (already awarded); a container terminal in Porto Alegre
(already awarded); the wheat-soy terminal, its silos and installations; a liquid bulk terminal
with a storage capacity of 34,000 m3 primarily used for vegetable oils; and a cargo
warehouse. The Government awarded the first three concessions (petrol and container
piers) earlier this year. The last concessions (liquid bulk and wheat-soy) are scheduled for
August 1998. (see Annex J).
2.96 Evaluation of Ports Sector Reforms. Reform in the ports sector is likely to be
sustained and will improve the state's fiscal position and to contribute to economic
efficiency. Strong government ownership and commitment to the reforms originates in the
poor experience that the state has had with public ports, including high labor costs and
inadequate investments. Strong ownership and commitment are evident from the state's
successful passage of enabling legislation and from early scheduled implementation of
concession arrangement for some facilities. The enabling legislation passed last year
addresses the key ports issues by creating a small agency that will only administer the
concessions and establish institutional arrangements to reduce labor costs and award
concessions. Early award of the petroleum pier (albeit concessioned to PETROBRAS, the
only bidder) and the container piers of Rio Grande and Porto Alegre indicates the state's
commitment to delegate ports to private operators. Sustainability is ensured by low
likelihood of reversing long term concession contracts that result in lower costs and better
service.
2.97 Concessions to corporate operators will improve efficiency indicators of ports
services. As pointed out before, these indicators have been adverse for the publicly
operated facilities of Rio Grande, when compared with privately operated ports. The cost
comparisons suggest that potential cost reductions of 25 percent to 50 percent are feasible
by transferring to private operators. The gains in efficiency created merely by reducing the
port's labor costs should also improve Rio Grande's competitiveness regionally, and allow
for greater imports and exports from the state. A further efficiency gain is that concessions
to private operators will raise the levels of capital investments in ports infrastructure.
Investments through the concessions are projected to total Rs. $60 million.
2.98  A negative contribution to fiscal balance is the state's assumption of DEPRC's
Rs.$131 million debt as part of the ports sector reorganization, but this is a forgone cost
to the state and is not attributable to the program. Costs of the reform program include
financing the personnel reduction (severance payments) and various studies. While



36
severance payments and early retirement benefits to ports staff are projected to total about
Rs.$25 million and technical assistance will cost about Rs. $5.1 million, the yearly cost
reductions will reach their peak of about Rs. $25 million in 1998 (the net present value of
this reduction in costs is by itself larger than the size of the debt assumed). The state
intends to pay for the temporary workers bonuses by levying an additional tax of
approximately Rs.$0.50 per ton of cargo for three years, resulting in approximately
Rs.$25 million in revenues. Furthermore, increased ports services through the concessions
will increase the state's ICMS receipts and the new concessions themselves are projected
to generate Rs. $6 million annually by 1998. Finally, a further fiscal gain is that the state
will not be required to fund investments in ports infrastructure. These will now be funded
by the private sector.
2.99  The state runs a number of financial and administrative risks in reforming the ports.
First, and foremost, resistance from the labor unions could upset ports operation, and
mean major losses of trade volume. The state has sought to mediate this risk with the
implementation of voluntary dismissals and early retirements-the early results are
promising (as of February 6, 1996, 612 avulsos had retired), but not conclusive. The state
estimates that an additional 1,000 avulsos will retire over the next two years. The success
of the labor reforms will be crucial, as the unions have been reluctant to change, and have
provided a great deal of opposition to reform throughout the country.
2.100 In addition, some inefficiencies will remain unless the state aggressively grants
concession for basic port services such as tugboats and dredging. Another important risk
to be addressed is the modes of transportation leading to and out of the ports. A 1984
study cited the multi-modal links to the port of Rio Grande as another bottleneck in the
shipping process. As these links are primarily controlled by unions, they, too, have the
potential for disrupting the smooth flow of transportation both in and out of the ports.
Roads
2.101 Background. The State's transportation agency, Departamento Ant6nomo
Estadual de Rodagem (DAER), is responsible for about 8,600 km of state roads (including
2,000 km of federal roads that will be transferred to the state) of which approximately 46
percent are paved. Recent surveys of surface conditions on the paved network indicate
that almost 40 percent are in good condition, with 48 percent and 12 percent in fair and
poor condition respectively. The average daily traffic on the paved network is on the
order of 1,500 vehicles, ranging generally between 500 and 5,000. On the unpaved
network, daily traffic volumes are of lower magnitude, although 75 percent of that
network presently carries more than 200 vehicles per day, which implies considerable
maintenance needs.
2.102 Issues. To maintain its network and invest in new roads, the DAER would require
substantial funding from its primary source, the State Treasury 2. The ability of DAER to
sustain its maintenance and construction program is constrained by the state's
12 About 5 percent of current receipts are derived from the "Community Toll Program".



37
deteriorating fiscal condition. State transfers for current and capital road expenditures
declined from US$169 million in 1991 to US$118 million in 1993 before increasing to
US$373 million in 1994 and declining to US$203 million in 1995. The reduction in road
spending followed the general worsening of the state's fiscal situation.
2.103 DAER falls under the authority of the Secretary of Transportation. It has
sufficient information to develop optimum strategies for resurfacing and overlay works
using the 1DM III model. Some further information is required to set out policies and
priorities at the network level. Existing pavement and cost management systems enable
DAER to monitor cost and performance of road maintenance activities in its 18 districts.
Nevertheless, as with the rest of the public sector, DAER faces severe overstaffing. Its
3,000 employees are about seven times more than necessary, and the agency pays 4,000
retirees.
2.104 Reform Program. To improve efficiency in road maintenance and help the DAER
achieve its maintenance and new construction goals, the current administration has
adopted a two-pronged road sector reform program. The first element of the road sector
reform is the restructuring of the DAER to reduce its operating expenses, principally labor
costs, and to shift its responsibilities from force-account work to planning/policy
development, concession monitoring and supervising maintenance contractors. The
second part of the reform program is to shift maintenance responsibilities to the private
sector through maintenance concessions. This will allow DAER to spread its limited
maintenance budget over more roads and maintain a larger portion of its network in good
repair.
2.105 DAER Restructuring. In 1995 the DAER had a staff of about 4,200 active
personnel that was responsible for the road network, about 10 times as many staff as
required for this level of service. In addition, DAER has inactive retired staff of about
3,800 who are also paid from the State Treasury. To reduce personnel costs, which
consume about 55 percent of the operating budget, DAER participated in the first phase
of the state's voluntary departures program. About 760 employees took advantage of this
program and left DAER. With other withdrawals and retirements, DAER's staff declined
to about 3,000 and the number of retirees increased to 4,000 by September 1996.
2.106 In addition to a reduction in personnel costs, DAER will also reorganize its
personnel to reflect its changing role in road maintenance. Currently, most routine
maintenance activities have been performed by force account. DAER's new policy is to
contract out as much maintenance work as possible. It has begun a pilot program
involving a regional network of about 300 km of paved and unpaved roads to be
maintained by contract over a five-year period.
2.107 Besides contracting out maintenance services, the state has also begun a toll road
program to shift the maintenance cost burden from the State Treasury's general fund to
road users. The program started out as a government-managed activity and is now being
transformed into a toll road maintenance concession reform. Since 1992 DAER has
developed three separate toll road projects covering about 150 km of state highways.
Two of the projects include widening to a dual carriageway and one project involves the
rehabilitation of the existing two-lane facility. Revenues collected from the tolls are used



38
to finance the improvements. DAER contracts out the collection of the tolls and the
roadway improvements. Tolls have been collected on the first project since 1992 and the
remaining projects beginning in 1994. DAER has organized a neighborhood commission
living in the vicinity of the road to monitor the toll revenues and road expenditures. Daily
management oversight of toll collections and the road improvements is provided by the
regional DAER office. By 1995 DAER collected about US$12 million in toll revenue,
almost 10 percent of its operating budget. The success of this program and the need to
further reduce maintenance expenditures has lead DAER and the administration to seek
private participation in a concession program.
2.108 Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Concession Program. DAER developed a
"pole of attraction" (toll concession complex) approach, under which a concessionaire
collects tolls at the junction of three or more roads feeding into a single toll plaza at a
major city and uses the proceeds to rehabilitate and maintain in good condition a given
length of each link passing through that pole, regardless of traffic volume. The basis for
the concession award is the bidder that proposes to maintain the longest length of road
associated with the toll complex.
2.109 The toll complex captures intercity trips traveling on the state and/or federal
highway system"3. The toll charge is only in the exiting direction. The private
concessionaire has the right to collect the toll revenues over a 15-year period and the
obligation to maintain, operate and make road improvements as specified in the concession
contract. DAER will monitor the concessionaire's performance, audit the toll revenues
and also establish an arbitration commission (comisdo arbitral) for each concession,
comprised of one representative each from the concessionaire, DAER, and the trucking
industry 14 to oversee the Concession Contract.
2.110 DAER completed a preliminary engineering and economic analysis to determine
the financial feasibility of establishing toll complex concessions. It has selected nine toll
complexes that will be concessioned with the first scheduled for award by early 1997.
These represent 2,134 km with traffic volumes per day averaging 3,500 and ranging from
1,200 to 7,300 vehicles per day. Selection of bidders will be based on the extent of the
network each tenderer commits to maintain. The bidder list for the first road pole
(Gramado) has already been aproved.
2.111 Selection of Concessionaires. DAER has established a two-phase bidding process
to select concessionaires: pre-qualification and contract award. In the pre-qualification
process, firms will be evaluated on their legal structure, technical qualifications, financial
capacity to undertake the work, and fiscal responsibility"5. In addition to the request for
13 The Federal Govermnent is in the process of transferring its highway network to state governments.
Many of the proposed concession toll complexes are located on existing federal roads, which
introduces an element of political risk.
See below for a further discussion of regulatory issues related to the concessions, and also paragraphs
2.128 et.seq. that describes the recommend regulatory organization for the privatized utilities and
concessions.
15 Compliance with tax payments and social security contributions.



39
technical and financial information, the pre-qualification documents will also provide the
bidders with background material on the general principles and legal basis of the
concession program, obligations of the concessionaire and DAER in the program, the
tariff and monitoring system 16, and the results of the financial feasibility studies17. DAER
has also begun a dialog with potential bidders in formal public hearings, to disseminate
information about the concession program.
2.112 During the pre-qualification process DAER will continue preparing the bid offering
documents. These consist of the "minuta de convocagao" (bidding rules, procedures,
requirements evaluation criteria, etc.); the detailed engineering, economic and financial
analysis of the toll complexes; and a final concession contract. The objective of providing
a detailed concession contract is twofold: to eliminate contract negotiations after the bid
award (thereby saving valuable time) and to remove discretionary interpretation of
concessionaire performance expectations, tariff adjustment procedures and other
regulatory requirements.
2.113 Regulatory Structure. DAER is the legal authority to confer concession rights to
bidders on state and federal highways (including those that have been transferred to the
state or are in the process of being transferred). It is also responsible for
monitoring/regulating the concessionaire's performance, unless a new state law is passed
which delegates this responsibility to a multi-sectoral Regulatory Commission (Paras.
2.128 et.seq.). It expects to contract out the technical and administrative aspects of
regulation, such as compliance with maintenance specifications, calculation of penalties for
non-compliance, auditing of toll collections, etc. DAER's executive committee,
comprised of the Auditor and Directors General of Administration, Operations and
Planning, will approve tariff adjustments, non-compliance penalties, contract amendments,
and the state's compliance with its concession law.
2.114 The state concession law assures the concessionaire of remuneration by charging
users a tariff that maintains the economic and financial balance (equilibrio econ6mico-
financeiro) of the Concession Contract. Economic and financial balance is defined as the
tariff level that provides revenues to cover costs of the service with "fair remuneration"
for the concessionaire. The DAER Executive Committee will define just compensation,
unless this responsibility is delegated to the proposed multi-sectoral regulatory body.
2.115 Evaluation of Concession Program. A positive evaluation of the program is
derived from a satisfactory rate of return of the concessions, a positive fiscal impact, and
strong grounds for sustainability. The following paragraphs elaborate on these criteria.

2.116        Financial Feasibility and Market and Other Risks. DAER has completed a
preliminary engineering and economic analysis to determine the financial feasibility of the
toll complex concessions. The primary factors determining financial feasibility are traffic
volumes and project costs. The preliminary analysis uses traffic projections based on a
1991 origin and destination survey completed by DAER traffic forecasting consultants.
The results of the survey have been combined with current and historical vehicle volume
data into a standard traffic forecasting model. Maintenance and operating costs have been
developed in detail for each toll complex by DAER's engineering consultants. They have
provided operating and maintenance cost data for different lengths of road to test the rate
of return for varying segments of the toll complexes.
2.117 The traffic and cost data were then combined into a financial-economic analysis
and project rates of returns calculated for different lengths of road in each toll complex.
The preliminary financial analysis completed by DAER uses a 14 percent rate of return as
the benchmark to determine the length of road the concessionaire would maintain. This
allows the bidder to trade-off length against his return as demonstrated in the preliminary
financial analysis. The rate of return analysis provided in the preliminary feasibility study
indicates that most of the roads will attract private participation, although some of the
lower traffic volume complexes may have to be combined with higher toll complex roads
to be viable. The results of the preliminary feasibility analysis are shown in Table 2.10.
2.118 The range of rates of retum illustrated in Table 2.10 indicate that some of the poles
are exposed to a significant market risk originating in uncertain future traffic volumes and
toll revenues as expressed in the rate of return (higher retum, lower market risk). The



41
Santa Maria pole achieves returns between 1 percent and 5 percent for road lengths of 200
and 181 km, respectively. Vacaria and Carazinho have returns from 5 percent to 14
percent for road lengths varying from 100 to 250 km. These poles may not attract bidders
because the length of road may have to shrink to a level that makes it impractical for the
concessionaire to bid. Grouping the low and high traffic volume toll complexes into a
single concession, such as Santa Maria with Metropolitano, may ameliorate this problem
and make these complexes financially feasible.
2.119 Other major market risks from the point of view of the concessionaire include: (i)
regional economic factors that reduce traffic volumes (employment, economic growth,
vehicle operating and new auto costs, etc.); (ii) toll evasion"8; (iii) competing free or tolled
highway that diverts vehicles from the concession toll complex; (iv) increasing operating
and maintenance cost not captured by the proposed tariff inflation adjustment index; (v)
increased insurance premiums due to a high level of accidents and third party liability suits;
(vi) force majeure events that close the highway (e.g. floods) which are not insured or
increase insurance premiums; and (vii) unexpected right-of-way costs associated with
carriageway expansion.
2.120  Other political, financial, and operating risks include: (i) Government approval of a
competing free of tolled highway parallel to the concessionaire's toll road; (ii) failure of
the Government to adjust the tariff according to the inflation index in an expeditious
manner resulting in revenue losses; (iii) DAER interpretation of the "financial-economic
equilibrium" requirement that reduces the concessionaire's return below its cost of capital
(see paragraph 2.114 above); (iv). DAER amendments to the Concession Contract that
require additional expenditures; (v) penalties for non-compliance; (vi) failure of the
government to manage traffic on the non-tolled portion of the highway network resulting
in reduced traffic volumes; (vii) interest rate volatility that raises the concessionaire's cost
of working capital without a corresponding increase in the toll rate; and (viii) Government
termination of the Concession Contract.
2.121 These are some of the risks that the concessionaire and the government will need
to mitigate through appropriate mechanisms, the most important of which is the structure
and responsibilities of the regulatory body which will monitor and interpret the Concession
Contracts. Currently the concession regulation falls under the jurisdiction of the DAER
executive committee, an arm of the Government. A multi-sectoral regulatory body for the
state's privatization and concession program has been approved by the State Assembly,
that will broaden participation of stakeholders in the regulatory process. This should
provide the toll complex concessionaires with greater comfort regarding exposure to
political risks.
Is Fare evasion is common in one of DAER's existing public toll roads. The reason for fare evasion is the
toll road's semi-urban location and relatively easy access to a detour around the toll facility. The
vehicle travel time around the toll plaza is short enough to induce people to evade the toll plaza. The
private concession toll plazas will be located on embankments in rural areas providing little
opportunity for detours.



42
2.122 Project Cost and Fiscal Impact. The DAER will spend approximately Rs.$12
million to develop the concession program. The high cost is related to the detailed
engineering that was done to estimate the cost and schedule of operating and maintenance
improvements for each segment of each toll complex, over 2,500 km of highway. Traffic
forecasting, legal and economic consultants also contributed to the cost. In addition to
program development costs, DAER will require annual funding of about Rs.$186,000 per
year for concession supervision and monitoring. These costs will be paid by the
concessionaire.
2.123 Table 2.10 above indicates that DAER will save from Rs.$844 million to Rs.$1
billion over the 15 year period of the concessions at 1995 prices or about Rs.$56 million
to Rs.$66 million per year. This savings ranges from 49 percent to 57 percent of DAER's
1996 operating budget These figures represent potential, not actual savings over the
concession period. The State Treasury could not afford to invest Rs.$56 to Rs.$66
million per year on 2,500 km of highway network. This is over Rs.$22,000 per km, more
than five times as much the current DAER maintenance budget.
2.124 Sustainability. The concession program is self-supporting and should be sustained
over the long term without subsidies from the State Treasury. Toll revenues should be
sufficient to cover costs and provide the private concessionaire with a sufficient return on
equity. It is critical that the government allocate market risk to the private concessionaire
to limit its exposure to traffic fluctuations and a bailout of the concessionaire with
resulting negative impacts on the State Treasury. However, a state law that requires "just
compensation" for the concessionaire places the state at risk for some form of
concessionaire rescue in case of a large fall in traffic and toll revenues.
Other Privatizations
2.125 BAGERGS and Companhia de Seguros Reais. The Government will also sell
BAGERGS -- a warehouse company owned by the State Commercial Bank
(BANRISUL) --, and Unido de Seguros Reais, an insurance company also controlled (76
percent) by BANRISUL. BAGERGS's chief business is the storage of imports and
exports, as the Federal Government awarded the company the contract for customs
warehouse. Sale of the company will extinguish that contract. The company also operates
a silo for agricultural and industrial products. The estimated value of the company is
Rs. $20 million, which originates chiefly in its real estate assets. The sale of BAGERGS is
expected to occur by 1997. Unido de Seguros has offices in Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro,
Parana, Santa Catarina and RGS. It has a book value of Rs. $40 million and will be
evaluated by the Brazilian bank Bozano-Simonsen. Sale of the company is expected to
occur in 1997.
2.126 Thus far the Government has not taken any action to privatize its banks, which
include BANRISUL (a commercial bank with Rs.$6.8 million in assets in December 1995)
and CEERS (a low-cost housing mortgage bank with Rs.$1.3 million in assets in
December 1995). The Government believed in 1995 that it would not achieve the
required political consensus to privatize these banks and therefore excluded them from the
privatization program. Mere attempts to merge BANRISUL and CEERS generated a



43
considerable amount of controversy which the state did not want to intensify by putting
privatization on the table. While the financial condition of these banks is not as bad as
BANERJ or BANESPA, their commercially inefficient operation remains a financial risk
to the state. Rates of return on equity, although positive, have been poor and declining and
portfolio quality is doubtful. Bolstered by emerging public bank privatizations, the
Government is now publicly renewing its reform proposals, which now would include the
merger of BANRISUL and CEERS with the federally-owned Banco Meridional and part
of a small development bank (BRDE, actually a department of BANRISUL), with the
possibility of privatizing the merger sometime in the future.
Regulation of Infrastructure Services
2.127 Current Status. Until recently, there was little formal regulation of infrastructure
services, although two agencies (in roads and ports) were about to oversee concessions in
their respective areas. The Secretary of Energy was also planning as part of the reforms in
the electricity sector to introduce a Commission for Energy Regulation. Independently, a
deputy in the State Assembly was proposing to introduce legislation which would create a
State Code for Quality of Public Services, together with a State Council on Public Service
Quality to implement the Code.
2.128 Responsibility for monitoring and oversight of leases and concessions in the ports
sector is, for instance, being undertaken by the Superintendency of the Port of Rio Grande
with ultimate responsibility for regulatory matters held by the Conselho de Autoridade
Portudria (CAP), a council consisting of members of the three levels of government, port
operators, private concessionaires, consumers, workers and private operators. The lease
contracts used in the port reform program (for instance, for the petroleum pier) do not
have a requirement for periodic readjustment of the terms of the contract. The contract for
operation of the container terminal, however, which includes a requirement to construct
new terminals, includes periodic contract revisions after every six years. The contract is
also slightly longer-lasting a total of 25 years. This contract will therefore require
expertise in reviewing reasonable rates of return in resetting prices, a standard regulatory
problem. In toll roads, responsibility for regulation of the new toll roads scheme is with
the Department of Roads (DAER) that is designing the scheme.
2.129 Issues. With concessions being implemented in several sectors, regulation of
infrastructure services has become a primary concern for the RGS government. The trend
emerging in RGS thus far has been to delegate regulatory responsibilities to specialized
independent authorities. Nevertheless, international experience shows that most state-level
governments establish multi-sectoral regulatory entities rather than a proliferation of
sector-specific agencies, and the same trend is emerging for national-level regulators in
many countries. The main advantages of establishing regulatory entities on a cross-
sectoral basis include:
Saving resources and hence lowering the costs of regulation-senior
professionals (e.g., economists, lawyers, and financial specialists) and
administrative resources can be shared between sectors.



44
*   Facilitating learning between industries-many of the most difficult regulatory
issues in the public services sector are substantially identical across sectors. A
multi-sectoral entity facilitates the sharing of experience among sectors, which
can be particularly important when experience in regulation is limited.
*   Consistent approaches to similar issues in different sectors can also help to
reinforce the legitimacy of the entity's decisions.
*   Reducing the risk of political interference in an independent entity-the
broader constituency and higher profile of a multi-sectoral entity increases the
stakes of governments engaging in improper interference.
*   Reducing the risk of the regulator being "captured" by the regulated
industry-the broader industry coverage and constituency dilutes the
otherwise very close relationship between the regulator and a particular
industry, thus making it less vulnerable to "capture."
2.130 In the context of the State of RGS there is also an additional advantage of
choosing a multi-sectoral agency rather than a series of sector-specific agencies. In many
sectors the scope of the state's regulatory competence is not fully defined, and will likely
evolve over time. In these circumstances, it would be imprudent to establish dedicated
sector-specific entities for sectors such as electricity or water and sanitation until that
competence is better defined. Creating a multi-sectoral agency that focuses initially on,
for instance, transport and telecommunications allows skills and experience in regulatory
matters to be developed and then extended to sectors such as water and sanitation and
electricity once the state's responsibilities in those sectors are clarified.
2.131 The Government's Program. With these considerations in mind, the Government
decided to move in the direction of pooling its regulatory expertise into a single cross-
sectoral regulatory agency with regulatory responsibility for tasks within the state's
competence. Accordingly, the Government submitted and the State Assembly approved in
December 1996 new legislation creating a cross-sectoral agency. This legislation will
become effective in March 1997. If this model is seen as too restrictive, for instance by
taking power away from existing authorities such as the Superintendency of Ports and
DAER, the regulatory agency could act as a direct regulator for certain services, i.e.,
electricity distribution, water and sanitation, local telephone service and act as an appeals
body for concessions in ports and toll roads. The Government will need to address several
issues in this strategy:
* Definition of Public Services Within Regulatory Competence of the State:
The 1988 Constitution allocates responsibility for regulating public services
between federal, state and municipal tiers of government. In a number of
areas, the scope of state competence is uncertain or requires delegations from
municipal or Federal Governments through convenios or decrees. In the water
and sewerage sector, the precise scope of state responsibility remains to be
fully defined, and significant state competence will probably require a
delegation of authority from municipalities. The state lacks any Constitutional
competence to regulate electricity distribution or local telephone service, but
officials anticipate that the Federal Government may delegate some regulatory



45
responsibilities in these areas. Only in the transport sector are there a number
of activities that seem clearly to fall within state competence, and regulatory
policy can be determined without awaiting decisions by the Federal
Government. Under the new law, the scope of the cross-sectoral agency is
constrained by responsibilities already assigned to other federal agencies.
Implementation Strategy: The Government's strategy for implementing the
new regulatory entity is being shaped by three main considerations: (i) the
importance of establishing the entity as soon as possible to regulate private
infrastructure operators, the first major one of which was awarded in late
1996 (strategic private investor in telecommunications). Establishment of the
entity before privatization would provide comfort and certainty to investors
and consumers, facilitate orderly transition of ownership, and also allow an
opportunity to train regulatory personnel; (ii) the importance of establishing at
least the key safeguards for the entity's independence in law, rather than
decree, to reinforce the independence and stability of the new institution; and
(iii) current uncertainties over the precise scope of the entity's role and
responsibilities in relation to some sectors, most particularly water,
telecommunications and electricity. The new law will come into effect in
March 1997, prior to most key privatizations under the State's Reform
Program. The scope of the law will nonetheless remain subject to resolution
of uncertainities regarding the allocation of regulatory responsibilities among
the federal and subnational levels.
* Ensuring Sector-Specific Expertise. The main challenge in establishing multi-
sectoral entities is to ensure that sector-specific expertise is not compromised.
Most multi-sectoral entities have met this challenge by creating strong sector-
specific departments within the entity, as well as some departments with a
cross-sectoral coverage (e.g., central policy department, administration
department). The formal decision-making structure for the entity remains
cross-sectoral in nature and, as discussed below, typically involves
professionals with cross-sectoral rather than industry-specific technical
expertise. Multi-sectoral agencies may often be guided by sector-specific
advisory or consultative groups that comprise representatives of users and
concessionaires. These issues will be resolved through enactment of a new
law creating the staffing structure of the new regulatory entity.
* Ensuring Independence and Accountability. There is growing consensus
internationally that the long term viability and efficiency of public services will
best be achieved by moving responsibility for regulatory decisions on issues
such as tariffs away from the political process and into the hands of a more
independent regulatory entity. This new reform model has been adopted by a
growing number of reforming countries in the Latin America and Europe.
While most independent regulators are formally part of the Executive Branch
of the government, the regulator has an independent legal mandate and is
required to fulfill that mandate at arm's length from the day-to-day political
process, the regulated industry, consumers and other interest groups. In many



46
respects such regulators are akin to judges -- independent experts that are
entrusted to make decisions in the public interest and in accordance with law.
RGS new regulatory agency is part of the Executive Branch, with the
governor appointing three of its seven directors. RGS chose a representative
model to balance the power awarded to the governor.
*   Choosing the Regulators. A key issue is whether decision-making authority
should be vested in an individual or a commission. To avoid undue
personalization of the process and excessive concentration of power,
international experience leans to creating a commission. The size should be
small -- of three or perhaps five people -- to avoid slow decision-making and
strengthen the accountability of individual members. A second issue is what
qualifications should be required for appointment to the commission. Options
are representation of particular interest groups, industry-specific experts for
each regulated sector, or professionals with expertise in broad, cross-cutting
disciplines. The latter appears to be the best, as it permits a broad, objective
and balanced evaluation of regulatory questions from multiple perspectives.
The new RGS law creates a council of seven directors appointed by the
Governor (4), consumers (2) and concessionaires (1).
*   Views of consumers and other interest groups. To ensure adequate
information for regulatory decisions, the appointed regulators can obtain the
views of consumers and interest groups through special advisory or
consultative bodies or by allowing these groups to present their views in
regulatory proceedings.
-   Staffing the Entity. International experience is that "small is beautiful": a large
staff increases the costs of regulation and can also encourage "excessive"
regulatory interventions, such as when staff place unjustified demands for
information on concessionaires primarily to justify their pay-checks. The
preferred staffing strategy will usually be to start with a very small staff and
engage short-term consultants to assist with specific problems encountered
during the initial start-up period. Additional staff should only be recruited
once the need is clearly demonstrated. A new law will create the staffing
structure of RGS new regulatory entity, which is expected to be initially very
small.
Funding the Entity. Most independent regulatory entities are funded from
levies on regulated firms or consumers, rather than the general budget. This
reinforces the independence of the entity while reducing the burden on
government budgets. The new law creates a conflict of interest by specifying
fines as a source of revenue. This provision may be reviewed at a later stage.
2.132 The new law covers:
*  the general nature and mission of the entity (Articles 2-4);
*  the basic decision-making structure, including appointments and appeal
arrangements (Articles 5-7; 10-13);
*  the key safeguards of independence and accountability (Articles 7-8, 14);



47
*   the power to demand information from regulated firms (Article 4-VIII); and
*   the nature of funding and staffing arrangements (Articles 15-16)
The new law does not attempt to define in detail the entity's responsibilities in each sector,
nor enter into detailed questions of how each sector will be regulated. Rather, it describes
the nature of the entity's responsibilities by reference to a general formula and indicates the
entity's specific powers and responsibilities to enforce sector-specific laws, decrees or
concessions. This approach provides the maximum flexibility to adapt the entity's
responsibilities to later decisions on detailed regulatory arrangements in each sector. It
also provides a high degree of certainty as to what the entity is and is not empowered to
do.



3. THE PROJECT
Project Objective
3.1   The Bank strategy envisages support for reform programs in a number of Brazilian
states, including RGS. In contrast to prior support to the states, the present approach has
been to focus on overall state reform. The Bank has been providing some of this support
through non-lending activities. The diagnosis and framework for much of the fiscal
adjustment of the reform program was developed in a prior sector study that developed
options on reform to address the debt crises of the State. The Bank also provided
considerable assistance in developing a diagnosis and options for pension reform,
privatization and concessions, and regulation of public services provided by the private
sector. These non-lending objectives focus on the broad reform program being
undertaken by the state. In addition, the objective of the proposed State Reform Project is
more specifically to improve the efficiency in the delivery of the state government's
services through privatization and improve the state's fiscal condition. The project is
tailored to support successful implementation of RGS more limited privatization and
fiscal reforms. Unlike other states the Bank is assisting, RGS is not privatizing its banks in
the near future. Furthermore, the scope of its civil service reform and fiscal adjustment is
limited by the federal constitution's prohibition to dismiss statutorially confirmed staff to
a larger extent than in other states (where the number of contractual staff not covered by
the constitutional provision is more significant).
Project Description
3.2   The project consists of the carrying out of activities linked to the project objective
described above. These activities comprise technical assistance, restructuring of public
enterprises that adopt voluntary departure programs, and subprojects and programs to
mitigate the costs of the reforms, including priority investments and social assistance
projects and programs. A loan in the amount of US$125 million would help finance the
costs of the reforms and the high priority investments.
Conditions to Release Disbursements
3.3   The Government's program is described in the Government's Reform Program
Letter (see MOP - Annex A). The reforms supported by the project include: (i) actions to
improve the efficiency and curtail the size of the government expenditures, and thereby
contribute to improve the efficiency and curtain the size of government expenditures, and
thereby, contribute to improve the state's financial condition; (ii) privatization of state



49
services, including the state's telecommunications and power companies and concession of
ports, road maintenance, and water production and distribution. To achieve its objective,
the loan disburses against time-slice project costs following successful implementation of a
set of key selected reforms from the program. Successful implementation has been
assessed prior to board presentation and would be further assessed in two reviews of
implementation of reforms in all areas except water and one review of implementation of
water sector reforms. The first time-slice disbursement (US$50 million) would be released
promptly after loan effectiveness. A second time-slice disbursement of US$25 million
would be released following a positive first Project Review of agreed actions in all areas
except implementation of water concessions. A third time-slice disbursement of US$30
million would be released following a positive second Project Review of agreed actions in
all areas except implementation of water concessions. An additional disbursement of
US$20 million would be released following a positive review of water sector concessions.
The first review linked to actions in all areas except water would take place approximately
in September 1997. The second review linked to actions in all areas except water would
take place approximately in June 1998. The review of water sector reforms is expected to
take place in September 1998. The key selected reforms/actions and the proposed
performance benchmarks, summarized in Annex B, are discussed in the following
paragraphs.
Expenditure Reviews
3.4   The project reviews will include a review of the compliance by the state of agreed
expenditure performance aimed at strengthening fiscal restraint and enhancing the
efficiency of public expenditures. Under the public expenditure review (PER) the
Government and the Bank will assess the outcome of Government's efforts to achieve
fiscal restraint through containment of indebtedness and expenditures. The Government's
Reform Program Letter to the Bank indicates the government's intentions regarding (i)
personnel cost reductions; (ii) tax administration improvements; (iii) new investment and
borrowing; (iv) use of privatization proceeds; and (v) overall fiscal outcomes. Under the
PER, the Bank will verify that the Government's performance is substantially consistent
with its investment and investment financing program (paragraph 2.17). The Bank will
specifically assess whether or not: (i) investment expenditures are economically or socially
productive; (ii) overall levels of debt to revenue decline in accordance with the recent debt
agreement; (iii) investment levels and investment financing are consistent with the
achievement of overall debt/revenue targets; (iv) planned personnel cost reductions are
implemented following constitutional administrative reform; and (v) the Government
implements stated policies to increase tax collection.
Privatization and Concessions
3.5   Selected reforms include actions to privatize CRT and CEEE and to award
concessions of water and sewerage services, ports services, and road maintenance.
Performance benchmarks include the effective transfer of the agreed ownership interest
and management control of CRT and CEEE and the effective transfer of assets to be



50
awarded in concession to the selected concessionaires for road maintenance, water, and
ports.
3.6   Privatization of CEEE. The agreed implementation of power sector reforms can
be summarized in two general areas: (i) a matrix of events, as part of the general matrix of
events of the State Reform Project; and (ii) a timetable of activities to achieve those events
in the matrix. The matrix of events is as follows: (i) the Government hired consultants,
prior to appraisal, to develop the new institutional framework for the power sector in the
state and for the economic/financial evaluation of CEEE; (ii) by Negotiations, the
Government submitted the consultant results of the corporate organization for the splitting
of CEEE into different generation, transmission, and distribution companies as
recommended; (iii) by the second Project Review (about June 1998) the Government will
have privatized distribution companies North and West. Annex G indicates the time-table
of activities being undertaken to achieve these events.
3.7   Privatization of CRT. Under the agreed policy matrix, the privatization of CRT
will be completed by the first Project Review. The Government already sold 35 percent of
CRT's shares to a private strategic investor and will soon transfer key managerial
functions to this investor. Transfer of these functions is a condition of a positive first
Project Review. Annex H describes the key actions and the detailed timetable of these
actions.
3.8   Water Concessions. Under the program, the Government will award concessions
or full service management contracts covering a minimum urban population of 800,000,
provided that a minimum 200,000 will be covered by direct concessions and that a
minimum of 600,000 will correspond to population covered thus far by CORSAN.
Satisfactory concessions with the indicated coverage would be a condition for release of
the US$20 million time-slice disbursement linked to water reforms. The Government will
hire a consultant to assist in designing and implementing the program. The draft
consultant's report would be completed by the first Project Review. Annex I indicates the
detailed timetable of actions to achieve privatization.
3.9   Ports Concessions. The Government has already awarded the concession of the
petroleum pier. Under the project, the Government will award concessions of the
container terminal and the wheat-soy terminal in the Port of Rio Grande prior to the first
Project Review. Furthermore, the Government will award concessions of the
refrigeration pier, the liquid bulk terminal and Porto Novo Storage facility in Rio Grande
prior to the second Project Review. Annex J provides the detailed implementation
timetables.
3.10 Roads Concessions. Under the program, the Government will award a minimum
of three road poles prior to the first Project Review and a minimum of four additional road
poles prior to the second Project Review. DAER is already beginning prequalification. It
plans to offer all concessions by the first semester of 1997.



51
Environmental Aspects
3.11   The RGS State Reform Program will not have adverse environmental impacts. The
program will likely improve environmental performance through better environmental
oversight of current state enterprises as well as increased investment in and improved
management of water and sanitation systems. The project has been classified with a "B"
environmental impact category. Annex K reviews environmental problems and policies in
RGS and provides a detailed discussion of environmental aspects of the RGS State
Reform Program.
3.12  It was agreed that for each company or activity with potentially significant
environmental problems that, after the time of appraisal, will be prepared for privatization
under the Program, the environmental obligations of the new owner/operator would be
determined before the time of sale/concessioning in order to: (a) reduce the uncertainty for
potential private sector investors about their environmental obligations; and (b) allow
improvements in environmental performance of the affected operations. Following an
environmental audit, and still before the time of concessioning or sale, agreement would
be reached among the responsible entities on environmental performance targets including
the time and the responsible party for remedying the identified problems. To facilitate the
integration of environmental concerns, it was further agreed that the State Government
will include the State Environmental Agency (FEPAM) in all related discussions on
privatizations under the State Reform Program.
3.13  Water and Sanitation. The water and sanitation sector is, for most conventional
pollutants, the main source of water pollution in the state. Currently, there is very little
sewage treatment, and raw sewage from sewage collection systems and uncollected
runoffs directly enter the waterbodies. One of the reasons for considering increased private
sector participation in the water and sanitation sector is the need to generate the financing
needed to expand basic sanitation services and associated wastewater treatment. The
planned reforms have, thus, a significant positive environmental effect, and if properly
designed, can contribute to improved environmental management in the state.
3.14  Since the environmental targets to be set for the new utilities will be a critical
factor in determining both the economic feasibility and the environmental consequences of
restructuring, it is of critical importance that a consistent set of environmental targets and
obligations for the restructured utilities be developed early in the process through a
coordinated mechanism between the water and sanitation sector on the one hand, and the
environment sector on the other.
3.15  So far, specific locations and timetables for the restructuring of the privatization of
water and sanitation systems have not been decided. However, it was agreed that the
privatization process of the water and sanitation sector would include the following steps:
a) The detailed work of the consultants to be hired to study options and design
the process for water and sanitation sector privatizations would include an
analysis of different wastewater treatment targets over time, their impact on
water quality and environmental damages, as well as their costs and



52
implications for other concession parameters such as service expansion and
tariffs.
b) The environmental agency (FEPAM) would participate in the related
Government discussions on the design of the water and sanitation concessions
based on the above mentioned study. Wastewater treatment targets over time
would be agreed between FEPAM and the other relevant Government agencies
before the time of privatization of the respective system.
c) An environmental audit of each system to be privatized would be contracted by
the Government and completed before the time of privatization of the
respective system. Audits could include, inter alia, water quality and sampling
methods, wastewater discharges, and disposal of solid waste from wastewater
treatment plants. A time-bound plan of action to address the identified
environmental problems would be agreed between the responsible Government
agencies and the future concessionaire. The Terms of Reference for such audit
would be sent to the Bank for review and approval.
d) The Secretary of Health is in the process of setting up a system for the
supervision and enforcement of applicable drinking water quality standards for
all water operators in the state. The development of this system will be
pursued as a matter of priority, and such a system would be fully operational
for the relevant service areas before the time of privatization of any water
system.
e) The concession will provide for a transition from a regime with fixed targets
into the emerging system of water basin management by water basin
committees. Water and sanitation companies would be members of such water
basin committees with all rights and obligations including the payment of water
and effluent charges, which would be phased in over a period of several years.
3.16 Ports. The Instituto Brasileiro do Meio-Ambiente (IBAMA) is responsible for the
environmental licensing and enforcement of port terminals to be concessioned under the
project. However, these terminals currently operate without the required environmental
license. It was agreed that, for those terminals that have already been concessioned or are
about to be concessioned (petroleum, containers, wheat and soybean), the concession
contract (or where applicable the bidding documents) would include a clause requiring the
concessionaire to undertake and submit to IBAMA, within two months of contracting, an
environmental audit of the facilities. Based on this audit, IBAMA would determine
environmental obligations and issue the applicable operating license. For those terminals to
be concessioned in 1997 and later, the state would contract consultants to undertake an
environmental audit that would be submitted to IBAMA for issuance of the applicable
operating license before the time of concessioning.
3.17 Roads. Road maintenance works do not require an environmental license.
However, it was agreed that the road maintenance contracts would include explicit clauses
ensuring the environmentally acceptable behavior of the contractors (covering issues such
as construction wastes, construction camp management and equipment maintenance). The
contracts would be enforced by DAER. In addition, the contracts would require a valid



53
environmental license for extraction and disposal sites, borrow pits, and asphalt plants.
These licenses are issued and enforced by FEPAM.
3.18  Some of the roads, whose maintenance works will be concessioned, were
constructed without the legally required environmental license. Since this situation can
create legal impediments for the execution of maintenance works on these roads, FEPAM
and DAER will take the necessary steps to regularize the legal situation for all roads
whose maintenance is to be contracted under the program and which do not operate under
a legally required license.
3.19  Electricity. The project only includes the privatization of two electricity
distribution companies, which are generally associated with only minor environmental
issues. A review of environmental issues at CEEE has recently been completed. If this
document does not contain a sufficient analysis of environmental problems in the
distribution sector, the Government would include a more detailed environmental audit of
the distribution companies in the contract for the consultants that will prepare these
companies for sale. Prior to the sale of the distribution companies, FEPAM and CEEE will
agree on a compliance schedule to remedy identified environmental problems in the
respective part of CEEE.
Implementation Arrangements
3.20 The RGS State Reform Program is being implemented under the State Governor's
direction and the Planning Secretariat's coordination. Given the breadth of the program,
several participating agencies and PEs are involved. In addition to overall program
coordination, the Planning Secretariat is responsible for specifically coordinating the water
sector reform program and implementing management contracts with PEs. Other key
agencies for project implementation are the Finance Secretariat, which takes the lead in
public finance and debt reforms, including the upgrading of its own administration; the
Public Works Secretariat, which coordinates the CRT/CEEE privatizations and roads
concessions; and DEPRC, which implements ports concessions.
3.21  Project supervision will be coordinated by a Project Implementation Unit within
the Planning Secretariat and would focus on: (a) continuous monitoring of progress in the
different reform areas; (b) evaluation of compliance with performance benchmarks prior
to release of time-slice disbursements; and (c) compliance with procurement, disbursement
and auditing agreements which would be reflected in a Project Manual to be approved by
the Bank prior to effectiveness. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been
established in the Secretariat of Planning to manage all aspects of project implementation
and review, including monitoring of the reform program and management of all
operational aspects. Each of the secretariats participating in the reform program or using
loan resources would name representatives necessary for reform monitoring and/or
operations (e.g., procurement, accounting, disbursement, and auditing issues). The
general coordinator of the PIU would be the Secretary of Planning. The PIU would have
an Executive Coordinator that would handle day-to-day operations and two full-time
senior staff members, one of whom would be responsible for monitoring the reform
program and the other who would handle operational matters and necessary support staff.



54
3.22  To assure adequate reform monitoring and also that subprojects are adequately
evaluated and the procurement thereunder performed in strict conformity with Bank
guidelines, a concise Project Manual (PM) would be prepared to lay down detailed rules
and procedures for subproject evaluation, procurement, disbursement, accounting,
reporting, and auditing. The issuance of a final version of this PM acceptable to the Bank
that would only be modified with the Bank's no objection will be a condition of
effectiveness. State agencies identified in the PM will be responsible for procurement,
disbursement, and accounting for each of the different activities with review as also
specified in the PM.
Project Costs and Financing
3.23  To implement its reform program, the Government will incur several costs covered
by the project. These include severance payments, consultant reports, purchases of goods
(e.g., hardware and software) to modernize state agencies, and outlays on high priority
investments and social assistance programs during the adjustment period. Only the items
listed below would be eligible for Bank financing in the time-slices. To avoid increasing
the state's overall budget deficit, the proposed time-slice expenditures will not add to
overall spending. It is sought that disbursement to finance these costs proceed quickly
following implementation of the agreed policies discussed above in order to meet the
Government's financing needs during the adjustment period. Annex N provides more
detailed descriptions of each component, its cost, and how it should be evaluated.
Goods, Works, Consultant Services and Training
3.24  This includes reform-related studies: audits and training; reform-related equipment
and rehabilitation works; high priority investments in land management and rural poverty
alleviation, high priority investments in highway rehabilitation; and high priority
investments in school and hospital rehabilitation.
3.25 Reform-related Expenditures. The reform-related studies, audits, training and
equipment (office equipment, including PCs and computer software) are needed to define
and/or implement the reforms supported by the project. Therefore, these expenses are
linked to the achievement of the project objectives, and may include diagnostic or
implementation studies to undertake the privatization actions in the sectors supported by
the project (telecommunications, energy, roads, ports or water). There may also be
studies, training, or equipment that raise the efficiency of public expenditure. The
economic profitability, sustainability and risks of these items are linked to the profitability,
sustainability and risks of the privatization and public expenditure actions which were
discussed in chapter 2 of this report.
3.26 High Priority Investments. In addition to the reforms, the project will include
high priority investment subprojects during the adjustment period, including land
management and rural poverty alleviation to ensure that these environmental and poverty
programs are fully funded during the adjustment; and rehabilitation and maintenance of



55
roads, schools, hospitals, and health posts to assure that the physical assets of the state do
not deteriorate during the adjustment period.
3.27  To ensure that the investment subprojects in land management and rural poverty
alleviation, and highway rehabilitation are of the highest priority, financing would
complement that of proposed Bank projects scheduled for Board presentation in FY97.
Both of these projects have been pre-appraised and will be submitted to the Board after
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement for this operation. For example, if the state complies
with the SRL time-slice conditions, the loan would finance upto US$15 million of the
US$50 million of road rehabilitation works to be done in 1997 and 1998 under the
proposed State Highway Management Loan to RGS. Essentially the same procedures
would be applied for the proposed Land Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Loan,
in which the State Reform Loan would finance up to US$15 million of the US$60 million
to be spent on goods and works to be financed in 1997 and 1998. This SRL financing
would, of course, be in addition to the financing under both loans. These methods would
be described in the Project Manual. In the case of the social sectors, simple evaluation
criteria for maintenance and rehabilitation would be provided in the Project Manual.
Severance Payments
3.28  This includes severance payments to employees of reforming state enterprises.
The loan would finance the cost of severance pay under the Voluntary Departures
Programs (PDVs) of CRT and CEEE, and also possibly CESA, CEASA, CORSAN, and
other enterprises. In all cases, the PDVs of each enterprise must meet the criteria
established by the Bank, as did those of the above listed enterprises (for details, including
a financial and economic cost-benefit analysis for CEEE and CRT, see Annex M).
Although the following discussion of compliance with Bank criteria covers only the PDV
of CRT and CEEE, the findings would be similar to those carried out by the other
enterprises listed above:
(a)   Impact on Productivity: The PDVs were initiated in CRT and CEEE only
after careful studies to develop a strategy to improve the enterprises'
overall productivity. The PDV was just one element of these strategies.
Each enterprise signed a management contract with the state government
that includes the strategy for increasing productivity and performance
indicators and targets to monitor its success in implementing the strategy.
The enterprises are also revising their career and salary plans to assure that
the remaining employees are more effectively utilized.
(b) Measures to Avoid Reversal: PDV legislation requires any ex-employee
who has accepted a PDV package to return the full amount of his
withdrawal package if he reenters any state entity. Increased private sector
participation should increase market discipline in both CRT and CEEE.
This rehiring rule would be enforced by a number of state government
entities. In calibrating the severance payments for the PDV, the state took
into account obligations toward employees, applicable laws; prevailing



56
labor market conditions; and the affordability and replicability of the
package.
(c)    Steps Taken to Mitigate Negative Impacts. Both enterprises set up
programs to provide information and counseling on the benefits of the
PDV to all eligible employees. In addition, employees opting for
withdrawal could participate in training programs and career counseling.
For example, in CRT, each participant was eligible for 30 hours of
coursework in a wide variety of fields, plus 5 hours of individual
consulting. The state federation of industries also provided training on
opening a small business through its training arm.
(d)    Economic and Financial Analysis. Economic cost-benefit analysis showed
internal economic rates of return (IERR) of 96 percent for CRT and 112
percent for CEEE. The internal financial rate of return was 66 percent for
CEEE and 57 percent for CRT.
Grants
3.29   These include transfers to municipalities and private institutions. They cover
incremental expenditures for early childhood, public health, sanitation and basic education.
These expenditures are justified on the grounds of alleviating the social impact that the
reform program may have, particularly arising from the financial duress that the public
sector will experience in its quest for fiscal balance.
Incremental Recurrent Costs
3.30   These are defined as direct (i.e., non-transfer) costs incurred by the RGS
government in connection with social assistance programs also aimed at mitigating the
social impact of reforms. These target direct additional expenditures for public health,
education and training. They are justified on the same grounds as the grants discussed
above.
3.31   An example of these costs is the decentralization of school materials purchasing
and contracting of small repairs to democratically elected school councils and directors in
each school (see paragraph 2.31). The SRL will finance the incremental recurrent costs of
this program on a declining basis.' This reform was instituted by the Law of Democratic
Management of Public Schooling (Lei No. 10.576 enacted November 14, 1995). Under
this law, schools will become relatively autonomous public entities to be administered by a
' The rationale for financing recurrent costs is much the same as that for traditional investment projects, in which
such financing would be allowed on a declining basis as the project is being implemented until it can become self-
sustaining. In this same manner, the SRL would finance recurrent reform costs while the state implements its reform
program. Once implemented, these reforms will enable the state to finance more efficient recurrent and capital
expenditures on a sustainable basis with its own resources and prudent borrowing.



57
democratically elected director and school council. The state has begun to transfer the
responsibility for purchase of supplies (e.g., pencils, paper, chalk, etc.) and also for minor
repairs (e.g., repair of broken windows and painting) to special funds administered by
these school councils and directors, as it argues that they are subject to close scrutiny by
the local community and should, therefore, be more accountable to the community's
needs. These decentralization measures improve efficiency by lowering procurement
prices, improving the education budgets reached to final beneficiaries, and raising the
likelihood the budget is spent in the real needs of those beneficiaries.
3.32  Table 3.1 shows that the total program cost is estimated at US$461 million.
Foreign costs represent 27 percent of total project costs. Analysis of Brazil's overall
development program shows that this level of local cost financing is needed for this high
priority project, because the financial requirements of the program will exceed the limits of
available funds from expected local savings and foreign sources. Table 3.2 shows the
programn's financing plan in which the proposed loan for US$125 million represents 27.1
percent of the total project cost. RGS may also obtain parallel financing from various
domestic agencies (including the Caixa Econ6mica Federal and also from the IDB).

Procurement
Procurement Methods
3.33  To attain its reform objectives, implementation must focus on the reform efforts
per se, and disbursement must be quick enough to support the other reform efforts (e.g.,
downsizing and privatization). Thus, every effort has been made to keep procurement and
disbursement as simple and cost-effective as possible by selecting those items for which
both procurement and disbursement would be done simply and quickly at very low cost.
To this end, the focus will be on smaller contracts that can be procured using simpler
procedures. No procurement under ICB is anticipated. Prior review will be substituted as
much as possible by ex-post procurement audits following each of the time-slice
disbursements. A summary of proposed procurement arrangements is provided in Table
3.3.
3.34 Works would be undertaken through contracts with private firms, in accordance
with Bank Guidelines. In line with the need to keep procurement simple to meet the
project's reform objectives, most works and goods contracts would be small enough to be
procured using the simple shopping and National Competitive Bidding-NCB procedures
without prior review. A procurement audit following each time-slice disbursement will
review an adequate sample of contracts to assure that procurement procedures have been
performed in accord with Bank guidelines. See Table 3.4 for a summary of procurement
thresholds and review requirements.

3.35  Contracts for works expected to cost US$500,000 or more, but less than US$5
million (to account for about US$11 million of the Bank loan), and contracts for goods
expected to cost more than US$100,000 but less than US$500,000 would be awarded on
the basis of NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Procurement for works costing less
than US$500,000 and goods costing less than US$100,000 would be carried out through
international or local shopping involving at least three price quotations. NCB would be
based on agreed Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs) for the procurement of major and
small works (for cost estimates higher or lower than US$750,000, respectively), and
goods. (Revised Portuguese version of documents prepared by SEAIN/MPO and the
Bank in 1995).
3.36  Recruitment of consultant services (consulting firms or individual consultants) for
the technical studies, training, and audits, expected to cost approximately US$32 million,
would be carried out in accord with the Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers (August 1981).
Procurement Review Procedures
3.37  As mentioned above, to meet the project's reform objectives, activities requiring
the simpler procurement procedures and no prior review have been given priority. No
procurement under ICB is anticipated. An ex-post audit of an adequate sample of
contracts awarded under NCB and under international and local shopping procedures
would be done following each time-slice disbursement. These procurement procedures
will not only streamline project execution but also reduce the Bank's supervision burden.
3.38  Table 3.4 summarizes the procurement review for each type of procurement and
consultant contracting procedure. Prior review would be concentrated only on consultant
contracts. To insure that all participating entities are fully capable of using Bank
procurement procedures at the onset of project implementation, the PIU would hire
consultants to review ex-ante the procedures for the first three procurement procedures
for goods and works by shopping or NCB by each such entity. The Bank would review
ex-ante only the TORs of consultant contracts: in which (i) individuals consultants are
hired on a competitive basis for amounts less than US$50,000; or (ii) consulting firms are
hired on a competitive basis for amounts less than US$100,000. In all other cases
(including all single-source contracts and consultancies of a critical nature), the Bank
would review ex-ante all documents of each contract for consultancies. Following the
above procedures the Bank would review ex-ante only about 10 percent of the total cost
of all procurement carried out under the project.

3.39   The capacity of the PIU and the state's Executing Agencies for effective
implementation and review of procurement documents and procedures in line with Bank's
procedures improved greatly during the comprehensive training initiative to enhance the
implementation and management of public investment operations in Brazil at the federal,
state and municipal levels in which staff of executing agencies in the State of RGS
participated. The Training and Dissemination Program in Procurement took place with
Bank participation in 1995.
Disbursement
Time-slices
3.40 To provide needed flexibility in time-slice disbursement, two different mechanisms
will be used: (i) for all areas except water, time-slice disbursement would follow
successful completion of the required actions at three points in time: after conditions of
effectiveness have been met and after Project Reviews have been successfully completed.
Disbursement for this reform component will be in three time-slices of US$50 million,
US$25 million and US$30 million following effectiveness and the two Project Reviews
respectively; (ii) for water, the remainder of the loan would disburse in one time-slice of
US$20 million following completion of agreed concession actions in the water sector,
which have significant implementation risks due to factors outside the government's
control. This structure will ensure that failure to complete privatizations and concessions
in the water sector will not undermine disbursements following successful completion of
actions in the other, less risky areas.

Closing date: December 31, 1998
3.41  To facilitate disbursement, the PITJ will submit to the Bank for its review an
Annual Disbursement Plan (ADP) at the Project Reviews that it would prepare in accord
'with the instructions in the Project Manual. It will list the items to be disbursed and
amounts to be submitted for disbursement, required subproject evaluations, and the
procurement procedures to be used in their purchase as established in the Project Manual.
The PIU may submit modifications in the ADP to the Bank for its review at any time
before the time-slice has been fully disbursed.
3.42 Withdrawals will be made for each time-slice only for expenditures for items
included in an ADP acceptable to the Bank. The disbursement percentages for severance
payments and consultants will be 100 percent of the non-tax expenditure. As the financing
of incremental recurrent costs will be on a declining basis, the disbursement percentage
will be as follows: 90 percent for withdrawals made until June 30, 1997; 80 percent for
withdrawals made thereafter until June 30, 1998; and 70 percent thereafter. The
disbursement percentages for all goods and works would be 100 percent of foreign and 70
percent local.
3.43  To ensure that the state has adequate resources to finance its reform program
(especially the heavy initial downsizing costs), 50 percent retroactive financing is proposed
and the special account should include amounts greater than normally approved.
Expenditures up to this limit that were made not more than 12 months prior to loan
signing, would be eligible for retroactive financing. Disbursement projections are shown in
Table 3.5. The Project Completion Date will be September 30, 1998 and the Closing Date
will be December 31, 1998.



63
Documentation of Expenditures
3.44 Withdrawal applications for goods, works and services not requiring the Bank's
prior review, would be disbursed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE)
certified by the implementing agency. Supporting documents would not be submitted to
the Bank but would be subject to independent audits and Bank review. Selective review
of SOE documentation, covering an adequate sample of expenses disbursed under SOEs,
would be undertaken as part of the annual project audit. Only consultant contracts
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more for individuals and US$100,000 or
more for consulting or accounting firms would be disbursed against standard
documentation.
Accounts and Audits
3.45  A Special Account in dollars with an authorized allocation of US$20 million
would be opened in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The balance of the
Special Account could be increased at the time of each time-slice release to facilitate
disbursement. The special account will be maintained and operated by the PIU which will
also be responsible for submitting replenishment requests to the Bank.
3.46  The participating executing agencies will maintain identified accounts of the
project in accordance with sound accounting practices. The accounts will show
expenditures for each project component, subdivided by expenditures financed by the
Bank and the Borrower. In addition, the Project Manual will define in detail what records
would have to be maintained so as to facilitate review of procurement procedures.
3.47  All project accounts and all disbursements against SOE and the Special Account
would be audited annually by private independent auditors acceptable to the Bank in
accordance with the Bank auditing guidelines. The Borrower would submit to the Bank
the audit reports of expenditures within six months of the close of each fiscal year. The
audit reports would certify that the funds were used for legitimate project activities. The
procurement audit following each time-slice disbursement will cover ex-post sampling of
all procurement of goods and works. The annual audit will also certify that the severance
payments of the Voluntary Withdrawal Program of the state enterprises were made in
accord with the applicable state law.
Project Sustainability
3.48  Overall project sustainability will largely depend on the budget constraint to which
the state will be subject. A federal policy prone to easily bailing out states in financial
difficulties will likely undermine implementation and sustainability. Alternatively, federal
policy could play an important role in encouraging the state to implement and sustain the
program if it rewards good performance in lieu of bailing out bad performance.
Hopefully, the Federal Government's own budget constraint will reinforce its desire to
encourage reform.
3.49  In addition to outside incentives, sustainability will also depend on how easily
reversible the reforms are. Clearly, privatizations and concessions will better withstand



64
adverse changes in incentives than fiscal discipline or administrative reforms. Successful
privatization of CEEE and CRT and successful concession in water, ports, and roads will
improve financial performance, investment, and service delivery so as to discourage future
expansion of state ownership or direct management in these sectors. On the other hand,
any improvements of the state's financial situation during 1996-1998 will not protect
against future episodes of financial mismanagement.
Lessons Learned from Previous Operations
3.50  The Bank has extensive experience in the reform of the public sector through
SALs and SECALs and with subnational development projects in Brazil, Argentina and
other countries. Key lessons may be summarized as follows. First, projects must focus on
a few significant reforms that are hard to reverse -- such as privatization of public
enterprises and banks, and reforms passed via legislation -- and that can be fully
implemented during the mandate of an elected administration. Second, project design and
implementation arrangements must be flexible enough to achieve targeted reform
objectives. Third, as reform projects for subnational governments can have high
supervision costs, project implementation should seek to include as much private
participation as possible in such areas as auditing and procurement. Finally, to ensure
commitment in implementation, the government should have a strong ownership of the
project components. The Bank's role should be to provide financial and technical support.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.51  Bank involvement in RGS State Reform Program is motivated by the state's
commitment to encourage development through its State Reform Program. The Federal
Government has asked for the Bank's assistance in developing, implementing and
financing state reforms that promote an improvement in the state's financial situation,
improved public sector efficiency, and better delivery of infrastructure services. Although
the Government is proceeding with its Reform Program under its own commitment, it has
asked for Bank assistance both to strengthen the quality of the program as well as to
finance some of its costs. The proposed project is within the Bank's current Country
Assistance Strategy, which calls for support of improvements in the performance of
Brazil's public sector. The Bank is considering similar projects in the states of Rio de
Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso.
Program Objective Categories
3.52 The primary objective category of the project is "Economic Management (EA)",
as it seeks to improve the overall performance of RGS' public sector.
Participatory Approach
3.53  The RGS Government has pursued a highly transparent and participatory approach
in proposing and seeking approval of the State Reform Program. Most of the reforms in
the Program have been subject to parliamnentary scrutiny. For example, legal mandates for



65
privatization of public enterprises are being obtained for each enterprise individually. The
participatory approach has gone as far as to hold public hearings for the discussion of
these privatizations. In addition, ali bidding documents of concessions and privatizations
have also been presented at public hearings.
Project Benefits
3.54 The project will support improvements the public sector's financial performance, in
economic efficiency, and in the quality of infrastructure services. It is also expected to
help trigger similar reforms elsewhere in Brazil. A better financial performance of the
public sector will result from an improved efficiency and reduced level of expenditures.
This benefit will be achieved through measures to reduce evasion of the ICMS and
through actions to control expenditures. It is a benefit because through improved financial
performance RGS will be able to contain indebtedness and manage its own resources more
effciently. Increased economic efficiency will also result from a reduced role of the state in
infrastructure, including telecommunications, power, water, ports and roads. This means
that the infrastructure sector will be able to produce more and better services for any given
amount of resources as a result of privatizations and concessions. In addition, the
privatizations and concessions will help mobilize much needed investment to meet supply
shortfalls of infrastructure services. Finally, a project benefit will surely be its impact on a
future deepening of reforms in RGS and on reforms taken by other states. Together with
Rio de Janeiro and other States, RGS is a pioneering program that breaks new grounds in
improved public sector management and privatization for Brazil.
Project Risks
3.55   The reform programs being undertaken by a number of highly indebted Brazilian
states will typically include revenue and expenditure actions to improve fiscal
performance, agreements to alleviate scheduled debt service to the Federal Government,
reform to reduce the burden of labor costs and a program of privatization actions.
Achievement of the actions and related objectives of the reform program is subject to
three key risks. First, the debt agreements, particularly in the initial years do not lower
debt service to levels that are compatible with projected improvements in fiscal balance.
This may impede achievement of creditworthiness. Second, lack of federal action on
administrative reform will undermine efforts to reduce labor expenditure and improve
fiscal balance. Third, future reversibility of actions taken by the presently committed
administration may also undermine the fiscal objectives of the State Reform Programs.
3.56  The Bank's assistance strategy to Brazilian states includes state reform loans to
four or five Brazilian states, in support of privatization actions and actions to improve the
efficiency of expenditures. This support is coupled with investment loans in various
sectors of these reforming states. Project risks are as follows. A first risk is that federal
largesse in helping states weather present financial difficulties may discourage the
privatizations and expenditure efficiency improvements supported by the project. This
risk is somewhat contained by the Federal Government's own fiscal constraints and by the
reform. A second risk is that the state's debt agreement with the Federal Government will



66
not accomplish financial sustainability for the state. This may well happen because the
parameters of the agreement will not allow a rapid decline in the debt/revenue ratio. High
indebtedness and debt service may undermine the fiscal improvement objectives of the
expenditure actions supported by the project. The high level of remaining indebtedness
may lead to an unaffordable debt service (e.g. through high interest rates) that would
generate a new debt crisis. This risk is somewhat contained by a debt agreement on a
fixed 6 percent rate on the rescheduled debt. Third, CORSAN, or municipal intransigence
may decrease the pace of reform in the water sector. The use of a floating time-slice
disbursement will encourage the state to continue other reforms if-- for reasons beyond its
control -- water reforms are delayed. Fourth, a complex reform program may test the
Government's capacity to implement it. Nevertheless, thus far, the Government's team
has successfully achieved passage of several complex pieces of legislation and
implemented a difficult staff downsizing program. Commitment has been high, as
demonstrated by firm actions to privatize telecommunications and rapid progress towards
privatizing the power sector.
3.57  Finally, the state will continue to be exposed to public enterprise losses. Although
the privatization program covers two important enterprises (CRT and CEEE), the state
will remain exposed to risks of losses in important enterprises, including CORSAN,
BANRISUL, and the Caixa Econ6mica Estadual. Only BANRISUL made a profit in
1995. Although these enterprises are reducing costs through staff reductions and branch
closings (the case of BANRISUL and CEERS which may be merged), these actions could
easily be reversed in the future. Losses from poor management and credit policies
(including lending to public enterprises and other uncreditworthy borrowers) could be
large, particularly in BANRISUL and CEERS, where total assets are Rs.$8 billion. To
illustrate, a loss of only 1 percent of the joint assets of BANRISUL and CEERS alone is
equivalent to about 1 percent of the state's debt, which in turn is 2 percent of the level of
net revenues, a very significant amount under the state's present conditions of financial
strain. There is nevertheless some comfort and an emerging track record that the present
Government will be able to improve the aggregate financial performance of these
enterprises during 1996-98, that some of the enterprises (CRT and CEEE) will be partially
privatized during 1996-98, and that the banks are now being considered for merger and
eventual privatization.



ANNEXES






Annex A
MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL REFORM BACKGROUND
A. Stabilization
1.    Since the beginning of 1994, the authorities have been implementing a stabilization
plan that has been carefully sequenced. The first phase involved a modification of the
budget to obtain a balance in the operational account of the consolidated public sector.
The second phase marked the introduction of a new system of indexation of a co-
temporaneous nature, intended to eliminate inertial components of inflation. The final
phase, introduced in July 1994, saw the introduction of a new currency, the Real, linked to
the U. S. dollar and the elimination of indexation. Stabilization policies have been based on
a nominal exchange rate anchor and tight monetary policies. External payments were
normalized with a debt and debt service reduction agreement with commercial banks and
with arrangements under the Paris Club as a part of the stabilization plan.
2.    Inflation has been reduced sharply under the plan from monthly rates of around 40
percent in mid-1994 to below 1 percent currently. The economy has grown at annual rates
of about 3.5 percent in the post-stabilization period; initially, the major contribution to
growth arose from a sharp rise in domestic demand associated with a reduced erosion of
real incomes from inflation, rises in real wages and consumer credit expansion, but after
bouts of monetary policy tightening since early 1995, domestic demand has moderated and
the external contribution turned positive.
3.    The fiscal adjustment seen in 1994 was sharply reversed in 1995, when an
operational surplus equivalent to 1.3 percent of GDP was transformed into a deficit of 5
percent of GDP. The underlying deterioration in the fiscal balance is even greater when
the strong cyclical upturn in 1995 is taken into account. The principal causes of the fiscal
loosening lie in a rise in the public sector wage bill, as minimum wages and public sector
pay were increased in late 1994 and early 1995, higher social security expenditures (in part
related to the rise in the minimum wage), increases in outlays for interest payments on
public debt, and strong increases in expenditures at states and municipalities.
4.    The burden of adjustment has fallen on monetary policies. The authorities have
taken periodic measures to vary reserve requirements and to impose tax and other
restrictions on credit operations and capital inflows. Consequently, until very recently,
real interest rates in monthly terms have ranged between 2 and 3 percent. During 1996,
interest rates declined temporarily to less than 1 percent per month. The Central Bank has
engaged in sterilization operations in response to foreign exchange reserve accumulation --
a development, which together with the need to fund the fiscal deficit, had led to a sharp
rise in public debt to the equivalent of nearly one-third of GDP. A further cause of the rise



68
in the public debt lies in Central Bank liquidity support given to several public banks and
one private bank in distress.
5.    Once introduced, the Real was allowed to float and traded at around Rs. $0.82 to
the U.S. dollar, with an official floor of parity to the dollar. From March 1995, the
Federal authorities adopted an adjustable exchange rate band system to limit the
appreciation in real terms and safeguard the external accounts. The band has since then
been depreciated on several occasions and currently stands at Rs.$0.97 to Rs.$1.06 to the
dollar. Since its introduction, the Real is estimated to have appreciated by over 25 percent
in real terms, but from an initial position of a strongly competitive economy. The external
current account registered a deficit of US$17.7 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) in 1995, but
with strong capital inflows, gross international reserves rose by US$12 billion in the
course of the year to stand at US$52 billion by year-end. By end-June 1996, international
reserves stood at US$60 billion.
6.    The success with the stabilizatiorn plan to date has been encouraging: inflation has
been sharply reduced, while growth has been maintained. Furthermore, the reduction in
inflation has contributed greatly to a rise in real incomes of the poor. It will also lead to
an upturn in savings in the economy that is necessary if growth is to be sustained. At the
same time, reliance on external savings to finance growth has been limited and current
account deficits have been easily financed. The strengthening of confidence in Brazil has
led to large capital inflows and to reserve gains.
7.    Consolidating stabilization in 1996 will require changes in the policy mix. In
particular, it will be vital to tighten fiscal policy and to limit the growth in public debt.
The authorities have frozen nominal wages since mid-1995 and increased public enterprise
prices as principal means of increasing the consolidated public sector primary surplus. If
these can be achieved, the burden on monetary policy will diminish and real interest rates
could be safely reduced. A stronger fiscal position will, thus, also contribute to some real
depreciation of the currency and to a better balance between the external current and
capital accounts.
8.    Policy adaptations of this type will require strengthening the budget currently
before Congress and also the passage of several key constitutional amendments that will
remove constraints to more efficient management of the public sector. These are
discussed below.
B. Structural Reforms
9.    The Cardoso Government has reintroduced the privatization program, slowed and
temporarily halted by the preceeding Franco Government. A law was passed in February
1995 permitting private concessions for electric power distribution and transport of
natural gas. Several Brazilian state governments have launched programs covering the
sale of state equity in electricity distribution, telecommunications and the banking sector.
Two large state-owned banks may have majority equity in private hands by 1997.



69
10.   The major reforms to come are follow-ups to the ending of state monopolies in
telecommunications, petroleum, the gas sector and coastal shipping which also occured in
1995. In the area of telecommunications, peripheral and value added services are being
opened to competition. The privatization of the network may be delayed awaiting
regulatory reform and the complexity of breaking up the existing structure. There are no
plans to privatize Petrobras, the Federal petroleum monopoly, but it may collaborate with
foreign companies in exploration. The privatization program is being particularly
revitalized at the state level, where incentives have been given for state banks to be
introduced into the program.
11.   In electric energy, the Federal Government is seeking partners to finish incomplete
existing plants. In electricity distribution minority shares are being sold with the publicly
owned development bank, BNDES, forming a fund where shares may be deposited by
state governments against future sale.
12.   The Cardoso Government has reform plans in three other economic areas: social
security, fiscal reform and administrative reform. The social security system is a defined
benefit regime, largely funded by employer and general taxes. It is also biased towards
early retirement by certain categories of workers. This has resulted in a growing mismatch
between payments and benefits. Efforts at comprehensive reform, including a move
towards a largely capitalized system are unlikely to succeed politically at present and the
administration's current reform goal is a more modest one of correcting the bias towards
early retirement and removing some of the legislation from constitutional to infra-
constitutional status to be dealt with later.
13.   Administrative reforms would involve allowing layoffs from the civil service and
setting limits to salaries plus benefits as well as retirement benefits. Currently no
confirmed civil servant can be removed from service; and the practice of drawing multiple
pensions with no overall limit on the amount is widespread.
C.    Medium-Term Outlook
14.   The projected GDP growth rates in 1997 and 1998 are 4.0 percent and 4.5 percent
respectively. While Brazil has achieved much higher rates of growth in the past, the need
to keep aggregate demand under control in order to prevent a resurgence of inflation
suggests that growth will be in this range or even slightly lower in 1997. Gross domestic
fixed investment is expected to rise steadily, financed largely by growing domestic savings.
15.   Current account deficits should be contained to below 2.5 percent of GDP.
Trends in capital flows suggest that deficits of this magnitude can be financed relatively
easily. According to the Federal Government, the consolidated fiscal account (operational
basis) will show a deficit of about 3.5 percent of GDP but should show a clearly declining
trend toward zero balance over the next three years. The rate of inflation should gradually
decline but will still be in the double digit range through 1997. This scenario is posited on
the Federal Government making the necessary effort on fiscal adjustment.



70
16.   The Federal Government's aim is to reach single digit inflation by 1998, the last
year of President Cardoso's mandate. So far, the record of economic management has
been good. The rate of inflation continues to be low and an overheating of the economy
was contained successfully in 1995 and 1996. The current account deficit is about 3
percent of GDP and reserve levels are high. The economy is less indexed than in the past,
and inflationary expectations for 1997 are favorable. However, there are risks to the
program if the reform agenda in the case of state reforms and structural changes discussed
above are delayed or left incomplete. These risks are elaborated below.
D. Risks
17.   The stabilization program has enjoyed success in lowering inflation, but fiscal
deficits and high real interest rates still pose challenges for macroeconomic policymaking.
The authorities are attempting to accelerate reforms amid trying political circumstances.
A number of states are attempting to seize the opportunity to formulate deep reform
programs. However, there is an urgent need to reduce fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits to
sustainable medium term levels. This requires continuing progress on structural reforms.
Reform intentions may falter in part related to opposition of vested interests, to
weaknesses in institutions and capacities to design and implement programs. Bank lending
and non-lending support increasingly emphasizes actions assisting a declining path for
fiscal deficits, a strengthened poverty program and enhanced efficiency in selected sectors.

Annex F
RETIREMENT FUND OPTIONS
1.    Several options merit consideration by the State Government of RGS (see Table
F. 1), which must address five questions in formulating a reform program for State
employee retirement planning. Does each option satisfy the Lei Camata requirements to
reduce personnel spending? Is the option consistent with Brazilian labor legislation?
Does each option require new state legislation? Is it sustainable financially? What impact
does the option have on the State Treasury? A Government's Task Force to consider
pension reform is presetly considering these questions.
Table F.1
Rio Grande do Sul
Options for Personnel and Retirement Reform
Options and Scenarios  Satisfies    Labor   Requires  Sustainable?  Treasury
Camata? Legislation?  New Law?             Impact
1. Baseline Scenario        No        Yes        No          No      Negative
2. Adjustment Scenario      Yes        ?          No         No      Positive
3. State Pension Fund (SPF) +    Yes  Maybe      Yes         Yes     Positive +
Adjustment Scenario
4. Defined Contribution Plan +    Yes  Maybe     Yes         Yes     Positive +
SPF+ Adjustment Scenario
5. Privatized Pensions      Yes      Maybe       Yes         Yes     Positive
++
2. Baseline scenario. Data on state employees, especially their distribution by category
of work, age, sex, and recent experience of retirement, provided the basis to project
personnel costs, 1996-2030. These data underlie the baseline scenario. Its projection
into the future demonstrates that personnel costs, particularly because of the near doubling
of inactive workers between 1996 and 2020, is inconsistent with the Lei Camata,
financially unsustainable, and has negative implications for the State Treasury.
3. The adjustment scenario assumes that the state will meet the Lei Camata requirement
to reduce personnel spending, yet will maintain the number of workers in each
employment category. A key result is that workers' wages would have to fall by one third
in real terms to finance the increased number of retirees. Although this option would be
consistent with the Lei Camata, it would probably lead to severe deterioration in state
services and hence would not be sustainable or politically acceptable.



78
4. A third approach is to combine adjustment with creation of a State Pension Fund
(SPF). The SPF + adjustment scenario would require new legislation that must be
consistent with labor laws. SPF would offer a number of retirement plans, including full
salary in retirement, but with the proviso that a significant share of retirement costs be
financed from mandatory social contributions during the working years. This option, if
properly designed, could have a positive impact on the State Treasury by gradually
removing payments to retirees from personnel costs. It could be made financially
sustainable by assuring the right balance between workers' and state agency contributions
to the retirement fund. Whether to maintain a funded scheme, pay-as-you-go, with
inclusion of state-owned enterprises, and many other details, remain to be decided within
general legal parameters.
5. SPF would be introduced gradually as it would initially cover new workers. Current
retirees would not be affected. Older workers, those over age 40, have a large stake in the
current generous retirement system and would probably prefer its terms to any funded
scheme. Younger workers could be attracted by providing them with acquired rights
(based on the present value of expected future benefits) that are portable, allowing them
the flexibility to leave public employment without losing retirement benefits. One
interpretation of the law is that state employees must be offered the right to retirement
payments equal to 100 percent, and often, 120 percent of the last wage, but that the
financing of the payments could include substantial wage-based taxes during the
employee's working years. Many employees, if faced with the substantial salary
deductions that such a high replacement rate would entail, might decide voluntarily to
accept a less generous retirement plan. Typical years of employment and retirement
periods for women teachers, the largest group of RGS State employees, would require
contributions rates of about 60 percent of gross wages during the working years, typically
age 20 to age 45 for this group, to finance the 100 percent replacement rate for thirty or
more years that these teachers could be expected to live in retirement. For males, who
work longer years, and also retire later and die earlier than females, the contribution rates
would be lower, but still well above 25 percent of gross wages. These high contribution
rates need to be taken into account in planning for the SPF and its financing.
6. Participation in SPF could be made mandatory for all new employees. The
Government expects to present a legislative proposal for creation of a SPF following
completion of legal and preliminary actuarial analysis. Implementation of a funded scheme
will require substantial actuarial analysis, a management and business plan for the pension
fund, and a manual of operations that would set out fund policies and modes of
administration.
7. The state is preparing technical studies that will form a better basis to assess these
reforms. These changes could move retirement payments off the State Treasury budget.
With efficiencies and some cost recovery from the beneficiaries, they could also lower the
cost of retirement programs now financed from state revenues.



79
8. A fourth approach adds a defined contribution plan to the SPF + adjustment package.
It further reduces Treasury risk, and enhances worker flexibility, by creating personal
retirement accounts owned by the beneficiary. Existing acquired rights could be
transferred into such accounts, with the funds invested in equities that promise a
reasonable risk-reward ratio. The SPF could be flexibly designed to accommodate
traditional defined benefit programs, as well as defined contribution personal accounts. It
could be extended to cover workers in state-owned enterprises, as well as municipal
employees.
9. A fifth option is to privatize retirement finance and pensions. This option would
eliminate the risk of unfunded liabilities for the State Treasury, and it would assure
insulation of funds from any risk of political manipulation. Such arrangements work well
in Chile, and they are being considered throughout Latin America. Nonetheless, analysts
consider that this step may represent too great a change to appeal to state employees, even
if offered entirely on a voluntary basis.

Annex H
TIMETABLE OF ACTIONS FOR PRIVATIZATION OF CRT
Under the timetable of actions required for privatization of CRT (Table 1.1 below),
privatization was completed by December 1996. The key activities in this timetable are
described as follows:
* Law Approval. Law No. 10682 authorizing the Government to sell the shares
of CRT was approved by Congress on December 28, 1995 and signed by the
Governor on January 2, 1996.
*  Appointment of the Working Group. Law No. 10.607 of 28 December 1995,
the State Reform Law designated a Director Council for the Reform of the
State. The members of the Council were appointed by Decree 36.437 of 25
January, 1996. The Governor appointed Secretary de Souza as President of
the Director Council. The Council then appointed the CRT Privatization
Working Group ("Grupo de Assesoramento") on January 31, 1996.
-  Hiring of the Investment Bank. This group of activities comprised the tender
for the selection of the investment bank, including preparation of
specifications, publishing (it was published 26 January), reception of
proposals, evaluation, award and contract negotiations.
*  Preparatory Work. This group of activities comprised the tender for the
selection of the investment bank, including preparation of specifications,
publishing reception of proposals, evaluation award and contract negotiations.
A consortium of Patrimonio/Salomon Brothers/Deloitte
Touche/Tohmatsu/Metal Data Engenharia signed their contract on May 10,
1996.
*  Preparatory Work. This included the preparation of a Strategic Plan, the
Financial and Legal Audit of CRT, preparation of a Business Plan for CRT,
drafting of Legal Documents and Regulations, preparation of the Data Room
and the Information Memorandum, and a Road Show to possible Investors.
*  Pre-Qualification. This is the selection of strategic investors through a pre-
qualification process, including the publication of criteria for selection,
reception of documents, evaluation and award.
* Due Diligence. This activity included the time for the investors to come to
Porto Alegre and inspect the Data Room, visit the installations, and review the
preliminary bidding documents.



83
*  Public Bidding. After discussion with pre-qualified investors on the detailed
terms of the transaction, the Government issued the final bidding documents,
received proposals, invited for price envelopes, received price proposals, and
awarded the tender.
*  Closing of the Transaction. This is the final step, culminating in the final
closing of the transaction after payment by the strategic investor for the shares
of CRT. The bid was awarded in December 1996.

Annex K
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
Environmental Issues
1.    Environmental problems in the State of RGS include pollution problems related to
urban and industrial activities (water pollution, air pollution, solid waste), pollution
problems related to agricultural activities (mainly water pollution) and degradation of the
natural resource base, for example in the form of soil erosion.
2.    The state can be divided into three major water basins: the Rio Guaiba Basin, the
Rio Uruguai Basin and the Coastal Zone. The most severe water pollution problems affect
the Rio Guaiba basin that covers 30 percent of the state's surface but includes 70 percent
of the state's population, including most industrial activities and the Porto Alegre
Metropolitan Area. Water pollution problems are caused by a combination of almost
entirely untreated domestic wastes, industrial effluent and agriculture runoff. Water
pollution reaches critical values in specific locations of the basin. Pollution damage
includes health threats to, mostly lower income residents, who swim at local beaches. The
Rio Uruguai drains mainly agricultural areas. Localized problems with pollution from
domestic wastes and agriculture (nutrients and agro-toxics) have been detected. The
Coastal Zone includes several vulnerable coastal lakes and the Lagoa dos Patos, which is
the most significant estuary of southern Brazil and has significant fisheries.
3.    Water quality monitoring in the Rio Guaiba Basin is undertaken at 37 monitoring
points for 19 standard parameters in the Sinos (monthly), Gravatai (monthly), Cai
(trimestral), and Tuquari-Antas (trimestral) sub-basins. Additional in-depth water quality
studies have been conducted in several areas of industrial concentration. There are 62
monitoring points in the Coastal Zone at which water quality is assessed in two annual
measuring campaigns. During the holiday months, December to February, weekly water
quality analysis is carried out at the main beach locations.
4.    Air quality problems include excessive particulate concentration in urban areas,
caused by emissions from industry and transport and localized industrial pollution. In
particular, air emissions from the Candiota coal-fired power plant in the south of the state,
have led to complaints from Uruguay regarding transborder pollution from this plant. The
state has 14 non-automatic monitoring stations for Total Suspended Particulates (TSP)
and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), which provide monitoring data every six days (of the 14
stations, four are located in Porto Alegre, four in Rio Grande, and one, respectively, in
Montenegro, Triunfo, Estancia Velha, Bage, and Acegua). Most stations are located close
to major industrial polluters. Individual measurements from July 1995 indicate that
particulate concentration in parts of Porto Alegre may significantly exceed applicable
standards.



87
Environmental Policies
5.    The combination of federal, state and local environmental regulations has created a
complex system of requirements that covers most potentially environmentally harmful
activities but is at times confusing for polluters and difficult to enforce. The objectives of
environmental policy are formally defined in ambient environmental standards. The Federal
Government has established water and air quality standards through resolutions of the
National Environment Council (CONAMA). For example, CONAMA Resolution 20/1986
determines ambient standards for nine water use classes for the main water pollutants. In
RGS, only some waterbodies (primarily in the Guaiba basin) have been classified
according to water use classes.
6.    At the national level, there are the PROAGUA national water quality program and
the PRONAR national air quality control program, which include ambient monitoring,
administration of emission licenses, and a national emissions inventory. The
implementation of most policies, however, is the responsibility of the State. In RGS, the
basic legal provisions for environmental management are contained in the Basic
Environment Law of 1981 (Law 7,488/81), for which regulations have never been issued,
and the State Constitution of 1989. A new environmental framework law is awaiting
approval by the State Legislature.
7.    The main instrument for pollution management is a comprehensive licensing
system that was established in 1991 (Law No 9202/91) which requires a valid license for
every potentially environmentally harmful activity. The firms' licensing applications
contain information on technical parameters and environmental impacts based on which
the state grants or refuses the license. The licensing process involves three steps: a
preliminary license granted during the planning process of a new project, an installation
license, and an operation license. For activities with a potentially large environmental
impact, the development and evaluation of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
forms part of the licensing process. Even though the licensing process is applicable mainly
for new activities, existing companies and activities are gradually being included in the
system. An environmental license determines the environmental conditions and norms
under which the respective activity is permitted.
8.    Current environmental management instruments are largely based on a command-
and-control approach and somewhat inflexible mentality. Moreover, there is no effective
link that ties environmental policies to the ambient environmental conditions in specific
locations. Cross-sectoral planning and coordination of environmental policy is lacking.
Economic thinking and the desire to develop flexible and cost-effective solutions to
pollution problems is not yet well-developed. For example, lacking integration between
effluent controls from industry and the sanitation sector undermine the development of
cost-effective pollution control strategies. There has been insufficient cooperation between
environmental agencies and the industry and other polluters, such as the sanitation sector,
even though experience elsewhere suggests that such cooperation is critical for effective
pollution reduction.



88
9.    The key reform of environmental management instruments comprises the
introduction of a comprehensive system of water basin management. Law 10,350 of 1994
creates the legal basis for such systems in which water basin management plans are
prepared by water basin agencies and approved by committees representing the users of
the respective water basin. A Water Resource Council has been established to implement
the new law. The instruments of water basin management would include water charges
and effluent discharge fees. While a few individual water basin committees have been
formed or are currently being formed, full implementation of the system will have to await
the detailed regulation of the law and the resolution of legal uncertainty about the
competence of states in establishing water and effluent charges.
10.   Environmental management in RGS is the responsibility of the Fundacao Estadual
de Protecao Ambiental Henrique Roessler (FEPAM) which was created in 1990 and
reports to the Secretary of Health and Environment. FEPAM has a total staff of 238, of
which 135 are at the professional level. Total agency expenditures in 1995 were Rs. $7.6
million, of which 71 percent were staff costs. FEPAM's own revenue sources (licensing
fees and fines) provided Rs.$2.2 million toward the 1995 budget. FEPAM's responsibility
includes the implementation of the licensing process. During 1995, FEPAM received
4,570 licensing applications and issued 4,571 licenses (910 preliminary licenses, 622
installation licenses and 2,988 operation licenses).
11.   Working conditions of FEPAM are difficult but not desperate, and overall capacity
to deal with the comprehensive environmental management demands is limited. For
example, monitoring of ambient quality and, thus, the information base for effective
environmental policy is relatively limited. While FEPAM follows up on citizens'
complaints on pollution problems, resources are insufficient for a comprehensive program
of regular visits and spot-checks at polluting sites.
12.   FEPAM has suffered from the departure of about 30 staff, some of them highly
qualified, during the recent program of voluntary staff separations. Recovery from these
staff losses is supported by an institutional strengthening program of GTZ (Germany),
which focuses on solid waste, water resources, and information management. FEPAM is
also being supported within a major IDB-financed project for the cleanup of the Rio
Guaiba Basin. This PROGUAIBA project finances sewage collection and treatment works
as well as the development of a masterplan for the basin and studies on pollution control
and solid waste management. The counterpart funding includes the incremental cost for
about 65 additional staff for FEPAM that will be instrumental in improving the agency's
performance in pollution management within the Guaiba waterbasin.
13.   An important actor in environmental policy is the Ministro Pzublico, who is part of
the judicial system and presents to FEPAM complaints, on behalf of the public, and has
significant legal powers in forcing the state to act on these complaints. In effect, the
attention to complaints presented by the Ministro Piublico absorbs a significant share of
the management capacity of FEPAM. Zoning is an additional instrument of environmental
policy that is unevenly used by local, state and Federal Governments. In this and other
areas, there is significant overlap between the responsibilities of the national environmental



89
agency, the Instituto Brasileiro de Meio-Ambiente (IBAMA), FEPAM and the
municipalities.
14.   Similar to many environmental agencies elsewhere, FEPAM is often not
substantially involved in important Government decision processes with significant
environmental impacts. The result of this exclusion is that environmental concerns are
often not considered from the beginning in important planning decisions and investment
projects but encountered as a constraint after the planning process is substantially
completed. This approach leads to polarization and stigmatization of environmental
agencies as obstacles to effective execution of investment projects.
15.   Given the overall weakness of the environmental management system, a strategic
focus on key problems is absolutely critical. Many low-cost pollution abatement options
are available in specific cases. Obviously, policies should focus on these cheap solutions
first. At least in the short and medium term, this means focusing on critical sinks and
critical pollutants and focusing principally on large pollution sources while at the same
time directing sufficient attention at other polluters to encourage compliance at reasonable
levels and establishing the general rules of the game, which in the long term will be
enforced for all polluters. Once priority areas have been determined, policies need to be
strongly and consistently enforced.
16.   The agency should be reoriented toward a more cooperative approach vis-a-vis
polluters. While its ultimate enforcement power cannot be questioned, the agency should
focus on negotiations, voluntary compliance agreements and assistance for enterprises and
other polluters in attaining environmental targets. Within the public sector, environmental
agencies should more actively participate in the design of major new projects allowing
them to contribute constructively. The role of the agencies should change from a pure
environmental police function to a service provider function, in particular through the
provision of environmental information.
17.   IBAMA maintains in a state superintendency with a total of 260 staff in 20 field
offices. While most of IBAMA staff work on the protection of natural parks, they also
have responsibility for pollution problems, for example in border areas or in maritime
ports. While all three levels of government have overlapping responsibilities, none of them
has sufficient capacity to address all existing problems. A clearer division of labor between
the three levels of government could therefore contribute to improved clarity about the
obligations of polluters and the responsibilities of the respective agencies, allowing them
to focus their resources
Environmental Aspects of the State Reform Program
18.   The RGS State Reform Program will not have adverse environmental impacts. The
program will likely improve environmental performance through better environmental
oversight of current state enterprises as well as increased investment in and improved
management of water and sanitation systems. The Government recognizes the importance
of considering the environmental aspects early in the process of privatizations planned



90
under the State Reform Program. This approach will: (a) reduce the uncertainty for
potential private sector investors about their environmental obligations; and (b) allow
improvements in environmental performance at least cost.
19.   It was agreed that for each company or privatization activity with potentially
significant environmental problems that, after the time of appraisal, will be prepared for
privatization under the Program, the environmental obligations of the new owner/operator
would be determined before the time of sale/concessioning. Following an environmental
audit, and still before the time of concessioning or sale, agreement would be reached
among the responsible entities on environmental performance targets including the time
and the responsible party for remedying the identified problems. To facilitate the
integration of environmental concerns, it was further agreed that the State Government
will include the State Environmental Agency (FEPAM) in all related discussions on
privatizations under the State Reform Program. Under the proposed project, the
Government may hire consultants who assist in monitoring compliance with agreed
environmental targets.
Sectoral Issues for the State Reform Project
20.   Within those components of the State Reform Program that will be supported by
the Bank-financed State Reform Project, four sectors raise environmental issues that are
discussed below: the reforms of the water and sanitation sector, the subconcessioning of
port terminals, the concessioning of road maintenance, and the sale of electricity
distribution companies. For the environmental audits in these sectors, the terms of
reference for environmental audits and draft reports of the consultants would be sent to
the Bank for comments. Several other components of the project do not require an
analysis of environmental aspects since potential environmental impacts from the sector
are non-existent or minimal. For example, the warehouse company Banrisul Armazens
Gerais (BAGERGS) does not handle chemicals, fuels or hazardous materials and its
privatization raises no significant environmental issues.
Water and Sanitation
21.   The sanitation sector is, for most conventional pollutants, the main source of water
pollution in the state. Currently, there is very little sewage treatment, and raw sewage
from sewage collection systems and uncollected runoffs directly enter the waterbodies. In
theory, all sewage systems and wastewater treatment facilities require an environmental
license. Licensing of sewage systems by FEPAM is based on an internal technical norm
that includes emission standards that, in general, would require secondary treatment. A
specific license can be granted even if these standards are not met immediately but attained
over a specified period of time. In practice, environmental oversight of sewage systems is
limited and most older systems do not operate under a valid license. A small group in
FEPAM works specifically on the environmental problems of the sanitation sector.



91
22.   Drinking water quality standards are established by federal regulation (Portaria No.
36/1990 of the Ministry of Health). This regulation contains minimum water quality
parameters and minimum water quality monitoring requirements, and delegates
implementation of the regulation to the states. Currently, there is no oversight of the state
water company's (CORSAN) implementation of these standards. However, CORSAN has
an internal system for water quality monitoring and laboratories to perform the required
analyses. Regional laboratories have limited capacities, but the central laboratory is fully
equipped. While water quality is supposedly acceptable, this claim cannot be verified since
water quality analysis results are not generally published. Water quality monitoring in
municipal systems differs and is virtually non-existent in the smallest systems. The State
Secretary of Health is currently in the process of setting up, together with the relevant
municipalities, a system for supervising compliance with the drinking water standards. A
federal law establishes fines for violations of drinking water standards.
23.   One of the reasons for considering increased private sector participation in the
water and sanitation sector is the need to generate the financing required to expand basic
sanitation services and associated wastewater treatment. The planned reforms have, thus,
a significant positive environmental effect, and if properly designed, can contribute to
improved environmental management in the state. Since the environmental targets to be
set for the new utilities will be a critical factor in determining both the economic feasibility
and the environmental consequences of restructuring, careful coordination of the
environmental aspects of the water and sanitation sector restructuring is of great
importance.
24.   Fundamental decisions about what level of wastewater collection and disposal
services should be provided and how this should be financed must be made in the near
future. These are essentially environmental decisions that are bound up with strategic
choices about future levels of environmental quality in the main river basins of the state. It
is of critical importance that a consistent set of environmental targets and obligations for
the restructured utilities be developed early in the process through a coordinated
mechanism between the water and sanitation sector, on the one hand, and the environment
sector, on the other hand. In this way, the potential implications of alternative options for
investment requirements, tariffs, and environmental quality can be assessed and laid out
before taking the final political decisions. Once wastewater treatment targets have been
agreed by the Government, they will have to be incorporated into the sector restructuring
as an obligation of the concessionaire.
25.   Once the sector has been restructured, there is no reason to treaL water and
sanitation companies differently from other large point pollution sources. Therefore, the
concession contract should provide for a transition from a rigid regime with fixed targets,
for instance in the first few years of the contract, to the general water basin management
regime. In the latter regime, water and sanitation companies will be represented as users
within the water basin management structure and will be subject to the normal iicensing,
monitoring, and inspection requirements applied to other companies. After a transitional
period, they will also be required to pay effluent discharge fees either to the state or to the
relevant water basin agency. Failure to meet the terms of their discharge permits will



92
expose them to the imposition of fines and/or other penalties. In order to increase the
certainty about future regulatory obligations of the concessionaire, it would be highly
desirable that the work on the regulation of the water resource law and the introduction of
water use charges be accelerated.
26.   So far, specific locations and timetables for the restructuring of the privatization of
water and sanitation systems have not been decided. However, it was agreed that the
privatization process of the water and sanitation sector would include the following steps:
*  The detailed work of the consultants to be hired to study options and design the
process for water and sanitation sector privatizations would include an analysis of
different wastewater treatment targets over time, their impact on water quality and
environmental damages, as well as their costs and implications for other concession
parameters such as service expansion and tariffs.
*  The environmental agency (FEPAM) would participate in the related Government
discussions on the design of the water and sanitation concessions based on the above
mentioned study. Wastewater treatment targets over time would be agreed between
FEPAM and the other relevant Government agencies and approved by the Bank before
the time of privatization of the respective system.
-  An environmental audit of each system to be privatized would be contracted by the
Government and completed before the time of privatization of the respective system.
A time-bound plan of action to address the identified environmental problems would
be agreed between the responsible Government agencies and the future concessionaire
and approved by the Bank. The Terms of Reference for such audit would be sent to
the Bank for review and approval.
-  The Secretary of Health is in the process of setting up a system for the supervision and
enforcement of applicable drinking water quality standards for all water operators in
the State. The Government assured the mission that the development of this system
will be pursued as a matter of priority and that such a system would be fully
operational for the relevant service areas before the time of privatization of any water
system. This system will be approved by the Bank.
*  The concession will provide for a transition from a regime with fixed targets into the
emerging system of water basin management by water basin committees. Water and
sanitation companies would be members of such water basin committees with all rights
and obligations including the payment of water and effluent charges, which would be
phased in over a period of several years.
27.   The restructuring of the water sector includes the sale of an aluminum sulfate
company (KIEL), which has already been completed. This company operates with a valid
environmental license that spells out environmental obligations of the company. In
addition, the wastewater treatment plant (SITEL) for a major petrochemical complex
(P6lo Petroquimico do Sul) near Triunfo about 50 kilometers outside of Porto Alegre is



93
being privatized. FEPAM has an intensive regulatory relationship with the petrochemical
complex including a separate field office of FEPAM, a GTZ-supported monitoring and
research program, and specific regulation (Portaria 04/1995 of the Secretary of Health and
Environment). This regulation and the environmental license of the complex requires the
wastewater treatment performed by SITEL and specifies permitted remaining emissions.
As such, the environmental obligations of the future operator of SITEL are well
established; however, they are subject to revisions following the ongoing research
program into environmental impacts of the petrochemical complex.
Ports
28.   Significant environmental problems are suspected in the operation of some of the
terminals (in particular petroleum) currently operated by the State under a concession
from the Federal Government and to be subconcessioned to private sector operators.
IBAMA is responsible for the environmental licensing and enforcement of port terminals
to be subconcessioned under the Project. However, these terminals currently operate
without the required environmental license. Currently, no effective environmental
oversight and no comprehensive assessment of existing problems exists. The
Superintendency of the Rio Grande Port (SUPRG) has recently applied to IBAMA for the
required environmental license for the terminals of the Rio Grande Port. However,
IBAMA is not able to process these applications without undertaking an assessment of
current environmental problems in the port.
29.   It was agreed that, for those terminals that have already been subconcessioned or
are about to be subconcessioned (petroleum, containers, wheat and soybean), the
subconcession contract (or where applicable the bidding documents) would include a
clause requiring the subconcessionaire to undertake and submit to IBAMA, within two
months of contracting, an environmental audit of the facilities. Based on this audit,
IBAMA would determine environmental obligations and issue the applicable operating
license. For those terminals to be subconcessioned in 1997 and later, the state would
contract consultants to undertake an environmental audit that would be submitted to
IBAMA for issuance of the applicable operating license before the time of
subconcessioning. The Government will send the Terms of Reference of the environmental
audits and the results of audit studies to the Bank for comments and approval by
December 1996.
30.   Environmental audits of the port terminals would include items such as air
emissions from handling and storing dust-generating materials or volatile chemicals; waste
water and solid waste discharges; presence of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
and contaminated soil and groundwater from chemical or fuel spills or leaks; chemical and
fuel storage design and handling procedures and measures for spill prevention and control;
use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration facilities; port dredging and spoil
disposal.



94
Roads
31.   The State Road Department (DAER) has a small environmental office and some
internal capacity for the assessment of environmental impacts of road construction and
restoration. For new road projects and road restoration, DAER has developed sample
terms of reference for Environmental Impact Assessments and Environmental Impact
Statements. Ultimately, however, FEPAM is responsible for the licensing of road
construction and restoration, and it will be necessary for FEPAM to develop own capacity
in the area of environmental impacts of roads.
32.   The State Reform Project only includes the private sector contracting of road
maintenance works. Road maintenance works do not require an environmental license.
However, it was agreed that the road maintenance contracts would include explicit clauses
ensuring the environmentally acceptable behavior of the contractors (covering issues such
as construction wastes, construction camp management and equipment maintenance). The
contracts would be enforced by DAER. In addition, the contracts would require a valid
environmental license for extraction and disposal sites, burrow pits, and asphalt plants.
These licenses are issued and enforced by FEPAM. The Bank will review and approve
contract documents.
33.   Some of the roads, whose maintenance works will be concessioned, were
constructed without the legally required environmental license. Since this situation can
create legal impediments for the execution of maintenance works on these roads, FEPAM
and DAER will take the necessary steps to regularize the legal situation for all roads
whose maintenance is to be contracted under the Program and who do not operate under a
legally required license. The Government will inform the Bank of the completion of this
process.
Electricity
34.   Most of the states electricity demand is met by hydropower. However,
environmental problems have arisen with respect to atmospheric emissions by the main
coal-fired thermal power plant, Candiota (446 MW). Problems are caused mainly by very
poor coal quality. This plant is equipped with an electrostatic precipitator. However, the
plant does not currently comply with gas emission standards. The existing Candiota II
plant does not yet have a valid environmental license, but negotiations between the state
electricity company (CEEE) and FEPAM about a compliance schedule are ongoing and
expected to be concluded within a few months. At the same time, an EIA is being
prepared and evaluated for a new thermal power plant (Candiota III).
35.   FEPAM has adequate capacity to address environmental issues arising in the
context of the operations of CEEE. The company itself has recently taken active steps to
improve its environmental management system and performance. The company has its
own environmental manager and considers seeking ISO 14,000 certification. A review of
environmental issues at CEEE has recently been completed and will be sent to the Bank
for information.



95
36.   The State Reform Project contemplates the privatization of two electricity
distribution companies, which are generally associated with only minor environmental
issues. If the mentioned environmental analysis of CEEE does not contain a sufficient
analysis of environmental problems in the distribution sector, the Government would
include a more detailed environmental audit of the distribution companies in the contract
for the consultants that will prepare these companies for sale. Prior to the sale of the
distribution companies, FEPAM and CEEE will agree on a compliance schedule to remedy
identified environmental problems in the respective part of CEEE.

The Project Manual (PM) will provide an overview of the objectives and
organizational structure of the SRL, and will define the technical evaluation, procurement,
disbursement, and auditing requirements. Thus, it will serve as a guide for both the
secretariats that are reforming and those that have activities financed by the Bank. The PM
will be organized as follows:
(a)   Presentation of the PM and its structure;
(b)   Institutional arrangements;
(c)   Eligible Expenditures;
(d)   Procurement and Procurement Review;
(e)   Disbursement;
(f)   Auditing;
(g)   Accounting

Annex M
EVALUATION OF THE VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES PROGRAM
1.    The loan will finance the cost of severance pay under the voluntary downsizing
effort of CRT and CEEE, and also possibly CESA, CEASA, and CORSAN. All of these
are government-owned corporations that sell goods and services to the public, are legally
autonomous, and have assets as well as their own sources of revenue. The payments will
be made under the rules of the Voluntary Departures Program (PDV) discussed
previously.
2.    This annex will analyze how the provisions of the PDV as applied in the CRT and
CEEE provide for increased productivity and also deal with potential problems of such
severance programs, including: rehiring, excessive severance payments, adverse publicity,
and negative impacts on those who withdraw. Finally, financial and economic cost-benefit
analyses are presented.
Impact on Productivity
3.    The PDVs in CRT and CEEE were initiated only after developing strategies to
improve the enterprises' productivity. The VDP was one element of these strategies.
Each enterprise signed a management contract with the state government that includes the
strategy for increasing productivity and performance targets and indicators to monitor its
success in implementing the strategy.
4.    The CRT's program was designed to correct the mismatch between the firm's
needs and current employee skills due to rapid technological change and outsourcing of
many activities (e.g., system maintenance and security). For example, many telephone
operators are not longer needed. CRT did a full analysis of its labor force needed to meet
its performance targets of its management contract with the state government, and then
determined the numbers that should be reduced in each category. The total number
eligible for voluntary withdrawal was set at 2,000 of which 1,600 submitted requests and
about 1,400 of these were finally accepted by CRT.
5.    The situation in the CEEE was different as the problem was basically over-staffing
in many different areas. Thus, a total number of 1,300 staff were declared eligible for the
program, of which 287 actually decided to accept.
6.    Both CRT and CEEE are revising their Career and Salary Plans to assure that the
remaining employees are more effectively utilized.



98
Measures to Avoid Reversal
7.    Although these enterprises cannot deny employees who leave under the PDV their
constitutionally guaranteed right to participate in public examinations for employment, the
PDV legislation requires any ex-employee who has accepted a PDV package to return the
full amount of the withdrawal package if he reenters any state entity. Furthermore, neither
CEEE nor CRT thinks that withdrawing employees would be interested in entry level
positions that would be offered in these public examinations. Increased private sector
participation in both CEEE and CRT resulting from the SRL should increase market
discipline in both enterprises.
8.    This rehiring rule would be monitored by the state's Tribunal de Contas and also
the Contadoria e Auditoria Geral do Estado (CAGE). The public examinations are
controlled by another state entity (Fundacao para Desenvolvimento de Recursos
Humanos) that would also ask screen candidates for those who had accepted a PDV
package.
9.    In calibrating the severance payments for the PDV, the state took into account
obligations toward employees, applicable laws including labor laws; prevailing labor
market conditions, and the affordability and replicability of the package. Although the
public service trade unions opposed the PDV, they did not have the power to block it.
Steps Taken to Mitigate Negative Impacts
10.   Both CEEE and CRT set up programs to provide information and counseling on
the benefits of the PDV to all eligible employees. In addition, employees opting for
vithdrawal could participate in training programs and career counseling. For example, in
CRT, each participant was eligible for 30 hours of coursework in a wide variety of fields,
plus 5 hours of individual consulting. The state federation of industries provides training
on opening a small business through its training arm.
Economic Costs and Benefits
11.   This section analyzes the impact of the PDV on the productivity of the enterprise
or sector after restructuring. This economic analysis, encompassing economy-wide costs
and benefits, is to determine whether the enterprise or sector reform project is
economically viable.
12.   In summary, the PDV program has a clear value, under the most pessimistic
assumptions. This social value does not stem from the fact that the enterprises' workers
are laid-off, but rather because the redundant workers can be better used in other sectors
where the demand has been identified, and from the specific efforts made to ensure that
the quality of this labor force will be enhanced in the process through training. It also
releases scarce public resources for better targeted and more effective uses including



99
education, which is best completed earlier rather than through middle life literacy
programs.
Methodology
13.   Economic costs and benefits are defined as follows:
14.   The costs. The costs. of the retrenchment program in each concession are given
by the sum of the net present value of:
(i) the marginal productivity value of retrenched employees from the state
enterprises, differentiated by year (i), employee (j), and concession area (k) (Rr ijk)
(ii) the severance payments (Soj ).
(iii) the early retirement payments (Pij).
(iv) the training costs (T1jk).
15.   Item (i) represents the services not rendered by due to employee retrenchment.
Since the remaining personnel is sufficient to carry out current production levels of these
enterprises, the value of the marginal production productivity of retrenched workers is
assumed to be zero.
16.   In an environment without budget constraints or price distortions, items (ii) and
(iii) would not normally be labeled economic costs. Assuming no subsidy and no
government budget constraint, these outlays would be considered income-efficient
transfers to the redundant employees and would the not be included as a cost in the
analysis. But Brazil does have a budget constraint and a highly distorted tax system which
results in price distortions. These two terms were therefore included to recognize the
importance of the opportunity costs of public funds. The underlying assumption is that the
shadow price of public funds is 100 percent and that each dollar of public resources used
to finance severance payments or early retirement packages has an equivalent economic
cost which needs to be taken into account. This also contributes to the conservative
estimates of the rate of return as the cost estimates are an upper bound of the costs rather
than a lower bound. These payments are differentiated by year (i) and employee (j).
17.   Item (iv), training costs, have an economic component attached as long as the
training agency (or firm) has an alternative use for its resources. In this case, training will
be provided by state-supported agencies that operate far below their service capacity
limits. Nevertheless, the full cost of the training program was included. Training costs
were estimated at Rs.$300 per employee days, and all redundant workers have been
included as potential candidates. Training is differentiated by year (i) employee (), and
subsystem (k).



100
18.   The pensions paid to normally retired employees are not included, since these costs
would be incurred anyway. Earlier payments of regular pension have included since they
are small and their impact on the internal rate of return of the project would not be
significant.
19.   The Benefits. The benefits of redundancy reduction in each year given by:
(i) the marginal productivity value of each laid-off employee elsewhere in the
economy (REjmp).
(ii) the marginal productivity value of the foregone labor cost of the enterprises
(LC ijk).
20.   The marginal productivity value of the laid-off employee is the product of: (i) the
probability of the employee's engagement in another productive activity, depends on
effectiveness of the training which the employee receives, by (ii) the net income produced
by such activity. RP is influenced by attributes such as age, education etc., of each
employee (j), and the location (m) at which the employee is likely to find an occupation
(p), "Region" (m) may or may not be the same as "Where the employee previously
worked" and occupation (p) is related to the employee's attributes and the training which
the employee receives. In some cases, the laid-off employee may get a job at the expense
of someone else's job, and the net income contribution may be zero. But since these cases
are normally rare impact on the final results would not be significant. Provision was made
for these assumptions in the sensitivity analyses.
21.   The marginal product of the foregone labor cost of the enterprises represents the
opportunity cost of the outlays that will be saved by the retrenchment program. These
savings labor costs can be used in investments in needed to provide additional service
capacity, as well as further improvements in the existing system. In the economic analysis
of this specific they are estimated as equivalent to the foregone labor cost. In the
economic analysis of the overall project, the savings in labor costs are translated in terms
of reduction in the long-run marginal cost of the services provided by these enterprises.
That cost reduction is the main reason for the increased competitiveness which in turn
explains the improvement of their competitiveness and market shares.
Quantitative Assumptions
22.   The quantitative assumptions made in estimating the return to staff reductions are
conservative; in particular, it is assumed that not everyone will find a job. The probability
of being rehired was computed on the basis of the time spent on the job and the average
length of unemployment. Based on the information available about the employment
situation in the largest metropolitan areas, the probability of finding a new job in the
southern, southeastern, or center regions is 0.83. The main reason why unemployment
duration is rather short is that prices adjust to clear the labor market. This implies that
unemployment goes down as the price of labor declines. Those who do not find a job at
their previous wage have to accept a wage cut consistent with the average probability of



101
being employed. The reduction in wage depends on the region; wage is reduced to the
average salary in the region where a worker is declared redundant. This implies wage
losses of about 10 percent in the South (of which RGS is a part) and Southeast regions.
Results
23.   Tables M. 1 and M.2 presents the results for the two enterprises analyzed: CEEE
and CRT. The net present value (NPV) of the staff retrenchment program is estimated at
US$350 million for CRT and US$72 million for CEEE with a 12 percent discount rate.
The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is estimated at 96 percent for the CRT and
112 percent for the CEEE.
Financial Rates of Return
24.   Table M. 1 and M.2 also show the financial rates of return calculated only with the
costs of the program and the cost savings from retrenchment. The estimated internal rate
of return was 66 percent for the CEEE and 57 percent for CRT.

Annex N
DESCRIPTIONS OF DISBURSEMENT COMPONENT
This annex provides more detailed descriptions of each disbursement component.
Information on procurement and disbursement procedures, project accounts, and auditing
such be included in the PM (See Annex L).
Goods, Works, Consultants and Training
1.    Equipment for Reform Implementation This component will finance office
equipment necessary to improve public sector efficiency, including PCs and PC software.
Expenditures on this equipment, are part of the project objective of improving the
efficiency of expenditures. Their economic profitability is linked to the profitability of
actions to reduce the level of public expenditures and raise their effectiveness. The PM
will define in detail what types of equipment would be eligible for financing and other
conditions. For example, larger purchases of PCs would not be eligible without an
adequate training program. Disbursement would be against the expenditures for this
equipment. Accounts should facilitate the annual project audit.
2.    High-Priority Investments  In addition to the reforms, the project will finance
high priority investment projects during the adjustment period, including: land
management and rural poverty alleviation to ensure that these environmental and poverty
programs are fully funded during the adjustment; and rehabilitation and maintenance of
roads, schools, hospitals, and health posts to assure that the physical assets of the state do
not deteriorate during the adjustment period.
3.    To ensure that the investment subprojects to be financed are of the highest priority
in the case of land management, rural poverty alleviation, and highway rehabilitation,
financing would complement that of proposed Bank projects scheduled for Board
presentation in FY97. For example, if the state complies with the SRL time-slice
conditions, the SRL would finance upto US$15 million of the US$50 million of road
rehabilitation works to be done in 1997 and 1998 under the proposed State Highway
Management Loan to RGS. Essentially the same procedures would be applied for the
proposed Land Management and Rural Poverty Alleviation Loan and the SRL would
finance upto US$15 million of the US$60 million to be spent on goods, works, and
consultants to be financed in 1997 and 1998. This SRLJ financing would, of course, be in
addition to the financing under both loans. To avoid double counting in calculating the
overall share of Bank financing for the Brazil, the SRL financing would be counted only
under the loan. If these two projects are delayed, the SRL could finance subprojects in
these areas using the evaluation and procurement methods similar to those which would



105
have been used for the proposed projects. These methods would be described in the
Project Manual.
4.    In the case of the social sectors, simple evaluation criteria for maintenance and
rehabilitation would be provided in the Project Manual.
5.    Consultants The study will also finance studies needed to define or implement
the reforms, training, and audits. The studies are linked to the achievement of the project
objectives. They may include diagnostic or implementation studies to undertake the
privatization actions in the sectors supported by the project (telecommunication, energy,
roads, ports or water). There may also be studies to help implement actions that raise the
efficiency and/or curtail the level of public expenditures. The economic profitability of
these studies, sustainability and risks of the privatization and public expenditure actions
which are discussed in the text.
Severance Payments
6.    The loan would finance the cost of severance pay under the voluntary downsizing
effort of CRT and CEEE, and also possibly CESA, CEASA, and CORSAN. The
evaluation of the component is in Annex M. Initially, the payments will be for payments in
only the CRT and CEEE, but other entities and downsizing programs could be included.
As these are for payments to those eligible on the PDV, Bank procurement procedures do
not apply.
7.    Disbursement will be against the actual expenditures payments as defined in the
Annual Disbursement Plan (ADP). The project accounting system will be defined so as to
make the key elements of this program auditable. The PM will describe in detail the
disbursement procedures for these funds.
8.    The following are the key issues that will be addressed in the PM on accounting,
disbursement, and auditing for the Voluntary Departures Program:
(a)   The PIU will help the enterprise establish the accounting system that will
produce auditable accounts.
(b)   The enterprise will submit estimates of the numbers of PDV participants
and the amounts of total salaries and benefits net of income taxes within the
amount of the approved budget.
(c)   The enterprise pays with its resources and sends the declaration of what
has been actually paid rather than just accrued signed by the head of the
operations subunit in each enterprise.
(d)   The operations subunit of the PIU withdraws the amount of the
disbursement from the Special Account and deposits the resources in the
Social Development Fund.



106
(e)    The PIU sends a request to replenish the Special Account if it has not
exhausted the amount approved for the time-slice. If it has exhausted the
amount, it just notes the amount in preparation for the next time-slice.
(f)    The PIU will make sure that the accounts established permit adequate
auditing. The auditor will be private independent acceptable to the Bank.
The private audit will cover only eligible expenditures. The auditor will be
contracted early and will do a test preaudit to make sure that the accounts
are fully auditable. The audits will be done in a timely manner. The second
and third time-slices will be released only after the approval of the audit
report for the project expenses for the previous fiscal year. The audit of
severance payments will include the analysis of an adequate sample of
payments to assure that the principles of the staff reductions are being
enforce where pertinent to assure that all of the rules are being enforced.
Grants
9.    These include transfers to municipalities and private institutions. They cover
incremental expenditures for early childhood, public health, sanitation and basic education.
These expenditures are justified on the grounds of alleviating the social impact that the
reform program may have, particularly arising from the financial duress that the public
sector will experience in its quest for fiscal balance.
Incremental Recurrent Costs
10.   These are defined as direct (i.e., non-transfer) costs incurred by the RGS
government in connection with social assistance programs also aimed at mitigating the
social impact of reforms. These target direct additional expenditures for public health,
education and training. They are justified on the same grounds as the grants discussed
above.
11.   An example of these costs is the decentralization of school materials purchasing
and contracting of small repairs to democratically elected school councils and directors in
each school. The SRL will finance incremental recurrent costs of the program. In 1996, a
law was passed which made each school a relatively autonomous public entity to be
administered by a democratically elected director and school council. The state began to
transfer the responsibility for purchase of supplies (e.g., pencils, paper, chalk, etc.) and
also for minor repairs (e.g., repair of broken windows and painting) to special funds
administered by these decentralized school units. The state feels that these associations
are open to closer scrutiny by the local community and should, therefore, be more
accountable.
12.   To participate in the school support decentralization reform, a school board must
meet the requirements established in the legislation, including adequate capacity to control
the use of funds. At the present time, about 2,100 of the 3,000 schools have formed



107
school boards and 900 of these have be certified by the SEE as having met the
requirements for receiving the funds. Most of the uncertified school units are expected to
qualify by the end of this year.
13.   The certified boards will enter into annual contracts with the SEE to transfer
funds. The amount of the transfer to each school is determined using indices based on the
size of the school and its location. Using these indices, the amounts transferred annually
to the school boards would range from US$250 to US$151,000. The contract states that
with SEE which will permit the transfer of State funds that the associations can use
exclusively to purchase school supplies and materials, and small repairs.
14.   Disbursement would be against the amount actually transferred to certified school
boards by the state. The budget line should contain only transfers going to certified school
boards. The amounts to be submitted for disbursement should be included in the Annual
Disbursement Plan (ADP).

Annex 0
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE IN THE SECTOR
1.    The State Reform Loan for RGS draws on lessons of experience from a number of
Bank projects of similar scope and design in both the Latin America region and Brazil. As
the Bank and other institutions are increasingly supporting regional development, a wider
range of experiences in operationalizing and implementing these projects can be utilized.
In addition, the Bank's experience with subnational government projects has evolved
rapidly since the adoption of these fiscal and political reforms in the 1988 Constitution,
offering many country-specific insights.
Subnational Development Project
2.    Complex project design has often been cited as a key reason for weakening
importunate components of subnational development projects. Aspects such as
institutional development and financial management are often neglected in these projects,
due to the high demand placed on state implementation and coordination capacities.
3.    Experience shows that by identifying and designing certain aspects of the project
early in the project preparation process allows for greater flexibility and improved project
implementation. In the case of the Minas Gerais Municipal Management and
Environmental Infrastructure Project (Ln. 3639-BR), many of the Terms of Reference
to be used and implementation arrangements were discussed during the project's
preparation phase. This helped shape the dialogue between the Bank and the state, and,
moreover clarified and better defined project objectives and scope for both parties.
Increased borrower involvement during these stages also has the benefit of giving
governments greater project "ownership," which often leads to improved project
implementation.
4.    In its 1992 review of urban and municipal projects in Brazil, OED found that many
projects did not pay enough attention to the external environment in which they would be
implemented. Tailoring project implementation periods to political mandates is
particularly importunate in the case of Brazil, as it helps to capture government support
for a project. As an alternative, projects that have a flexible project design can easily
accommodate shifting political priorities. Additionally, any pilot programs needed to be
quickly implemented to capitalize on a climate of favorable political and community
support.
5.    The Brazilian Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP) projects found that
incorporating aspects of public involvement in the project can lead to greater ownership
and cooperation by the public. Public involvement can diffuse otherwise difficult political
situations, and in the case of the NRDP can lead to greater local government



109
accountability. In addition, the government can lower future (political) costs of trying to
overcome opposition during implementation once the project has been agreed upon by
including the public in the decision-making process. Public participation can also help
identify places where conflict can either slow or derail project components.
Project Sector Reforms in Brazil
6.    The Bank's experience in Brazil demonstrates the need to work within existing
institutions -- regardless of how weak -- to minimize lags in project implementation.
Technical assistance has been the most common tool used to bolster municipal
governments. Training can also help created better skilled staff.
7.    One of the more relevant projects with respect to design and scope of the SRL-
RGS is the Brazil Public Sector Management Loan (PSML -- Ln. 2721-BR). The
PSML sought to develop planning and management capacity on the federal level in the
areas of sector and project analysis, multi-year investment planning, and program
monitoring. Another major component of the project was an integrated budget
information and control system. Relevant lessons of experience include:
-     Project design should not be overly ambitious since the loan size, the
project's operational complexity, and number of project component can ultimately
burden both the Borrower and the Bank during implementation and supervision.
-     The project can benefit from firm budget commitments from the
government and clear design links if certain aspects of the project, such as Terms
of Reference, are agreed to prior to loan signing.
-     The overly flexible use of funds by the Borrower often leads to
management problems, Moreover, too many unallocated funds can pressure the
government to finance otherwise low-priority activities.
-     Training activities will help increase the technical capacity of the public
service, but do not necessarily lead to any corresponding increase in wage
compensation.
-     In the case of Brazil, the Borrower should seek ways to hire consultants
and purchase necessary goods within local procurement legislation in terms
satisfactory to the Bank.
8.    Civil service staff training alone cannot create a more efficient civil service. This is
particularly true in the PSML due to Brazil's inadequate wage policy for public sector
employees. Civil servants earn comparatively much less than their private sector
counterparts, and their wages have eroded over time in real terms due to economic and
fiscal difficulties. Moreover, in the quest for decentralization and downsizing, a high
number of qualified and skilled staff often leave public service for voluntary reasons, or



110
due to poorly targeted reduction strategies (such as across-the-boards cuts or wage
compression).
9.    In order to remedy these problems, larger problems within the civil service need to
be addressed. Solutions can include redefining of the role and functions of the
government and the improving the quality of delivery of government services in light of
optimal government size, needed skills and improved service delivery. Well-planned and
targeted reduction or reassignments of staff can also maximize efficiency.
Privatization of Public Enterprises in Argentina
10.   Under the Public Enterprise Reform Project (Ln. 3291 -AR) in Argentina, the
following lessons were learned. The initiative to privatize was entirely the Government's.
The Bank was vital in providing financial and technical support, but never set the basic
policy objective.
11.   The Bank prudently kept a low profile; in spite of an ubiquitous Bank presence,
privatization never became a "World Bank Program" in the eyes of political or public
opinion.
12.   A large amount of relevant sector work had been done by the Bank before there
was any indication that a privatization program might be possible. Since at the time, the
chances for any lending resulting from this work were quite low, it may well be thought of
as a high risk gamble. It paid off, however, without this technical work it would have
been difficult for the new Government to seize the moment and push ahead with
privatization at the point where a pervasive sense of national crisis gave it the needed
political support.
13.   Implementation was greatly enhanced by a highly effective Project Unit. The fact
that the head of the Unit participated, from the beginning, in Loan discussions and formal
negotiations, enabled the Unit to play a constructive role during implementation, since he
was fully aware of the backgrounds and rationales of the often complex issues and of the
actions required from the many agencies involved.
14.   The Bank's investments in Loan Formation and Administration was heavy (about
612 staff weeks) but vital. Without it, the program might have come to a stop at critical
junctures.
15.   The Bank's imaginative use of adjustment lending, in allowing visible application
of counterpart proceeds to finance severance payments, was decisive in making railroad
privatization feasible. But its justification hinged on two circumstances: monitoring to
prevent rehiring or replacement and, even more important, imminent privatization, after
which the pressures to overstaff would, presumably, largely disappear.

Operational Aspects
16.   Disbursement was an historic problem in Brazil due to the long-standing
incompatibility between Brazil's federal procurement law and Bank guidelines.
Disbursement lags also persisted due to federal regulation that mandated all Special
Account be held in the Central Bank in Brasilia. In 1993, federal legislation was enacted
to allow public entities to hold projects accounts in institutions outside the Central Bank.
Concrete steps have also been taken to bring procurement in line with Bank standards
thorough the issuing of Standard Bidding Documents that were agreed upon by the
Federal Government and the Bank.
17.   Project financing should use a simple, transparent flow of funds to minimize
bureaucratic delays. Agreements on key disbursement and procurement mechanisms
should be made as early as possible, and transparent as possible. By adopting standardized
procurement documents, as well as spelling out key aspects of and all other procedures.
Another means is to raise the thresholds for all ex-ante reviews as high as feasible.
18.   OED's recommendations for improving the monitoring of urban development
projects include:
-     a system to monitor implementation adequately should be put in place prior
to project start-up to strengthen project management and facilitate subsequent
evaluation;
-     use clearly defined and measurable indicator to permit the monitoring of
progress toward the achievement of these goals in operations which contains
substantial institutional development objectives; and
-     operations that contain substantial institutional development objects should
include clearly defined and measurable indicator to permit monitoring progress so
as to achieve these goals.
19.   In order to improve overall project execution, the Bank has decentralized many of
its supervision responsibilities to the field. The experience provided by the Argentine
Provincial Development Project (Loan 3280-AR) has shown the need to contract out
certain basic management tasks (such as review of documents, audits, and monitoring)
given the large burden that "portfolio" and multi-sector projects place on project and
Bank staff. For several decades, this has been as established practice with Chile's Ministry
of Public Works. The Ministry contracts a firm for a designated period, and it renews
contracts with the same firm to ensure continuity. Consultants report to the Ministry and
supervise all works under the Ministry's jurisdiction; they prepare quarterly reports,
participate actively in discussions during supervision missions, and draft aide-memoires.
Supervision by the Ministry can be supplemented by annual on-site inspection by Bank
staff. This practice has contributed significantly to the reduction of Bank staff supervision.
