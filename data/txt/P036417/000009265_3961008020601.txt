MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO MONGOLIA
FOR A POVERTY ALLEVIATION FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to Mongolia for SDR 6.5 million, the equivalent of $10
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance the Poverty
Alleviation for Vulnerable Groups Project.
2.          Country/Sector Background. Mongolia, with a per capita income of $320,
is a vast country with a small population (2.26 million), of whom 25 percent are nomadic
herders. Despite the dispersed population and limited communication and transport
networks, exacerbated by Mongolia's harsh and erratic semiarid continental climate, until
1990 the population had enjoyed universal coverage of primary education, primary health
services, access to safe drinking water, and state-guaranteed employment and social
assistance.
3.         In 1990, living standards and social indicators began to deteriorate when the
country's 70-year-old socialist system collapsed, accompanied by the termination of
assistance of the former Soviet Union and a substantial decrease in demand from its
traditional trading partners, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA). At the
same time, Mongolia launched an austerity program and structural reforms to move toward
a market economy and sustainable development. Between 1990 and 1993, Mongolia's
gross domestic product declined for four years in a row as the country underwent a rapid
transition to a market economy. The cumulative loss in national income amounted to 20
percent, real consumption per capita declined by a third, and real investment by two thirds.
Inflation accelerated to 331 percent in 1993, and exports and imports fell by more than half
between 1990 and 1993. The combined effect of these events resulted in an 8.5 percent
registered unemployment rate, 30 percent of school-age children not attending schools, a
doubling of maternal mortality from 0.12 percent in 1990 to 0.24 percent in 1993, the
number of female-headed households rapidly rising, and the real value of pensions and
other social benefits declining.
4.          The economy now appears to be responding to the wide-ranging reform
program carried out by the Government. GDP contracted by only 1.3 percent in 1993 and
is estimated to have grown by 2.5 percent in 1994. Inflation slowed significantly in 1994
to less than 70 percent. External, fiscal, and structural targets set for end-1993 and end-
1994, and agreed with the International Monetary Fund were met. Government savings,
which were negative earlier, turned positive.
5.          To complement its economic stabilization and reform  measures, the
Government has launched a comprehensive National Poverty Alleviation Program (PAP)
aimed at reducing the proportion of the population living below the poverty line from 26

5.          To complement its economic stabilization and reform  measures, the
Government has launched a comprehensive National Poverty Alleviation Program (PAP)
aimed at reducing the proportion of the population living below the poverty line from 26
percent in 1994, including 6 percent classified as absolute poor, to 10 percent by the year
2000. While the adopted poverty reduction strategy is appropriate, achieving the target
by the year 2000 appears ambitious.
6.          To facilitate financing of the PAP, the Government has established a Poverty
Alleviation Fund (PAF) with four accounts for employment promotion, local development,
women, and social assistance. Each is seen as a vehicle for resource mobilization
(domestic and external) aimed at specific objectives of the program.  These four
operational accounts will be complemented by special "project" allocations from aid
agencies to finance parts of the PAP. The National Poverty Alleviation Committee
(NPAC), an interministerial and nongovernmental organization committee, chaired by the
Deputy Prime Minister, would oversee implementation of the PAP to ensure that ministries
and local governments adhere to agreed policy guidelines. The Project Implementation
Manual (PIM) has been drafted, which provides the complete menu of eligible subprojects
for the overall PAP program, mechanism for allocating resources based on the proportion
of poor in each province, detailed guidelines for subproject preparation, and selection
criteria, financing mechanisms and repayment terms.
7.          The proposed project supports the most urgent aspects of the PAP aimed at
poverty alleviation among groups particularly vulnerable to the social cost of adjustment.
The vulnerable groups are considered to be: (a) children without one or both parents;
(b) disabled persons; (c) the elderly without care; (d) the unemployed; (e) low-income
households with many children; (f) female-headed households; and (g) herders with few
animals. To target basic services to the poor and improve monitoring of poverty trends,
the Government will complete a Living Standards Measurement Survey by July 1995.
8.          The proposed project was prepared entirely by the Government, with
financial assistance provided by the Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development
Fund. Preparation began in June 1994 and, to gain lessons for project design, included
implementation of a series of pilot schemes in income generation, education, health, and
social assistance. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) prepared by the Government was
discussed with IDA in Washington in January 1995.
9.          Project Objectives. The overall development objective of the project is to
mitigate the adverse effects of Mongolia's economic transition on the poor segments of the
vulnerable groups. The proposed project would contribute to the development of the
institutional framework for implementing and coordinating the PAP and facilitate
community participation. As the first donor-assisted project to be processed through the



- 3 -
PAP framework, the project would demonstrate the implementation process of the PAP,
while focusing on short-term, quick impacts with a view to: (a) create gainful employment
and income for the poor and absolute poor in particular; (b) raise enrollment in basic
education; (c) reduce maternal and other mortality and morbidity; and (d) provide
assistance to handicapped and mentally retarded children and disabled persons.
10.         Project Description.  The proposed project is an integral part of the
Government's PAP and comprises institutional capacity building and subprojects under four
sectoral components. The institutional support component would provide short- and long-
term international and local consultants to develop the implementing agencies' institutional,
management and operating procedures, supervision, monitoring and evaluation methods and
a management information system. Project technical assistance would be carried out under
an umbrella program administered by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). This assistance would not only aid project implementation, but also develop a
network of organizations able to manage the PAP. Local and overseas training of
implementing agencies' staff, office equipment and vehicles would also be provided. The
implementing agencies' operating costs would be initially (for six months) financed under
the UNDP program, but thereafter the Government would take over the expenditures using
its project counterpart contribution.
11.         To meet their varying needs, communities will be able to select appropriate
sector investments from menus of eligible activities defined in the PIM. About 300
subprojects under the various menus have been identified.  The income-generating
component would create employment opportunities through community-based programs of
public works, including infrastructure maintenance and environmental protection works,
and productive activities. The basic education component is aimed at reducing the dropout
and nonenrollment rates through a menu of options, including the installation and repair
of heating systems, the renovation of schools and the provision of teaching materials. The
rural health component would provide critical inputs needed to maintain and restore the
ability of rural health services to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity through options,
including the provision of transport services, the installation of heating systems, the supply
of medical equipment and the training of health staff. The support for the disabled
component would finance special equipment needs of: (i) mentally retarded and physically
handicapped children, and (ii) the institutes/factories that train or employ disabled adults.
The allocation of resources at the province level for the sectoral components will be based
on the distribution of the absolute poor, school nonenrollment and maternal mortality rates.
Targeting of the poor would be achieved through community participation in subproject
identification and the use of self-targeting in the income generating component by fixing
wages slightly below the market rate.

12.         Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at $10.53
million. Since the specific subprojects are yet to be identified by the communities,
physical and price contingencies are not included. Similarly, the foreign exchange
component, estimated to account for 9 percent of the total project cost, is indicative. The
proposed IDA credit of $10.0 million equivalent would finance 95 percent of the total
project cost (100 percent of foreign and 94 percent of local costs) and the Government
would contribute the balance. To allow start-up of the project before the onset of the harsh
winter season that would prohibit work on many subprojects, retroactive financing is
recommended of up to $0.15 million of eligible expenditures approved after June 1, 1995
in accordance with the PIM. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement amounts and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of IDA operations in Mongolia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
project map (IBRD No. 26754) is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13963-
MOG, dated May 22, 1995 is being distributed separately.
13.         Project Implementation. The project would be implemented in accordance
with procedures and provisions for the overall PAP, including use of the PAF and the PIM
(para. 6). The NPAC would have overall responsibility for project implementation, while
the Poverty Alleviation Program Management Unit (PAPMU) would act as secretariat and
would be responsible for day-to-day project management. As the Government's focal point
for poverty alleviation, PAPMU's mandate includes: (a) monitoring implementation of
policy decisions; (b) monitoring implementing agencies' adherence to the criteria
established in the PIM for approving locally initiated subprojects; (c) ensuring that the PAF
is adequately funded and remains liquid; (d) ensuring projects are properly monitored and
an appropriate data bank is established for timely evaluation; (e) organizing training for
the implementing agencies; (f) publicizing the financed activities; (g) ensuring that public
policy and expenditures have a poverty focus; and (h) issuing progress reports to the
NPAC and the donor community. PAPMU's counterparts at the province level would
review and approve subprojects submitted by the district level, monitor the implementation
of subprojects, document lessons learned, and maintain proper project accounts. The
district-level implementing agencies, with beneficiaries, would be responsible for
identifying, implementing and supervising priority community-based income-generation,
education and health subprojects.
14.         Project Sustainability. The long-run sustainability of poverty alleviation
would only be assured when the growth of the economy recovers, allowing employment
opportunities to emerge, and public expenditures on basic education, health and other
social services are provided adequate funding. It is also recognized that during the
transition, the limited domestic resources would have to be augmented substantially to
support the PAP. In the interim period, sustainability of the specific programs financed



under the project would be assured by adhering strictly to the subproject selection criteria
requiring the formation of group organizations and the identification of community-based
subprojects for which a recurrent budget allocation would be assured. To link the short-
term measures that are being supported under the proposed operation with the long-term
measures, by end-1995 the Government would review its planned expenditures for
delivering priority basic education, health, and other services and develop a draft strategy
for providing social services on a sustainable basis over the next five years. IDA would
be closely associated with the study with a view to assisting the Government identify a
follow-up operation in the human resources sector planned for 1998.
15.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Experience. Since the
proposed project would be the first IDA-assisted poverty/human resources sector operation
in Mongolia, lessons are not available from previous operations. However, lessons from
the pilot schemes and the Bank Group's experience in supporting poverty alleviation
projects and Social Investment Funds (SIFs) in other countries have been considered in
designing the proposed project. Most SIFs in Latin America were created to alleviate the
impact of adjustment programs on the poor. The key lessons incorporated in the design
of this project are that: (a) the poverty alleviation program is integrated into the economic
transition program to support the sustainability of the economic reform and the structural
adjustment; (b) political commitment at the highest level is demonstrated in the
preparation, review and approval of the PIP and the establishment of an independent
implementing agency, PAPMU; (c) a PIM describing the operating procedures would be
adopted; (d) to avert approval of subprojects that are not eligible, the Government would
publicize its transparent funding mechanism and procedure to the public, and release of
funds to the province-level implementing agencies would be contingent upon satisfactory
compliance with agreed procedures and full accounting of actual expenditures; and
(e) targeting of the poor would be achieved by allowing community participation in
subproject identification and the use of self-targeting by fixing wages slightly below the
market rate.
16.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy presented jointly with this operation to the Board. The
social cost of transition is manifested by the sharp decline in the standard of living of the
vulnerable groups, particularly women and children, erosion of human capital and the
deteriorating basic health indicators. While encouraging the Government to sustain the
adjustment program vigorously, an integral part of IDA's Country Assistance Strategy calls
for the protection of the vulnerable groups adversely affected by the country's economic
transition. Moreover, for the reform program to continue enjoying broad-based public
support, a cornerstone of our strategy, IDA's support for the PAP is critical. IDA's
wealth of experience in poverty alleviation operations in general, and social investment
funds in particular, makes it well qualified to take a lead assistance role through the



- 6 -
proposed operation. IDA's experience in the institution building of social funds in Latin
America and Africa which has attracted cofinancing is also a valuable asset for the
proposed project. The social fund framework being established in Mongolia with IDA and
UNDP assistance would facilitate additional donor contributions. Furthermore, IDA
involvement in the poverty alleviation program is a suitable entry point to assist the
Government in the design and implementation of a sustainable poverty alleviation and
human resources development program, and in addressing the long-term human resources
development issues through further possible support.
17.         Agreed Actions. The Borrower has agreed to: (a) get prior IDA approval
of any key amendments to the PIM; (b) open and maintain a PAF account in the Mongol
Bank and deposit its agreed counterpart contributions annually starting January 10, 1996;
(c) ensure that PAPMU shall have adequate staff and a full-time Director with suitable
qualifications satisfactory to IDA; (d) cause the district-level implementing agencies to
involve beneficiaries and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the identification,
implementation and supervision of subprojects; and (e) review its planned expenditures for
the delivery of priority basic education, health, and other services, and develop a draft
strategy for providing social services on a sustainable basis over the next five years to be
submitted to IDA for review not later than December 31, 1995. Conditions of credit
effectiveness are that (a) NPAC will have adopted and made effective the PIM in form and
substance acceptable to IDA; (b) the Borrower will have entered into and made effective
an agreement with UNDP for technical assistance and contractual arrangements for
execution by UNDP; and (c) the Borrower will have adopted an appropriate legislative
instrument to ensure, inter alia, that the implementing agencies are bound by the
Development Credit Agreement and the PIM.
18.         Program Objective Categories. The target beneficiaries of the project are
the absolute poor among the vulnerable groups who are currently unable to meet their basic
needs, together with those who may fall into these groups. Program components will build
on or operate through, to the extent possible, existing central and local structures rather
than aim at the establishment of separate services/facilities for the poor. As female-headed
households constitute the largest group of poor, a particular focus of the project will be
addressing the gender-related causes of poverty. Mongolian society as a whole would
benefit from the project through increased financial resources diverted away from subsidies
to priority community identified activities; through better use of underemployed resources;
and greater socioeconomic stability as a result of increased equity, opportunity, and human
development.
19.         Environmental Aspects. The project would have no direct environmental
impact.



- 7 -
20.         Participatory Approach. Mongolia's small population lends itself to a
manageable targeting of public programs to the absolute poor. District administrations
maintain detailed information on household incomes and classification of residents by
income groups. Effective participation of the vulnerable groups in identifying community-
wide needs is key to the successful implementation and sustainability of the program. To
facilitate meaningful participation, the district level implementing agencies assisted by
NGOs (where present) would involve the communities, including the vulnerable groups,
prior to undertaking any community-wide programs.
21.         Project Benefits. The project would contribute to the attainment of the
goals set in the PAP by mitigating the social costs of adjustment which, if not addressed,
will undermine the Government's economic reform program. Public works and other
vulnerable group activities will generate 0.7 million person-months of temporary
employment for all the absolute poor of working age. Moreover, the long-neglected public
infrastructure would be rehabilitated, improving opportunities for local area development.
The project would contribute to raising the school enrollment rate from 70 to 85 percent.
In addressing the gender-related effects of poverty, reduction of maternal mortality is the
focus of the rural health services component, which is aimed at achieving the pretransition
level of 12 per 10,000 births. The services and capacity of four institutions serving the
disabled would be enhanced through this project, providing direct assistance to about 600
physically disabled and mentally retarded children and adults. Through the development
and capacity building of the PAP institutional mechanism, the project would provide for
the longer-term sustainability of the PAP with a mechanism for channeling other donor
support. Creating an enabling environment for the community in general and the poor in
particular to participate in identifying community needs in infrastructure, education and
health would form the basis for a sustainable development approach.
22.         Risks. A key project risk is the limited institutional capacity to plan,
implement, monitor and evaluate a multisectoral poverty alleviation program. Project
implementation is largely delegated to local government entities and community
organizations with limited experience in decentralized decision-making. Moreover, if
donors provide assistance for poverty alleviation outside the institutional framework of the
PAP, local governments may be burdened by additional administrative and management
procedures. The institutional capacity constraints in the government would be reduced by
mobilizing donor support and coordination to strengthen existing structures and through
expanding ongoing programs and limiting new initiatives to a small proportion of the
project activities.  Staff training and awareness-raising seminars for senior local
government officials, NGOs and beneficiaries are also being provided. Another risk is
failure to target the poor to benefit from the project. To promote effective targeting and
delivery mechanisms, there will be local community-based identification of the vulnerable
people jointly by government and community organizations.

23.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

dollar amount greater than the original credit amount expressed in dollars.
