Project Completion Report
PREFACE
The Fourth Highway Project was financed with a credit of US$22.O
million, which was approved on June 15, 1976, was signed on June 23, 1976
and became effective on August 19, 1976. The closing date was extended
several times and finally set at December 31, 1983. The credit was fully
disbursed.
This Project CGmpletion Report (PCR) was prepared by
Transiortation Division 1, Eastern and Southern African Projects
Department. The PCR is based on data collected during the October 1984
project completion mission in Madagascar, updated traffic counts, vehicie
operating costs and investment costs provided by the Government and
info,mation contained in the Staff Appraisal Report, and a review of Bank
files including correspondence and supervision reports.
The project had two cofinancers: a) the Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa (BADEA) and b) the Federal Republic of Germany.
(i)  BADEA contributed a USS5 million loan.  This loan was to finance
about 16% of total project cost, net of taxes and was earmarked
specifically for the foreign cost of the Tsiroanomandidy-
Maintirano earthworks, or 53% of these works' total cost,
including taxes.
(ii)   Germany (FR) provided DM2.0 million (about US$800,000) for
procurement of workshop tools and equipment and part of the
training equipment for the Ministry of Works Training Centre
(Centre d'Appl.cation der Travaux Publics).
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
The draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were
received.

Fourth Uigh8ay Project - Credit 641-MAG
Project CompleTeon Report
HIGHILIGHTS
The Fourth Highway Project was the sixth of nine projects
financed by IDA in the transport sector. The project was designed to
assist the Madagascar Government in reduwing transport costs on a heavily
trafficked road, in opening up for development areas with high agricultural
potential, and in improving overall road maintenance quality.
This Project was the first that emphasized the shift from
expansion of the road network to road maintenance and institution building.
The overall implementation could be divided in two parts. The
first consisted of the construction of RNI and bridges on the
Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano road and the second largely covered road
maintenance assistance. The implementation of IDA-financed civil works
generally went very well with limited delays after initial start-up and at
less overall cost than expected in US dollars (but higher in current FMG).
The delays in the equipment procurement were largely responsible for the
delay in completing the project from 1980 to 1984.
The construction of the secondary gravel road (Tsiroanomandidy-
Maintirano) started in October 1978 and was initially expected to be
completed by October 1981 at a cost of about US$7.0 million. In August
1979 the V_,vernment changed the road design from a secondary gravel road to
a primary gravel standard road. The construction costs would have been
US$35.0 million making the improvement uneconomical. The Association did
not approve the change, and in 1983 the Minister of Public Works reverted
the scope of remaining work (after some 60 km had been constructed to
higher standards, financed by the Government) to the orig!.nal standards.
The construction of the training center and procurement of
training equipment were hampered by Government inexperience and procedures
which interrupted the contractor's work schedule and delayed pasments. An
additional probiem that caused the delay in the construction was the lack
of imported construction materials.  The contractor was finally li'ensed by
the Ministries of Finance and Commerce to import directly the necessary
construction materials and supplies.
Points of particular interest arising out of this project are:
(i) Disbursement almost continuously fell short of expected
performance. By end-1980, the original closing date, only 51% of
the IDA funds ha' been used and an four years were needed to



(vi)
complete disbursements. The delays in the equipment procurement
were largely responsible for the delay in completing the project
from 1980 to 1984. The reason for this problem was largely
institutional. (para. 3.16)
(ii) Institutional development has been slow but positive.  In part,
this has been due to very difficult economic and political
conditions over the last several years in MLadagascar. As a
result of the persistence of the Association under this project
(and the subsequent one" a road maintenance organization is now
beginning to become operational again after the loss of key staff
(mostly expatriates) in the beginning of the 1970s.  Due to the
strong emphasis on institutional development under this project,
clear results have been achieved. (para. 4.01).
(iii) During the implementation of the project the Malagasy Government
faced serious limitations of resources, both human and
financial. This has clearly been reflected in project
implementation, where the project components most dependent on
government (and in particular Ministry of Public Works) action,
have been slow to complete. Purchase of equipment as an example,
is normally rapidly undertaken in a highway proje't but in this
pLtject has taken a long time largely due to Government
procedures (para. 5.01).
(iv) The working relationship between IDA and the borrower was
generally good.  In the last few years joint solutions were found
to expedite the procurement of equipment and coordinate the
activities under this project. (para. 7.03)
(v) The credit covenants were not effective since they did not
address the underlying causes of non-compliance. The covenants
were unrealistic mostly because of the very difficult economic
and political situation. These two factors at the time of
appraisal and the subsequent implementation, largely explain the
ineffective compliance. At appraisal these conditions were
considered of limited duration, whereas in fact the economic
conditions worsened. (paras. 8.02 & 4.02)

Fourth HiRhway Proiect (Credit 641-MAC)
Project Completion Report
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The main long-term objective of the Malagasy Government for the
transport sector has been to build a system of highways radiating from the
central plateau and going around the coaz,t of Madagascar. Due to the size
of the island, the road system that has evolved, responded mainly to
immediate needs of a largely rural economy.  This has been supplemented by
two railways, coastal shipping and air transport. Nevertheless the present
Government's "Charter of the Revolution" dated August 1975 indicates that
it was considered essential to: a) cnnnect regional capitals gradually by
all-wt.ather roads; b) complete the main Antananarivo-Moramanga-Toamasina
road; c) maintain the road network effectively; and d) review transport
orgenizations to improve services.
1e02      The present transport system consists of about 50,600 km of
roads, of which about 4,890 km are paved roads, 5,260 km are engineered
earth and gravel roads and the remainder feeder roads and tracks mostly in
poor condition. There are four ports with international traffic:
Toamasina, Mahajunga, Antsiranana (Diego Suarez) and Toitara and another 16
ports mainly for coastal traffic. Some of these ports are connected to the
populated highland area by all-weather roads but most are not. This is
also the reason for a continued dependence on air transport from some 10
major airports and 45 airstrips. Two separate rail-lines total about 860
route-km. one of which handles most of the imports from Toamasina to
An tananarivo.
1.03      The Bank Group began assisting transport activities in the
country in 1966. The first three projects (Credit 903-MAG of 19b6, Credit
134/Loan 570-MAG of 1968 and Credit 351/Loan 876-MAG of 1973) in the
highway sector focussed on helping the Government pursue its objective of
providing better road access to regional economic centers. In totel these
projects financed the construction to paved standards of 708 km of roads.
Two railway projects (Credit 488-MAG of 1974 and Credit 903-MAG of 1979)
financed a modest increase in capacity and improvements in management and
railway operations. The Second Railway Project also included replacement
of outdated equipment, track renewal and improvement of telecommunications
and workshops. Up to now the only port project was for tOe extension of
the main port of Toamasina and the creation of a port authority to operate
it (Credit 200-MAG of 1970).

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification and Preparation
2.01      The Fourth Highway Project (referred to as Highways IV in this
report) was identified in September 1973 during the implementation and
supervision of the previous (Third) Highway Project (Credit 351-MAG and
Loan 876-MAG). Initially the project focussed on road construction
including the missing link on RN6 between Ant3ohihy and Ambanja (See Map
11744R). The RN6 is the only land connection between Antananarivo and
Diego Suarez (Antsiranana) in the north. Relatively early in the
discussions sections of the road Tsiroanomandidy- Maintirano were added.
Studies for RN5 on the east coast and Antananarivo-Toamasina Road were also
considered for inclusion as a result of these early contacts but were
finally deleted.  As project preparation advanced, road maintenance was
included in the project in addition to the Antsohihy-Ambanja road and parts
of the Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano secondary road (through assistance to
local contractors).
2e02      Since lack of trained manpower and maintenance had been evident
since the Third Highway Project, the Association's attention began to shift
from expansion of the road network to road maintenance and institution
building. This project was the first of three subsequent projects where
this policy has been adopted. As a result of the first substantial oil
price increase in 1973 the Third Highway Project needed additional funds.
The reconstruction of about 67 km of RNl (Arivonimamo- Analavory)
previously in the Third Highway Project, with realignment shortened to 60
km was added to Highways IV.
Appraisal and Negotiations
2.03      After appraisal in April 1975 the main components of the project
were (a) the Arivonimamo-Analavory section of RNI; (b) the upgrading of
Antsohihy-Ambanja Road (RN6); (c) minimum standard improvements to the
Tsiroanonandidy-Maintirano road and (d) technical assistance and training
of MPW's personnel. Limited traffic gave a low economic return for the
missing link on RN6 if constructed to as high geometric standards as
proposed by Government. The construction of the missing link was dropped
and bridges on the road were eventually finaticed under the Fifth Highway
Project. The decision meeting on this basis recommended a project
comprising the RNI, Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano Road and technical
assistance and training, and studies.  For the Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano
road cofinancing from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa
(BADEA) was sought and obtained (for US$5 million) in November 1975.
2.04      During preparation of the Staff Appraisal report in the Fall of
1975 it became evident that highway maintenance suffered because of the
lack of equipment. Therefore spare parts and road maintenance equipment
were added to the project, and assurances concerning future
maintenancebudget levels were obtained from the Malagasy government.
Negotiations were held between March 29 and April 2, 1976 and the credit
amount was increased from US$20 million to US$22 million to include
weighing stations, portable scales and additional equipment and spare parts



for road maintenance. At negotiations, the amount of the maintenance
budget for 1976 for the main highway network was established and it was
agreed that previous delays in payments to contractors under the Third
Highway project be settled up to December 31, }975. These were the two
conditions for Board presentation, and were met without delay.
2.05       The final composition of the project, as approved by IDA on June
15, 1976 was as follows:

2.06       The Development Credit Agreement (Cr. 641-MAG) for US$22.0
million was signed June 23, 1976.   The project was cofinanced by the Arab
Bank for Economic Levelopment in Africa (BADEA) with a US$5.0 million loan
and by Germany (FR) aid (US$800,000). The credit (641-MAG) became
effective August 19, 1976. The project was scheduled for completion by
June 1980 with a closing date of December 31, 1980.

IIl. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION & COST
A. Constructl!-
3.01      The major component of the project was the construction of about
60 km of the Arivonimamo-Analavory Road (RNI), to two-lane paved standards
over mountainous terrain, replacing an old winding 67 km road. For road
construction four bids were received from seven prequalified bidders. A
French firm with the lowest evaluated bid was awarued the contract. For
supervision five consultants were invited, three provided proposals and a
French-Malagasy firm (Annex I) was selected. The road was satisfactorily
completed after a 24 months construction period in June 1979, seven months
behind schedule due to initial delays in starting construction.
Construction costs were higher than the bid amount but about equal the
appraisal estimate including contingencies.
3.02      The other road works included the constructior of the 375 km
Tsircanomandidy-Maintirano earth road, where IDA financed the construction
of 18 bridges. These bridges were completed in December 1979 within the
contract period and costs. The bridge construction was awarded to the
lowest bidder, a French contractor, after IDA objected to an earlier
selection by the government of a higher bid. The works were supervised by
a French-Malagasy consultant selected from proposals submitted by three
firms. Concerning the earth works, these were to be entirely undertaken by
force account by the government. The road was to be improved tc a gravel-
standard secondary road. The earthworks and construction of bridge
approaches and protection works were financed by Government and BADEA, the
latter contributing US$5.0 million for this project component. The IDA
credit also financed supervision of construction of bridges and road
works. The contract for the execution of other road works was undertaken
by a Government-owned contractor in early 1978, since the government did
not have capacity to do these works directly by force account.
3.03      Road construction and bridge approaches for the
Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano road started in October 1978 and were scheduled
for completion by October 1981 at a cost of about US$7.0 million. In
August 1979 the Government changed the road design from a secondary gravel
road to a primary gravel standard road. The estimate of construction costs
soared from about US$9.0 million (including contingencies) to US$35.0
million, making these improvements uneconomical. The Association did not
agree to the change. Due to the contractor's involvement with other works,
inefficient management, and lack of experienced personnel and equipment,
works were spo adically carried out, until they came to a complete
standstill in September 1982, with the Government suspension of its
contracts with the contractor and consultants (see para. 3.05). At
suspension of contracts in September 1982, only partial improvement had
been carried out on (i) 120 km and (ii) on bridge approaches and protection
works. Of this some 60 km were built to a higher standard.
3.04      Following IDA's suggestion, the Minister of Public Works (MPW)
decided to reduce the scope of the remaining works to the level of a
gravel standard secondary road and gave priority to the completion of
bridge approaches and protection works. The US$3.0 million of BADEA



- 5 -
financing left was sufficient to cover the total costs of these limited
works for bridge approaches. The Government contractor in joint venture
with a French contractor restarted the works in October 1983. The works
were carried out on the Tsiroanomandidy-Beravina section (156 km) with
BADEA financing and substantially completed by December 1984. The section
Beravina-Maintirano (219 km) was improved by AMOCO, an international
petroleum company, within its oil exploration activities. The supervision
of works was finally carried out by technical assistance financed by FAC
(France).
B. Construction Supervision
3.05      Malagasy consultants jointly with the French firm satisfactorily
carried out the supervision of construction of RNI works and (until 1982)
of bridges and improvement works on the Tsiroanomandidy- Maintirano road.
After suspension by Government of the consultants' contract (para. 3.03) a
team composed of a FAC technical assistance expert and MPW personnel
carried out the last years supervision of earthworks of this road.
logistical support was provided to this team under a technical assistance
contract financed by IDA and the Governmunt under the Fifth Highway
Project .
C. Training
3.06      An American firm of consultants was selected (from proposals
submitted by three finms) for technical assistance to establish and execute
the training program with the agreement of the Association. The firm
provided a team of seven experts, partly financed under Highway V. The
team leader arrived in the field November 5, 1980; he was followed by a
workshop manager/trainer (August 7, 1981), a road maintenance expert
(September 21, 1981), an audio-visual training expert (September 21, 1981),
a road design expert (September 21, 1982) and two mechanical engineers
(October 11, 1983). The experts have established a training program and
have assisted the MPW in the selection of the local instructors.  Initially
some 15 local instructors started their training. This number was
increased to 39 on February 18, 1982. Of these, 30 completed training in
audio-visual techniques and were advanced to training technicians. The
trainees included 5 road technicians (foremen), 5 equipment operators, 18
mechanics and 2 audio-visual specialists. The first field training was
compleced in October 1983. About 21 of these have reached the final
training; they have been given training responsibilities under the
supervision of consultants. They include three foremen, three equipment
operators, and 15 mechanics. In addition to the training of instructors
the experts undertook the training of engineers in design, construction,
supervision of works, contracts and specifications. Seven engineers joined
the program on September 15, 1982; the number reached 27 on January 17,
1983. Of the 27 engineers, 14 completed their training in March 1984, 3
gave up the program and 10 were dropped from the program for lack of
qualifications. The consultants are also carrying out road maintenance
works and field training with a training/production brigade; they have
already improved about 200 km of RN2 and RN3, and trained 9 foremen, 70
technicians, and 5 equipment operators. The consultants also assisted the
Ministry of Public Works in constructing and outiitting of the training
center.



D.  Construction of a Training Center and Procurement of Training Equipment
3.07      The project also provided for construction of a building,
procurement of office and training equipment, and technical assistance for
the MPW (Centre d'Application des Travaux Publics (CATP)) training center
in Antananarivo. Part of the training program was continued with financing
under Highway V (para. 3.06). This project component was cofinanced by the
Federal Republic of Germany, providing DM2.0 million (about US$800,000) for
procurement of workshop tools and equipment and part of the training
equipment.
3.08      A Malagasy contractor started the construction of buildings in
March 1981 with July 1982 as the expected completion date. Construction of
classrooms, mechanical workshops, offices and dormitories were completed in
October 1983. Sites and service works were completed by force account in
December 1983. The work was hampered by the lack of experience of the
Government personnel in charge of supervision who interrupted the
contractor's work and delayed his payments. The consultants were asked to
provide their personnel to strengthen the supervision team. Another
problem which caused the delay in the construction was the lack of imported
construction materials in Madagascar. The contractor was finally licensed
by the Min'stries of Finance and Commere   o import directly the necessary
construction materials and supplies.
3.09      Following international competitive bidding (ICB), several
suppliers (Madagascar and France) provided training equipment to CATP;
delivery was completed in July 1983. Following unresponsive bids for
procurement of dormitory and cafeteria equipment, IDA agreed to a
Government proposal to procure this equipment through competitive shopping
under the consultant's contract for training. An amendment to the
consultant's contract was approved to that effect; this equipment has been
provided. Additional training equipment and workshop tools provided by
Federal Republic of Germany co-financing under Highway V are being
delivered.
E. Study for Pavement Resurfacing and Rehabilitation
3.10      The project provided for a study for resurfacing and
rehabilitation of 500 km of sections of the national roads Nos. 4 and 7.
Initial financing for construction is provided under the Fifth Highway
Project (Credit 938-MAG). Malagasy consultants jointly with an American
consultant, were selected to carry out this study; they started feasibility
studies in early 1980 and preliminary engineering in mid-1980, identifying
481 km, out of 1,100 km surveyed, for strengthening and rehabilitation. A
draft final engineering report was submitted in July 1981. The study was
behind schedule due to delays by MPW in preparing the consultants' contract
and deciding on consultants' proposals. It was only in February 1982 that
MPW communicated itc comments and those of the Association to the
consultants.  Following the cyclones and floods wh1.ich caused further
deterioration of the road network in 1982, consultants updated the bidding
documents to reflect these changes; the review was completed in August
1982.

F.  Procurement of Road Maintenance Equipment and Maintenance Operations
3.11      The need for road maintenance equipment and its maintenance was
studied in 1977 by an American firm selected from proposals submitted by
two firms. A list of equipment was agreed upon between Government and the
Association. All of this equipment was slowly procured after 1979. The
first tranche, procured under ICB, included six concrete mixers, one crane,
two bulldozers, one grader, one loader, one compactor, three crushers,
sixteen trucks, fourteen light vehicles and six weighbridges.  The
Government initially financed the entire cost (US$2.7 million) of this
equipment and was later reimbursed by the Association.
3.12      Following ICB, several suppliers (Madagascar and France) in 1982
provided a second tranche of equipment to MPW: twenty-five trucks, one
road tractor and trailer, two asphalt distributor trucks, and five light
vehicles. Following limited ICB, agreed upon by IDA, a local supplier
in 1983 provided the last tranche of the equipment (four low-bed trailers
with trucks, five pneumatic compactors, eight hand compactors and six
trailer-homes).
3.13      With the equipment procured under the Fourth (and Fifth) Highway
projects, eight brigades have been constituted for road maintenance and
operated during 1983. These brigades are operating in the Toliary region
for the improvement of RN9 and RNIO and in the rice producing regions of
Antananarivo and Lake Alaotra for the improvement of RNI, RN2, RN3, RN7 and
RN44. Works on RN44 (under Highway V) are being cofinanced by the French
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE). So far works have been
satisfactorily completed on about 325 km of paved roads (RNI, 2, 3 and 7)
and 700 km of earth roads (RN2, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 44 and RIP4). Twenty-nine
bridges have been repaired on RN5 and eighteen on RIPIO, and cantonnage has
been carried out on about 500 km of selected rural roads and on about 400
km of paved roads. The 1984 program included about 1,000 km of similar
operations.
G. Procurement of Portable Scales and Weighbridges
3.14      The portable scales and fixed weighbridges were delivered by
two Malagasy firms following ICB in 1977 after agreement with the
Association. A weighing campaign was done in 1979 after completion of
country-wide traffic counts, using portable scales, indicating truck
overloading. The portable weighing scales are not at present in working
order while the permanent weighbridges are in operation.
H. Project Costs and Disbursements
3.15      The actual final costs compared with the estimates at the time of
appraisal are shown in Annex I and Table 1. The actual disbursement are
shown in Table 2. The overall implementation in the end could be divided
into two major parts: (i) the construction of RNI and bridges on the
Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano road; and (ii) road maintenance, training and
technical assistance, and studies largely implemented subsequently. The
implementation of IDA-financed civil works generally went very well with
limited delays after initial start-up and at an overall cost as expected.
The delays in the equipment procurement were largely responsible for the



- 8 -
delay in completing the project from 1980 to 1984. Also the development of
training, technical assistance and building of a training school took much
longer than anticipated. Despite cost increases due partly to delayed
procurement, more equipment than originally planned was purchased partly
for training purposes, and put to good use, and still the total overall
cost was less than the appraisal expectations.  A study preparing the Sixth
Highway Project was also included in the project.
3.i6      Detailed cost estimates for project components not financed by
IDA are stili incomplete. For RNI and Tsiroanomandidy-+Maintirano bridges
total disbursements increased from US$9.4 million to US$10.4 million due to
an increase in the RNI disbursements from about US$6.2 million to US$7.8,
whereas the disbursements for the bridges components decreased from US$3.2
million to US$2.6 million. Thus US$1.0 million of US$5.4 million
unallocated were used for civil works, leaving US$4.4 million for other
project components. The allocation for the study of training needed
increased, mostly because of expansion of the scope and the inclusion of
some training. Some of the training costs were also carried out under
Highways V to continue the program over a longer time. The study of
equipment requirements had to revised and updated to meet changed
conditions. The result was a significant increase in purchase of highway
maintenance equipment. This was a well justified use of remaining
unallocated IDA funds which enhanced the effectiveness of Highways V. As
indicated in Annex I, overall cost in FMG increased from FMG 6.2 billion to
FMG 9 billion for IDA contracts, Ln US$ costs decreased slightly as a
result of changed exchange rates.
3.17      Despite the positive aspects of project implementation,
disbursements continuously fell short of expected performance as shown in
Table 2. By end-1980, the original closing date, only 51% of the IDA funds
had been used and an additional four years were needed to complete
disbursements. This was largely caused by MPW delays in defining equipment
requirements. The study on equipment needs took a relatively long time,
and by the end of 1979 only a first tranche had been awarded, and the
second tranche was not awarded until 1982. Disbursement requests also took
a long time for processing by the Government. With appointment of a new
Minister of Public Works in 1982 progress improved substantially. In the
end, to speed up procurement, purchasing agents were vsed for some of the
equipment and spare par-:s.
I. Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.18      After some initial delays in beginning their work, performance of
all consultants and contractors financed by the IDA part of the project
was generally good. On the Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano road the government
did not have the capacity to carry out the earthworks financed by BADEA
through direct force account. The Government therefore in 1977 requested a
government-owned contractor to carry out this construction. Work
progressed very slowly and finally came to a stop in 1982 (See para.
3.03).
3.19      A continuous difficulty for consultants, contractors and
suppliers were delays in approval of amendments to c-ntracts and slow
payments by the Government. This in turn sometimes resulted in delayed
delivery or completion of works.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Institutional Performance
4.01      As indicated in Chapter III institutional performance
improvements have been slow but positive.  In part, this has been due to
very difficult economic conditions over the last several years in
Madagascar. As a result of continued institutional assistance under this
and the Fifth Highway Project a road maintenance organization is now
beginning to become operational again after the loss of key staff (mostly
expatriates) in the beginning of the 197Cs. As this was the first highway
project to give significant attention to institutional development clear
results have been achieved. Not only have staff for some brigades been
trained, but an effective training school is now in place and a maintenance
program for primary roads is operating with special procedures to assure
domestic funding. An MPW program of priority road rehabilitation has also
been developed in consultation with other ministries.
B. Compliance with Credit Covenants
4.02      The experience with credit covenants has not been very good.
(See Annex II). Compliance has been slow and in some cases ineffective.
The most serious is a continuous road deterioration which has taken place
and at least partly could have been avoided had some of the covenants been
adhered to. Axle-load control was also ineffective and the weighing
campaign using weighbridges started 5 years behind schedule (Section 4.02
of the Credit Agreement).  The need to adequately maintain roads for which
MPW has responsibility were not met for several years (sections 4.08 of the
Credit Agreement).
4.03      In reviewing credit covenants, the very difficult economic and
political situation both at the time of appraisal and the subsequent
implementation largely explains ineffective compliance. At appraisal these
conditions were considered to be of limited duration, whereas in fact the
economic conditions got worse. The maintenance equipment and road
maintenance budget suffered as a result, which in turn led to
non-compliance of Credit Agreement section 4.04 which requires the
Government to adequately maintain roads for which MPW has responsibility in
accordance with appropriate engineering standards and with due regard to
financial and economic requirements. Despite the supplemental letter I and
the required exchange of views with the Association every fiscal year on
proposed budget for road maintenance, this budget only became adequate in
January i984. The program of axle-load control (Sections 4.02 a and b) had
sporadic attempts of implementation, which encountered serious political
resistance.

V. THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
5.01      The Malagasy Government during the implementation of the project
faced serious limitations of resources, both human and financial. This has
clearly been reflected in project implementation where the project
components most dependent on government (and in particular MNW) action were
completed slowly. Purchase of equipment as an example, is normally rapidly
undertaken in a highway project but in this project has taken a long time
largely due to Government procedures. The delays in implementation were
reduced after appointment of a new Minister of Public Works in January 1982
and his putting in place of a new management team. The delays were both in
evaluation of bids on proposals and in preparation of contracts. The lack
of qualified staff in MPW contributed to this situation, particularly in
the early part of the project.

VI. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
A. Traffic Development
Arivonimamo-Analavory Road (RN1)
6.01      The seventies were marked by political unrest, economic
stagnation and fundamental changes in overall economic policies. This
situation resulted in a lack of coherent transport policy during the whole
project period, in continuous uncertainties regarding basic Government
orientations on major questions such as the degree of autonomy of public
bodies and delays in reaching agreements and implementing decisions on
current matters such as procurement.
6.02      The traffic development on the main road of the project(RNI) is
well below the appraisal estimate. Actual data show that daily traffic,
450 vpd, is about 52% below the appraisal estimate for 1984 and lower than
in 1978.  Buses had the largest shortfall (81%), while trucks above ten
tons 78% lower than the appraisal estimates for 1984 (see Table 3). Trucks
of less than ten tons were 45% and cars 40% less than the appraisal
projections. Light vehicles had tIhe smallest decrease, 15% below appraisal
estimates. There are two major factors which could explain this traffic
decrease: (a) the decline in the level of economic activity; and (b) the
increase in the price of petroleum products. Contributing factors are also
(a) deterioration of the roads, (b) lack of fuel supplies, and (c) the poor
condition of the vehicle fleet, causing a large number to be out of
service.
6.03      Agriculture was the leading sector through which the government
wanted to increase economic activity in the late 1970s. However, economic
activity within this sector also declined sharply. For instance the
production of rice (which is the main component in the diet of Madagaskar)
fell behind population growth. Rice production increased by 2.3% p.a while
population growth was about 2.5% for tte country as a whole and about 3.6%
in the area of influence of this road.
6.04      The additional factor which influenced the decline in traffic
refers to the major oil price cLange in 1979.  The international price
per barrel of oil increased from US$12.9 in 1978 to US$30.5 in 1980. This
increase had a strong negative effect on the economic activity for
developing countries like Madagascar. The contraction in the economy of
the country meant that less transportation than anticipated was used for
both passengers and merchandise. The volume of imports of energy products
remained constant between 1980-83.
Tsiroanomandidy-Maintirano Road
6.05      0n two of the three road sections, actual traffic data indicate
that traffic roughly followed appraisal estimates for cars and light
vehicles.
6.06      A large discrepancy with appraisal estimates appears in the last
section Morafenobe-Maintirano, on which cars are about 84% below appraisal

estinate: six cars per day compared with 37 vehicles projected at
appraisal for 1984. Coneerming light vehicles (on the Morafenobe-
Maintirano Road), there was also a large discrepancy with tne appraisal
estimates that there would be about 16 light vehicles per day, the actual
traffic was only 2. The reason for this discrepancy was that expected
benefits from a livestock development project appraised by the Bank in
1973 did not materialize to the extent expected.M/
Economic Reevaluation
6.07      At appraisal the project was designed to assist Government in
reducing transport costs on a heavily trafficked road (RN1), in opening-up
development areas with high agricultural and livestock potential and
improving overall road maintenance. The economic evaluation was done by
comparing the "with" and "without" project cases of road improvement. A
complete comparison with the appraisal presentation is not possible because
procurement of road maintenance equipment was not quantified at appraisal
time.  (See para. 2.04)
6.08      The quantified benefits in the reevaluation are vehicle operating
costs savings and for RNI also time savings but not savings in road
maintenance. The three quantified components are: (a) the reconstruction
of a two lane paved road (RNI) between Arivonimamo and Analavory (60 km);
(b) construction of a secondary road from earth road in bad condition to
earth road in good condition running from Tsiroanomandidy to Maintirano
(initially about 375 km); and (c) procurement of road maintenance
equipment. The economic reevaluation was done with 1984 prices, with
necessary conversions of the construction and supervision cost using an
inflator on international and local prices. The economic life of the roads
is assumed to be 20 years for RN1, 15 years for the secondary road and 6
years for the road maintenance equipment. The benefits from road
maintenance equipment are calculated on the basis of decreased voc's due to
road improvement and run from 1983 until 1988. In the first year, 120 km
were implemented, in the second year 165 km, in the third 165 km and in the
fourth through the sixth, will be 150 km (see para. 3.13). Traffic growth
is asssumed at 4% throughout the economic life of the project, based on
population and economic growtn. This growth assumption is about two
percentage points below the appraisal e.Atimate and about one percentage
point above the projected GDP growth for the medium term  in Madagascar.
6.09      On the basis of inputs mentioned above (traffic counts, voc
savings and time savings) the combined rate of return of the three
components is satisfactory: 15% versus 13% at appraisal. The breakdown of
the ERR by components is the following:
(a) Route Nationale (RN1) about 12% as compared to about 13% at
appraisal estimate. The decrease in the projected traffic by
about 52%, effectively meant about 50% reduction in benefits if
voc had been the same. The price increase in voc largely

and Rural Development Project CRL 506-MAG, June 6, 1984. Page 53-56.



- 13 -
compensated for the decrease in traffic.  The re%'alculated ERR is
the same as the assumed opportunity cost of capitl ef about 12%.
(b) For the secondary road sections the recalculated ERR is about 2%
as compared with 12% estimated at appraisal.  The divergence
between these two rates could be explained largely by the meager
benefits from livestock projects implemented in that area.
Consequently no benefits relating to increasei agricultural
production were included in this ex-post estimate. In 1973 the
Bank appraised a project to assist livestock and rural
developmen: over four years in Majunga Province and
Tsiroanoman4idy subprefecture (see end of paragraph 6.06 and
footnote 1). However, herd growth was below expectations, which
in turn decreased the benefits of the feeder roads. The works
financed by IDA on these roads effectively increased the
accessibility of the area from barely four months of the year to
about eight months. Had the road works, and not just the
IDA-financed bridges been carried out as expected, a year-round
link would have been established,
(c) Road maintenance equipment yielded a high rate of return: about
42%. Even if benefits were reduced by 20%, the ERR only
decreases to 34% which is still high and compares very favorably
with the opportunity cost of capital of 12%.
6.10      The combined rate of return for secondary roads and RN1 is about
9%, which is about four percentage points below the appraisal estimate
(13.0%). However, the combined rate of return of this project is about 15%
(iL.2luding the road maintenance equipment component) compared with the
combined appraisal estimate of 13.0% (which did not quantify road
maintenance equipment). The actual rate of return is about two percentage
points above appraisal and three percentage points above the opportunity
cost of capital.
6.11      Considering the limitations of the foregoing analysis, the
recalculated overall rate of return would serve as the best indicator of
the success of the project, since the 20 years economic life of RNI started
only recently.

VII. THE ROLE OF IDA
7.01       Since the first transport project in 1966 the Bank Group has
played a lead role in the sector. This project was part of this continuing
process. What was achieved by this project was a shift from new road
construction to maintenance and rehabilitation of the existing system and
institution building. Sot.e of the benefits are now only just beginning to
be realized since road maintenarce nas been lacking in many parts of
Madagascar.
7.02      The Association's perception of the priorities for the sector was
essentially correct and so was :he content of the project. An exception,
as indicated in Chapter VI, was the secondary road part of the project
(Tsiroanomandidy-Maintira&-o) which did not achieve what was expected
largely because expected agricultural development did not materialize from
investments made in other projects. In addition, IDA overestimated the
implementation capacity of the Ministry of Public Works which was
reorganized at the beginning of the project (1975). More frequent
supervision at that time might have helped somewhat to speed up equipment
procurement.
7.03      The working relationship between IDA and the borrower was
generally good. In the last few years joint solutions were found to
expedite the procurement of equipment and coordinate the activ.tties under
this project and the Fifth Highway Project.  The Association also assisted
the government in obtaining cofinancing from BADEA, Germany (FR) and to
some extent FAC for specific project components as described above in
Chapter III.
7.04      The civil works implementation went as expected at appraisal.
What took substantially longer waa to decide on equipment needs. Delays in
this process were partly due to conditions outside the control of both the
borrower and IDA (para. 4.03). The Association also was not very
successful with some of the credit covenants, where in particular the
axle-load control was not effectively implemented. A more critical review
should have been made of the practical possibilities of meeting such
covenants prior to including them in the loan documents.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      Generally the project has been successfully implemented although
disbursements were much slower than anticipated. Two (RNI and equipment)
of the four major project components were clearly well justified despite
lower traffic than forecasted* The combined ERR was higher than at
appraisal. The third component, the craining school, was not evaluated in
economic terms but is an important factor in Government's longer term road
maintenance program. The last component, the secondary road to Maintirano,
was well implemented concerning the IDA-finaned component, but not
justified on the whole partly because of low traffic and partly because of
slow or limited implementation of other parts of that road project. The
Association at an early stage warned against too high a standard for this
road and that the proposed investment would result in an uneconomic
project until agricultural production in the area expanded.
8.02      The dialogue with the Association on the whole has also been good
throughout the project. Although the project was justified, a major
shortcoming was the delay in implementing effective highway maintenance.
In the past this was the result of slow procurement of maintenance
equipment. Another important reason, was very limited Government funds, in
turn due to stringent economic conditions and institutional capability.
Miuch of this was not foreseeable at the time of appraisal. Some of the
loss of key staff was evident already then, but became worse. The
covenants were not effective since they did not address the underlying
causes of non-compliance. The covenants were unrealistic mostly because of
poor economic conditions. In general, the Association overestiirated the
capacity of MPW to undertake the project and some earlier technical
assistance and solutions like the use of procurement agents may have
helped. The lessons learned in this project nevertheless have facilitated
implementing the succeeding projects, and in particular the Fifth Highway
project.
