SUMMARY
i.        The project appraised in this report comprises (i) a $30 million
dfc-type loan to Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) includ-
ing $2 million'reserved for financing expansions of existing Small Scale Enter-
prises (SSEs); and (ii) a $5 million line of -redit to the government for newly
created SSEs. The SSE component is a pilot scheme -- therefore somewhat risky.
It will be centered around BDET, but part of the funds will be channelled by
the government to SSEs through the branch network of commercial banks. Tech-
nical assistance to SSEs will also be organized in the framework of the
project.
ii.       Since the early 70's, the development of Tunisia's manufacturing
industry is gradually changing its orientation from import substitution
towards export-oriented activities. The Fifth Plan (1977-81) foresees, for
the manufacturing sector, investments of D 950 million, with priority given
to investment decentralization; an increase inT value added at 11.7% p.a. in
real terms; the doubling of manufacturing exports; and the creation of 90,000
jobs. Most employment creation would be in the private sector; this requires
encouragements to new entrepreneurship, in medium and small scale industries
(paras. 2.01-2.06).
iii.      There are an estimated 80,000 SSEs in Tunisia, of which 18,000 in
the manufacturing sector, but information on SSEs is scanty. SSE deve opment
has been at a disadvantage in the past, because the development strate v of
Tunisia gave priority to large and medium enterprises. The government; s;ti-
tude has now changed, as SSEs are seen as potential contributors to solve '--
country's unemployment problems. In 1975 the government set up a budget-
financed fund (FOPRODI) intended to provide financial assistance to the estab-
lishment of new SSEs. An extension service catering to SSEs will be organized
by API (Agence de Promotion des Investissements) and will coordinate other
forms of assistance available to SSEs (paras. 2.06-2.12).
iv.       The Tunisian financial system is tightly regulated by the authori-
ties. BDET plays a key role in financing the industrial sector; commercial
banks are also induced to finance industrial projects with medium term loans
(up to 7 years). Interest rates were maintaiLned at a low level during the
Fourth Plan, which hampered the development of medium and long term credit
instruments. Following discussions with the Bank, IFC and the IMF, the
Central Bank made a study of interest rates which led to their overall in-
crease by up to 1-3/8 points. Medium-term rates for rediscountable loans
to industry range now between 8 and 8-1/4%. The rate payable on new BDET
long-term loans to resident industrial borrowers will also increase from 8%
to 9% as of January 1, 1978 following the Government decision to abolish its
1% rebate on such loans. Further liberalization of credit, and measures to
vitalize the capital market are subjects of the ongoing dialogue between the
authorities and the Bank (paras. 2.13-2.17).
v.        BDET carried out a reorganization in 1976, which resulted in con-
siderable improvement of the effectiveness of its management. BDET's house



- ii -
has been put in order in the areas of financial management and quality of
portfolio. Procedures are satisfactory, though improvements are needed as
regards appraisals and, especially, supervision. Recognizing the progress
made, the Bank agreed, in 1976, to a relaxation of some of the provisions in
BDET's policy statement (Chapter III).
vi.       BDET's approvals declined in 1975, largely because of a resource
squeeze, and of the increased competition of commercial banks since the author-
ities extended the limit of commercial bank's medium term credit from 5 to 7
years. Approvals picked up again in 1976 (D 30 million) with more new (versus
expansion) projects, and with an increase in the average size and duration of
loans. Tourism financing was reduced to 25% of total, as agreed with the Bank.
Slightly less than one half of BDET's operations are in the Tunis metropolitan
area (paras. 4.01-4.06).
vii.      BDET contributes about 30% of total term lending to the industrial
and tourism sector.  In the 1974-76 period BDET-financed projects generated on
average about 9,000 new jobs per year, at an average investment cost per job
of about D 9,000. Export projects were only 4% of BDET's 1976 approvals while
projects of new entrepreneurs were 13%. The financial and economic returns of
BDET's projects are generally satisfactory (better than 15%). BDET's activity
in the capital market declined in importance in the past two years (paras.
4.09-4.14).
viii.     Total available term resources almost doubled between 1974 and 1976;
the Bank's share in BDET's resources declined from 37% to 25%. BDET has been
successful in mobilizing new resources, especially in the Arab world. In 1976
BDET borrowed for the first time in the free, international market. The bond
issue, of 7 million Kuwaiti dinars, was subscribed by the Kuwaiti Investment
Company (KIC). Due to the thinness of the Tunisian domestic bond market,
BDET's principal source of domestic financial resources are the Government and
the Central Bank (paras. 5.01-5.03).
ix.       BDET's auditors issued a clean opinion on the 1975 and 1976 accounts,
with two minor reservations. Provisions have been brought to a satisfactory
level, and the arrears situation has improved and is now brought under control.
Reschedulings, however, have been high in 1976 (17% of loan portfolio) largely
as a result of delays in the implementation of recently approved projects.
Good progress has been made in validating mortgages of hotel borrowers, in
line with the timetable agreed with the Bank. The yield of BDET's equity in-
vestments declined to less than 4% in 1976 (paras. 5.04-5.13).
x.        BDET's profitability remained adequate and permitted an increase in
dividends from 6% to 7% in 1976. Capital structure is satisfactory. The Bank
agreed, in 1976, to an increase of the debt/equity ratio limit from 5:1 to
7:1. but excluding subordinated loans from the equity base (paras. 5.14-5.15).
xi.       BDET's yearly approvals are expected to increase gradually to D 40
million ($100 million) by 1981, providing about 30% of total term financing
for industrial projects. In line with the Plan's guidelines BDET will give



- iii -
priority to (a) labor intensive projects; (b) export-oriented projects; (c)
projects outside Tunis; (d) projects of new entrepreneurs; and (e) SSE proj-
ects. Bank funds will be reserved essentially for the financing of the above
priority categories (paras. 6.01-6.03).
xii.      To finance its operation programs BDET will have to mobilize D 143
million during the Fifth Plan (1977-81), of which D 56 million ($130 million)
in the two years 1978-79. Only D 21 million are already identified. The
proposed Bank loan and local bond issues will only partly fill the resource
gap. BDET will have to borrow up to D 20 million in the international markets
before the end of 1979 (paras. 6.04-6.06).
xiii.     BDET profitability would decline in the next few years, due to the
effects of the Government-imposed low interest rates policy of the recent past,
coupled with the rising cost of resources. BDET's current nominal lending
rate of 9% (which together with other financial charges and taking into
account the collection of interest six months in advance corresponds to an
effective lending rates of about 9.65%) will not be sufficient for BDET to
maintain an adequate profitability. Yet, except in the case of tourism proj-
ects for which BDET has agreed to increase its lending rate to 9.5%, the rate
cannot be further increased for fear of jeopardizing BDET's competitive posi-
tion with respect to commercial banks which extend rediscountable medium-term
loans to industry at an average rate of 8 to 8-1/4%. Agreement was reached
during negotiations on a system of Government rebates on the cost of BDET's
foreign exchange resources obtained at non-concessionary terms, calculated in
such a way as to ensure, on an ex-ante basis, an adequate spread on BDET's
operations. This will also permit BDET to aclequately remunerate its capital,
which will increase from D 6 million to D 10 million between 1978 and 1980.
The Government's share in BDET's capital might increase somewhat from the
current 12% following the capital increase. The debt/equity ratio will be
maintained within 8:1 excluding subordinated loans from equity (paras. 6.07-
6.11).
xiv.      The main objectives of the proposed loan to BDET are:  (a) helping
BDET finance priority projects in accordance with the Plan's strategies; this
includes the leading role BDET is expected to play in the proposed scheme of
assistance to SSEs; and (b) helping BDET establish itself as a viable borrower
in the international financial markets: Bank resources are expected to
decline to 17% of BDET's indebtedness by 1979. The loan would be repayable
in 13 years on a level principal payments basis (paras. 7.01-7.04).
xv.       The $7 million SSE component of the proposed loan will finance both
newly established SSEs costing less than D 200,000 at 1976 prices and expan-
sions of existing SSEs with fixed assets of less than D 100,000 at 1976
prices. $5 million will be lent to the Government for onlending to new SSEs
through the existing FOPRODI scheme. BDET will participate in the scheme and
will administer Bank selection and disbursement procedures. FOPRODI does not
finance expansion projects, so $2 million of the SSE component will be lent



- iv -
directly to BDET for onlending to eligible SSE expansion projects.  SSE loans
will have terms of 7-11 years, and carry on 8 to 8-1/4% interest rates. The
banks administering FOPRODI will be encouraged to participate with their own
resources in the financing of SSE projects, as Bank funds will not cover over
50% of total investment costs (paras. 7.06-7.10).
xvi.      In parallel with the Bank-financed scheme of financial assistance
to SSEs, the Government agreed to set up a system of technical assistance for
SSEs, based on the existing structure of API which is already in charge of
determining, on behalf of the Government, projects' eligibility for FOPRODI
assistance. The technical assistance scheme when completed will consist of
about 20 specialists of whom 16 in API's regional branches. They will co-
ordinate all forms of technical assistance which other agencies will be able
to offer SSEs. API will be assisted, for the initial two years of this
experience, by foreign experts, whose cost will be financed by a bilateral
or multilateral aid agency (paras. 7.09-7.10).
xvii.     The project is suitable for Bank finance, in view of the conditions
agreed with the Government and BDET, as regards, on the one hand, BDET's opera-
tions and its use of the Bank's funds, and, on the other hand, the setting up
of a system of financial and technical assistance to SSEs (Chapter VIII).



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       This report appraises a project consisting of (i) a dfc-type loan of
$30 million to Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) including
$2 million to be earmarked for financing exp .sions of existing small scale
enterprises (SSEs); and (ii) a line of credit of $5 million to the Government
to provide financial and technical assistance to newly created SSEs in Tunisia.
1.02      BDET provides term loan financing as well as equity investments to
industry and tourism; it has received so far six Bank loans for a total of $69
million. IFC holds 10% of BDET's share capital. The previous Bank loan was
made in early 1976, and is now fully committed. The appraisal report (No. 962-
TUN) for that loan, which this report updates, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on December 19, 1975. BDET has made considerable progress since it
was last appraised. A seventh loan to BDET would have three principal objec-
tives: (i) to help finance the foreign exchan,ge component of high priority
industrial projects; (ii) to help BDET establish itself as a viable borrower
in international financial markets; and (iii) to serve as a vehicle for the
Bank to start financing SSEs in Tunisia.
1.03      The SSE component of the proposed project is of an experimental
nature and contains an element of risk becausE the Bank has never before fi-
nanced SSEs in Tunisia and there are no estab'Lished structures in the -ountry
specifically geared to assisting SSEs. The proposed scheme will be cer.-ered
around BDET; however, since BDET has no decentralized outlets, part of tu,
funds destined to SSEs will be lent to the Government for channelling to SSEL
through the regional branch network of four commercial banks. Financial
assistance to SSEs will be complemented by the creation by the Tunisian gov-
ernment of a system of technical assistance services to SSEs. No such system
exists now in Tunisia, and its creation will require the assistance of expa-
triate experts to be financed by multilateral or bilateral aid agencies. The
objectives of the SSE component of the proposed project include: ti) an insti-
tution building goal, consisting of helping the Government devise the creation
of necessary structures for fostering the development of SSEs; and (ii)
preparation of a more comprehensive Bank-financed follow-up project.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT 1/
A. Manufacturing Sector
2.01       During the early 1970's, while the bulk of manufacturing investment
was still concentrated in industries catering to the local market, a strong
effort was made to promote export-oriented manufacturing industries, and
1/   A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Tunisia; Review of
the Fifth Development Plan 1977-1981 (1539-TU), was issued on May 2, 1977;
it reviews the results of the Fourth Plan (1973-76) and assesses prospects
for the Fifth Plan.



-2-
to prevent the expansion of import-substitution activities beyond their limits
of efficiency. Simultaneously, the public sector's role as entrepreneur was
de-emphasized and a generous incentive system was created to promote private
investment.
2.02      By 1976, at the end of the Fourth Plan (1973-76) the manufacturing
sector accounted for 11.2% of GDP compared with 8% in 1960. A break-down by
branches shows a predominance of food processing (33%), textiles and leather
(25%) and, mechanical and electrical industries (13.6%). About 70% of all
manufacturing production was generated in the North East, of which 59% in Tunis
alone. Employment in the manufacturing sector, including the informal sector,
amounted to 270,000 jobs, or 14.2% of Tunisia's labor force in 1976.
2.03      Overall, industry has performed well during the Fourth Plan (Annex
1). The investment target was exceeded in real terms by 20%, with most of
the increase taking place in the private sector. Employment creation also
exceeded the target by creating 61,000 new jobs, or 50% more than expected.
Value added in real terms increased at 6.5% p.a. Good overall results have
been fostered by (i) the system of investment incentives (mainly tax exemp-
tions) granted by the Investment Code modified in 1974 and by the 1972 export
promotion law; and (ii) by the establishment of new institutions to assist
industry such as API 1/, responsible for the administration of the investment
laws, and AFI 2/ responsible for acquiring and developing industrial land
(Annex 23).
2.04      The Fifth Plan (1977-1981) objectives for the manufacturing sector
aim essentially at the continuation of the policies of the Fourth Plan, with
the following emphasis: (i) a growth in value added in real terms at 11.7%
p.a., with non-agricultural industries growing at 15.9% p.a.; (ii) total
investment of D 950 million, at current prices, equivalent to 23% of total
planned investment; (iii) increase of manufacturing exports from D 151 million
in 1976 to D 327 million in 1981; and (iv) creation of 90,000 new jobs, or 43%
of all non-agricultural employment to be created during the Plan period.  The
public sector will continue to play a leading role in implementing strategic
projects of a capital-intensive, high-technology nature and will be reponsible
for implementing over 50% of the proposed investment program. The financial
1/   One of the primary functions of API (Agence de Promotion des Investisse-
ments) is to assist prospective investors both at home and abroad by dif-
fusing information and expediting procedures in determining eligibility
of new investments for government incentives. Between 1973 and mid-1976,
API approved 3,494 new projects with a total investment of D 657 mil-
lion and an employment generation potential of 123,000 new jobs.
2/   AFI (Agence Fonciere Industrielle) was also created in 1973.  The
nature of its work has made AFI's take-off look less impressive than
API. However, the initial efforts devoted to land acquisition, loca-
tional analysis, and initiation of civil works, will have an impact on
industrial expansion during the Fifth Plan.



-3-
performance of government-owned enterprises has been weak in the past, requir-
ing frequent budgetary transfers, largely because of low initial capitaliza-
tion and unrealistic pricing policies. This is now changing, as the Govern-
ment has adopted the policy of granting public sector enterprises greater
autonomy while requiring that they become self-supporting. Private investment
is expected to be predominant in export-oriented manufactures, such as elec-
trical and mechanical goods assembly, garments, leather products, and textile
manufacture (Annex 1, Table 1.4). An important role is also assigned to small
scale industries in providing employment and in improving income distribution.
2.05      Performance of Tunisian industry during the first half of the 70s
supports the feasibility of Plan's targets. Their actual achievement will
require however, that project identification, preparation and execution capa-
bilities (eg. API) be further strengthened. At present, only about 70% of the
expected manufacturing investment for 1977-81 is properly identified and over
D 300 million are still unidentified. The bulk (67%) of identified manufac-
turing investment for the Fifth Plan is in relatively capital-intensive public
sector projects (petrochemicals, basic chemicals, and cement) with an average
cost per job of about $30,000. In order to reach the target of 90,000 new
jobs in manufacturing, nearly 40,000 jobs will have to be created through cu-
rrently unidentified projects at an average cost per job of less than $18,000;
this would require intensified support of small and medium enterprises in the
light manufacturing subsectors.
B. Small-Scale Enterprises (SSEs) 1/
2.06      Tunisians have a long tradition of craftsmanship and business capa-
bilities and the number of small non-agricultural enterprises, defined as
those employing less than 50 workers, is estimated to be close to 80,000
(18,000 of them in manufacture). Yet Tunisia's administrative, fiscal and
financial system have not favored the development of SSEs in the past.
Tunisia's industrial development strategy in the last two decades has given
priority to large scale public enterprises and, more recently, to modern
medium-size privately owned enterprises benefiting from generous incentives
and institutional support. This process has not favored SSE development, be-
cause (a) investment incentives were linked to criteria into which SSEs do not
fit, such as the absolute size of employment creation and value of exports 2/;
(b) SSEs had limited access to the banks' financing; and (c) the authorities
provided no assistance geared to the needs of SSEs.
2.07      SSEs have not been comprehensively studied in Tunisia.  According to
the 1973 industrial census (which excluded all firms employing less than 5
1/   See also Annex 2 for a more detailed description of the SSE sector.
2/   Although a change of the investment laws is not foreseen in the immediate
future, ways to eliminate the implicite bias against SSEs are being
studied by the government. This aspect will require further discussions
during preparation of the proposed follow-up SSE project.



- 4 -
people) small industrial firms employing between 5 and 50 workers accouinted
for 21.4% of industrial employment, for 77% of industrial establishments, but
for only 15% of the manufacturing sales (see Annex 2, Tables 1 and 5, for dis-
tribution of SSEs by size and region). In 1976, a complete inventory of all
non-agricultural enterprises in major cities was started. The survey identi-
fied in Sousse, Sfax and Gabes alone 5,023 manufacturing firms with 1 to 10
employees. Such figures, compared with the census figure of 281 firms for
the entire country, show the importance of SSE activities not covered by the
census. 1/
2.08      The SSE sector is mainly oriented toward the production of household
goods for local markets. Three groups accounted, in 1973, for 63% of produc-
tion: food and beverages (36%), metal products (15%) and textiles (12%).
Small firms were also important in furniture and building materials. Informa-
tion is not available regarding fixed assets in SSE manufacturing in Tunisia.
2.09      FOPRODI Scheme.  A change in the Government's previous attitude of
benign neglect was marked by the creation, in 1974, of the FOPRODI (Fonds de
promotion et de decentralisation industrielle), a budget-financed fund intended
to encourage the sponsors of small industrial projects, especially those out-
side Tunis. Under the FOPRODI scheme (Annex 24), eligible entrepreneurs 2/
obtain subsidized personal loans to supplement their venture capital and to
help them acquire a majority ownership in the equity of the new enterprises;
the smaller projects (total cost under D 30,000 3/) are also eligible for
subsidized long-term credits to the SSE itself, as opposed to the entrepreneur.
Eligibility for FOPRODI assistance is determined by API. FOPRODI itself is
not an institution; it is administered through participating commercial banks,9
which are expected to contribute their own resources in term-loan financing,
necessary to complete the financial plan for FOPRODI projects. Since it
became operative (in December 1975) until May 1977, FOPRODI has financed 81
projects, with total investments of D 7,093,148 and creating of 2,553 new jobs
(Annex 2).
2.10      Other steps are being taken now towards an integrated program in
support of SSEs. Of particular relevance are the creation of an SSE policy
making unit in the Ministry of the Economy, and the decision to set up a
countrywide system of technical assistance to SSE which will be built around
the API network of regional branches and will combine efforts with AFI, CNEI
(Centre National d'Etudes Industrielles--Annex 23) and local governments.
1/   Preliminary data on employment for the Sousse province alone show 3,018
people employed in this sub-group in 1976. The census shows a total of
1,643 for the country as a whole in 1973.
2/   Tunisian citizens with technical qualifications willing to devote them-
selves full-time to the new enterprise and sponsoring a project costing
less than D 200,000 (this limit has been revised upwards to D 500,000
in October 1977).
3/   This limit has been revised upwards to D 75,000 in October 1977.



-5-
2.11      SSE Constraints and Problems.  Excessive import protection and
indiscriminate import substitution during the 60's favored the subsistence of
traditional SSEs by conserving inefficient structures and reducing competition.
The negative effects of such policies became more apparent when the gradual
opening up of the economy, in the early 70's, caught SSEs out of step in the
transition towards modern and efficient production units. Major problems
adversely affecting their productivity and constraining their growth, are not
different from those observed in other countries at similar stages of develop-
ments. They include: outdated machinery, deficient production planning and
accounting-management, lack of quality control, poor plant layout and product
design, poor working facilities. In marketing their products, SSEs cannot
cope with market fluctuations due to acute shortages of raw materials (sub-
ject to import licensing) and to limited access to institutional finance.
A characteristic of Tunisian SSEs is the regional concentration of some small
industries, like weaving in Monastir, carpet making in Kairouan, metal fabri-
cating in Sousse and Sfax. Such regional specialization favors integration
with large, modern plants and upgrading of productivity through subcontracting.
2.12      Strategy for SSE Development.  A strategy to develop SSEs should aim
simultaneously at employment creation and at :improving productivity. Unemploy-
ment has been singled out by the government and the Bank as the most important
problem facing the Tunisian economy. 1/ SSE development can make a substantive
contribution to gainful employment generation if the productivity and competi-
tiveness of the small shops now working on a stop-go basis is effectively
increased. This is possible through upgrading operating techniques and re-
placing equipment. 2/ SSE viability and self sustained growth can be attained
by focussing their potential on activities with insignificant economies of
scale, catering to specialized or low-priced market niches, or complementary
to production processes of large firms.
2.13      The transition from traditional small shops into small but efficient
units requires some support by the Government, through various forms of tech-
nical and financial assistance aiming at putting SSEs on an equal footing with
the larger firms. In the Tunisian environment, this may eventually require
the establishment of a specialized agency, where all forms of public assistance
to SSE development would be centralized. The Government is not yet prepared
to take this step, and prefers, at this stage, to put the emphasis on reinforc-
ing, and better coordinating among themselves, ongoing initiatives toward
assisting SSEs. API, which is responsible for selection of projects eligible
for FOPRODI assistance, and which already disposes of a decentralized network
of regional branches, appears to be the most suitable agency to coordinate
ongoing efforts of assistance to SSEs, and to establish, within its organiza-
tion, an extension service catering to SSEs.
1/   In the non-agricultural sector, unemployment in 1976 amounted to 22% of
the registered labor force (Tunisia-Special Economic Report, 1977).
2/   Modernization does not imply, in this context, over-mechanization and
labor displacement. Appropriately chosen equipment and technologies can
upgrade quality, improve competitiveness, expand operations and, even-
tually, generate (or maintain) permanent employment.



-6-
C. Financial Sector
2.14      Tunisia's financial community is composed of 10 commercial banks,
two development finance companies (BDET, which finances industry and tourism,
and COFIT, which finances exclusively tourism), another small investment bank,
two savings institutions and several insurance companies. Off-shore banks are
being set up in Tunisia following a 1976 law which permits their establishment
but limits their activity to foreign currency financing. The authorities use
an array of monetary policy instruments, including the administrative determi-
nation of interest rates, reserve ratios related to banks' liabilities, and
variable reserve requirements; however, the Central Bank has relied primarily
on prior approval of large credits granted by commercial banks, and on redis-
count ceilings, to implement its credit policies.
2.15      While the large industrial development projects in Tunisia, gener-
ally sponsored by public sector enterprises, are financed by the government or
through direct foreign borrowings, the authorities rely on the banking system
for the financing of the medium and small scale industrial development proj-
ects. BDET plays a central role in this respect (30% of total term credit
extended to the industrial sector was held by BDET as of end 1976) 1/ and for
this reason the authorities channel toward BDET concessionary foreign exchange
loans as well as long-term local currency resources. Commercial banks are
encouraged to participate in the development financing effort by the require-
ment that 18% of their deposits be placed in medium-term private loans, and by
the availability of rediscounting facilities for refinancing further commer-
cial bank lending to the private sector. Term credit represented 36% of total
commercial banks' credit to the economy at end 1976.
2.16      The overall level of interest rates has been kept low (Annex 1,
Table 1.5) during the Fourth Plan period (1973-76) compared with the rate of
inflation (4.1% in 1974, 9.6% in 1975 and 5.4% in 1976). Private savings (in-
cluding those of public sector enterprises) averaged about 20% of GDP during
the Fourth Plan, and financed about 60% of total investments. Low interest
rates, however, have been partly responsible for insufficient mobilization of
savings through medium and long-term financial instruments. The domestic
capital market (especially the bond market) is extremely thin and remains a
major weakness of Tunisia's financial system. Furthermore, on the the demand
side, the ceilings on interest rates have deprived the banks of the incentive
to take term risks, and resulted in a rationing and possible sub-optimal allo-
cation of medium and long-term credit. Partly as a result of discussions
with the Bank, IFC, and the IMF, the Government has become increasingly aware
of these problems particularly in view of the resource mobilization effort
needed to finance the investment targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1977-81).
2.17      In 1977, the Central Bank conducted a major study of the structure
and level of interest rates of commercial banks. Following its conclusions,
1/   BDET also plays an important role in the financing of tourism investment.
As of end-1976, BDET held 22% and COFIT 18% of total term credit extended
to the tourism sector.



- 7 -
the Central Bank raised its official rediscount rate from 5% to 5.75%, effec-
tive September 1, 1977, and deliberated that the commercial banks' deposit and
lending rates be increased by up to 1-3/8 percentage points (Annex 1, Table
1.5). Medium-term lending rates for rediscountable loans to the industrial
and tourism sectors (other than to resident export-oriented enterprises and to
enterprises in the least developed regions) have been increased from a range
of 6.25-8%, to a range of 8-8.25%.1/ The rate payable on new BDET long-term
loans to resident industrial borrowers will also increase from 8% to 9%, as of
January 1, 1978, following the Government decision to abolish its 1% rebate
on such loans. These are steps in the right direction. The authorities
intend to closely monitor the development of the domestic inflation rate
(which is currently projected to be kept below 7% p.a. during the Fifth Plan
period) as well as the level of lending rates in the international market,
with a view to maintain domestic interest rates significantly positive in real
terms, and to harmonize them with interest rates prevailing abroad.
2.18      In parallel with the Central Bank's study on interest rates, the
Ministry of Finance has prepared a study on the domestic capital market; the
study's conclusions recommend legislative measures to be taken in order to
foster the development of the market. These include: the creation of new,
more attractive types of securities (convertible bonds, investment fund shares,
etc.); the revamping of laws and regulations affecting the bourse and the
stock brokers (at present, only banks can operate as brokers in the Tunis
bourse); encouragements to the banks to promote the placement of savings by
the public in securities, and to be themselves more active in the market; a
rationalization of tax and other incentives to both issuers and buyers of
securities; and, finally, higher yields on bond issues. The implementation
of these measures has not yet been decided. This, together with the still
excessive rigidity of the Central Bank's control over credit and interest
rates, and with the tightness of exchange controls (including the desirability
of passing on the exchange risk to the ultimate borrowers of foreign exchange
loans--see also para. 6.06) is the object of the ongoing dialogue between the
Bank and the Tunisian authorities, on the reform of the financial system.
III.  BDET INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
A. Ownership Board and Committees
3.01      Since the last Bank loan appraisal, the ownership structure of BDET
has remained substantially unchanged (Annex 3). The Tunisian public sector
held at the end of 1976 29.5% of BDET's capital and the Tunisian private
sector 28.2%, the remainder being divided between IFC (10%) and other foreign
1/   The range of rates for rediscountable medium-term loans financing resident
export-oriented enterprises and enterprises in the least developed regions
was also narrowed from 6.25-7.25% to 6.75-7%.



- 8 -
shareholders (32.3%). The decision to raise BDET's share capital from D 6
million to D 10 million (paragraph 6.11) might result in an increase of the
share of the public sector as some of the other shareholders might decide not
to exercise fully their subscription rights.
3.02      The composition of BDET's Board of Directors (Annex 4) reflects
BDET's ownership structure. The Board delegates to the Executive Committee
(composed of the Tunisian members of the Board) the authority to approve loans
and investments of up to D 300,000. The Management Committee (BDET manage-
ment and department heads), approves operations up to D 50,000. The Board
meets quarterly, the Executive Committee once or twice a month, and the
Management Committee as often as needed.
B. Management and Organization
3.03      The Bank's concern in late 1974 that the departure of BDET's manag-
ing director might excessively weaken the institution's top management has not
been confirmed by events. As agreed during negotiations for the sixth Bank
loan, BDET has taken measures to improve management effectiveness. BDET's
organization was radically restructured in 1976, in an effort to decentralize
the decision-making function at the middle management level. Six new depart-
ments replace the three previously existing ones (Annex 5). Four departments
are headed by young, capable and dynamic Tunisian professionals who have been
promoted from the ranks. Experience with the new organization over the last
fifteen months is definitely positive. Further improvements in procedures
especially as regards bookkeeping, follow-up and internal audit are now being
introduced on an experimental basis following the recommendations of a compre-
hensive organization study conducted for BDET by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and
Co. (PMM) and by Cabinet FINOR. The Bank is satisfied that PMM and FINOR's
recommendations will allow BDET to cope more effectively with the increasing
volume of business.
C. Statutes and Policies
3.04      Except for the authorization to increase BDET's capital from D 6.0
million to D 10.0 milion, BDET's statutes are unchanged since the last Bank
loan appraisal. BDET's Board adopted a few changes in BDET's Policy Statement
including: (a) an increase, from 25% to 30% of BDET's total financing, of the
limit to BDET's lending to public sector enterprises (which increasingly turn
to BDET as a lender of last resort); (b) an increase in the limit to BDET's
exposure to a single borrower, from 20% to 25% of BDET's equity; and (c) a new
definition of BDET's debt/equity limit, which is now seven times BDET's equity
(excluding subordinated government loans) compared to the previous limit of
five times equity plus subordinated government loans considered as quasi-
equity. The Bank concurred with these changes in view of BDET's improved per-
formance and strengthened financial situation (para 5.15).



- 9 -
3.05      In October 1975, BDET's Board approved a new amendment to BDET's
Policies Statement specifying that BDET's activities in the tourism sector
will remain of a secondary nature, and will not, in general, exceed one fourth
of BDET's financing (see para 4.04); with the Bank's approval (para 5.15)
BDET's management intends to submit shortly to its Board, for approval, an-
other amendment increasing from 7:1 to 8:1 the ceiling for BDET's debt-equity
ratio.  BDET and the Government have also sought Bank agreement to increase to
40% of BDET's total lending the limit on BDET's exposure to the public sector.
Prima facie, this request does not appear to be warranted (para 4.03).
D. Procedures
3.06      Project Appraisal.  BDET's appraisal work has further improved over
the past two years and overall BDET's appraisal reports are generally compre-
hensive and sound. Further improvement can be achieved in (i) market studies,
which should better assess competition; (ii) the assessment of a project's
employment creation; and (iii) the evaluation of physical and financial con-
tingencies. BDET has undertaken to strengthen its appraisal work in the above
mentioned areas.
3.07      Project Supervision.  Project supervision remains the weak link in
BDET's organization, and progress in this area has fallen short of the expecta-
tions expressed in the last appraisal report. While about 100 of BDET's cus-
tomers (currently numbering about 400) are deemed to be in need of close
supervision, only 25 customers were visited by the supervision staff in 1975
and 40 in 1976 with only a few of them in their start up period. The work of
the project supervision division is poorly coordinated with that of the opera-
tional units in charge of projects appraisal, promotion, equity participations
and loan collection. BDET's management is aware of this problem and has
agreed to submit to its Board and implement a comprehensive program of action
for the supervision division. This program provides for (i) strengthening of
the supervision division staff, which will be increased from 4 to 7 profes-
sionals, (ii) implementation of procedures and information flows which would
improve the supervision division's integration within BDET following PMM and
FINOR's recommendations (para 3.03); (iii) systematic planning of visits
to customers in their start up period or having failed to submit satisfactory
informations (para 5.05); (iv) strengthening of the quality of supervision
reports and (v) submission to BDET's Board in the first half of 1979 of a
synthetic report giving a feedback of supervision activities.
3.08      Promotion.  Over the last two years, BDET's promotional efforts have
shifted away from regional business solicitation, which was not deemed suffi-
ciently profitable, towards the identification of large innovative industrial
projects. BDET's promotional efforts have led to the implementation of three
large projects in 1976, costing D 4.8 million in total, of which D 2.7 million
financed by BDET: they are a velvet fabric manufacturing plant, a vegetable
fat plant, and a conveyor belts plants. Several other industrial projects in
different branches (including starch-glucose, chlorine, aluminum sections,



- 10 -
asbestos-cement pipes, luxury shoes for exports, car assembly, synthetic fibers
etc.), are now being studied by BDET, which is also actively looking for
potential Tunisian promoters and foreign technical or financial partners.
3.09      Procurement and Disbursement.  BDET's procurement and disbursement
procedures continue to be satisfactory. At the Bank's request, however, BDET
has undertaken that projects appraisal reports would include in the future a
more thorough coverage of procurement matters.
IV. BDET'S OPERATIONS
A. Characteristics
4.01      Annexes 6 and 7 contain a summary of BDET's operations over the last
five years. The sharp increase in operations in 1974 reflect the 1973-74 boom
in Tunisia's industrial sector, and contrast with a marked decline in applica-
tions and approvals in 1975. This decline resulted itself from the increased
competition from commercial banks (due to a change in banking regulations
extending from 5 to 7 years the maximum length of medium term credit) and
BDET's resource constraints made particularly acute by the protracted negotia-
tions of the sixth Bank loan, pending which other foreign lenders adopted a
wait-and-see attitude. Operations picked up again substantially in 1976 with
approvals amounting to D 30.3 million ($71.5 million equivalent) and commit-
ments amounting to D 21.6 million ($50.9 million equivalent).
4.02      The increase of BDET's approvals of new projects (75.5% in 1976
compared to 60.9% in 1975 and 39.3% in 1974) as opposed to expansion projects
can be explained by the fact that commercial banks' cheaper credit at terms
of up to 7 years is better suited to modernization and expansion projects
than BDET's loans. This also explains why the proportion of foreign currency
loans declined to 58.4% of total approvals in 1976 while that of dinar loans
increased to 31.5% and that of equity investments to 10.1% (Annex 6), since
new projects tend to involve higher local currency expenditures (mainly for
construction) and higher needs for equity funds than expansion and moderniza-
tion projects. Also it explains the longer maturity of BDET's loans: in
1976, over 50% of approved loans were for 10 years or more.
4.03      The proportion of BDET's new approvals in the public sector decreased
from 25.1% in 1974 to 14.3% in 1975 and 11.7% in 1976. In terms of commitments
however the share of the public sector was 21.0% in 1975 and 22.1% in 1976. In
view of BDET's past record, and of an analysis of BDET's pipeline of projects
under preparation, it appears unlikely that the present limit of 30% for BDET's
public sector commitments will constitute a significant constraint.
4.04      The bulk of BDET's operations is now concentrated in the manufac-
turing sector. BDET's portfolio of industrial loans and equity investments
is spread over a wide range of subsectors (Annex 7). It was agreed for the



- 11 -
sixth Bank loan that BDET would progressively reduce its excessive exposure
in the tourism sector, which was about 41% of portfolio at the end of 1974,
to 25% of total financing. This target was achieved by the end of 1976. For
the future, BDET believes that it continues to have an important, though
secondary, role to play in tourism, especially for co-financing projects
which are too large for a single institution to assume the entire risk.
BDET however foresees no need to exceed the agreed exposure limit of 25%.
This view is reflected in an amendment to BDET's Policy Statement recently
approved by BDET's Board.
4.05      Despite a substantial increase in the amounts approved, the number
of approvals declined from 141 in 1975 to 124 in 1976. The resulting increase
from D 158,600 to D 244,400 in the average size of BDET's operations reflects
increases in project costs as well as a lesser emphasis on smaller projects
especially those for expansion and modernization. In 1976, 84 projects involv-
ing BDET's financing of less than D 200,000 ac:counted for only 17.6% of the
total amounts approved, as compared to 114 projects accounting for 34.7% of
the total in 1975. Eight projects involved BDET's financing of D I million or
more in 1976, and accounted for 42.1% of the total amounts approved, as com-
pared to 3 projects accounting for 17.2% of the total in 1975.
4.06      There has been a slight decrease in the proportion of approved opera-
tions for projects located in the Tunis area. In 1976 this area accounted for
48.1% of the amounts approved compared to 50.1% in 1975. Most of the rest how-
ever went to urban centers on the relatively developed coastal strip. BDET
intends to launch a new promotion effort for its services outside of the Tunis
area, with particular emphasis on the less developed regions of the interior
(para. 6.02).
B. Economic Impact
4.07      Contribution to Investment and Share in Term Lending.  In the manu-
facturing sector, BDET's disbursements accounted for about 15% of total invest-
ment both in 1975 and 1976. BDET's share in total outstanding term lending to
the industrial sector (including construction) remained also remarkably stable
at about 30%. BDET has also maintained at approximately 22% its share in total
term lending to the tourism sector. In percentage of the total investment cost
of approved projects for all sectors, BDET's financial contribution reached a
high point of 47% in 1975, due to the unusual concentration of industrial proj-
ects in that year, and went back to 37% in 1976.
4.08      Employment Creation.  Employment generation associated with BDET's
financed projects decreased from the record level of about 12,000 in 1974 1/
to about 7,900 in 1975 and 6,500 in 1976 while the average investment cost
per job after decreasing from about D 8,100 in 1974 to D 6,000 in 1975 went
1/   These numbers are based on BDET's appraisal reports.



- 12 -
up again in 1976 to over D 12,500 ($29,500 equivalent). These figures are
influenced by the relative proportions of new vs. expansion projects, (and of
industrial vs. tourism projects). Investment cost per job for new projects
increased from about D 5,500 in 1974 to about D 9,000 in 1976 reflecting
increases in the cost of imported capital goods  and a certain decrease in the
relative importance of smaller projects (Annex 8). BDET's financing of small
projects with total costs of less than D 150,000 declined from 11.8% of total
in 1974 to 8.4% in 1975 and only 3.8% in 1976. Yet these projects consist-
ently involved on the average an investment cost per job of less than D 4,000.
BDET's financing of large projects with investment costs exceeding D 1 million
increased from 58.9% of the total in 1974 to 67.5% in 1976 while the average
cost per job of such projects increased in the same period from about D 6,900
to D 17,200. During the Fifth Plan period, BDET is committing itself through
a strategy statement approved recently by its Board (para 6.02) to a stronger
promotion of labor intensive projects, with particular emphasis being given
to projects with an investment cost per job not exceeding D 4,600 (US$10,670
equivalent) at 1976 prices.
4.09      Export-oriented Projects.  In 1976 exclusively export-oriented
projects accounted for only 4% of BDET's industrial sector financing. This
low percentage reflects both the difficulties encountered by Tunisian resident
enterprises (as opposed to non-resident enterprises benefiting from the mar-
keting experience of foreign parent companies) in penetrating foreign markets.
BDET strategy statement for the Fifth Plan Period (para 6.02) includes export-
oriented projects among its priorities for promotion and financing. Also, a
closer cooperation is expected between BDET and the Export Promotion Center
(CEPEX).
4.10      Promotion of Entrepreneurship.  While commercial banks are often
reluctant to finance projects whose sponsors do not have a past record as
enterpreneurs, 34 such projects (out a total of 124 approved by API) were
financed by BDET in 1976, accounting for D 3.9 million, i.e. 13% of BDET's
total approvals. Eleven more projects, accounting for D 623,000 were approved
in 1976 for expansion of SSEs with assets of less than D 150,000.
4.11      Financial and Economic Profitability.  A sample of projects approved
by BDET in 1976 and the early part of 1977 shows internal financial rate of
returns (FRR) ranging from 15 to 35% and averaging about 20%. Larger projects
submitted to BDET's Board and for which the internal economic rate of return
(ERR) has also been computed showed in most cases an ERR generally higher than
20%, which is satisfactory, even after taking into account BDET's occasionally
optimistic assumptions.
4.12      Contribution to the Development of Tunisia's Capital Market.  In
1976 BDET subscribed about D 2.4 million in new equity participations, i.e.
11% of total 1976 commitments. BDET's portfolio management for individual and
corporate clients increased from D 3.5 million at the end of 1974 to D 7.8
million at the end of 1976. On the other hand BDET is encountering difficul-
ties in selling shares from its own portfolio. Sales of shares declined from
D 318,400 in 1974 to D 250,000 in 1975 and D 152,000 in 1976. At the same
time BDET's total interventions in the Tunisian stock exchange declined from



- 13 -
D 944,000 in 1974 to D 688,000 in 1975 and D 385,000 in 1976. Although part
of this decline reflects a reduction in the overall activity of the Tunis
stock exchange, BDET's share in total trading declined from 4.7% in 1974 to
3.7% in 1977. BDET's role in this area should be reviewed in light of the
conclusions of'the recent report prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on the
Tunisian Financial Market (para 2.17). During negotiations, an informal
understanding was reached that BDET would submit to its Board and to the
Bank before the end of 1978 a plan of action to strengthen its contribution
to the development of the Tunisia's Capital Market.
V. BDET'S FINANCIAL SITUATION
A. Resource Position
5.01      BDET's resource position as of December 31, 1976, is described in
Annex 9 which also provides details on the status and conditions of domestic
and foreign long-term borrowings. The evolution of the total resources avail-
able to BDET -- on a commitment basis -- over the last two years may be sum-
marized as follows:
December 31, 1974            December 31, 1976
Amounts in                    Amounts
thousand dinars        %       thousand dinars      %
Equity                        6,710            15.2           8,688         10.4
Subscribed but unpaid
capital                    1,500 /1           3.4              -            -
Long term domestic
borrowings              4,807             10.9          16,151         19.5
Long term foreign
borrowings             31,170             70.5          58,192         70.1
of which IBRD           (16,547)           (37.4)        (20,099)       (24.9)
44,187           100.0          83,031        100.0
A    BDET's share capital increase of 1974 from D 3 million to D 6 million was
paid-in in two equal tranches, the first in 1974 and the second in 1975.
BDET has been quite successful in borrowing new domestic and foreign long-term
resources, permitting a decline of the share of Bank funds. BDET's equity is
due to increase over the 1978-80 period when share capital will be raised from
D 6 million to D 10 million. BDET secured in 1977 a new DM 10 million loan
from KfW (D 1.6 million equivalent), a KD 7 million line (D 10.3 million
equivalent) from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and a
sixth line of credit of D 2.5 million equivalent from the French Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique.



- 14 -
5.02      In accordance with understandings reached during the negotiations
for the sixth Bank line of credit, BDET obtained from the Government a D 4
million subordinated loan, which is to be partly converted into equity to the
extent BDET's existing shareholders do not exercise their subscription rights
(para. 5.15). BDET may avail itself of the still unused D 2.5 million Central
Bank rediscount facility. Other resources obtained by BDET on the Tunisian
market include several 10-year bond loans issued from 1973 to 1975 and placed
with the commercial banks (at 5.5%) and with the public (at 5.75%, or 7% in
the case of subscribers not qualifying for tax exemption). More recently,
however, the thinness of the Tunisian capital market, and the competition of
Government securities have made it increasingly difficult for BDET to issue
bonds aimed at the Tunisian public. A D 1.0 million issue of March 1977
met only very limited success and had to be closed at a level of D 100,000.
BDET hopes to obtain more success with future domestic bond issues, once the
proposed measures to revitalize the Tunisian capital market are implemented
by the Government (para 2.17) and, especially, if the Ministry of Finance,
following the general increase in commercial banks' interest rates decided by
the Central Bank in September, 1977 (para 2.16) permits, as expected, that
higher interest rates be offered also on bond issues.
5.03      In 1976 BDET issued a bond loan of 7 million Kuwaiti dinars (D 10.3
million) on the international financial market. The loan was guaranteed by
the Tunisian Government and underwritten by Kuwait Investment Company (KIC).
This operation is the first of its kind undertaken by a Tunisian financial
institution and illustrates BDET's determination to gain access to the inter-
national capital market. Full repayment of the principal of this loan is
expected in 1979 and 1980 but there is a distinct possibility to revolve the
loan. Unfortunately the high cost of this issue (8.5%) would leave BDET with
a narrow spread on its long-term loans and would have already caused losses of
D 76,000 on short-term placement of that portion of the loan which could not
be immediately onlent at long-term. On the basis of an ad-hoc agreement, the
Government compensated BDET in 1976 for this loss, and informally agreed to
ensure, with a special subsidy, that the servicing of this loan would not cost
BDET more than 6% p.a.
B. Auditors' Reports on BDET
5.04      The audit reports on BDET's 1975 and 1976 accounts were jointly
prepared by the Tunisian firm Cabinet Finor, and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and
Company (PMM). The increasingly important role played by Finor illustrates
the development of the local auditing profession 1/, an objective supported
by the Government and the Bank.
1/   Large companies seeking rediscounted medium term loans, and major public
sector enterprises are now frequently required by the Central Bank to be
audited by an independent Tunisian firm. This has encouraged the estab-
lishment of numerous auditing firms in Tunisia which are rapidly gaining
experience. Tunisian firms are no longer discouraged by the authorities
from seeking an association with foreign auditing firms of international
standing, as in the case of Finor and PMM.



- 15 -
5.05      The audit reports on BDET's 1975 and 1976 accounts were ready on
schedule and were made available to Board members in accordance with under-
standings reached during the negotiations for the sixth Bank loan. The main
results of the audit reports for 1974, 1975 and 1976 are summarized in Annex
10. The 1976 audit gave an unqualified opinion on BDET's accounts with only
two reservations. The first reservation is basically related to inadequate
reporting on 50 of BDET's clients, accounting for 3.2% of portfolio at end-
1976, a situation which should considerably improve once BDET's supervision
activities are strengthened (para 3.08).
5.06      The second reservation concerns a loan of D 877,500 to an hotel com-
pany which has been in deficit since 1975. BDET is taking steps to force the
hotel owners to redress the situation by changing management arrangements.
BDET confirmed during negotiations that all necessary measures will be taken
to ensure full recovery of this loan.
C. Quality of BDET's Portfolio
5.07      BDET's portfolio at the end of 1976 amounted to D 61.4 million
($144.8 million equivalent). Annex 11 divides BDET's portfolio at December 31,
1976, into medium-term loans (4.0%), long term loans (85.3%) and equity invest-
ments (10.7%) and provides a picture of the portfolio's sectoral breakdown.
From the point of view of risk, BDET's portfolio is now well diversified.
5.08      Loans in Arrears.  A detailed comparative analysis of BDET's loans
in arrears of over three months is given in Annex 12. The arrears situation,
particularly in the tourism sector, has dramatically improved since the time
of the last appraisal, following a strong resurgence of tourism in 1975 and
1976, and assertive action on the part of BDET in collecting loans in arrears.
At the end of 1976, the portion of the tourism sector loan portfolio affected
by arrears of over three months had decreased to 17.1%, compared to 41.1% at
the end of 1974. In the industrial sector, the corresponding portion has also
gone down from 7.4% at the end of 1974 to 4.7% at the end of 1976. Total
arrears of over three months in principal and interest represented 1.7% of
total loan portfolio at end 1976 compared to 3.7% at end 1974 and 2.4% at end
1975.
5.09      Loan Reschedulings.  Loans reschedulings have increased from 1974 to
1976 as follows:
1974      1975       1976
Number of loans rescheduled                               33         35         41
Amounts involved - in thousand dinars                  3,451      6,237     9,765
- in percentage of total loan
portfolio at year end               11.0%     14.3%      17.8%
Estimated potential arrears of over 3 months
as % of loan portfolio, if no loans had been
rescheduled                                              4.0%      3.3%       2.6%



- 16 -
Most reschedulings consist of shifting forward the loans' amortization sched-
ules by one year or less. The increase in the percentage of the loan port-
folio being rescheduled is largely due to delays in the completion of projects
approved in the 1974 industrial investment boom. However, BDET should be more
cautious in its projections of client's financial needs, and grant, when appro-
priate, longer grace periods. BDET's Supervision Division should follow up
closely the performance of clients having obtained reschedulings. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that, should reschedulings affect in any year
more than 15% of BDET's loan portfolio, a special report on reschedulings
would be submitted to BDET's Board.
5.10      Loan Security.  BDET's loans to industrial customers are backed by
chattel mortgages which are generally valid and sufficient to cover risks.
Only seven industrial sector loans are to companies in difficulty against
which BDET has collateral of an uncertain value (Annex 13). The taking of
mortgage securities on many hotel loans, which was a major issue during
negotiations for the sixth Bank loan, has been making substantial progress.
Further energetic action will still be needed on the part of BDET. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that, in the future, BDET's hotel loan con-
tracts should include a timetable for the mortgage validation process.
5.11      Equity Portfolio.  BDET's equity portfolio, estimated at acquisi-
tion cost, increased from D 3.9 million at the end of 1974 to D 6.6 million at
end of 1976, while its book value went from D 4.5 million to D 7.4 million
and its estimated market value from D 5.0 million to D 7.2 million. The snare
of tourism investments has declined from 35.6% to 30.4% of total. Except for
a hotel management company jointly owned by BDET and COFIT, BDET does not own
more than 40% of the capital of any company, and half of its participations
are in the range of 10% to 20% of total shares. Cash dividends on 1975
operations were declared in 1976 by 22 of the 78 companies in which BDET held
shares and amounted to D 120,877 (compared to D 100,506 in 1975) producing an
average yield to BDET of 2.5% on equity investments, (compared to 5.4% in
1973, 3.9% in 1974 and 2.6% in 1975). The decrease in the yield is largely
due to the increasing proportion of new companies in which BDET holds shares.
5.12      Capital gains on BDET's equity portfolio have declined from D 154,700
in 1974 to D 73,600 in 1976, as a consequence of a decrease in the volume of
sales (para 4.12). For 1977 BDET plans to sell about D 150,000 worth of
shares, a substantial increase compared to 1976, but still only 2.3% of BDET's
equity portfolio. A more aggressive policy of portfolio management would con-
tribute to revitalizing the Tunisian capital market.
5.13      Provisions.  At the time of the last appraisal provisions were still
considered by the auditors and by the Bank as insufficient to cover BDET's
risk of losses. Since then, BDET has built up its provisions to a fully
satisfactory level, as recommended by the auditors (Annex 10).



- 17 -
D.  Financial Performance and Position
5.14      Profitability.  BDET's audited income statements and balance sheets
for the years 1972 to 1976 are shown in Annexes 14 and 15, and the relevant
performance indicators are presented in Annex 16. BDET's income almost
doubled from 1974 to 1976, reflecting basically the growth of BDET's loan port-
folio, which increased by 74%, as well as an increase in its average interest
rate from 8.u% in 1974 to 8.6% in 1976. Dividends and capital gains declined
from 7.8Z of average equity portfolio in 1974 to 3.4% in 1976 (see paragraphs
5.11-5.12 above). Expenses have also doubled from 1974 to 1976, the main
cause being interest expenses on term borrowings which increased by 140%.
Administrative expenses (including depreciation) decreased from 1.8% of total
assets in 1974 to 1.5% in 1976, which represents a good performance. Net
profits increased by 78%, yielding in 1976 a return on average net worth of
9.7%, compared to 8.5% in 1974 and 8.3% in 1975. In 1977, BDET was able to
raise its traditional 6% dividends distribution to 7%, which remains however
well below what most commercial banks in Tunisia pay (i.e., between 10% and
12% of par value). Earnings per average share outstanding in 1976 were
D 0.701.
5.15      Capital Structure.  According to the Loan Agreement for the sixth
Bank loan, BDET's debt/equity ratio was not to exceed 5:1. The Government
subordinated loan of D 4 million, however, was to be included in the equity
base on the assumption that most of it would be converted into shares in 1976
and 1977, to permit BDET's capital to increase from D 6 to D 10 million (para.
5.02). Given the lower-than-expected volume of business in 1975 BDET decided,
with the Bank's concurrence, to delay the capital increase until 1978-80.
About three-quarters of the capital increase appeared then likely to be sub-
scribed by existing shareholders other than the Government. The rationale for
including the Government subordinated loan in the equity base was thus no
longer there, and the agreed debt/equity ratio limitation was redefined accord-
ingly, and increased to 7:1. The ratio is expected to exceed 7:1 in 1977 and
to stabilize thereafter slightly below 8:1 as BDET's capital increase takes
place (para 6.11). BDET's improved financial situation, reflected in the
auditors' opinion on the 1975 and 1976 accounts warrants an increase from 7:1
to 8:1 in BDET's debt/equity ratio limit. Given BDET's increased provisions
against possible losses on loans and investments (para 5.13), the proposed 8:1
limit would adequately protect the risk of BDET's lenders, and would reflect
fairly the company's debt servicing capacity. The Bank agreed, therefore, to
the increase in the limit (para 3.05).
VI. BDET's PROJECTED OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL SITUATION
A. Projected Operations
6.01      BDET's assumptions and projected operations are given in Annexes
17 and 18. BDET expects to continue to supply manufacturing with about 30%



- 18 -
of all the term credit--domestic and foreign--foreseen in the Plan (D 482
million, including D 164 million for private enterprises). Private sector
industrial lending will continue to be the principal responsibility of BDET.
6.02      The sectoral orientation of BDET's projected industrial lending
reflects that of the Fifth Plan (1977-81), with the main emphasis on electro-
mechanical industries (especially light industry largely sponsored by private
sector investors) followed by the construction, and construction materials
industries (though this branch is likely to be largely developed by the public
sector), and by the textiles, chemical, food processing, and wood and paper
industries. The Plan assigns priority to labor intensive and to export
oriented industries, the development of new entrepreneurships, and places
great emphasis on the need to decentralize industry away from the coastal
urban areas in general and from Tunis in particular. BDET's Board approved
in October 1977 a strategy statement for the Fifth Plan Period declaring that
BDET will make all efforts to finance and promote priority projects having the
above described characteristics, specifically: -(a) labor intensive projects,
defined as projects with an investment cost per job not exceeding D 4,600 at
1976 prices 1/; (b) export-oriented projects (defined as those expecting to
export more than 20% of production) promoted by Tunisian sponsors; (c) decen-
tralized projects, especially those in the interior; (d) project sponsored by
new entrepreneurs (especially Tunisian workers returning from abroad) having
the required technical qualifications, and the intention to personally attend
to the management of the enterprise; and (e) small-scale industrial projects
(see Chapter VII).  On the basis of past experience, and of an analysis of
BDET's project pipeline, BDET is aiming at meeting the following objectives
during 1978-1979: at least 15% of BDET's new approvals should go to labor
intensive projects; 15% to projects of new entrepreneurs; and 50% to projects
outside Tunis. No quantitative target has been established for export-oriented
projects given the uncertainties of the international climate for Tunisian
exports. Understanding was reached during negotiations that the proceeds of
the Bank's loan would be essentially reserved for the financing of the priority
projects identified in the above mentioned strategy statement.
6.03      BDET's capacity to handle the projected volume of operations detailed
in Annex 18 has been demonstrated in the period 1974-76, when BDET's approvals
averaged D 30 million per year, and BDET's management and staff had to devote
much time and energies to strengthen BDET financial situation and internal
organization. Further improvements in the effectiveness of BDET's staff are
expected as the recently appointed middle level managers gain experience, and
as the company's procedures are further streamlined (para 3.03).
B. Resource Mobilization
6.04      In order to finance the program of operations detailed in Annex 18
BDET will have to raise, in the period 1977-1981, D 143 million of new finan-
cial resources (on a commitment basis). Of the resource requirements for
1/   This meets the Bank's Urban Poverty Program criteria, which set the
threshold for Tunisia at an investment cost of $10,690 (D 4,608) for
a 15-year job.



- 19 -
1978 and 1979, estimated at D 56.2 million, only D 21.2 million have been
identified (excluding the proposed Bank loan). These include, beside cash
generation and the partial payment of the capital increase, one new French
line of credit (partly at concessionary conditions), one new loan from Qatar,
one new loan from the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, and a
local bond issue. The resulting resource gap for 1978-79, of D 35 million,
could be covered in part by the proposed Bank loan (D 12.9 million) and in
part by domestic bond issues. The latter should become less difficult to
pLace (para 2.18 and 5.02) than in the recent past, but they can hardly be
expected to yield more than D 2 million in the next 2 years. As a conse-
quence, unless other unforeseen sources of concessionary financing become
available (a possibility not to be excluded, but on which BDET does not count)
BDET will have to borrow the equivalent of D 20 million ($46 million) in the
international capital market before the end of 1979.
6.05      BDET confirmed during negotiations that the Government has approved
its resource mobilization plan for the 1977-79 period which calls for a D 10
million borrowing in the international capital in late 1977/early 1978 and a
second borrowing for the same amount in late 1979. Preliminary contacts that
BDET has had with lenders in the Euro-currency market indicate that this
objective is realistic. To attain it, however, BDET may have to accept
floating interest rates, a risk which BDET has been so far reluctant to bear.
Initially, at least, the guarantee of the Government will be necessary to
contain the cost of new foreign borrowings in the open market.
6.06      The Government is not yet prepared to permit BDET to pass on the
foreign exchange risk to industrial borrowers, on grounds that the inconvert-
ibility of the dinar prevents residents from covering their foreign exchange
position, and that the tightening of credit conditions, begun with the recent
increase of the overall level of interest rates, must be carried out gradually.
As a consequence, the Government will continue to bear the foreign exchange
risk on BDET's foreign borrowings. This is one of the matters being discussed
in the framework of the on-going dialogue between the Tunisian authorities and
the Bank on national financial policies.
C. Financial Projections
6.07      BDET's Profitability and Interest Rates.  BDET's financial projec-
tions are presented in Annexes 18 through 22. Under current circumstances,
net profits as percent of average net worth would decline from a range of
8.3% to 9.7% in the period 1973-76 (Annex 16) to a mere 8% in 1977 and 1978.
This is largely due to the Government having imposed on BDET artificially low
lending rates of 8% in 1974 and 1975, and 9% (including a 1% Government sub-
sidy on loans to resident industrial borrowers) in 1976 and 1977, in the face
of the steadily increasing cost of BDET's borrowed resources, which rose from
5.4% in 1974 to 6% in 1976 and which is projected to reach 6.3% by 1978. Dur-
ing negotiations of the 6th Bank loan BDET and the Government had agreed to
suspend the effectiveness of the arrangement by which any difference between
the actually realized spread on BDET's operations and a minimum of 2.5% would



- 20 -
be debited to a Government account (interest equalization account). This was
intended to eliminate a form of automatic subsidization of BDET by the Govern-
ment. However, though the form of the negotiated agreements was adhered to,
the Government had to intervene, at end 1976, to supplement BDET's income
(para 5.03).
6.08      BDET will have to seek similar Government interventions in the next
few years given the restrictions that Government policies, and the competition
with commercial banks, impose on its ability to raise lending rates to a level
sufficient to ensure an adequate profitability. Agreement was reached with
BDET and the Government during negotiations on the principle that the interest
rate actually payable on long-term loans to BDET's clients should be higher by
at least one percentage point than that payable on commercial banks' medium-
term loans to industry. BDET confirmed that, following the elemination of the
1% Government rebate (para 2.18), the interest cost to be borne by industrial
borrowers on new BDET loans will increase from 8% to 9% as of January 1, 1978.
Taking into account that, unlike most Tunisian commercial banks, BDET charges
interest on its loans six months in advance (which amounts to a 0.4% increase
in the effective lending rates) and that its various commissions and fees
(other than commitment fees) are equivalent to an annual interest rate sur-
charge of about 0.25%, it appears that BDET's nominal rate of 9% on long-term
loans corresponds to effective cost of resources to its industrial borrowers
of about 9.65%, i.e. more than 1% above commercial banks medium-term rates for
rediscountable loans to industry, which are in the range of 8% to 8-1/4% (para
2.18). As long as commercial banks rates remain in this range, BDET feels it
cannot raise its nominal rate above 9% for industrial borrowers lest it jeopar-
dizes its competitive position. For new tourism loans (for which generally
BDET does not have to compete with the commercial banks given the longer
maturities required), however, BDET confirmed during negotiations its inten-
tion to raise its nominal interest rate from 9 to 9.5%, which would correspond
to an effective cost of funds of about 10.15%. This increase affecting only
up to 25% of BDET new loans will, however, be insufficient to ensure BDET an
adequate profitability, assuming that new resources will be borrowed domesti-
cally at a cost of no more than 7% p.a., and that the cost of foreign exchange
resources borrowed from 1978 onward will average 8%, and assuming further that
the Government will continue to contribute to the servicing of the Kuwaiti
dinar KIC bond loan issued in 1976 at 8.5% (para 5.03).
6.09      A form of Government intervention will thus continue to be neces-
sary to ensure BDET's financial equilibrium, at least as long as commercial
banks rates restrict BDET's ability to raise its lending rate to the level
required to ensure an adequate profitability. The Government however concurs
with the Bank that its contribution to BDET's profitability should be deter-
mined ex-ante, rather than ex-post, thus encouraging BDET to aim at maximizing
its operating spread rather than relying on a Government-guaranteed spread.
Understanding was reached during negotiations that the Government would
selectively subsidize the cost of BDET's foreign exchange borrowings obtained
at non-concessionary terms in such a way as to ensure a gross spread of 2.5-
3% on these resources.



- 21 -
6.10      On the basis of the assumptions made above, BDET's net profit as per-
cent of average net worth is expected to decline slightly (to 9.2%) in 1977
then rise again to 9.7% in 1978, 11.2% in 1979, and over 12% thereafter.
The expected improvement in BDET's profitability will be partly due to the
increasing efficiency of BDET's staff, as reflected in the relative decline
of administrative expenses from 1.5% of average total assets in 1976, to about
1% by 1981. Profits so projected should permit the company to remunerate out-
standing shares at 8% p.a. in 1977 through 19793 (compared to the traditional
6% dividends paid by BDET until 1975). Dividends should be increased to 10%
beginning in 1980, thus bringing the yield of BDET's share more in line with
that of other banks in Tunisia. At the same time BDET would be able to
continue to carry out the very prudent provisions policy it adopted in 1974,
while moderately building up its free reserves.
6.11      Share capital increase.  In order to maintain the debt equity ratio
below 8:1 (para 5.15) new shares would have to be subscribed early in 1978
and paid in in three tranches within 1980. M4ost foreign shareholders, have
already announced their intention to exercise their preemptive rights. IFC is
also considering exercising its rights. The Government will maintain its share
in BDET's ownership by converting into shares part of the D 4 million advance
made in 1975 and 1976. As agreed, a greater portion of the Government advance
may have to be converted into capital, with the Government acting as a sub-
scriber of last resort, in case preemptive rights not exercised by existing
shareholders (which may be the case with some of private Tunisian shareholders
to whom the short-term yield of BDET's share is not sufficiently attractive)
are not taken by other shareholders or by other new private sector subscribers.
Direct Government ownership of BDET's shares could thus double, in relative
terms, from 12% to 24%, bringing the total of BDET's shares held by public
sector institutions (including the Central Bank and various Government-owned
companies) to slightly more than 40% of capital. BDET would in any event
remain a majority privately owned institution.
VII. STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT,
OBJECTIVES AND FEATURES OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. Loan to BDET
7.01      The proposed loan to BDET will provide needed support for BDET's
operational strategy as explained in para 6.02. Firstly, the loan will help
BDET meet its foreign exchange resource requirements for the financing of
industrial projects especially in the private sector, in the framework of the
priorities set by the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1977-81). The earmarking of the
loan for priority projects is intended to encourage BDET to concentrate its
promotional activities towards areas where special efforts are necessary at
this stage of the country's economic development. It is expected that about
60% of the loan will finance projects located outside the Tunis area, thus
contributing to the industrial decentralization policy of the Government.



- 22 -
Probably 25% of the subprojects financed with the proposed Bank loan, will be
sponsored by new entrepreneurs. Assuming a favorable international climate
for Tunisian exports abroad, export-oriented projects sponsored by Tunisian
entrepreneurs are expected to represent at least 10% of projects financed
under the Loan. This will require special promotional efforts, because this
type of activity has been so far the almost exclusive monopoly of large
public-sector enterprises and of foreign investors. About one-third of the
proposed loan is expected to finance projects meeting the labor intensity
criterion of D 4,600 (at 1976 prices) invested per job created, which falls
well within the Bank's Urban Poverty Guidelines for Tunisia. Labor-intensive
projects alone would thus generate about 2000 new jobs, compared to the
1500-2000 jobs expected to be created by other projects financed with the
proceeds of the loan. The proposed loan to BDET will also include a $2
million tranche to be earmarked for the financing of expansions of existing
SSEs; furthermore, BDET is expected to take a leading role in implementing
the SSE component of the proposed Project (Section B of this Chapter).
7.02      The second objective of the proposed loan, is to help BDET establish
itself as a viable borrower in the international financial markets, thus becom-
ing less and less dependent on concessionary financial resources, and on World
Bank loans in particular. Continued Bank support will help consolidate BDET
standing on the international financial community. The Bank's share in BDET's
total borrowed resources is declining. On a balance sheet basis, at end-1976
it was 23% of total term borrowing of BDET, compared to 48% at end-1974; it is
projected to decline to 18% of borrowed resources by the end of 1979 and to
15% by 1981. As mentioned (para 6.05) BDET will submit to the Bank a resource
mobilization plan as part of agreements to be negotiated.
7.03      BDET will maintain its debt/equity ratio at or below 8:1.  In its
financing operations, BDET will continue to observe the following limitations
which are specified in BDET's Policy Statement: exposure to a single customer
should not exceed 25% of BDET's equity; financing of public sector enterprises
should remain less than 30% of total financing; tourism sector financing
should continue not to exceed 25% of total financing. The free limit for sub-
projects not subject to prior Bank approval will remain D 300,000 ($705,000).
7.04      The proceeds of the loan, other than the $2 million portion to be
earmarked in the Loan Agreement for SSE expansion projects, will be used for
financing (a) the full cost of directly imported equipment or services needed
for the implementation of eligible subprojects; and (b) 70% of the cost of
equipment previously imported in Tunisia, and purchased locally for the imple-
mentation of eligible subprojects. Taking into account that the loan will be
committed over a 2-year period, and given that the average term of BDET's long-
term loans is about 12 years, with a 2-year grace period, the loan should be
repaid in a period of 13 years, including a 4-year grace period, on a level
principal payments basis. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown
in Annex 26.



- 23 -
B. Small Scale Enterprise (SSE) Component
7.05      The main objective of the SSE component of the project is to coordi-
nate and strengthen on-going initiatives in the field of SSE development, by
providing financial resources through the commercial banks' branch networks,
with BDET participating in the effort, and administering Bank procedures for
subproject selection and disbursement of funds; and by fostering the creation,
in parallel, of a system of technical assistance for SSEs, centered around
API. It is expected that the experience of this pilot project will lead to
the identification of the most suitable channels for a possible future project
of the Bank fully devoted to SSE financing. The SSE component of the proposed
loan will consist of two sub-components: (i) $5 million to be lent to the gov-
ernment for the financing of newly created SSEs through the existing FOPRODI
mechanism (paragraph 2.09 above and Annex 24); and (ii) $2 million to be lent
to BDET to finance expansion projects of SSEs, which are not presently eligible
for FOPRODI assistance (FOPRODI being basically intended to encourage new
ventures). Both SSE sub-components will benefit from the technical assistance
scheme for SSEs to be set up by API (para 7.10).
7.06      The $5 million sub-component to be borrowed by the Government will
be channelled through a special account with the Central Bank of Tunisia and
drawn upon by the four commercial banks (Societe Tunisienne de Banque, Banque
Nationale de Tunisie, Union Internationale de Banques, and Banque du Sud,
which together cover the whole country through a wide network of branches)
currently administering POPRODI as well as by BDET which would become the
fifth bank participating in the scheme. The establishment of the special
account referred to above is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan. Bank funds will be used to finance a new FOPRODI credit facility that
will complement in the form of medium- and long-term loans the financing plan
of newly created SSEs which qualify for concessionary FOPRODI loans for the
constitution of their equity capital (see Annex 24). The eligibility criteria
for the Bank funds will be, however, slightly more restrictive than those
currently established for FOPRODI, in that: (i) total project cost including
working capital should not exceed D 200,000 ($460,000 equivalent) at 1976
prices, which is in line with the Bank's working definition of SSEs; (ii)
normally the investment cost per job created or maintained should not exceed
D 4,600 ($10,700 equivalent) at 1976 prices, which is in line with the Bank's
Urban Poverty Program criteria; and (iii) the promoter should be willing to
make use of the available technical assistance deemed necessary by API.
7.07      The operational arrangements for the $5 million SSE sub-component
will be the following:
(i) Promotion, identification, initial'screening and appraisal
of eligible SSE projects will be the responsibility of the
banks (four commercial banks and BDET) administering FOPRODI.
A summary appraisal report will be prepared for each SSE
project by the sponsoring bank under a simplified procedure,



- 24 -
and with the possible assistance of API.  The report will
spell out the project's total investment cost, including the
needs for working capital, and will propose a financing
plan detailing the respective contributions of (a) promoters
in the form of equity (at least 30%, part of which can be
financed out of the existing FOPRODI concessionary loan
facility), (b) the subloan to be made out of the Bank funds,
which should not exceed on the average 50% of total project
cost; and (c) the sponsoring bank in the form of a term loan
out of its own resources (which in consequence should be
about 20% of total project cost). The report will also
specify the number of jobs to be created and the forms of
technical assistance required by the SSE.
(ii)  Once the SSE project and its financing plan have been
approved by the supporting bank and API, the SSE appraisal
report will be sent to BDET which will (a) verify that
the project complies with the Bank eligibility criteria
(paragraph 7.06); (b) submit to the Bank on behalf of the
Government approval and disbursement applications; and (c)
maintain the necessary documentation, particularly as re-
gards disbursement, available for inspection by Bank super-
vision missions.
(iii)  The SSE's repayment obligation for the Bank funds will be
toward FOPRODI (i.e. the Government) but the responsibility
of loan collection will remain with the banks sponsoring
the project, which will share evenly with the Government the
risk of loss on both FOPRODI loans financed out of the Bank
funds and term loans made out of their own resources. For
their services, the participating banks will receive from
the Government commissions patterned after those they cur-
rently receive for the administration of the existing credit
facilities (flat percentage commission on disbursements of
FOPRODI funds and commission based on the amount of prin-
cipal and interest recovered on behalf of FOPRODI with an
increasing percentage depending on the recovery ratio; see
Annex 24).
These arrangements will be reflected in the FOPRODI agreements between the
Government and the participating banks. The same agreements will also
specify the banks' commitment to participate with their own resources --
generally with 20% of the projects' costs -- in the financing of FOPRODI
assisted projects. The amendment of the FOPRODI agreements to these effects,
as well as the signing of a similar agreement between the Government and
BDET, are a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
7.08      The second SSE sub-component, amounting to $2 million will be part
of the loan to BDET but will be earmarked to finance the expansion of exist-
ing SSEs with net fixed assets valued (before expansion and excluding land)
at less than D 100,000 ($235,000 equivalent) at 1976 prices. The conditions



- 25 -
of subloans and the eligibility criteria for such expansion projects will be
similar to those applying to subloans for newly created SSE projects, but the
repayment obligation of borrowing SSEs will be toward BDET with no risk-
sharing mechanism between BDET and the Government. In order to ensure that
SSE expansion projects will receive appropriate attention BDET will set up a
special unit staffed by two SSE specialists. The unit will be responsible for
the processing of these projects as well as for administering Bank funds of
thie $5 million SSE sub-component to be channelled through the FOPRODI scheme.
The establishment of this unit is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.
7.09      The terms of Bank-financed FOPRODI subloans for SSEs are expected
to be between 7 and 11 years, with grace periods between 2 and 3 years. Cor-
respondingly, the SSE component will be repayable to the Bank, by the Govern-
ment and BDET respectively, over a period of 13 years, including 4 years of
grace, on a level principal payment basis. Such a term is expected not to
create restrictions on the appropriate duration of subloans, while keeping
the possible roll-over of funds to no more than about 25% of the SSE compo-
uent.  The cost of funds to SSE borrowers will be the same as the cost charged
by commercial banks on medium-term loans to larger industrial enterprises,
currently in the range of 8 to 8-1/4% except f'or subloans financing invest-
ments in the less developed regions of the interior and industrial investments
of export-oriented enterprises, for which the rates will be between 6.75 and
7%.  The foreign exchange risk on the Bank funds will be assumed by the
government. Although Bank funds will be usable to finance one half of the
full investment cost of SSE projects, without distinguishing between foreign
and local currency expenditures, it is expected that on average this will
imply little, if any, local currency financing with Bank funds, as the foreign
exchange costs of SSE investments in Tunisia are estimated to vary between
one-third and two-thirds of total costs, averaging about 40% of total. The
estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex 26.
7.10      Techncial Assistance.  The establishment of a system to deliver
technical assistance to SSEs is one of the major objectives of the projezt.
The Government intends to entrust to API the responsibility of setting up
such a system, making use of API's existing network of 4 regional branches
(which is expected to expand to 8 branches in the near future). There will
be a central core of four SSE experts at API's headquarters, in Tunis, and a
small unit of two experts in each regional office. API's technical assistance
staff will receive the support of CNEI and of AFI, whose activities in the
field of SSE development will be coordinated by API. The scheme, which would
be initially staffed by 20 specialists, is conceived in view of the needs of
Tunisian SSEs in general. Initially, API's technical assistance staff would
concentrate on identifying SSE projects and assisting sponsors in preparing
their project, obtaining the financing, and properly implementing the proj-
ects. Later, the API-centered extension service will provide follow-up
assistance, especially in the areas of financial management, marketing and
improvement of productivity. API is expected to need initially specialized
expertise, estimated at 69 man-months, to establish the central core of four
SSE experts and train the experts in the regional offices. At least two and



- 26 -
at most four expatriates (depending on the availability of Tunisian experts
with the appropriate profile and SSE experience to fill two of the four posi-
tions envisaged) will be recruited by the Government.  Financing of the foreign
exchange cost of the expatriates is expected to come from bilateral and/or
multilateral aid agencies. However, it was agreed with the Government during
negotiations that, if firm commitment from these sources is not obtained by
July 1, 1978, a portion of the loan to the Government, amounting to $300,000,
would be earmarked to finance the foreign exchange cost of these experts.
Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the establishment of the tech-
nical assistance system and on the principle of periodic consultations between
the Bank and the Government to review the functioning of the system (Annex 25).
7.11      Benefits and Risks of the SSE Component.  It is expected that the
SSE component of the Project will finance between 50 and 60 new sub-projects
and between 20 and 30 expansions. About 2,300 new employments will be created,
at an average cost/job of $7,000, and half of the sub-projects are likely to
be located outside of the Tunis metropolitan area. In addition, the Project
will have an important institution building effect. Beside supporting API in
its efforts to set up a country-wide network of assistance to SSEs, it will
reinforce the FOPRODI scheme which could eventually be institutionalized
and 4ecome a suitable counterpart for the Bank in future larger operations
specifically oriented towards SSEs. Moreover, the efforts to be undertaken
by BDET in developing a specialization for SSEs will leave open an alternative
channel for further Bank assistance to SSEs in Tunisa. The relative lack of
experience, both in the Bank and in Tunisia, in assisting Tunisian SSEs en-
tails a moderate risk that the Project's targets will not be fully achieved.
The risk, however, is well worth taking, also because the proposed mechanism
will ensure that the Project's funds will be used for worthwhile projects,
even if no success were to be obtained by the Project in its institution
building objectives.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMM4ENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal issues affecting the loan to BDET:
(a) distinction between the traditional dfc portion of the
loan ($28 million), reserved for financing industrial
projects in the framework of the priorities estab-
lished by the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) (paras.
6.02 and 7.01), from the $2 million portion of the
loan to be earmarked for expansion of existing SSEs
(para. 7.08);
(b) strengthening of BDET's appraisal work (paras. 3.06;
and 3.09);
(c) strengthening of BDET's supervision work (para. 3.07);



- 27 -
(d) BDET's plan of action to strengthen its contribution to the
development of Tunisia's Capital Mlarket (para. 4.12);
(e) measures taken by BDET to ensure full recovery of a loan
to an hotel company (para. 5.06);
(f) BDET's submission to its Board of a special report on loan
reschedulings, should these affect in any fiscal year more
than 15% of its loan portfolio (para. 5.09);
(g)  inclusion in BDET's hotel loan contracts of a timetable for
the mortgage validation process (para. 5.10);
(h) BDET's maximum debt/equity ratio of 8:1 (paras. 3.05 and 5.15);
(i) BDET's resource mobilization plan (para. 6.05);
(j) BDET's long-term lending rates for industrial and tourism proj-
ects (para. 6.08); and
(k) Government's contribution to BDET's profitability in the form
of subsidies towards the cost of selected BDET's foreign
exchange borrowings obtained at non-concessionary terms (para.
6.09).
8.02      Agreement was also reached on the following principal issues
affecting the SSE component:
(a) SSE eligibility criteria (para. 7.06);
(b) operational arrangements, including BDET's role of
intermediary between the Bank, the Government and the
commercial banks participating in the FOPRODI scheme,
risk-sharing between the commercial banks and the Govern-
ment, and the remuneration of commercial banks (para. 7.07);
(c)  onlending rates for the SSE component (para. 7.09); and
(d)  design, staffing, financing and timetable of establishment
of the system of technical assistance to SSEs (para. 7.10).
8.03      Subject to the conditions of effectiveness described in paras 7.06,
7.07 and 7.08, which apply to both loans, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$30 million to BDET on the terms outlined in paragraph 7.04 and for
a Bank loan of US$5 million to the Government for onlending to SSEs through
the FOPRODI's scheme on the terms outlined in paragraph 7.09.

THE SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES (SSE) SECTOR IN TUNISIA
I. CHARACTERISTICS
Size Distribution
1.01      There is no official definition of SSE in Tunisia.  For administra-
tive conveniences demarcations have been adopted by the Institut National de
la Statistique (INS), which publishes annual industrial censuses excluding
all enterprises with less than 5 employees or activities considered handi-
crafts; and by the Ministry of the Economy (handicrafts - less than 10 em-
ployees; small enterprises - between 10 and 50 employees; medium enterprises
between 50 and 300 employees; large enterprises - over 300 employees). For
the purpose of this project, SSEs are defined as those employing less than
50 employees and having fixed investments of less than D 150,000 (US$350,000).
Statistical information, as noted above, refers only to the "5 and over" size
of firms and imposes a restriction on the detailed characterization of the
sector. According to the 1973 industrial census, SSE in Tunisia accounted
for 21.4% of formal industrial employments, for 77% of industrial establish-
ments and for only 15% of the manufacturing sales. In 1976, INS started a
complete inventory of all non-agricultural enterprises in the major cities.
The survey identified in Sousse, Sfax and Gabes alone 5,023 manufacturing
firms with 1 to 10 employees (see Table 1). Such figure must be compared
with the census figure of 281 firms for the entire country (see Table 2) to
show the extent of the under coverage of SSE activities. Moreover data on
employment for the Sousse province alone show 3,018 people employed in the
sub-group in 1976, while the census shows a total of 2,492 for the country
as a whole. Based on the above preliminary surveys, on data provided by
entrepreneurial associations (UTICA), and on preliminary countings by the
Office of the Employment, the mission estimated the number of non-agricultural
enterprises of all sizes to be close to 80,000 of which 18,000 are in manufac-
turing or manufacturing-related activities (mechanical repairs, food preparing,
etc.).
Sectoral Distribution
1.02      The sectoral characteristics of manufacturing firms are shown in
Table 3 and the sectoral distribution by size of enterprises in Table 4.
Small scale firms are predominantly oriented towards production of household
goods for local (as opposed to national) markets. Three groups accounted in
1973 for more than 63% of production: food and beverages (36%), metal
products (15%) and textiles (12%). Small firms were also important in furni-
ture and building materials, i.e., subsectors in which SSEs have a comparative
advantage of labor costs and location for the requirements of local (as opposed
to national) markets. Information is not available regarding the total amount
of fixed investment in SSE. However, data for yearly investment in existing
firms, between 1969-74, show a decline in the share of SSE investment over
total investment in manufacturing.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
Regional Distribution
1.03      Regional distribution of industry, in 1973, is shown in Table 5.  The
Province of Tunis alone has more than 50% of the establishments and 53% of the
employment. The next area of concentration, Sfax, has only 14% of firms and
a meager 8% of the employment. The concentration is even greater in some
branches of industry like metal manufacturing, glass, garments, printing and
some food products. In these branches nearly 80% of the firms are located in
Tunis. A few regional concentrations can be found in Sfax (mechanical prod-
ucts, chemicals), in Monastir (textiles), Kairouan (carpet making) and Nabeul
(ceramics and food processing), which could be the base of a regional special-
ization and might favor regional vertical integration with larger industries.
Employment
1.04      The evolution of the employment structure in the formal sector
between 1969 and 1973 is shown in Table 1. According to the census about
15,000 persons or 20% of total manufacturing employment work in firms with
less than 50 employees. More recent estimates of employment including the
"informal" sector are shown in Table 6. It is estimated that about 120,000
persons work in the "informal" manufacturing sector, of which over 80,000 in
handicrafts. The Office of Handicrafts (Office National de l'Artisanat - ONA)
estimates at 35,000 the number of independent carpet weavers, while another
8,000 are employed in the medium size carpet production centers of ONA. Other
artisans working in leather, wood products, furniture and miscellaneous ar-
tistic and utilitary handicrafts add up to 37,000 people. The information
about productivity, on small firms of the formal sector, for 1969-74, shows
that while the number of employees in firms with less than 50 people remained
at about 20% of total manufacturing employment, turnover (as an approximation
for industrial output) declined from 19 to 15%. This data suggests a relative
decline of productivity in smaller firms during the period of accelerated
industrialization.
II. SMALL INDUSTRY CONSTRAINTS AND PROBLEMS
2.01      In the absence of a structured base of information about SSEs, the
comments that follow are based on limited surveys carried out by official
institutions, and on the observations of the pre-appraisal and appraisal
missions to a number of small scale firms.
Ownership
2.02      The predominant form of ownership in small firms is the single
proprietorship. The typical owner is a self made man who started as an
apprentice or as a merchant in the souks and learned the trade on the job.
Few small-scale businessmen have any formal education beyond the primary
level, although many have gone through specialized training courses in their



AliNEX 2
Page 3
trade. They might be termed craftsman-entrepreneurs rather than industrial-
ists. The mission was favorably impressed with the quality of entrepreneur-
ship in many SSEs. Owners appeared resourceful and hardworking. They often
display considerable ingenuity in the development of machines or in recondi-
tioning old equipment. In other respects (relations with employees, accounting
practices) they are reluctant to accept innovations and change. A special
group among SSE owners are those who have picked up new skills abroad as
migrant workers. These are among the most ambitious and open-minded small
entrepreneurs.
Production and Layout
2.03      Workshops of SSEs in Tunisia display the universal traits of the
informal sector: poor lay-out, lighting and ventilation of the shop; lack
of organization in the production process; young apprentices and adult workers
alike working unusually long hours, often in unsafe conditions. At the other
extreme, some of the small firms with dynamic growth potential which have
moved into the new industrial zones show a tendency to overbuild their plants.
Designs have been carried out with limited help of industrial specialists and
the results, in many cases, are relatively expensive buildings with serious
problems of layout.
Investment
2.04      Data on fixed assets of industry are not available.  Even the recent
surveys in Sousse and Sfax neglect information about capital stock. Indus-
trial censuses contain only yearly investment by existing establishments. An
indication of the trends in modern small industries can be obtained from the
81 projects, with total cost of D 200,000 or under, financed by FOPRODI for
the period December 1975 - May 1977.

ANNEX 2

Investment and employment intensity fluctuates according to the type of small
industries (see Table 7). It appears, however, that in the type of industry
qualifying for FOPRODI, cost/job is below D 5,000 and is often around D 3,000.
It is interesting to note that for the type of projects in the sample cost/job
tended to decrease when the size of the project increased.
Technology
2.05      In Tunisian SSEs technology varies greatly even within the same
industry. In the textiles sector SSEs in Tunis, all looms are powered,
whereas many of the SEE looms in relatively remote areas are manually operated.
Technology may be very modern, such as adjustable wrenches, cutters and presses
brought back by Tunisian workers abroad for their metal workshops. Relatively
high machine power among small production units may reflect several factors.
First, SSEs often acquire old, inefficient machines as opposed to modern
machines utilized in large industries. 1/ Secondly, the small industrialist,
basically a skilled worker and a self-taught man, may choose machines from
various accessible sources without sophisticated selection procedures. 2/ He
may also develop a taste for owning more and more machines, some of which may
not be of immediate use. In the end, he finds himself with equipment clearly
excessive to his needs. This situation was observed in several metal working
units.
2.06      Many small industry owners, on the other hand, are capable of
"copying" and sometimes adapting an original design of equipment.  In Tunis,
an improved version of a standard lathe (for wood cutting purposes) was
found to be built by largely self-taught local technicians. This is only
one example of Tunisian engineering skills in SSEs. It could be useful to
undertake a survey of existing technologies and skilled labor in Tunisian
SSEs, so that the resulting picture of appropriate technologies for SSEs can
be referred to by the extension service to be created by API. In the mean-
while it is the mission's impression that for most SSEs improvement of exist-
ing machines, more rational workshop layout and appropriate selection of
equipment would probably make a greater contribution to the increase of pro-
ductivity than the introduction of new technologies.
Procurement
2.07      The most commonly mentioned constraint for growth was the diffi-
culty in getting supplies (materials rather than equipment). Most of the raw
materials utilized by SSEs are purchased through intermediaries with easier
1/   In this context, it is interesting to note that SSEs use relatively
few directly imported machines. Many imported machines are bought
through dealers, including second hand machinery. Only the largest
SSEs obtain technical advice from foreign suppliers of machinery.
2/   This often creates maintenance problems.  Maintenance and repair of
very diversified machinery is difficult to arrange satisfactorily.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
access to import licenses and sometimes on the parallel market when the items
are scarce. At present, such items include cement, linings and some imported
fabrics, stainless and special steel, etc. Although small firms are allocated
annual quotas of imported materials corresponding to their "normal" require-
ments, delays occur at various stages (time to obtain import licenses, delays
at ports, losses in transit, difficulty in finding exact specifications for
required items). This results in time losses, under-utilization of capacity
overpricing of raw materials. A satisfactory solution to this problem might
follow from the measures being taken by the Government to gradually liberalize
trade for major materials.
Marketing
2.08      SSE's in Tunisia seem to have more problems in access to production
factors (see above), than in market access. Most marketing is done through
wholesalers and other "middlemen" (particularly in textiles). Construction
materials producers often sell directly to builders. Very few workshop owners
met by the mission had their own marketing outlet, like a store in town for
themselves. 1/ Subcontracting relationships are of limited scope. Thus, in
the SSE engineering subsector, "ancillary" production for large industries is
only a supplementary activity. Outside the metal products and engineering
industries, subcontracting frequently takes the form of commission work. In
view of the relative importance of Tunisian public sector participation in
production and services it is surprising that there are no structured channels
for government purchases from small producers. In addition, very few small
manufacturers have succeeded in securing import orders. The Government could
have an important role to play in three areas of marketing: promotion of sub-
contracting, organizing Government purchases, and setting-up or promoting the
creation of trading companies.
Management
2.09      A world-wide characteristic of small scale enterprises is the con-
centration of managerial, production and marketing functions in one or two
persons. The typical small entrepreneur, however, has a restricted notion
of plant layout and is generally unfamiliar with basic accounting methods,
inventory planning and other management techniques. It is only natural, for
him, to concentrate on the production side and pay scant attention to the
rest. Of 2217 firms of all types surveyed in Sousse by INS less than 20% keep
any sort of accounting. The percentage raises to 26% if only manufacturing
firms are considered and 31% in the case of mechanical shops. Two-thirds of
the mechanical shops which keep accounts rely on outside accountants to do
the job. The critical point in the development of an industrial establishment
is reached when it becomes essential to delegate managerial functions; many
entrepreneurs are incapable to take this step and are condemned to stagnation.
1/   One exception was a hydraulic pumps producer in Tunis with a store
in the center of Tunis of his own.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
Others move slowly but consistently towards specialization and growth. Man-
agement is probably the area in which a technical assistance service is most
urgently needed.
Finance
2.10      Lack of access to institutional finance, particularly from SSEs
occupying the lower end of the size range, is an important constraint to SSE
development. It is hard to ascertain the true dimensions of the problem, in
view of the reluctance of many SSEs to disclose their detailed financial posi-
tion and of the limited experience of commercial banks in dealing with small
entrepreneurs. Expansions of plants are usually financed by borrowing from
relatives or by plough-back of profits. 1/  Those firms which reported finan-
cial constraint, emphasized inadequate financing of working capital.  The
combination of uncertain raw materials supplies (para 2.07) and lack of
working capital puts small entrepreneurs at the mercy of seasonal market
fluctuations (very important in handicrafts, food processing and garments).
Interviewed entrepreneurs considered the ready availability of funds more
important than the rate of interest at which those funds were made available.
Owners of small workshops run into even more problems when they grow and
become industrialists. Their larger requirements in terms of amount and
duration of credits are not likely to find adequate support from the commer-
cial banks which are not geared to accommodate small industrial customers
without suitable collateral. This is one reason why FOPRODI has been set
up and, despite initial shortcomings due to procedural delays, is becoming
rapidly known among small industrialists as an interesting source of project
financing.
Potential for Development of SSEs
2.11      The overall low productivity of SSEs does not mean that most of
them are lacking in economic viability or development potential. A large
number of small firms is successful in satisfying local needs for reasons
of transport economies (e.g. bricks, tiles, etc.) or for speed, convenience,
and service (auto and agricultural equipment repairs, printing establishments,
etc.). The main asset of SSEs is clearly the great natural skill, determina-
tion, and specialized experience of the people working in the small shop.
Many small scale industries are regionally concentrated like weaving in Ksar
Hellal, carpet making in Kairouan, metal fabricating and engineering in Tunis,
Sousse and Sfax, providing a good opportunity for vertical integration with
large, modern industry. Though this will often necessitate a leap forward
in technology and markets, the example of several industrialized countries
shows that the transition can be made with appropriate support from the
government through various forms of assistance.
1/   Several industrialists mentioned a 20% net profit on fixed assets as
the normal rate of return envisaged for undertaking a new venture.
An indication of good profitability may also be the fact, confirmed
by banks, that those small industrialists who get loans repay always
on time.



ANNEX 2

III. ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK
3.01      Dispersed institutional responsibiliLy toward SSIs and a system of
incentives oriented towards large scale modern enterprises were until very
recently the characteristics of the framework of development for SSEs in
Tunisia. The Fifth Plan dedicates increasing attention and support to the
sector, and the structuring of an integrated program of assistance to SSEs
appears to be in the making. The situation described below is that prevail-
ing until 1976.
Incentives
3.02      Government policies and incentives have favored large scale public
enterprises and, more recently, modern medium-size privately owned enterprises.
Capital intensive subsectors, where small industry is less competitive, have
been encouraged and far less support has been lent to labor-intensive exports,
e.g. metal manufacturing and engineering products, plastic products, and
footwear. 1/ In these industries, the bias in favor of import prot~c:tion
(over export support) helps SSEs by conserving traditional structures and
reducing competition in price, quality, marketing and new technology. It
also postpones the inevitable and desirable transition towards modern, lynamic
enterprise - integrated with the export sector or with new competitive h -e
market industries as suppliers, subcontractors and ancillary industries. 3SE
access to incentives is constrained by criteria of eligibility for investment
benefits.  Incentives to industrial investments have been established by the
Investment Code which was first issued in 1969 and revised in 1974. Such
incentives include a 5-years reduction in income tax; duty free import of
equipment; and the right guaranteed to non-resident investors to re-export
both their capital and profits. Incentives are linked to criteria such
as employment size, value of exports and location.
3.03      The Tunisian authorities recognize that SSEs do not fit into the
standard incentive scheme. One preliminary condition to benefit from incen-
tives is to set up a firm creating at least 10 new permanent jobs, which
eliminates the bulk of small workshops. Another condition is that 30% of
investment must be financed from the investor's own resources, which is not
always easy for a small scale industrialist. In addition income tax exemption
increases with employment and irrespective of investment as shown below:
1/   One important exception is knitwear and clothing where exports have
developed rapidly.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
Income Tax Exemption
Category       Number of New Permanent Jobs           Rate of Exemption
A                      10 -  20                           40
B                      21 -  50                           60
C                      51 - 100                           70
D                     101 - 150                           80
E                     151 and above                       90
The concept is thus to give consideration to employment creation but the
smallest firms are excluded and firms employing 10 to 50 people receive less
concessions than larger firms. In other words, tax exemption is not related
to investment per added working place and the choice of technology is not
to be influenced.
3.04      Location of plants outside Tunis is encouraged through one extra
year of tax exemption, grants for infrastructure work and subsidies on the
interest rate for specific risk capital loans, to complement the owner's
equity. Encouragements toward decentralization apply, in theory, to small
and medium firms 1/, but the smallest firms with up to 9 working places are
again excluded. The law of April 1972 provides special incentives for export
oriented enterprises such as total or partial tax exemption for up to twenty
years; exemption from customs duties for imported equipment and intermediate
goods; exemption from turnover taxes on purchases from domestic sources; and
the right granted to non-resident investors to dispose of the proceeds of
their exports. These concessions promote foreign enterprises without however
encouraging local subcontracting. Local linkages which could promote small
enterprises are excluded.
3.05      In the procurement of supplies by government agencies, a 20% higher
price is allowed for local supply. However, each concerned agency is free to
make use of this opportunity or not. There are no indications of specific
efforts by purchasing agencies to support the establishment of small local
suppliers. The same applies to the 80 or so public enterprises, the 15
offices (cereals, coffee, tourism, transport, commerce, etc., of which
several have some industrial or commercial functions in addition to their
regulatory duties) and the statutory public or private monopolies. Nothing
seems to have been done to promote supplies from small firms.
3.06      While it can be argued that small workshops can generally evade tax
payments more easily than large firms, such evasion is partially due to their
inability to maintain a good accounting system and is often an encouragement
1/   These benefits are mentioned both in Law 74-74 of 1974 applying to all
industries and in Law 73-83 of 1973 creating FOPRODI. In practice
they have not been implemented yet.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
against implementing such a system. The only real tax incentive for SSEs in
Tunisia is the exemption of registration tax (taxe a l'enregistrement), and
some thought is now being given by Government authorities to the possibility
of reducing income tax rates for SSEs. In addition, SSEs may in the future
receive support through industrial estates facilities.
Institutional Support
3.07      Responsibility for implementation of various administrative regula-
tions and policies affecting SSEs lies within several different government
agencies (e.g. Directorate of Industries, Ministry of the Economy; A.P.I.;
Office de l'Emploi, Ministry of Social Affairs; Ministry of Finance; etc.).
Lack of communication and unified criteria among them has hampered the
development of consistent regulations and integrated programs in support of
SSEs, in spite of their common needs and problems. At present there are no
specific technical advisory services for small manufacturers 1/. A few in-
stitutions providing some free or subsidized services are catering to large
and medium undertakings in areas of project identification and preparation
(A.P.I., C.N.E.I.) and training (Office de l'Emploi). The inadequacy of the
existing information concerning SSEs aggravate the communication gap and the
lack of coordination among agencies.
3.08      As part of a new Government approach towards SSEs, and partly as
a result of discussion with Bank missions during the preparation of this
project, some remedial proposals have been advanced by the Government that
could have great impact in the SSE sector. Of particular relevance are the
creation of a SSE policy making Unit in the Ministry of Economy, and the
decision to set up a country-wide system of technical assistance to Small-
Scale Industries. The latter will use A.P.I. and its network of branches and
will combine efforts with A.F.I. and C.N.E.I. In addition, the Employment
Office has recently established a SSE Unit to coordinate its assistance and
vocational training in view of the specific needs of small entrepreneurs. The
present activities of A.P.I., the Employment Office, A.F.I. and C.N.E.I. in
relation to the industrial sector are described in Annex 23.

1/ The 1976 audit did not make a distinction within enterprises in their
start-up period between those encountering technical or financial
difficulties and those encountering no such difficulty. For 1976,
all enterprises in their start-up period are, therefore, grouped in
category (a).
2/ The reserve for exonerated reinvestments is considered by BDET and
the auditors as a provision against losses on the equity portfolio.

1/ According to Tunisian fiscal laws, allocations to provisions are not deductible from taxable income
until the losses have actually been incurred.  The auditors consider that taxes paid on the
allocation to provisions are pre-paid taxes to be reimbursed when the losses will be actually incurred.
Such taxes have therefore been included in net profits and in accounts receivable.

ANNEX 17

BANQUE DE DEVELOPPEMENT ECONOMIQUE DE TUNISIE
Assumptions underlying Projected Operations 1977-81
1.   Overall approvals will increase moderately, at a rate of about
6.5% p.a. The proportion of tourism financing to total approvals is
expected to decrease from about 20% in 1976 to 12% in 1981.
2.   85% of approved loans are expected to be committed, as follows:
30% in the same year as they are approved; 50% in the following year;
and 5% in the third year after the approval.
3.   Commitments of a given year are expected to be disbursed as follows:
55% in the same year that the loan contract is signed; 35% the year
after; and 10% in the third year following contract signature.
4.   Provisions on doubtful loans are conservatively expected to remain
at a level of about 2.5% of portfolio. As regards equity participations,
the same proportion of outstanding portfolio (about 13%) as in 1976 will
continue to be provisioned. This latter requirement is covered by the
existence of a "reserve for tax-exonorated investments" on BDET's books,
which the auditors accept as a provision. In the projected balance
sheets, however, that portion of this reserve which will have to be
earmarked as a provision against losses on the equity portfolio, has
been identified as such, and deducted from BDET's equity.
5.   It has been assumed that long term loans signed in 1978 and 1979
would be made at an effective rate of 10.15% p.a. for tourism projects and
9.65% p.a. for industrial projects; those made in 1980 and later would be
made at 10.65% respectively.
6.   Medium-term loans signed in 1978 and 1979 are expected to carry an
interest rate of 8% on average; those made in 1980 and later, an interest
rate of 8.5%. The proportion of medium-term loans signed under these
conditions is expected to grow from less than 1% of outstanding portfolio
in 1978, to about 3% in 1980.
7.   Cost of new resources obtained after 1977, has been assumed to be,
on average, 7% p.a. for local currency borrowings, and 7.5% for borrowings
in foreign exchange taking into account future Government subsidies towards
the cost of selected foreign exchange borrowings obtained at non-concessionary
terms. These assumptions would bring the average cost of outstanding borrowing
to 5.5% in 1977, 6.0% in 1979, and 6.3% in 1981. The KD 7 million bond loan
subscribed by KIC in 1976, although it carries an interest rate of 8.5%, has
been assumed to continue to cost BDET 6% p.a. thanks to a Government rebate.
Average interest spread on BDET's lending operations is thus expected to vary
between 2.7% and 3%.



ANNEX 17
Page 2
8.   Equity investments are expected to be paid in, after approvals, as
follows: 50% in the year of approval, 40% in the following year, and
10% in the third year after approval. The yield of outstanding portfolio
of equity investments is assumed to average 3.6% p.a.
9. Administrative expenses are expected to increase by D 100,000 per
year, i.e., on average, at about 9% p.a., which is a higher growth rate
than that of approvals, but much slower than the growth rate of BDET's
portfolio. As BDET's efficiency improves, partly thanks to economies
of scale, the ratio of administrative expenses to average fixed assets
will decline from 1.5% in 1976 to 1.0% in 1980-81.
10. BDET's capital increase from D 6 million to D 10 million is assumed
to be paid-in as follows: D 1 million in 1978; D 1 million in 1979; and
D 2 million in 1980. A subscription premium of 20% of par value will
be collected by BDET in 1978.
11. BDET's dividends are assumed to increase to 8% p.a. on Daid-in
shares for 1977 through 1979, and to further increase to 10% p.a. from
1980 onwards, when such an increase is made possible by the increased
profits resulting from the higher interest rates to become effective in
1978.

INDUSTRIAL SECTOR SUPPORTING INSTITUTIONS
1. THE INVESTMENT PROMIOTION AGENCY (API) 1/
A January, 1973 Decree established the Agency as an autonomous
public institution operating under the aegies of the Ministry of National
Economy.  The Agency's objectives are the following:
a.   Assist industrial investors in preparing and filing licensing
applications within the framework of existing legislation
(i.e. both the Investment Code and the Export Industries Law).
To claim the benefits of incentives, industrialists should
first apply to the API. Depending oni their size and scope,
all projects are reviewed by the Board of Directors of the
API which meets once a month or by the Internal Committee of
the Agency which meets once a week. In the case of smaller
projects (below D 250,000), a review is conducted by the
Internal Committee of the Agency which, upon approval,
delivers a letter of consent 2/. For such projects the
letter of consent is obtained normally within 30 days from
the presentation of the project. 3/ Such time schedules does
not pertain, however, to projects presented under the Fund
for Industrial Promotion and Decentralization (FOPRODI) which
are forwarded to the API through one of the banks that have
signed with the Ministry of Finance the June 1975 Agreement
establishing the management procedures of the Fund. Indus-
trialists are granted a one-year delay from the date of receipt
of the Approval Certificate or letter of consent to commence
operation on their projects, failing which such approval may
be withheld.  The API has created a follow up department for
the purpose of overseeing the scheduled implementation of all
relevant industrial projects.
b.   initiate research and studies on its own or in collaboration
with the National Center for Industrial Studies (CNEI) or any
other agency, public or private, domestic or foreign, with a
view towards promoting investments in Tunisia, and
c.   disseminate information, both inside and outside Tunisia,
regarding investment opportunities, and help to establish
relationships beween investors, particularly in the field
of export oriented industries.
1/   Agency de Promotion des Investissements.
2/   The Board grants an Approval Certificate for larger projects.
3/   The maximum length of time is in principle 8 weeks for projects
involving expected investments of over D 250,000.



ANNEX 23
Page 2
Under the direction of its Chairman and Managing Director (President-
Directeur General) and of its Deputy Managing Director, the Agency is organized
into three major departments, a Licensing Department, a Promotion Department
and a Study and Follow-up Department. The Promotion Department includes over-
seas promotion offices (in Germany, Belgium, France, the USA, and Canada) as
well as various services in charge of initiating research and studies, bringing
investors together and carrying out public relations activities likely to
foster investments. The Licensing Department assists investors in preparing
their applications, and reviews investment proposals. It is subdivided into
sectoral branches specialized in various industries. The department prepares
reports and recommendations to API management for approving or rejecting
investment applications.
The Follow-up and Studies Department, as mentioned above, oversees
the scheduled implementation of all relevant industrial projects. It also
includes the FOPRODI Divison, a research and study branch, one administrative
and financial division, one statistical division, missions abroad and 4 re-
gional offices in Tunisia. 1/ These regional offices are in charge of follow-
ing up on approved projects to make sure that these projects are carried out
in due time. They provide information to investors (including potential
FOPRODI applicants) 2/ on licensing procedures, they assist industrialists
in solving various administrative problems (such as clearing goods with
customs) and they organize visits by foreigners or for Tunisian businessmen
abroad. Coordination between regional offices and API headquarters is very
close. Most licensing applications are forwarded to regional offices rather
than to Tunis. The application is screened locally in a preliminary way,
mainly in order to eliminate obviously unsound requests. Once a file has
been forwarded by the regional office, the final decision is taken by API
in Tunis. Regional Managers remain closely supervised by Management in
Tunis and are frequently summoned to report to the head office. Lack of
staff and budgetary limitations put a severe strain on regional office effi-
ciency. Under such circumstances, assistance to SSEs can only be extremely
limited and fragmentary, provided as it is on a purely ad hoc basis.
API has succeeded in promoting foreign investment and, more im-
portantly for SSEs, in speeding up bureaucratic processing of licensing
agreements. However, as indicated above, an integrated program of assistance
to SSEs would imply a combination of financial and technical assistance to
be provided through close contacts with small industrialists. The API re-
gional branches already work in close cooperation with local branches of
banks (in particular STB) in gathering information on potential and existing
industries. However, much more must be done to strengthen API's regional
branches and the creation of other branches is also envisaged in the near
future, in order to set up a viable system of outreach to promote and assist
SSEs in Tunisia.

ANNEX 23

2. INDUSTRIAL LAND AGENCY (AFI) 1/
AFI was set up in 1973 for the following purposes:
(i) to carry out any study or review related to provision of
industrial land in Tunisia;
(ii) to purchase land - either through direct negotiation or
expropriation;
(iii) to carry out any activity concerned with development of indus-
trial land (improvements, building of roads, provision of public
utilities and possibly the construction of factories); and
(iv) to sell or rent these lands and/or buildings.
Practically, the agency sells or rents land and buildings to pro-
moters for development and renovation. Promoters thereafter sell (or rent)
these properties to enterprises. The agency, although a non-profit organiza-
tion, is expected to be financially viable by itself. 2/ In practice AFI has
been in operation only since 1975 and has been able to start acquiring and
improving land in a number of areas.
Industrial zones are considered to be a city planning device rather
than a concept for developing small scale industries. However, the 1974
Investment Law provided that the government would subsidize infrastructure
costs for small and medium industries moving to industrial zones. This was
also mentioned in the 1973 Law establishing FOPRODI. No decision has been
officially taken defining those industrial zones in which small industrialists
would benefit from subsidies. According to AFI's management, only firms in
industrial zones in non-metropolitan areas (Group B in the table below) are
eligible to receive subsidies. The difference between the cost of non-
improved land (Dinar 0.5/square meter) and the cost of improved land sold to
industrialists (Dinars 3/sq. meter) would be provided to eligible projects as
a subsidy. This would probably be too little to induce small industrialists
to move to an industrial zone, remote from the SSE traditional markets, since
additional transport cost would be incurred to carry the goods from the zone
to main urban centers. However, in the case of medium-size industries it
might be economic to settle in industrial zones. AFI management is extremely
skeptical as to the likelihood of attracting SSEs to Group B industrial zones.
Should it be eventually decided to provide cheap industrial land to SSEs, a
specially low selling price per hectare might be set for SSEs. The problem
of giving easier and cheaper access to industrial land to SSEs should be con-
sidered as a matter of urgency since it is becoming increasingly difficult for
1/   Agence Fonciere Industrielle.
2/   It has been however losing money since it was set up.



ANNEX 23

SSEs to find land or rent premises at reasonable rates; this has become an
issue for a number of small units needing better quarters in order to raise
productivity.
It seems also that a combination of extension services with AFI's
new industrial zones has not been given consideration until now, but that
idea should be given further attention. It has been demonstrated in other
countries, that when there is enough concentration of small industries (as
in the Tunis area), the latter may be willing to move to industrial estates
where they may benefit from banking, management and technical assistance.
3. THE OFFICE OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING, MIGRATION
AND EMPLOYMENT (OTTEEFP) I/
This office is the main body in charge of manpower in Tunisia.
Established in 1967 and operating under the wing of the Ministry of Social
Affairs, it administers employment exchanges, conducts a wide variety of
training programs, and supervises external migration. It employs 2,400
persons, including 5% professionals. A Placement Office within the organiza-
tion maintains offices in every province. However, workers and employers
alike do not seem to be eager to use the exchange and do not have to.
There are about 100 local vocational training centers mostly for
drop-outs from elementary schools, and 13 regional and 7 national centers for
drop-outs from secondary schools, as well as for some of the graduates from
the local centers. The total number of students in vocational training is
around 100,000. There are also about 10,000 on-the-job trainees. For a few
hundred, more advanced, there is a national vocational training institution.
No specific training activities for small manufacturing entre-
preneurs exist, until now. As a comparison, vocational training for farming
covers over 4,000 persons and for handicrafts about 3,000. An experimental
training center for small industries may be started in 1978 at El Djem. The
Center would include several workshops: wood working, metal working and
leather processing. At this center, technical training, as well as training
and management, accounting and administrative procedures will be provided
freely. The idea of setting such training center in a rather remote area is
to make it possible to analyze more clearly the direct impact of the experi-
ment on the local small industry sector. Should the experiment be successful,
a network of 20 training centers could be installed throughout the country.
At this stage, the intention is to provide training and courses within the
Center rather than to give on-the-spot advice through extension services.

Other scattered activities related to SSEs have been (a) a Dutch
supported program to identify new small enterprises which could provide work
for returning migrant workers 1/, (b) a Swedish/ILO program to evaluate small
rural development projects in the North West. It was found that many small
units needed technical assistance to be revived or to survive and that on-the-
spot advice should be given through plant visits. 2/ Partly as a result of
these experiments, the office hopes to set up a Small Enterprises Unit which
could identify and evaluate SSE projects and would provide technical and
managerial assistance with on-the-spot advice and plant visits.
The fact that the Office Management is taking initiatives in devel-
oping such a program for SSE testifies to the growing interest shown in
Tunisia for the development of the small scale sector. This is obviously
part of the priority given to employment by the new Development Plan. How-
ever, the program summarized above, has not yet been officially approved and
if it is implemented it will probably be complementary to the API scheme.
4. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR INDUSTRIAL CENTERS (CNEI) 3/
The CNEI was established in 1968 as an autonomous agency. Its tasks
are to:
(i) make recommendations on means to foster industrial development
and follow up on the progress of the plan in the field of
industrialization;
(ii) initiate detailed economic and technical studies for specific
industrial projects, including those whose implementation is
called for by the Plan;
(iii) furnish advice on the possibilities of creating new industries
and on how to finance and establish them;
(iv) provide assistance both on technical and managerial issues to
state-owned and private enterprises; and
(v) disseminate information and data obtained either in the course
of its own activities or from foreign publications.
1/   In one year, 30 projects were identified, but they have yet to be
implemented.
2/   Such visits would be made by mobile teams (equipes mobiles).

ANNEX 23
Page 7
Since its inception, CNEI has made numerous market studies, sector
studies and project feasibility appraisals. It has been put to use by the
government for the preparation of Development Plans and is called upon by API
for advice concerning investment proposals. -[t is instrumental in suggesting
new investment opportunities to investors and helping companies with tender
offers, and bids evaluation. The main thrust of its activity, however, has
been on behalf of the ministries, public institutions and state owned enter-
prises. Private investors and enterprises appear to prefer dealing with the
local bank from which they expect financing rather than asking CNEI for a
market analysis or a profit appraisal. Also since 1972, CNEI is charging
a fee for its assistance 1/ and suffers from the increasing competition of
private consulting firms.
CNEI has carried out only a limited number of studies on small
industry projects. 2/ Out of 26 studies made in seven years, 16 have been
for food processing industries (olive oil, pasta, fruit and vegetable canning,
etc.). The management of the CNEI did not feel the need to work on small
scale manufacturing until recently, because priority was given to large and
medium scale industries. Studies made on SSEs have been part of technical
consulting services to potential investors.
Since January 1977, a one-man office has been set up in CNEI to
provide information to small industrialists on possible projects. The con-
cept is to centralize requests from these industrialists and to give them
preliminary reaction to their ideas and thinking. CNEI management seems to
welcome more general background studies of SSEs. The motivation towards
small scale industrial development seems to be strong among some of CNEI's
staff. CNEI will be assigned a role in the API scheme for assistance to
SSEs (see below). For the time being, CNEI is represented on the Board of
API to which FOPRODI's small projects are submitted. As a result, CNEI
representatives analyze, and comment on, FOPRODI's proposals before they
are considered by the Board of API.
CNEI's program includes further work on industrial decentralization
which will directly benefit SSEs. For each province, a report will be pre-
pared providing all available information on existing industries, licensing
agreements, investment, etc. Reports will also include (1) information on
proposed local industrial zones; 3/ (2) potential regional markets for new
1/   For instance, CNEI charged a small investor D 100 for the study of an
olive oil processing plant. Such fee does not seem to be excessive
but private consulting firms are apparently much more aggressive than
CNEI in looking for clients.

seven years. See Annex Table 18 for a 'List of CNEI studies.

industries; and (3) a list of projects which could be envisaged on the basis
of an analysis of local resources and markets; such project list would give
rough indications on capacity, investment cost, employment, etc. CNEI manage-
ment hopes to identify a number of SSEs which will be included in the project
list.
Detailed industry studies paying special attention to the position
of SSEs are necessary to investigate the economic efficiency of SSEs, problems
of minimum economic size and also the new areas where SSEs could be set up.
Such studies could be made by CNEI which has gained experience in preparing
industrial studies. They could be worked out as part of the cooperation with
operationally oriented institutions such as API and also banks engaged in
lending to small scale industrialists.
5. UNION TUNISIENNE DE L'INDUSTRIE, DU COMMERCE ET DE L'ARTISANAT (UTICA)
UTICA was established in 1946. It acts as the federation of em-
ployers in Tunisia, as well as the major organization promoting the interests
of private business. UTICA in practice focuses an important part of its
efforts on medium and small scale Tunisian businesses. It argues strongly
for further efforts to assist SSEs. Through its continuing contact at the
regional level 1/ with firms, UTICA is in a position to know their needs ?nd
promote their interests. However, given the specific needs of Tunisian
entrepreneurs for financial, managerial and technical assistance, UTICA does
not seem to have the resources to handle technical and other extension ser-
vices for small scale manufacturers, as is indicated in its statutes.
A new advisory unit (SEPIC) 2/ has been set up in 1976, following
a recommendation of UTICA.  The objectives of SEPIC are:  (1) to provide
training to small businessmen mainly through seminars and teaching of non-
technical subjects (such as management and accounting); (2) to set up a
"projects bank". (Projects could be sold to interested promoters and SEPIC
maintains a library of industrial projects prepared in various countries);
(3) to study projects or sectors (for a fee) as a private consulting firm,
selling services. SEPIC is a limited liability company with a D 200,000
share capital and UTICA is only a minority shareholder; other shareholders
are Tunisian businessmen and industrialists. A minimum 5% statutory dividend
is paid normally to shareholders. SEPIC Is willing to take some equity par-
ticipation in some of the projects it studies. SEPIC is only starting
operations with limited financial and human resources. 3/ SEPIC has not

been able so far to receive any governmental subsidy, in particular to meet
its training objectives. It is investigating the possibility to assist small
industrialists in preparing projects to be subsequently submitted to FOPRODI.
In a few cases, commercial banks (which act as a channel between applicants
and FOPRODI) have requested investors to submit a detailed proposal and these
investors have come to SEPIC for help. However, SEPIC experience is that it
is often difficult for small industrialists to understand the need for studies
and even more to pay for them. It is too early to pass a judgment on SEPIC's
ability to assist SSEs but it seems so far to have experienced difficulties in
obtaining financial resources from public sources, has only a few clients and
anticipates possible competition from API and/or CNEI, in case the latter
would decide to increase its program of assistance to small scale enterprises.



ANNEX 24
FONDS DE PROMOTION ET DE DECENTRALISATION INDUSTRIELLE
(FOPRODI)
General Purposes and Functioning
1.        The Fonds de Promotion et de Decentralisation Industrielle (FOPRODI)
was established by Tunisian Law No. 73-82 of December 31, 1973. Its orga-
nization and functioning were defined in Decree No. 74-793 of August 16, 1974,
and amended by Decree No. 77-855 of October 20, 1977. Its general purposes
are promotion of entrepreneurship, support to the creation and development
of SSEs and implementation of incentives for decentralization of industrial
investments.
2.        FOPRODI is not an institution but a fund financed with budgetary
allocations, proceeds from the amortization of loans made out of the fund,
interests charged on these loans, and any other sourcesof funds that could be
allocated to it by law or decree.
3.      The administration of FOPRODI is entrusted to banking institutions (the Partici-
pating Banks) under the term Qf an agreement concluded between each of them and the
Ministry of Finance, and specifying procedures for the appraisal of eligible
projects, their submission for FOPRODI financing, funds disbursement, loan
collection, remuneration of the participating Bank and risk-sharing between
it and the Government. So far, four commercial banks have concluded such an
agreement with the Ministry of Finance. They are Societe Tunisienne de Banque
(STB), Banque Nationale de Tunisie (BNT), Union Internationale des Banques
(UIB) and Banque du Sud (BS).
4.        The decision to extend FOPRODI financing to a particular project is
taken by the Minister of the National Economy, on the basis of a recommendation
made by API (see Annex 23).
5.        FOPRODI financing is available only for projects in the industrial
sector, with equity accounting for at least 30% of the financing of total
investment cost.
FOPRODI Credit Facility for the Promotion of Entrepreneurship
6.        The FOPRODI credit facility for the promotion of entrepreneurship is
extended to the sponsor of the project in the form of a personal loan towards
the constitution of equity capital. Until October 1977, this credit facility
was intended only for new projects with an investment cost (including working
capital) not exceeding D 200,000 ($464,000 equivalent). This ceiling was
raised to D 500,000 ($1,160,000 equivalent) by Decree No. 77-855 of October
20, 1977.



-2-
7.        To be eligible for the above crediLt facility, the sponsor (s) must
be Tunisian nationa14 with adequate qualifications but limited means, and
willing to assume personally and full-time the management of the project.
8.        Until October 1977, the personal 'Loan to the sponsor extended under
this FOPRODI credit facility amounted to up to 41% of equity capital and was
intended to enable him to acquire a 51% majority ownership by investing
10% of equity. Decree No. 77-855 has estab:Lished a more complex scheme:
(a)   For projects costing less than D 250,000 (including working
capital), the personal loan will be of up to 70% of equity,
the sponsor having to contribute himself a minimum of 10%
of equity;
(b)   For projects costing between D 250,000 and D 500,000 (including
working capital), the personal lo;an will be of up to 45% of
equity, the sponsor having to contribute himself a minimum
of 20% of equity.
9.        The above percentages to determine the maximum personal  loan  that
can be obtained under this FOPRODI credit facility apply to an equity basis
amounting to no more than 30% of total investment cost. These personal loans
have terms of 12 years, including 5 years of grace and bear interest at 3%.
FOPRODI Credit Facility for SSE Creation and Development
10.       The FOPRODI credit facility for SSE creation and development is
extended to the SSE itself (as opposed to the project sponsor) in the form
of a medium- or long-term loan. This loan may be combined with the personal
loan described in paragraphs 6 to 9.
11.       Until October 1977, this FOPRODI credit facility was reserved for
new projects costing less than D 30,000 ($69,600 equivalent), including
working capital, or SSE expansion projects costing less than D 15,000 ($34,800
equivalent), excluding working capital. Decree No. 77-855 has raised these
two ceilings to D 75,000 ($174,000 equivalent) and D 45,000 ($104,400 equivalent)
respectively.
12.       The amount of the loans under this FOPRODI credit facility cannot
exceed 70% of total project cost.
13.       Loans under this FOPRODI credit facility bear interest rate at 4%
and have maximum terms of 10 years, including 3 years of grace, for new
projects, and 7 years with no grace period for expansion projects.

FOPRODI Assistance for Industrial Decentralization
14.       FOPRODI assistance for industrial decentralization has not yet been
organized. However it is envisaged in the law that FOPRODI will finance
incentives to be given by the Government for investments in the less developed
regions of Tunisia. Such incentives may include interest subsidies, invest-
ment grants and the financing of selected infrastructure works.
Operational Arrangements
15.       Identification, initial screening and appraisal of eligible projects
under the existing FOPRODI facilities is the responsability of the Participating
Banks. The appraisal reports prepared by the Participating Banks are sent
to API for its review. On this basis API submits recommendations to the Minister
of the National Economy who takes the decision to finance the project under
one (or several) FOPRODI credit facility (ies). The Minister's approval enables
the participating bank concerned to withdraw funds from the FOPRODI account,
established at the Central Bank of Tunisia, in line with its own disbursements
of the corresponding amounts to the project sponsor or to the SSE.
16.       The participating Banks are also responsible for drafting and con-
clusion of contracts, taking of adequate securities, control of the uilization
of the funds, collection of interest and principal, and enforcement Oi the secu-
rities and other legal proceedings in the case of non-payment by the s  rnsor or
the SSE. An interest penalty of 7% p.a. applies on overdue payments. Iuterest
and principal collected by participating banks have to be transferred by theL.
to the FOPRODI account established at the Central Bank of Tunisia.
Risk-Sharing
17.       Losses on a loan extended under a FOPRODI credit facility are shared
between the Participating Bank having extended the loan and FOPRODI in the pro-
portions of 25% for the bank and 75% for FOIODI.  The risk sharing mechanism
applies only after exhaustion of all legal means to recover the loan.
Remuneration of Participating Banks
18.       The Participating Banks are remunerated for their services in admi-
nistering the FOPRODI by the following commissions:
(a)   a fixed commission of 1% based on the principal amount of
loans disbursed under the FOPRODI credit facilities; and
(b)   a variable commission based on the amounts recovered in
principal and interest every year and fixed at 5%, 4%, 3%,
2%, 1% and 0.5% when the rate of recovery of the amounts
to be recovered in principal and in interest: in that
year has attained respectively 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%
and 50%.



-4 -
19.       These commissions are paid annually to the participating banks
out of the FOPRODI account established at the Central Bank of Tunisia.
Experience with the FOPRODI
20.       Since it became operative in December 1975 until May 1977, FOPRODI
has financed 81 projects, accounting for total investment of D 7,093,148
and creating 2,553 new jobs (Annex 2, para. 2.04). The main problem encoun-
tered so far has been the reluctance of the Participating Banks to contribute
their own resources to complement in the form of term loans the financial
plan of projects eligible for the FOPRODI credit facility for the promotion
of entrepreneurship but not eligible for the FOPRODI credit facility for the
creation and development of SSEs. Before the increase of ceilings in October
1977, these were essentially the new projects with investment cost (including
working capital) between D 30,000 and D 200,000. Now that the ceilings have
been raised, the same problem is expected to arise for projects costing between
D 75,000 and D 500,000. The reason for this reluctance is that in view of the
chronically tight liquidity position of Tunisian' commercial banks, the
Participating Banks prefer to use their own resources to lend to established
customers rather than to SSEs offering less attractive securities and with
no previous debt repayment records.
Purpose and Modalities of the New FOPRODI Credit Facility to be financed out of
the Proposed Bank Loan to the Government
21.       The main purpose of the new FOPRODI credit facility to be financed
out of the proposed $5 million Bank loan to the Government is to fill this gap
in making available to the Participating Banks (which will be joined by BDET)
special resources to complement in the form of term loans the financing plan
of new SSE projects already qualifying for the FOPRODI credit facility for the
promotion of entrepreneurship.  However, to keep the focus of Bank's assistance
on employment generation and SSEs rather than medium-sized enterprises, the
eligibility criteria for the new FOPRODI credit: facility will be more restric-
tive than those established under the FOPRODI c:redit facility for the promotion
of entrepreneurship (paragraph 6 above), in that: (a) total project cost,
including working capital, should not exceed D 200,000 at 1976 prices; and
(b) normally the investment cost per job created or maintained should not exceed
D 4,600 at 1976 prices, which is in line with the Bank's Urban Poverty Program
criteria for Tunisia. A new condition of eligibility has also been added in
that the project promoter should be willing to make use of the available
technical assistance deemed necessary by API.
22.       The new FOPRODI credit facility will finance up to 50% of the SSE
project investment cost, including working capital. Combined with a minimum
30% financing with equity capital, this will leave about 20% of the cost to
be financed by the Participating Banks out of their own resources (instead of 70%).



-5 -
Furthermore, should any SSE prove unable to repay on schedule the loans received,
the Participating Bank will not be obliged to make good on the SSE loan repay-
ment obligation vis-a-vis the Government. This arrangement is intended to
remove the principal cause of the reluctance of commercial banks to lend to
SSEs, since the aleas and costs of loan recovery are perceived by the banks
as excessively high in the case of SSEs. However, the new facility will
provide for a risk-sharing mechanism between the Participating Bank and the
Government. Once an SSE loan is recognized as fully or partly unrecoverable, the
final loss on both the loan financed out of the new FOPRODI credit facility
and the term loan made by the Participating Bank out of its own resources will
be evenly divided between the sponsoring bank and the Government.
23.       Except for the special role that BDET is expected to play as inter-
mediary between the Participating Banks, the Government and the Bank, the
operational arrangements for the new FOPRODI credit facility will be similar to
those applying to the two existing FOPRODI credit facilities.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SYSTEM FOR
SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISES (SSE)
General Purpose
1.        One of the major objectives set forth, for the SSE component of the
loan is to set-up a scheme of technical assistance for SSE. As a result of
the dialogue on this subject, the Tunisian Government has now decided to
establish a nationwide system of technical assistance for small industries
with a coverage beyond the extent of the Bank loan beneficiaries. The main
objectives of such system will be to:
(a)  assist small scale entrepreneurs in preparing new industrial
projects suitable for financing by the banking system;
(b) assist newly established SSEs in project implementation stage,
especialy as regards project design and choice of equipment;
(c) help SSEs establish proper management: procedures and provide
for adequate training of both management and staff;
(d) raise productivity of existing enterprises by improving
manufacturing processes and production management procedures;
(e) assist new and existing SSEs in their financial management
through establishment of appropriate accounting procedures; and
(f) assist SSEs in finding and/or organizing appropriate marketing
channels for their products.
2.        The system will be organized around the existing API network of four
regional branches, whichare expected to increase to eight in the near future 1/.
There will be a central core of four SSE senior experts at API's headquarters
in Tunis, and a small unit of two experts in each regional office. By the
end of 1978 the system is expected to reach its full strength with a total of
20 specialists. API will receive the support of CNEI, in identifying regional
industrial opportunities, and of API, in providing industrial land and basic
infrastructure. Close coordination with the Office de l'Emploi will be essen-
tial to provide feedback in the requirements of vocational training for small
entrepreneurs. In addition, API will resort to ad hoc technical consultancies
from either Tunisian or foreign experts, as the need may be, to provide advice
on specific technical problems which may arise in the context of individual
projects.
1/   Present locations are:  Tunis, North (office in Tunis), Sousse and Sfax.
Future suggested locations are: Nabeul, Beja, Sidi Bouzid, Kasserine.



ANNEX 25
Page 2
Staffing
3.        Most of the professionals required to implement the system may be
locally recruited among engineers and economists with practical business ex-
perience. They will require, however, additional specialized training in
the specific problems confronting SSEs. The central core of four senior
experts should initially concentrate in providing the required on-the-job
training for the new staff in the regional offices, and in assisting API
management in setting up the system. In consultation with API it has been
determined that some foreign assistance will initially be required to rein-
force the central core; thus, at least two of the four senior experts will be
expatriates with previous experience in analogous operations. Their selection
will be agreed with the Bank on the basis of jointly established profiles (see
attachment). Financing for the foreign exchange cost of the expatriates is
expected to come from bilateral and/or multilateral aid agencies. However, if
no firm commitments from these sources is obtained by July 1, 1978 a portion
of the loan to the Government amounting to $300,000 will be earmarked to cover
foreign technical assistance costs. The local costs of operating the system
are expected to run around $180,000 per year and are going to be borne by the
Government, which has approved the additional budgetary allocations to API.
Timetable
4.        The timetable to set-up the system will be linked to the operation
of the loan in the following way:
(i) Initiation of Activities. The system should be operational
by July 1, 1978, approximate expected time for the beginning
of loan disbursements. By then, at least eight of the re-
gional officers should be hired and arrangements for financing
of foreign experts (including their selection) concluded.
(ii) Advance Evaluation. Six months after effectiveness of the
loan, but not later than January 1979, the Government and the
Bank will jointly assess the functioning of the system. The
Government will take steps to introduce those changes deemed
necessary.
(iii) Regular Operations. By June 30, 1979 the system should be
operational to its full professional strength. A second
joint assessment could take place at such time.
