PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY: TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
(Loan 1194-TU)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report of the Second TEK Transmission
Project, for which Loan 1194-TU was approved on June 14, 1976 in the sum of
US$56.0 million. The final disbursement on the loan was made on August 18,
1982, after cancellation of US$586,048.34.
The Project comprised the construction and placing into operation of
380/154-kV and 154/33-kV substations, and various 380-kV transmission lines in
different parts of Turkey, as well as training of TEK staff in the design and
operation of the transmission system, and tariff, manpower and power system
studies.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Power and Energy Development Division, on the
basis of; the appraisal report, supervision reports and other documents in
the Bank's files, a completion report prepared by TEK, and information
obtained during Bank missions in July and October, 1983.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of this draft report to
the Government and TEK. CoLments received from the Director-General of the
Treasury, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources and TEK are reproduced
as Attachments A,B and C respectively.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY: TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
(Loan 1194-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The Project was the twelfth Bank Group operation supporting the power
sector in Turkey and the second loan to TEK for expansion of its electricity
power transmission system. The main objective of the physical facilities of
the Project was to assist TEK in the construction and placing into operation
of 380-lcV transmission lines and 380/154-kV and 154/33-kV substations, as
required to meet the rapid]y expanding demand for electrical energy in Turkey.
This objective was largely realized. However, the Project succeeded only
partially in meeting its institutional objectives. The loan financed the
foreign costs of three sections of the 380-kV transmission network, totalling
507 kilometers in length, and nineteen 380/154-kV substations. Some components
included in the original project scope -- the 154/33-kV substation, and two
sections of the 380-kV network, totalling 167 kilometers -- were ultimately
financed by other sources.
Project start-up was delayed almost two years due to delays in loan
effectiveness (para. 3.1), and project completion was ultimately four years
later than expected. Operating performance of Project facilities has been
good overall, based on experience to date. However, several project
components had still not been comissioned at the time of drafting this PCR.
The rate of return achieved on the 1975-1981 timeslice of the power
investment program, estimated by using actual electricity tariffs was about
5%, compared to 16% as estimated at the time of appraisal. However, this is
not a measurement of the economic justification of investments in power
supply, but rather an indication of the inadequacy of electricity rates in
comparison with the long run marginal cost of supply, and the willingness to
pay for electricity.
The following points may be of particular interest:
(a) Loan processing and project start-up were delayed to allow TEK
time to meet its obligations under the Loan Agreement
(para. 3.1);
(b) Design of the Project did not take into account adequately the
weather conditions along one of the line routes, and as a result
heavy rim ice formation caused the collapse of 17 towers
(paras. 4.1-4.2);
(c) Initial non-compliance with the return on assets covenant was
followed by a decision to change the financial covenant, under
which the adequacy of TEK's revenues would be monitored, from a
rate of return on assets to an internal cash generation



covenant. The targets set by this covenant were also not fully
achieved. (paras. 5.1-5.2);
(d)  Both the Bank and the consultants underestimated the obstacles
to implementing changes in TEK's organization and personnel
policy (paras. 6.4 and 6.8); and,
(e)  Project implementation suffered because the unit at TEK
initially responsible for project management fell apart owing to
staffing problems (para 8.6).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURK: TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
(LOAN 1194-TU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1     Under the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources ()ENR), the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is responsible for the generation,
transmission, and, since November 1982, the distribution of almost all the
electricity sold in Turkey. TEK is also responsible for the implementation of
the Government's program for rural electrification and the construction of all
generating and transmission facilities, with the exception of hydroelectric
plants.
1.2      The Bank's association with what today is the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) began in 1967 with a Technical Assistance grant to finance a
reorganization study of Turkey's power industry. Loan 568-TU followed in 1968
to help finance Turkey's first 380-kV lines and substations to bring power
from the Keban hydroelectric station to Istanbul and vicinity. Loan 763-lU in
1971, the First Transmission Project, covered the expansion of TEK's
transmission system during 1972-1974. TEK Transmission Project II was the
next stage of the Bank's support for TEK's transmission system expansion. It
included lines and substations intended for initial operation in 1976-1979.
The Elbistan Thermal Power Project (Loan 1023-TU) in 1974, involved
development of an open-cast lignite mine and construction of a lignite-fueled
thermal power station with four 340 MW units and related transmission lines
and facilities. During the early 1970's, other Bank loans to the power sector
in Turkey financed expansion of private power utilities.
II. PROJECT APPRAISAL AND ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION
Project Origin, Appraisal, and Negotiation
2.1      The Second TEK Transmission Project was added to the lending program
in September 1974 and appraised in October 1974, as a substitute for another
project (Karakaya Hydropower - Loan 1844-TU) which was experiencing processing
delays. The Project was a time slice of the ongoing 380 and 154 kV program
and was fully described in reports available in the Bank under the First
Transmission Project. The Bank was intent upon moving quickly with a loan to
TEK which would provide an opportunity to discuss TEK's structure and
institutional framework with the Turkish authorities. Negotiations started
April 28, 1975 and continued until June 4, 1975. Because of the short time
span between project identification and appraisal, agreement on the
institutional aspects of the project was left over to be reached during
negotiations. The staffing situation at TEK was determined by the Bank to be
critical, in particular, the low and decreasing average years of experience of
the engineering staff, and the main issue during negotiations was the reform
of TEK's recruitment, remuneration and overall personnel practices regarding
which the Bank had requested detailed information. Discussions were further
complicated when information on the personnel situation submitted during



- 2 -
negotiations was at variance with the data presented to the appraisal team.
Eventually, it was agreed during negotiations that TEK would undertake a
manpower planning study as part of the Project (paras 6.6 - 6.8) and would
send the Bank by September 30 of each year a program of staffing and
recruitment for the next year together with the details of the compensation
package that would assure satisfactory recruitment of staff. Furthermore,
according to a supplemental letter signed with the Loan Agreement, TEK was to
send to the Bank by July 31, 1976 (6 weeks after signing) "the corporate
instruments providing for the establishment of new headquarters divisions and
departments and of two new regional offices, their responsibilities and the
delegation of authority to the heads of these units."
2.2      Board presentation of the Project was delayed, having been made
conditional upon the resolution of problems with the Elbistan Thermal Project
(Loan 1023-TU). Effectiveness of the Elbistan loan, which had been signed in
June, 1974, had been delayed five times principally due to lack of
implementation of an agreed tariff increase, and the revaluation of fixed
assets in service through December 31, 1973. When Government commitment to
implement an appropriate tariff increase by early 1976 appeared assured, the
TEK Transmission II Project was then presented to the Board and approved on
November 18, 1975. An increase in the average electricity tariff of 18% on
May 26, 1976, then enabled the Elbistan loan to be declared effective June 1,
1976. Two weeks later, the TEK II loan was signed, almost a year after
negotiations had been completed.
Original Project Description
2.3      The Project was part of TEK's 1976-1979 development program and
consisted of the following components;
Part A   (1) The construction and placing into operation of 380/154-kV
substations with an aggregate capacity of about 2,550 MVA,
principally at Kayseri, Babaeski, Istanbul II (Alibeykoy),
Istanbul III (Ikitelli), Bursa, Ankara II, Eregli, Keban,
Osmaniye, Osmanca, Izmir and Adapazari, comprising structures,
switchgear, protective circuits, power transformers and related
equipment.
(2) The construction and placing into operation of 154/33-kV
substations with an aggregate capacity of about 650 MVA,
principally at Etibo, Ankara, Keban, Demizli, Bursa, Sivas,
Kayseri, Orhangazi, Gaziantep and Adapazari comprising structures
and equipment including power transformers and related equipment.
Part B       The construction and placing into operation of transmission lines
at 380 kV between Keban and Elbistan (171 km); Elbistan and
Osmaniye (174 km); Adapazari and Eregli (150 km); Babaeski and
Istanbul II (200 km); and Istanbul II and Istanbul III (60 km
including the Bosphorous Crossing).I/
Part C       The training of TEK's engineers in the design and operation of
the EHV (380 kV) transmission system.

-3-
Part D       A tariff study embracing the electric power sector throughout
Turkey.
Part E       A medium and long term manpower study of TEK's requirements for
professional staff by year and category over a five-year period
starting January 1, 1977.
Part F       Various power system studies.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness
3.1      The original effectiveness date for this loan, September 14, 1976,
was postponed six times to April 21, 1978, almost two years after signing.
While the Loan had no special conditions of effectiveness, declaring the loan
effective would have immediately resulted in default in respect of several
covenants having to do with the return on assets, manpower studies to be
undertaken before November 1976, and TEK's problem arising from receivables
due by municipalities. Thus the effectiveness deadline was postponed to
enable TEK to meet its obligations under the Loan Agreement. The question of
the studies had been resolved to the satisfaction of the Bank by early 1978.
In order to deal with the rate of return issue, an agreement was reached to
waive the covenant on the rate of return until December 31, 1979 and,
thereafter to require a 5.5% rate of return on net revalued assets in 1980, to
be increased gradually to 8% by 1982 (para 5.1). It was also agreed that, in
view of the authority available to the Ministry of Finance to pay TEK arrears
owed by municipalities, the arrears which were owed to TEK at that time should
not stand in the way of declaring the loan effective. This agreement is
embodied in a letter from the Bank, confirmed by the Government and TEK. 1/
Change in Project Scope
3.2      As a result of the delay in loan effectiveness, TEK was not able to
use Bank financing for the 154/33-kV substations included in Part A(2) of the
Project, due to the urgent need to proceed with constructing these
substations. It was therefore agreed 2/ that this part of the loan be
reallocated to include eight additional 380/154-kV substations in the Project,
in addition to the original eleven. The substations and overhead lines
ultimately financed by the Bank loan are listed in Annexes 1 and 2.
Furthermore, two of tne five transmission lines under Part B of the project
were ultimately financed from other sources. The Adapazari-Eregli line was
financ.ed out of TEK's own resources. The Bosphorus Crossing (Istanbul II -
Istanbul III) was financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development

(US $14 million).  An amount of US$586,054.72 was cancelled from the Bank
loan. Other sources of financing for the project included an Italian loan of
'JS$3 million, used for auto-transformzrs, and a Belgian loan of US$3 million
used for current transformers.
Implementation
3.3      Although the Project was part of a 1976/79 time-slice and at the tinme
of appraisal was planned to be completed by December, 1979, its completion
will not be achieved until late 1984. Given the generation capacity
shortfall, some delay of selected lines included in the Project was justified,
but not to the extent of delay actually occurring. The main constraints to
timely physical implementation were: (a) the long delay in declaring the Loan
effective; (b) the absence of a properly organized and continually
functioning Project Management Unit within TEK to oversee project
implementation, aggravated by the shortage of sufficiently experienced TEK
staff; (c) the lack of consulting engineers to carry out construction
supervision; (d) the difficulties encountered in site selection and
expropriation of land for substations and lines; and (e) the problems
encountered by TEK in retaining personnel for substations erection (done by
force account) mainly on account of lower than competitive salaries, so that
finally much of this work had to be contracted. The delay in deciaring the
Loan effective which has been explained in paragraph 3.1 resulted not only in
changes in the ploject scope but also in considerable delay in placing the
orders for the substations and lines equipment.
3.4      The Project was beset with additional implementation problems in all
phases, from preparation of bidding documents through coTmissioning of the
different works involved. The geographic dispersion of project components
would have made it difficult for one unit physically to inspect construction,
but central coordination of procurement and construction timetables could
still have been considerably improved. The rate of project implementation was
further affected by the lack of consulting engineers to assist TEK in
procurement, equipment inspection and construction supervision. At appraisal,
it was felt that TEK had demonstrated by its performance under the First
Transmission Project and its implementation of the ongoing 380-kV transmission
program that it would be able to implement the project with only limited
assistance from outside consultants. As it turned out, TEK's deteriorating
manpower situation diminished its project implementation capacity. TEK
employed only one individual consultant, highly competent in electrical
engineering, who dealt with design problems, and was not in a position to
influence the management of the project execution. Overall, the financial and
organizational objectives of the project were not achieved. The status of
compliance with major covenants is shown in Annex 3.
3.5      TEK's reports during progress of the Project were not designed in a
manner that would permit TEK's management or the Bank to follow easily the
Project's progress; the reports omitted essential information that could have
permitted management to influence the implementation schedule of the different
works and to forecast their completion date with greater accuracy. In this
area also, the lack of assistance from a consulting engineering firm is
reflected in the non-availability of a properly designed reporting system that
could have greatly assisted management in monitoring the Project's progress.

Procurement
3.6      -he complete list of contracts financed under the loan is snown in
Annex 4. Some of the equipment procured with the Loan was not installed in
the works included in the project scope (as defined in para. 3.2) but, as
agreed with the Bank, was used to replenish stocks which had been depleted.
It is now not possible to ascertain the end use of these supplies.
Disbursement
3.7      The comparison between actual disbursements and the Loan disbursement
schedule estimated at appraisal is shown in Annex 5. From this comparison it
can be seen that as a consequence of the delay in Loan effectiveness, the Loan
disbursements started two years later than anticipated at appraisal and that
disbursement was completed 7.5 years after loan signing, but over the same
length of time as estimated at the time of appraisal.
Project Cost
3.8      The cost of the project as implemented amounts to USt 175.0 million
of which 51 was in foreign exchange. The total cost is equivalent to
US$ 115.2 million when expressed in 1974 US dollars, the price level used to
estimate the base costs of the project at the time of appraisal. Table 3.1
gives a breakdown of the actual project cost, Total (A). It should be noted
that TEK's cost accounting system did not provide accurate information on the
foreign cost component of individual lines and stations, so that the figures
provided here are estimates only.

N/A = not available.
3.9      As explained in para. 3.2, the project as implemented differed from
the project as appraised, consequently it is not possible to compare directly
the project cost estimate CUSt 100.8 million excluding price contingencies)
with the actual cost of US$115.2 million. In order to be able to make an
approximate comparison of the actual cost and estimated project cost, the
project -ost shown in Table 3.1 has been reduced by the actual cost of the
380/154-kV substations which were added to the project scope after loan
effectiveness, resulting in an adjusted actual project cost, Total (B), as



- 6 -
shown in Table 3.2. The appraisal project cost estimate must then be reduced
by the estimated cost of the 154/33-kV substations eliminated from the project
scope, Total (C), as indicated in Table 3.3. According to the comparison of
Totals (B) and (C), the actual Project had a cost overrun of UStl.65 million,
which was Less than 2Z over the Project Cost estimated at appraisal. It
appears, consequently, that the base costs plus physical contingencies were
quite accurately estimated at the time of appraisal.

3.10     In order to determine the adequacy of the price contingencies

compared with the actual Project cost, adjusted by deducting the cost of the
substations added after loan effectiveness - Total (E) - as shown ir. Table
3.4. According to these figures, price contingencies as estimated at
appraisal were only 25% off from the actual impact of inflation on Project
costs. This underestimation reflects basically the delay in project

implementation (para. 3.3) and higher than expected local inflation rates.
The result was about a 7% cost overrun on the project overall.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Project Facilities
4.1      Since most of the Project's facilities have been in service for a
short period, and other components will not be commissioned until end-1984, it
is difficult to assess the operating performance of the Project. However,
based on the rather short observation period--ranging from a few months to two
years-it is apparent that the Project's components have been performing
satisfactorily, with the exception of the Babaeski to Istanbul line where ice
formation on the conductors caused the collapse of 17 towers. The
Babaeski-Istanbul line runs for some distance parallel to the Black Sea Coast
at about 30 km inland. In this area the line is exposed during the winter to
strong northern winds ladden with moisture. Conditions are such that rim ice
forms easily on the conLductors.  The surface exposed to wind is then greatly
increased by the large rim ice formation. The resulting loading of the towers



- 8 -
can exceed by far the design loads and the towers are liable to collapse.
Analysis of the incident mentioned above indicated that the ice formation
occurred in only very few spans directly facing low transverse valleys opening
toward the Black Sea. This problem was not known at the time the line was
designed but could have been anticipated by a careful study of weather
conditions along the line route. L/ The damaged portion of the line was
repaired by installing a number of additional towers in the more exposed
locations to reduce the line spans.
4.2      The quality of the power supply to the load centers served by the
Project has significantly improved with less power losses, lower voltage drop
and greater continuity of service. Reliable and proven equipment has been
used for the Project facilities. The operating performance of the equipment
cannot be properly judged in the beginning of the Project's life cycle when it
has not yet been fully loaded.
Growth of Energy Demand and Capacity
4.3      Annex 6 shows the actual generation, plant capacity, electricity
sales, and other variables for 1975-1982, compared with the appraisal
forecast. While sales for the first three years (1975-1977) were within 2-5%
of forecast sales, from 1978 onward sales began to slip much further from the
forecast trend. Although the slippage of actual sales from estimated sales
was as high as 16.2% in 1980 and 1981, the lower trend in energy demand was
not foreseeable at the time of appraisal-October 1974, and subsequent
updating in October 1975. The actual sales trend reflected the world
recession during that period and the concurrent weakening of Turkey's economic
situation. The slower-than-anticipated growth of installed capacity--which
was expected to reach 8556 MW for the interconnected system by 1981 but in
fact reached only 5188 MW--was the other major factor explaining the slippage
of electricity sales. In other words, while actual demand for electricity
continued to grow at a lower rate than had been forecast, inadequate plant
capacity was, nonetheless, resulting in unmet demand and lower than expected
electricity sales. While at the time of appraisal no purchases of power from
other countries were anticipated from 1976 on, in fact it became necessary to
increase steadily Turkey's electricity imports which reached almost 2,000 GWh
by 1982.
1/ This problem of heavy rim ice formation is not restricted to the
Babaeski-Istanbul area but occurs in other parts of Turkey with serious
effects on the structural stability of transmission lines. Between 1975
and 1979 rim ice formation caused the collapse of 114 towers, out of a
total 6658 towers, in 14 in idents. In all these cases, it was found that
the mechanical design loadings used were insufficient to maintain the
integrity of the lines.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Return on Assets and Internal Cash Generation
5.1      It was agreed under the Project that TEK would increase tariffs as
necessary to earn an annual return on a revalued asset base of 8% from 1976
onward. Although the target for 1976 was reduced to 6%, 1/ TEK was still
unable to comply with this requirement, a major reason delaying loan
effectiveness from November 30, 1976 to April 21, 1978 (para. 3.1).
Ultimately, because of the detrimental impact that considerably higher
electricity tariffs could have had on the Government's economic stabilization
program, Bank management decided to waive the rate of return covenant until
December 31, 1979, and thereafter to require a 5.5% rate of return in 1980, to
be increased gradually to 8% by 1982. Subsequently, despite agreement on the
methodology for the revaluation of assets, there was some disagreement between
TEK and the Bank on the actual computation of the rate of return, mainly due
to the inclusion or otherwise of certain assets in the asset base.
Ultimately, the rate of return covenant was superseded. When the Karakaya
Hydroelectric Project (Loan 1844-TU) was negotiated in May 1980, it was agreed
to replace the rate of return covenant with a cash generation covenant,
establishing targets for increasing shares of capital expenditures for power
(including investments by both TEK and DSI) which would be financed out of
TEK's net internal cash generation.
5.2      TSK's financial performance did not reach the levels anticipated in
the financial covenants (Annexes 7 and 8). The actual rate of return on
assets averaged below 3% during the 1975-1980 period. In 1981, TEK's
financial performance fell slightly short of the level agreed to under the new
covenant. Compared with a target ratio of 20%, the internal cash generation
ratio was 19Z if decreases in working capital are included as a source of
funds, as provided for in the covenant. (If working capital changes are
excluded, the ratio was 12%.) To explain the financial shortfall during the
project implementation period, it is necessary to look at the major trends
affecting TEK's finances which were not anticipated at the time of appraisal.
5.3      Partly due to uncertainties regarding price trends, the financial
forecasts were done mostly in constant 1974 prices, although some provision
was made for revaluation of assets and modest increases in staff salaries;
therefore, the differential impact of price changes on revenues, operating
expenses and capital expenditures was not forecast. Inflation during the
forecast period was high, climbing from 10% in 1975 to a peak of over 100% in
1980. The average tariff was expected at appraisal to increase 47% overall in
real terms for the 7-year forecast period (1975-1981), equivalent to a 6% p.a.
increase. However, the actual real increase was only 11% over the entire
period, or only just over 1% p.a. (Annex 9), while TEK's base of commissioned
assets was expanding at a much faster rate.   Fuel price increases, which
surpassed changes in the wholesale price index in 1979-1981, were not
1/ Supplemental Letter, Loan 1023-TU, dated October 16, 1975.



- 10 -
recovered through tariff increases. 1/ Furthermore, appraisal estimates of
the capital expenditures in thermal generation, power transmission and
distribution did not prove to be accurate, when compared with actual
expenditures in constant prices. TEK's actual capital expenditures were about
half of the forecast level in 1975-1978, but in 1979-1981 actual expenditures
were about 20% higher than forecast expenditures in real terms (Annex 10).
Toward the end of the 1970s, the number of major plants under construction was
expanded, resulting in an extensive drain on cash reserves.
Tariffs
5.4      In parallel with the adjustments in the overall level of tariffs
recommended by the Bank to meet TEK's financial requirements, changes in
tariff structure were recommended to TEK in the study carried out in 1975 by a
local consultant under Part D of the Project.  Hlowever, the recommendations
were not implemented and TEK has, at present, no plans to structure its
tariffs along the lines recommended in the study. The study is now outdated
and does not form an adequate basis for discussions regarding economic cost of
supplying electricity to consumers.
5.5      A new tariff study is included under the recently approved loan for
TEK Transmission Project III, Loan 2322-TU of June 27, 1983. The Bank will
continue to press for an increase in level and improved structure of
electricity tariffs so that prices may more adequately reflect the long run
marginal cost, as well as provide a reasonable level of internally generated
cash to finance future investment. The reduction of the SEE's financial
dependence on the Government and improvement in the efficiency of SEEs are
major goals of the structural adjustment program in Turkey, which The Bank has
supported through four Structural Adjustment Loans (SALs I, II, III and IV).
Receivables from Municipalities
5.6      The reduction of TEK's accounts receivable from municipalities was
highlighted at the time of appraisal as a step important to further processing
of the loan. Legislation was enacted to bring about a consolidation of debt
among Government agencies, through December 31, 1973. The Government agreed
to cause its agencies and municipalities to pay debts outstanding to TEK in
excess of three months in accordance with a plan of action and timetable
acceptable to the Bank and the Borrower (Guarnatee Agreement, Section 3.03).
In fact, such an action plan was never submitted and TEK continued to have to
face the problem of non-payment of bills by Government agencies and
municipalities causing a serious working capital shortfall. Not until the
absorption of municipal electricity distribution operations by TEK in
1982-1983 was this problem resolved.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVEtOPMENT
Organization of TEK
6.1      Subsequent to a reorganization study of TEK conducted by a foreign
electric power utility (hereafter referred to as "Consultant A") in 1971-73
under a 1967 IBRD Technical Assistance Grant, TEK was to "complete the
reorganization and staffing of its administration and cechnical structure in
accordance with a detailed implementation schedule acceptable to the Bank,"
submitting the implementation schedule by July 31, 1976. While the
recommendations of Consultant A had been approved by TEK's management in 1973,
an implementation schedule was never submitted to the Bank. Some of
Consultant A's recommendations have subsequently been implemented, however.
6.2      Many of the important issues highlighted by the diagnosis of
Consultant A continue to be relevant today. For example, TEK had been found
to be highly centralized. The General Manager, who has no deputy, is
responsible for carrying out numerous administrative tasks and for clearing
routine decisions, interfering with the more important responsibility of
directing overall company policy. Consultant A also concluded that there was
an inefficient allocation of responsibilities among the five departments of
TEK, which are each supervised by an Assistant General Manager. Thermal plant
construction continues to be managed separately from line and substation
construction, an obstacle to coordinating the timing of construction efforts
and to realizing economies of scale in the use of equipment and manpower.
Training is the responsibility of the System Operation and Maintenance
Department, where it is not regarded as a priority. Finally, the Board of
Directors of TEK does not include managers who should be directly involved in
setting company strategy. The Board has four members, including the General
manager, two individuals from outside TEK nominated by two related Ministries,
and only one of the five Assistant General Managers.
6.3      A major change was conceived for the System Operation and Maintenance
Department, which Consultant A recommended should be managed principally
through six regional offices, and coordinated only by a skeleton staff
conducting research and setting policy at headquarters. Both thermal and
hydro production of electricity as well as transmission facilities located in
a given geographic area would be under a common authority, to enable them to
share management and technical services, and to permit more effective use of
scarce specialists. These regional divisions would each include several
district operations units. TEK actually did set up regional offices based in
three cities (Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir) between 1979 and 1982, an experiment
which was partially successful, but which did not replace the strong
centralized control of operations. The regional offices were closed in the
light of other organizational changes following the transfer of urban
distribution to TEK in November, 1982. In two of these three cases, the
person who had been manager of the regional office has become the director of
the newly formed regional distribution enterprise.
6.4      In conclusion, while the study of TEK by Consultant A was thorough
and lengthy, including a detailed description of the proposed structure and
(



- 12 -
the tasks which would be undertaken by each division, it lacked analysis of
the steps necessary to arrive at the new structure, and failed to treat the
costs of the organizational and personnel changes recommended. It appears
that TEK management and staff were not adequately involved in drawing up the
recommendations, which of course diminished their commitment to carrying out
these changes. Furthermore, legal restrictions on State Economic Enterprises
(SEEs) constrained TEK management from implementing some of the Consultant's
proposals.
6.5      In the context of a program to introduce reforms to SEE's and Public
Economic Establishments in Turkey, Decree KHK/60 was approved by the Council
of Ministers on May 20, 1983. Since then, the Board has been reorganized so
that none of the Assistant General Managers sit on the Board 1/; this actually
moves the composition of the Board further away from that recommended by the
Consultant. Other implications of this Decree for TEK are not yet fully
known, but a new legislative ervironment may eventually result in TEK
management having more autonomy to determine its organizational structure.
Manpower Planning
6.6      As required under the Project, TEK also hired consultants in 1976 to
conduct a detailed manpower study. (Section 4.06 (ii) of the Loan Agreement)
Historical and future allocation of staff and personnel practices were
examined by the system sciences research institute of a domestic University,
(hereafter referred to as "Consultant B"), in a nine-volume report submitted
to TEK in September, 1977. Consultant B designed an "Integrated Manpower
Planning Information System," relating existing staff levels to physical
parameters. Observing that the given allocation of staff among departments
was not optimal, the consultants recommended training surplus personnel and
then shifting them to other departments. The study also treated other
measures to increase manpower effectiveness, including the development of a
performance evaluation and pay system, educational planning, and attempts to
identify the causes of low job satisfaction. Without considering budget
implications, Consultant B recommended wage increases which would raise TEK's
overall wage bill by 50%. Given the legal wage ceiling for employees of State
Economic Enterprises, the consultants recommended that TEK be placed under a
special personnel law outside the general SEE Personnel Law (No. 637). This
proposal may have had long-term merits, but it could not be immediately
implemented by TEK.
6.7      At the completion of the manpower study, TEK appointed a committee to
discuss its recommendations. However, TEK did not submit a staffing and
recruitment plan to the Bank on an annual basis, as had been agreed under the
Project.
6.8      The general approach of Consultant B is likely to have jeopardized
the relevance of the study to TEK. Using an academic orientation rather than
basing recommendations on practical experience in manpower planning, the
consultants were heavily biased towards quantitative methods and analysis
requiring extensive data collection and processing. For example, even in
discussing training requirements, the study stresses the need for a computer
tabulation of the evaluations collected after each course in order to monitor
1/ A subsequent decree of June 8, 1984 provides for two Assistant General
Managers sitting on the Board but the decree has not yet (September 1984)
been implemented.



- 13 -
the success of training. The study relied on mathematical models to analyze
the requirements, losses, supply and allocation of manpower at TEK. In order
for the "Integrated Manpower Planning Information System" to be of practical
use to TEK, several staff involved in personnel management at TEK would
require computer training. Of course. for the model's output to be
meaningful, the input data and future parameters would have to be continually
updated. Finally, the consultants failed to consider adverse budgetary
consequences of increasing wages and salaries without simultaneously reducing
the number of staff.
VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.1      As indicated in the Staff Appraisal Report, because the Project
formed an integral part of TEK's power supply and distribution development
program, benefits cannot be directly attributed to particular investments, but
instead should be compared to a timeslice of the investment program of TEK and
DSI in electric power. On this basis, using estimated tariffs as needed to
fulfill the financial covenants, it was calculated at appraisal that the
internal economic rate of return could be assessed at 16%, when benefits are
measured by incremental revenues attributable to the total investment in the
system operated by TEK and financial costs are adjusted for taxes and internal
transfers. The ex-post evaluation (see Annex 11) indicated that the internal
economic rate of return achieved was about 5%. However, this is not a measure
of the economic viability of the project but rather an indication of the
inadequate level of tariffs when compared with tariffs based on long-run
marginal cost pricing. Moreover, it is likely that the incremental revenues
understate grossly the benefits accrued to the users, in this case
particularly the improvement in the reliability of electricity supply. The
economic justification of the project must rest, therefore, upon the
unquantifiable benefits derived from the integration of the Turkish electric
power grid to permit bulk transfer of power from the main power stations to
the main consuming areas, and the optimum utilization of thermal and hydro
facilities according to their different operating regimes with resultant
savings in the cost of operation. As explained in para. 3.3, not all
facilities included in the project have been completed and for those in
operation insufficient time has elapsed since commissioning to determine the
full extent to which these benefits have been realized, but there is already
evidence that the quality of power supply throughout the grid has
significantly improved (see para. 4.3).
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
Achievement of Project Objectives
8.1      The Project's main objective was to assist the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) in the expansion of the national high voltage transmission
network through the construction and placing into operation of 380-kV lines
and 380/154-kV and 154/33-kV substations. This objective was largely
realized. Three sections of the 380-kV network, totalling 507 kilometers in



- 14 -
length, and nineteen 380/154-kV stations were financed by the loan, all but
seven of which had been commissioned by the end of 1983. Construction of the
other components originally included in the Project has also been completed,
although these components were ultimately financed by other sources.l/
8.2      The ambitious objectives of the Project for strengthening TEK's
financial position and staffing situation were only partially met.
Organizational and legal constraints on TEK as a State Economic Enterprise
made it difficult to introduce practices associated with private utilities
which could improve the efficiency of TEK's operations.
Bank Performance
8.3      The Project was included in the Bank's lending program on short
notice based on information already available in the Bank (para. 2.1). The
design of the Project was economically justified and generally technically
sound (with the exception of design problems mentioned in paras. 4.1-4.2). In
regard to sectoral and institutional issues, although agreement was reached
during negotiations between the Government, TEK and the Bank on an action
program to resolve these issues, progress in implementing the program was
limited in the deteriorating political situation and the fast-changing
institutional environment marked by growing staffing, financial and management
problems. In retrospect, it is clear that the Bank had unrealistic
expectations of the policy changes which were likely to occur both prior to
loan effectiveness and during project implementation.
8.4      The lesson to be learned for the Bank in this regard is that
institutional reform cannot be divorced from the political and economic
environmer-t in which the institution operates.
8.5      Another aspect of Bank performance which could have been strengthened
was project supervision. Between mid-1979 and mid-1982, there was no full
supervision mission specifically for the purpose of reviewing technical and
institutional progress under the subject project. The geographical dispersion
of project components impeded physical inspection by Bank missions. However,
parts of the Project and institutional aspects were supervised in the course
of missions for other power projects in Turkey.
Project Management
8.6      Another lesson to be learned from this Project is the extent to which
Project implementation suffered because the unit in TEK designated as
responsible for project management ceased functioning owing to staffing
problems. Several departments of TEK were responsible for certain stages of
the Project (e.g. Engineering, Procurement, Erection), but none of these was
ultimately held accountable by TEK management for the commissioning schedule
of Project components, or the overall success of the Project. The
administrative problems slowing Project implementation were emphasized in the
draft Project Completion Report prepared by TEK (Annex 12, para. 4).

8.7      In the light of the experience with project management for the Second
Transmission Project, it has been agreed under the Third Transmission Project
(Loan 2322-TUR) to establish a Project Management Unit, composed of TEK's
Assistant Director for Transmission Lines and a team of local and foreign
experts working with the newly formed consulting firm. While there
is not yet adequate experience to date to assess the advantages of this
approach to project management, it may to be a means to avoid the difficulties
encountered under the Second Transmission Project.
Financial Performance of TEK
8.8      TEK's financial performance during the implementation of the Second
Transmission Project indicated that adjustments in electricity rates which
maintained tariffs in real terms, but did not represent significant real
increases, proved insufficient to meet the substantial financial requirements
of the electric power sector. With real tariff increases averaging 1% per
annum over the period 1975 - 1981, TEK was not able to earn a satisfactory
rate of return on revalued assets; the rate of return achieved averaged about
3%. Fuel price increases alone surpassed changes in the wholesale price
index. During the same period TEK's investment program expanded rapidly, but
internal cash generation did not keep pace with the company's resource
requirements, resulting in an increasing reliance on Government equity
contributions.

TURKEY
LOAN J194-TU
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT II
PROJECT CONFLETION REPORT
Conclusion Section of Draft
Completion Report Prepared by TEK 1/
1. Introduction
This document consists of additional comments to TEK's Final Report
on Transmission Project II financed through IBRD Loan No. 1194-TU. Moreover,
some minor errors in the breakdown list of the above mentioned report have
been determined and a revised breakdown list as well as other essential tables
have been annexed.
2. Change in the Scope of Project
The scope of the project to be financed through IBRD Loan No. 1194-TU
was defined in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement. The construction and putting
into operation of 380/154 kV and 154/33 kV substations were foreseen in Parts
A(1) and AM2) respectively. 2/
Due to the delays in coming into force of the Loan Agreement and the
subsequent developments, the original scope of the project was modified. The
urgent need for the service of 154 kV substations necessitated the procurement
of equipment for three substations, before the Loan Agreement came into
force. Hence the 154-kV substations stated in Part A(2) have been excluded
altogether from the scope.
The part of the loan allocated to Part A(2) has been used to finance
various 380 kV substations additional to those covered in Part A(M) all of
which have prime importance in the overall Turkish Energy System. 3/
The tariff and manpower studies within the scope of Part D and Part E
of Schedule 2, respectively, have been partly realized. Once the present
conditions dictate a modified essence for these studies, they are foreseen to
be covered under TEK Transmission Project III.
1/ This note was sub itted by TEK, partly in July 1983 and partly in October
1983. It accompanied a report showing the physical implementation
schedule of each project component.
2/ Loan Agreement dated June 14, 1976, P. 13.

3. Delays
The major delays have resulted basically from two orders: namely EHV
series capacitors by ASEA under 103-ST/307 and EHV protection systems by BBC
under 109-ST/314C. Because these two orders cover engineering services as
well as equipment, the finalization of designs and procurement of equipment
have both been later than aimed. A more or less detailed account of t;he
above mentioned delays have been covered in TEK's Final Report.
4. Lessons to be Learned
The following comments, related with problems encountered in the
execution of the overall project, can be added to those already included in
TEK's Final Report.
(i) If IBRD and TEK purchasing departments ensure conformity in
certain periods about the actual disbursements, it will be
useful to keep track of the loan so as to prevent over
and/or under usage of the loan;
(ii) Tracing of the disbursements by TEK shall be facilitated if
the documents of disbursements are submitted directly to
TEK's Purchasing Department;
(iii) To ensure healthy operation and tracing of the loan, TEK
needs a reorganization within its own structure. TEK's
technical operations have suffered because of its inability
to employ and retain the service of experienced and
competent personnel, which in turn result in delays.  A
coordination must be established between the departments of
TEK that are related with the Project execution (e.g., TEK
needed extra time to check drawings, and then correction of
drawings was delayed.)
(iv) It will be useful for those departments of TEK engaged in
material procurement, to establish a team to pursue
material flow as well as related disbursemerts. TEK
Erection Department, responsible for withdrawal of Aaterial
from customs, must inform the relevant departments about
missing and/or defective units as soon as possible.



ANNEX 12
- 33 -                 Page 3 of 4
(v) On some occasions, suppliers send shipping documents long
before the material is ready for shipment, which in turn
results in early disbursements. This situation creates
problems in customs as well.
(vi) Delays resulting from variots reasons on suppliers' behalf
have adverse effects on the execution of the Project.
(vii) The existing regulations in the country, make it extremely
difficult for TEK's experts to participate in the technical
discussions during the finalization of the design and to
attend acceptance tests.
(viii)  When compared with other loans available to TEK, the IBRD
loan possesses outstanding advantages. The loan has
enabled TEK to have responsive bids and facilitates the
payment procedure, minimizing the problems that might have
otherwise arisen between TEK and its suppliers.
Cix) With respect to the utilization, the IBRD loan provides
important facilities to TEK when compared with other
loans. This in turn minimizes the problems between TEK and
its related suppliers especially from the viewpoint of
disbursements.
5. Breakdown List
The "Breakdown List" prepared by TEK and included in the Final Report
of June 1983 related with the IBRD Loan 1194-TU, has been revised.
As can be realized from an inspection of the above mentioned list,
the actual payment within the framework of the IBRD loan has come out to be
US$55,413,945.28. The same amount appears as US$55,413,951.56 in the
"Breakdown by W/A for Loan 1194-TU" of IBRD dated June 16, 1983. The
difference of US$6.38 between the two figures has been concluded to result
from round-off errors.
As already known, the difference of US$586,048.34 between the loan
amount of US$56,000,000 and the mentioned actual payment of IBRD constitutes
the undisbursed balance.
6. Additional Lessons to be Learned
- Difficulties encountered in site selection and expropriation for
the substations haire created various problems which in turn have
resulted in 1 to 2 years additional delays in the project
execution. A substantial reform seems to be essential in the
related procedures to expedite these activities.



ANNEX 12
34 -              Page 4 of 4
- Various difficulties evolve in stock keeping of the materials and
equipment procured locally and/or abroad. Sufficient storage
facilities, in terms of appropriate location and number, are not
available. An improved and computerized stock control mechanism
as well as accounting system should be established.
- At the initial stage of the loan agreement, TEK used contractors
for civil works, tower supply and erection of the transmission
lines since their magnitude made it desirable. Meanwhile, the
substation installations of this project were mainly executed by
TEK staff, i.e., TEK Erection Department, the performance of which
was satisfactory then. Gradually, however, the services of
competent and experienced personnel could not _e retained due to
various reasons, which in turn resulted in further delays.
As such additional delays could not be tolerated due to the urgent
need for the servicing of the substations; TEK decided to contract the
substation erection works to private contractors.
