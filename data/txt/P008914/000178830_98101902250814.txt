REPORT AiND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY
FOR A SECOND TRANSMISSION PROJECT
WITH GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) with guarantee of the Republic of
Turkey for the equivalent of US$56 million, to help finance transmission
facilities and training needs required to meet TEK's system growth. The loan
would have a term of 20 years including 4 years of grace, with interest rate
at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic updating mission visited Turkey in November 1974 and
its report (No. 71la-TU) entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Turkey" dated June 9, 1975, was circulated to the Executive Directors on
June 17, 1975. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Overall, Turkey's economic performance continues to demonstrate the
essential soundness of the economy, despite an uncertain domestic political
situation resulting in frequent changes of Government since 1971 and more
recently, the international recession. GNP grew rapidly in the last decade,
and averaged an impressive 7 percent annual growth in real terms in the period
1962-72. Industry, power, transport and construction were the main contributing
sectors to this growth rate. The growth rate dropped in 1973 to 5.5 percent,
largely due to a decrease in agricultural production reflecting poor weather
conditions, but is estimated to have recovered to 7.5 percent in 1974. How-
ever, growth during the last two years fell short of the Third Plan (1973-78)
target of 7.6 percent per annum. Despite some difficult problems that the
economy faces, this relatively high growth rate underlines the robustness and
vitality of the Turkish economy. The main issues facing the Government and
requiring the establishment of priorities as well as the taking of corrective
measures are: (a) high rate of inflation; (b) insufficient mobilization of
public resources; (c) employment generation problems; (d) deterioration in
the balance of payments; and (e) inadequacy of coordination among Government
agencies in project implementation (discussed in para 15 below).
4.        The budgetary situation in the last decade was dominated by the
relatively rapid growth of public expenditures. Although tax revenues also
grew rapidly, the increase was more than offset by the rise in Government
expenditures and transfers. As a result, the overall budget deficit widened
and the Treasury borrowed increasingly from the Central Bank. In 1972 and
1973, the Treasury introduced a stricter control of current expenditures and
succeeded to some degree in shifting the sources of finance for the budget



deficit, from the Central Bank to the sale of Government bonds to the public.
However, partly due to a shortfall in tax revenues and partly due to increased
current expenditures resulting from inflation and the Cyprus operations, the
budget deficit rose again in 1974 to TL 7.3 billion (compared to TL 5.4 bil-
lion in 1973). Central Bank financing of the Treasury rose by TL 4 billion
and became a major factor in monetary expansion at a time when stricter mone-
tary controls were needed. The 1975 budget estimates a deficit of nearly
TL 9 billion, which is intenced to be financed by domestic borrowing through
sale of Government bonds.
5.        Over the years, the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs) have generally
earned low profits, necessitating increasing budgetary transfers from public
resources to meet their operating and investment needs. A significant portion
of the SEEs' deficits are accounted for by the Turkish Railways and the Coal
Corporation. Other SEEs have shown either small profits or small losses.
During 1974 prices of several SEE products were raised substantially (ranging
from 20% to 167%) to improve the financial situation. of the SEEs concerned.
In addition, railway tariffs were increased by an average of 56 percent in
1975. The savings performance of the SEEs showed some improvement in 1973
and 1974 and their own resources financed an increased proportion of their
investment. However, because of delays in implementation of projects as a
result of management problems, limited technical capabilities and difficulties
in the procurement of imported materials, SEE investment levels and revenues
are still below the targets set by the Third Plan. Many SEEs continue to rely
heavily on budgetary transfers. The reform of the SEEs - in organization,
management, executive and labor skills and pricing policies - remains crucial,
especially if Turkish industry is to be prepared for competition from the EEC.
Realistically, these basic reforms can only be initiated by a Government with
significant parliamentary support, which Turkey has not had over the last
few years.
6.        The rate of domestic inflation has been high in recent years.
The average rate of increase in wholesale prices accelerated froml about 20
percent per annum between 1972-73 to nearly 30 percent in 1974. Inflationary
pressures have been partly fueled by growth in domestic liquidity, which
averaged about 25 percent per year during 1970-74. Other contributing fac-
tors are increases in agricultural support prices for domestic and export
goods as well as in minimum wages, besides substantial increases in the inter-
national price level of most Turkish imports. Measures to reduce the growth
of domestic liquidity, without discouraging investment and growth, are es-
sential to ease inflationary pressures further. The trend towards rapid in-
creases in central bank financing of the public sector needs to be reexamined.
In late 1974, the Government raised interest rates to encourage private savings
and long-term lending. The increase included raising the interest rate on
medium term credit from 12 to 14 percent and rates on time deposits up to one
year from 4 to 6 percent. The present Government of Prime Minister Demirel
regards the restoration of domestic price stability to be one of the key
problems on which Government policy must be focused. Some reduction in the
rate of inflation has been witnessed in the last few months, and for 1975 as
a wnole, the Government estimates a rate of inflation to be around 15 percent.



-3-
7.        Turkey's development strategy places greater emphasis on growth
of output through higher labor productivity, than on increased employment.
As a result, the labor surplus, including that in agriculture, rose from an
estimated 1 million in 1962 to 1.6 million in 1973, or about 10 percent of
the labor force. Emigration, especially to Germany, has so far partially
eased the pressure on employment. Between 1965 and 1973, net emigration to-
taled about 450,000 and was expected to be about 60,000 per year during the
Third Plan period. However, new emigration fell sharply during 1974 due to
the economic slowdown in Europe. The Third Plan continues to emphasize in-
vestment in capital-intensive industries, thus projecting a growth in non-
agricultural labor surplus of 300,000 by 1977. With the reduced prospect of
further emigration of Turkish labor to Europe, at least in the medium-term,
unemplovment should be a major concern of economic policy. Speedy imple-
mentation of land reform and rural development programs would help to dampen
migration from rural to urban areas and ease unemployment in both sectors.
In addition, labor intensive production methods need to be emphasized, where
appropriate, in the formulation of projects. However, even with these meas-
ures and faster growth than planned in construction and services, unemploy-
ment is likely to remain a significant problem.
8.        The Third Plan constitutes the first phase of Turkey's long-term
strategy for the period 1973-95, the ultimate objective of which is to raise
standards of living in 1995 to those of Italy in 1970, through rapid indus-
tralization and decreasing dependence on external resources. The Plan aims
at annual growth rates of 8 percent in GDP, 12.7 percent in fixed investment,
a marginal national savings ratio of 38 percent (compared with about 18 per-
cent in the Second Plan), an annual increase in commodity imports and exports
of 9.4 percent and 7.1 percent respectively and an increase in invisible
earnings (mainly workers' remittances) leading to a decline in gross inflows
of official external assistance to $130 million in 1977 (compared with over
$300 million in 1972).
9.        The prospects for continued high economic growth remain good, al-
though in view of the shortfall of the first two years of the Third Plan,
achievement of the 8 percent average rate of annual growth during the Plan
period seems unlikely. The Plan's projections also seem to be overly optimis-
tic about the prospects of raising the savings level and balancing the ex-
ternal accounts with reduced levels of external assistance. Experience during
the last two years suggests that present efforts to mobilize greater domestic
savings to support a rapid growth of investment, especially in the public
sector, need to be intensified. The Plan anticipates that two-thirds of the
increase in national savings will come from the public sector, through increases
both in surpluses of the SEEs and in tax revenue. Given the past performance
of SEEs and delays in implementing a general reform, mentioned in paragraph 5
above, the expected rapid growth in their surpluses is unlikely to be realized.
It will also be difficult to raise tax revenues to the extent envisaged by the
Plan. There is nevertheless scope for increases, if appropriate policies are
pursued more vigorously, e.g. improving the tax administration, widening the
tax coverage to include agricultural incomes and service incomes, increasing



-4-
the rates of property taxation, and introducing a value added tax. Domestic
resource mobilization in the public sector is, in any case, likely to con-
tinue to be a constraint in the growth of public investment. Besides improved
financial performance from the SEEs, increased borrowing abroad as well as
increased long-term borrowing from the domestic private sector will be neces-
sary to achieve the ambitiously planned public sector investment targets. As
Turkey's development program requires funds in excess of the savings that can
be raised domr,estically, and these cannot be provided in adequate amounts by
financing only the foreign exchange costs of high priority development pro-
Jects, some local expenditure financing by foreign lenders will be required.
10.       In addition, the balance of payments projections of the PlAn have
not taken into account recent developments on the international scene. The
sharp increase in the price of petroleum and other imports during 1974, and
the prospect of further increases in the next several years, mean that the
foreign exchange needs for f:inancing imports will be much higher than pro-
jected.  Commodity imports and exports in 1973 were already above the level
projected for 1977. At the same time, workers' remittances in 1972 were
higher than the 1977 target and continued to grow until recently. However,
they have slowed down appreciably in the first half of 1975 and their future
is uncertain, due to the temporary restrictions on further entry of foreign
workers into the major labor--importing countries of Europe. On the other
hand, recent agreements between Turkey and Libya to send Turkish workers to
Libya, and the possibilities of similar arrangements with other oil-producing
countries, should alleviate the situation until the pace of economic activ-
ity accelerates in Europe.
11.       The 1970 devaluation, together with associated stabilization meas-
ures, rising world demand and prices and a rapid rise in workers' remittances
(from $140 million- in 1969 tc $740 million in 1972) helped to improve Turkey's
balance of payments considerably in 1971 and 1972. This improvement continued
in 1973 with an inflow of $1.2 billion in workers' remittances, and with
exports increasing by 49 percent and imports by only 34 percent. The overalL
result was a surplus in the current account for 1973 and an increase in gross
reserves of about $720 million over the level at the end of 1972.
12.       After substantial surpluses in 1972 and 1973, the overall balance
of payments experienced a deficit in 1974, with net reserves declining by
about $360 million. This was due partly to sharp increases in the trade
deficit and a slow-down inI the growth of workers' remittances, besides rec--
tion in the official capital aid inflows. The large trade deficit resulted
mainly from the 80 percent increase in the import bill (in particular, pecro-
leum, wheat, iron and steel), mainly attributable to higher import prices.
The relatively high growth rate of imports continued in 1975, with imports
totalling about $2.4 billion dluring the first six months of the year.  Export
earnir.gs on the other hand, which totalled about $0.6 billion for the same
period, registered a decline, because of the recession in major importing
countries, agricultural supply constraints, restrictions on exports to relieve
domestic shortages, diversion of some goods to Cyprus, and the worsenirng _erms
of trade. Export pricing policy was not flexible enough, particularly for



-5-
cotton, whose export volumes fell sharply as the Government's minimum export
price remained fixed while international prices fell well below it. As a
result, gross reserves, which stood at over $2.1 billion in August 1974 de-
clined to about S1.8 billion at the end of the year and further to about $1.2
billion at end of June 1975 (the equivalent of about 3 months of imports at
the present rate). The pressure on the balance of payments could be partly
eased by promoting export recovery through the lifting of export restrictions.
Besides this, a slowing down of the rate of import liberalization is clearly
essential to prevent a further erosion of reserves. The Government should
also avoid fixing support prices at high levels, when there is softening of
commodity prices in international markets. In May 1974, the Turkish lira was
revalued vis-a-vis the dollar from TL 14.00 per US$ to TL 13.50 per US$, with-
out a change in parity with other currencies. In September 1974, the exchange
rate per US$ was readjusted to TL 13.85, and in April 1975, it was restored
to the previous parity of TL 14.00. As a result of subsequent small devalua-
tions, the rate per US$ stood at TL 14.75 at the end of August 1975.
13.       At the end of 1974, total external debt outstanding and disbursed was
estimated at $3.1 billion, of which all but 3 percent is public or publicly
guaranteed. The share of the Bank Group was about 11 percent of total debt
outstanding and about 8 percent of total debt service in 1974. The average
terms of new credits made available to Turkey, have been hardening in recent
years. This trend is expected to continue. Debt service as a ratio of exports
of goods and non-factor services plus workers' remittances was about 6.5 per-
cent in 1974 compared to 12 percent in 1971. Despite the deterioration in
the balance of payments in 1975, the debt service ratio is expected to remain
within manageable limits in the medium term, provided that proper policies
are pursued. In view of the decline in foreign reserves, Turkey needs to
continue to exercise considerable care in its external debt management, and
resort to suppliers' credit financing should be kept within closely monitored
limits. Meanwhile, Turkey continues to be creditworthy for Bank financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
14.       The 1970 economic stabilization program (see para 11 above) and
devaluation of the Turkish lira, which improved the balance of payments, en-
abled Bank Group lending, which had previously been intermittent, to be es-
tablished on a continuing basis at a high level. Inclusive of the proposed
lo^l, the Bank Group will have lent $1,140.8 million to Turkey through 42
lending operations, of which $1,008.2 million is outstanding. Thirteen of
these operations have been in agriculture and rural development (including
multipurpose), fifteen in industry (including DFCs), nine in power and the
rest in urban development, transportation, and education. Agriculture and
rural development account for 25 percent of the funds lent, industry and DFCs
for 38 percent and power for about 30 percent. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of September 30,
1975, with notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



15.       Implementation of projects has been satisfactory in the private
sector, but less so in the public sector, where significant delays have
resulted from political uncertainties, limited coordination among agencies,
staffing problems and related administrative delays. Disbursements have
consequently been slower than expected. To improve this situation, the Gov-
ernment has recently established a ministerial coordinating committee' sup-
ported by a new secretariat located in the Ministry of Finance, which will
be responsible for coordinating all aspects of Bank Group operations. In
connection with this new framework, the Government and the Bank have initiated
since June 1975, joint quarterly reviews of projects to identify and resolve
key bottlenecks impeding satisfactory project implementation. The results so
far have been encouraging considering that these reviews were initiated quite
recently, and the rate of coonmitments and disbursements in the last few months
has begun to improve.
16.       Bank lending to Turkey is mainly directed at supporting Turkish
efforts to improve: (a) lagging public sector saving, through gradual improve-
ment and reform in the SEEs; (b) better income distribution and improvement
in the level of living standards, through rural development efforts, better
urban planning and increased employment and incomes, and (c) long-term capacity
to earn foreign exchange, through promotion of industrial and agroindustrial
exports and tourism. While the Bank continues to support gradual institu-
tional and structural changes in the sectors in which lending is provided,
continuation of substantial external financial assistance, is equally important
in view of the increase in the projected capital import requirements.
17.       In support of these objectives, it is proposed to continue to devote
the Bank's development efforts to certain key sectors, of which agriculture
is the most important. In this sector, emphasis is being put on rural devel-
opment and the strengthening of agricultural credit mechanisms. Industry
(including mining and DFCs) and power, where the gradual strengthening of the
SEEs is the key task, will also receive significant support. This program
will be supplemented by future projects in selected sectors including urban
development, tourism and transport. Until recently, Bank lending was also
focused in two geographical areas: (i) the Istanbul region, with emphasis on
urban planning, water supply, power distribution and industrial finance, and
(ii) the Cukurova region around Adana on the southern coast, with emphasis
on power, irrigation, and fruit and vegetable production.    Now the focus is
gradually being shifted to the Anatolian plateau and eastern Turkey in support
of efforts to widen the geographical base of development, develop rainfed
agriculture, improve the distribution of income, and discourage rapid urban
migration. For instance, the $143 million Elbistan loan approved in FY74 was
for the development of a lignite mine and lignite-fired power station in eastern
Turkey; the $65 million loan to the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey
(TSKB) in FY75 was to help finance small and medium-scale private industrial
enterprises, in less developecl Turkish regions and away from the over developed
Istanbul-Izmit industrial axis; the $75 million loan for the Corum-Cankiri



integrated rural development project, also provided in FY75, is the Bank's
first such project in Turkey and will benefit two of its poorer provinces in
the north-central Anatolian dry land farming region.
18.       In addition to the proposed loan for the Second Transmission Project
of TEK (hereinafter called the TEK II Transmission Project), an agricultural/
agroindustrial credit project has been appraised and is scheduled for negotia-
tions by the end of December 1975; the appraisal of a second dairy project
has just been completed and a newsprint manufacturing project and the Bank's
first tourism project providing infrastructure in the south Antalya coastal
area, are currently being appraised. These projects are likely to be ready for
Board consideration in the second half of FY76. Other projects under prepara-
tion which will be processed towards appraisal in the next twelve-month period,
include a hvdroelectric project, wastewater disposal in Istanbul, a second DFC.
operation with the State Investment Bank (DYB), and a second railways project.
19.       IFC has invested in the production of nylon yarns, pulp and paper,
glass, aluminum and steel pipes. As of September 30, 1975, gross commitments
totaled S118.11 million, of which $71.5 million were still held by IFC. IFC
is currently investigating investment opportunities in the industrial sector,
including textiles, synthetic fibers and inorganic chemicals.
PART III - POWER SUB-SECTOR AND THE BORROWER
Available Resources
20.       Imported oil, domestic firewood and dung currently meet, in about
equal proportions, some two-thirds of Turkey's energy needs. Energy develop-
ment strategy is to reduce dependence on these high cost sources. The prin-
cipal domestic alternatives for producing electric power, in descending order
of known potential, are low-calorific lignite, low-calorific coal, hydro power,
and oil, plus reserves of geothermal energy which have not been extensively
explored. At present, the development of lignite, coal and water as energy
sources are receiving emphasis.
Institutions
21.       Under the general authority of the Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources, responsibility for electricity generation and distribution is
divided between: (a) TEK, an SEE formed in 1970 with primary responsibility
for overall electrical energy planning and construction and operation of
thermal plants and transmission lines; (b) the State Hydraulic Works (DSI),
a semi-autonomous agency, with responsibility for the planning of hydropower
development and for construction in coordination with TEK, which assumes
ownership once construction is completed; and (c) various private utility
companies, who are authorized to generate and distribute power in specified
areas, the most important being the Cukurova Electric Company in the Adana
region. Power distribution is normally in the hands of municipal authorities.



Capacity and Demand
22.       Turkey's installed public generating capacity at the end of 1973
totalled nearly 2,500 megawatts. Of this, 84 percent was owned by TEK and
12 percent by Cukurova. TEK's interconnected power generation and transmis-
sion system, which meets 90 percent of the demand in western and central
Turkey, is based about one-tLird eac'n 3n hydropower, oil-fired and coal-fired
the rmal plants.  Tne an;nual grow';h -te OL- derand for electrical energy was
about 12 percent between ,960 and 1972 but fell to about 10 percent in 1973
and 1974 due to the shortage of powle:. I-t is, however, expected to increase
to about 17 percent until around 1976, and thereafter to decrease gradually
to 10 percent by the miad 980s. A program of village electrification was
begun in 1964, providing service to about 200 villages in the first year, and
increasing to about 900 villages per year by 1973. About 5,800 out of 36,000
villages had been electrified by late 1974 and further progress at a rate oL
1,500 villages per year is planned.
23.       A shortfall in electricity generation capacity emerged in 1973,
which, together with plant failures, forced TEK into load shedding and inter-
rupting supply. To eliminate this growing shortfall and to meet projected
demand as earlY as possible, the Government has undertaken major power invest--
ments, mainly for hydro and lignite generation, to increase installed capacity
to 4,300 megawatts by 1977 and to about 8,600 megawatts by 1981. Major proj-
ects intended to meet this demand are: Elbistan lignite (1,200 megawatts
under construction with Bank assistance), Keban Hydropower (900 megawatts
partly commissioned), Tuncbilek lignite (300 megawatts to be commissioned in
1975 and 1977), and Karakaya hydropower (1,800 megawatts whose construction
is expected to begin next year).
Coordination
24.       The principal institutional constraints in the power sub-sector lie
in coordination, organization, management, staffing, pricing policies, and
revenue collection. Although under its enabling legislation TEK has the
responsibility for coordination, significant improvements in coordination
of planning and resource allocation among the various agencies concerned with
power have not occurred. For example, while the general policy of reducing
dependence on imported oil is undoubtedly the right course for Turkey, the
economic cost of industrial production which is being sacrificed because of
the shortage of electricity, may argue for some flexibility in considering the
limited installation of newq oil-fired capacity. Some agencies have main-
tained a fairly independent role; for example, hydropower development appears
to have been handicapped by insufficient coordination between DSI and TEK on
the planning and design of generating facilities.   Similarly, improved co-
ordination is needed between TEK and the Coal Authority (TKI), in the planning
of coal and lignite mining development and related power generation. The
Government is, however, aware of the need to improve coordinatior. and take
corrective measures on these matters.



-9-
TEK's Organizational Structure
25.       TEK's organizational structure has been essentially that of its
principal predecessor organization, the Power group of ETIBANK, and has not
been suited to TEK's current needs. Pursuant to the proposals which led to
the creation of TEK in 1970, recommendations for a reorganization were formu-
lated in March 1973 by consultants financed under the Bank's 1967 technical
assistance grant of $1.95 million. These recommendations aimed primarily at
decentralization of authority for operations to regional offices, as well as
the reorganizing of management responsibilities at headquarters. Earlier this
year, TEK's Board approved a reorganization plan, generally along the lines
of the consultants' recommendations. The first phase of this reorganization,
namely the realignment of the headquarters establishment with a more efficient
breakdown of functional responsibilities, is being initiated. Plans for proto-
type regional offices have been formulated, and it is TEK's intention to create
the first of the projected 10-12 regional offices on a pilot basis by the
end of 1975. Based on the initial experience obtained, the specific design
and timing of subsequent regional offices would be determined. Under the
Loan Agreement (Section 4.06), TEK has undertaken to complete the reorganiza-
tion and staffing of its administrative and technical structure in accordance
with a detailed implementation schedule which would be prepared and sent to
the Bank by the end of this year. The Bank also expects to receive, by the
same time, the corporate instruments providing for the establishment of new
headquarters divisions and two new regional offices together with their respon-
sibilities and appropriate delegation of authority.
Management and Staffing of TEK
26.       Since its establishment five years ago, TEK has experienced a con-
tinuing need to improve its management and professional staff, and in particu-
lar its engineering cadre. Its responsibilities and workload in power plan-
ning, project implementation and operation of its plants have grown geometrical-
ly in this period. There has been considerable concern whether TEK's ability
to attract and retain staff, especially experienced engineers with senior and
middle level management capabilities, has kept pace. Two aspects of this
problem appear crucial. First, because of the relatively low salaries and
benefits offered to SEE emplovees, under the Turkish civil service system, and
which were being eroded by inflation, together with the considerably higher
emolument packages offered to engineers in the private sector, TEK experienced
some difficulty in the early 1970's in holding and replacing experienced staff.
However, in 1974 and 1975, major increases in salaries and benefits were ap-
proved by the Government. These have contributed to some easing of problems
in recruiting and retaining at least the lower and middle level professional
staff. At higher levels, the concern persists even though opportunities for
alternative employment in Turkey of power specialists is more limited. TEK
has, for example, recently taken steps to hire senior personnel on a contract
basis in order to staff the Elbistan project, as provided for under the Loan
Agreement. On balance, TEK believes and has confirmed to the Bank, that the
emolument package (including intangibles) which it is now able to offer, will
enable it to meet its staffing needs adequately at least through the end of
1976.



- *0 -
27.       The second and equally cruciai aspect of TEK's staffing problem is
that its manpower planning and personnel management techniques have been
unable to provide TEK's management with reliable estimates of the true magni-
tude and composition of its staffing needs in the period ahead.    To deal with
this aspect of its staffing problem, TEK has agreed (Sections 3.02 and 4.06
of the Loan Agreement) to complete, with the assistance of experts, a detailed
meditum and long-term manpower studv of its annual professional staff require-
ments for the five-year period 1977-81, and to implement a program of staffing
and recruitment each year, based on the recormmendations of the study, as up-
dated from time ro time.
Rate of Return and Tariffs
28.       The pricing of electric power in Turkey has long been affected by
twTo interrelated difficulties: first, the level of tariffs has often been
inadequate to enable TEK to cover its production costs and at the same time to
make a reasonable contribution to the cost of its continuing investment pro-
gram; and second, the structure of tariffs, which is unrelated to the cost of
supply, as well as their low level, has led to the inefficient use of electric
energy. Under the provisions of the TEK Law, that SEE is required to earn an
8 percent return on net fixed assets. The requiremenit of an 8 percent return,
on periodically revalued assets, is also contained in past Bank loan agreements
with TEK. However, in view of the persistence of inflation in the last few
years, recent governments have been reluctant to raise TEK's tariffs suffi-
ciently to keep pace with general price increases. As a result, TEK has con-
sistently fallen short of the 8 percent rate of return target. TEK's revenues
have been increased periodically, however, to meet increased fuel costs through
fuel adjustment provisions which form part of the tariff structure. In con-
nection with the aforementioned Elbistan Loan, a previous government undertook,
as a condition of effectiveness, to increase TEK's tariffs to a level which
would yield an average net revenue of TI 0.51 per kwh, as a first step toward
achieving a rate of return of 8 percent by 1976. Taking into account the
present Government's current anti-inflationary policies, particularly after
the rather high inflation experienced in Turkey in 1974, the Bank accepted its
proposal to defer the achievement of the rate of return target until 1977.
This was done on the understanding, as incorporated in a letter from the Gov-
ernment to the Bank, that the Government and TEK will take such measures as
are necessary, including waiving of the 15 percent discount for prompt payment,
to achieve a rate of return of 6 percent in 1976 and 8 percent from 1977 on-
wards on its assets, as revalued from time to time. In addition, the Government
irtends to introduce a self--adjusting mechanism into its electricity tariff
review procedures to facililate tariff adjustments commencing in 1977. With
these steps all the conditions of effectiveness of the Elbistan Loan have
now been fulfilled with the excention of certain conditions of disbursement
of the loans of the co-lenders, EIB and KfW, which are expected to be met
shortly.  Meanwhile, procurement arrangements are going forward.
29.       It is worth mentioning that as envisaged under previous loan agree-
ments, TEK revalued its assets as of tihe end of 1974.   Under the proposed Loan,
TEK would continue to revalue its assets as rneeded periodically in the future
(Section 5.06 of th.e Loan Agreement).  To provide a basis for rationalizing the
structure of tariffs and improving electricity pricing policies, TEK has also



agreed to undertake a nationwide tariff study of the electric power sector,
with the help of qualified experts (Section 3.03 of the Loan Agreement).
Under the Guarantee Agreement (Section 3.02), the Government has not only
agreed to assist TEK in carrying out this study, but after exchanging views
with the Bank on its recommendations, to prepare measures for revised power
tariff systems.
Arrears Owed by Municipalities
30.       TEK has been experiencing significant difficulty in collecting
receivables from its customers, especially municipalities to whom it sells
electricity in bulk. This has happened despite a 15 percent discount for
payment within one month and a penalty of 1 percent per month for payments
thereafter. In 1971-73, the end-of-year arrears averaged around four months'
revenues. In connection with the Elbistan Loan, TEK and the Government in-
formed the Bank of their intention to monitor the collection of receivables
and ensure prompt collection. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated
rapidly thereafter, and by the end of 1974, receivables totalled over TL 2.0
billion, or about six months of revenues of TEK. Of this, nearly TL 400 mil-
lion was owed by the Ankara Municipality alone. Faced with this situation,
TEK in turn, has been forced to defer some of its own payments for several
months to suppliers and other creditors. At the end of 1974, such overdue
payments totalled nearly TL 1 billion. A key source of the problem is that
municipalities have only limited access for their own purposes to the
revenues collected in their areas of jurisdiction, and have to depend on the
Government for much of their financing. Therefore they seek to retain for as
long as possible, revenues they may have collected from sale of utilities such
as power, by not paying a bulk supplier like TEK.
31.       In the absence of available long-term solutions, the Government
proposed legislation providing for consolidation and pavment of intra-public
sector debts outstanding as of December 31, 1974. This legislation was
approved by the Parliament in July this year, with one critical amendment
which provided for the consolidation of TEK's receivables and debts only up
to December 31, 1973. While the implementation of this law will eliminate
some of TFK's receivables and debts, it still leaves a significant problem.
In view of this limited legislative action, the Government has agreed (Guar-
antee Agreement Section 3.03) that it will cause each of its agencies and
municipalities to pay debts outstanding to TEK in excess of three months in
accordance with a plan of action acceptable to the Bank and the Borrower.
As one measure aimed at prevention of recurring arrears, the Government also
undertakes under the Guarantee Agreement (Section 3.04) to ensure that muni-
cipal tariffs for the sale or distribution of power are promptly adjusted in
a manner and in amounts commensurate with adjustments TEK may make from time
to time in its tariffs, which are largely wholesale prices on power delivered
to such other distributors.



Past Bank Loans to TEK
32.       In 1968, the Bank provided a $25 million loan to Turkey for relend-
ing to TEK's predecessor, ETIBANK, for the construction of transmission lines
and substations related to the Keban HIvdro-electric Project. Although the
Transmission line Project was delayed by nearly two years because of contrac-
tors' problems, arising from disputes primarily over compensation for cost
increases, it was completed in August 1974 by force account and provided much
experience to TFK staff in the construction of high voltage transmission lines.
In 1971, the Bank made a $24 million loan to TEK for expanding TEK's transmis-
sion system.  This project is now expected to be completed by the end of 1975.
In 1974, the Bank approved a $148 million loan to TEK and TKI (The Coal
Authority) for the Elbistan Project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
33.       The proposed project originated last year, following an exchange
of views between the Turkish authorities and the Bank and the mutual apprecia-
tion that the high cost of the Elbistan Project was placing a great strain on
the availability of foreign. exchange for other needs of the power sub-sector.
Transmission projects, in particular, were feeling the pinch, in part as a
result of a shift of some anticipated financing to Elbistan. The proposed
project was, therefore, formulated as a group of items from TEK's total trans-
mission program for 1975-79. Appraisal took place in October/November 1974.
Negotiations were held in Washington in May/June 1975. The Governmrent was
represented by Mr. Cengiz Alper, Deputy Financial and Economic Counselor in
the Turkish Embassy in Washington, and TEK, by Mr. Huseyin Tekinel, its As-
sistant General Manager. However, these negotiations could not be substantive-
ly completed until the above-mentioned legislation with regard to TEK's
receivables and debts was passed and the agreements already discussed were
reached on the critical issues relating to staffing and tariffs. These out-
standing matters were settled to mutual satisfaction and agreement reached
on the negotiated documents in early October.
The Project
3-'.      The proposed project includes:
(a)  the construction and placing into operation of 380/154
kV and 154/33 kV substations having aggregate capacities
of about 3,200 MVA, and 755 km of related transmission
lines in various parts of Turkey, including the link
between Elbistan and Keban and a second crossing of the
Bosporus;
(b) the training of TEK engineers in transmission system design
and operation;



- 13 -
(c) a nationwide power tariff study as well as a study
of TEK's medium and long-term professional personnel
staffing needs for the period 1977-81; and
(d)  project engineering and related studies.
The proposed project is more amply detailed in the Loan and Project Summary
provided in Annex III. An appraisal report (679-TU) dated November 4, 1975,
and entitled "Appraisal of TEK Transmission Project II , is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors.
35.       The effect of the Project on the environment is small.   However,
the proposed loan provides for an undertaking by TEK to carry out the project
w;ith due regard to ecological and environmental factors (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.07).
Project Cost and Financing
36.       The estimated cost of the proposed project, excluding interest
during construction, is about US8146 million, of which US$76 million would be
in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$56 million, will finance
the foreign costs of (i) equipment and materials for substations and their
installation, (ii) insulators, hardware and conductors for transmission lines,
(iii) training and training equipment, and (iv) consulting services for the
design and construction of the project. The remaining foreign exchange cost
of the transmission lines, some US$20 million including contingencies, as well
as the entire local cost of the project, totalling another US$70 million
equivalent, will be financed by the Borrower under its investment program.
Project Implementation
37.       TEK plans to contract the larger civil works, transmission tower
procurement and erection. However, the bulk of the project will be done by
force account. The construction schedule is phased over four years. TEK will
employ a firm of engineering consultants to assist in the preparation of
designs, plans, and specifications for the construction of the 380/154 kV
substations and to help supervise construction. (Loan Agreement, Section
3.02). Experts and specialists will be also employed by TEK to assist in
carrying out the studies referred to in paragraph 34 above. (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.02). While by and large, TEK has the capacity to implement and
operate the project, there is still a need to train additional engineers for
the design and operation of TEK's growing transmission system. TEK will
define a mutually acceptable training program by April 30, 1976 (Section
3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement) and implement it thereafter. The Project is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1979.

Procurement and Disbursement:
38.      - All contracts to be financed from the proposed loan (except for
consulting services) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Disbursements
would he made against the CIlF cost of imported equipment and materials and the
foreign cost of services. Although local manufacturers are not expected to
participate in contracts financed by the loan, in the event they do develop
this capacity and compete successfully, disbursements would be made for the
ex-factory costs of goods sc, supplied, and such suppliers would be granted
the usual 15 percent preference. Disbursements are expected to begin in the
second half of fiscal year 1976 and the loan should be fully disbursed by the
end of FY80.
Financial Position
39.       TEK's current financial position is weak due largely to the low rate
of return and collection problems discussed above in paragraphs 28 - 31. Al-
though the debt position is satisfactory, the cash position is poor as indi-
cated by a current ratio of 0.8 estimated for 1975. Although the current ratio
is projected to remain at or below 1:1 during the period 1976-81, reflecting a
tight working capital position, the overall financial situation is expected to
improve as a result of the measures agreed in connection with the proposed Loan
(also described in paragraphs 28 - 31), such that TEK will be able to self-
finance about 33 percent of its investment program covering the construction
period of the project.
Economic Justification
40.       Over the life of the proposed project, TEK has planned new generating
capacity, including Elbistan, in excess of 2,500 MW to meet the forecast in-
crease in demand for electrical energy. In the appraisal of the Elbistan proj-
ect, the system development program to 1987 was assessed as being the least-
cost solution relative to reasonable alternatives. Planning of the transmis-
sion element of this program, of which the Project is an important part, has
been done by TEK as part of their ongoing planning process, using mathematical
models to assure technical and economic optimization. The transmission program
is essential to balance the major investments being made in generating capa-
city (e.g. Keban and Elbistan). Economic benefits cannot be attributed directly
to the Project, so no rate of return can be calculated. However, the internal
raLa of return for TEK's total development plan has been calculated to be at
least 16 percent if benefits are measured by incremental revenues attributable
to the total investment in the system operated by TEK and financial costs are
adjusted for taxes and internal transfers. It is likely that the incremental
revenues understate the benefits, some of which will arise from improving the
reliability of electricity supply.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AIJTIORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Borrower and the Bank, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Features
of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 25-39 of this Report.    In
other respects, the draft loan documents conform to the normal pattern for
loans for power projects.
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements.

A.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 587/143 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project: US$12 million
Loan and US$12 million Credit of February 20, 1969. Closing Date:
December 31, 1977.
Work on Stage II of the Seyhan Irrigation Project is being performed
in a satisfactory manner, and the project is expected to be completed by the
end of 1977. As regards the training component, an integrated training pro-
gram for TOPRAKSU, the Agriculture Extension Service and DSI is now under
preparation by the Government. The Government is also preparing recommenda--
tions for implementation of proposals contained in water charges study.
Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$4.5 million credit of February 22,
1971. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is now virtually fully staffed, and satisfactory pro-
gress is being made. Contracts for the two consultants to the project have
been extended and measures are being taken by the Agriculture Bank to make
credit more easily available to reach small farmers. About half the Credit
has been disbursed and the balance should be disbursed over the next 15 months.
At full disbursement some 140-150 farmers will benefit, which falls short of
the original target of 250-300, mainly due to increased input costs.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9, 1971.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
The project is about two years behind schedule due to the initial
reluctance of the Ministry of Education to provide the project unit with
adequate qualified staff and authority commensurate with responsibilities
that this unit had to undertake. However, a new project director and deputy
director have been appointed, other vacancies filled, and long standing prob-
lems concerning the appointment of technical assistance specialists are in
the process of being resolved. The procurement of equipment (the major com-
ponent of the project) is also proceeding satisfactorily. Although limited
progress has been made in the achieving of the overall educational objectives
of the project, these are now receiving increased attention. Similarly,
interim actions are now being initiated to prepare training programs for the
Management Training Institute as well as selection of fellowship candidates
and staff, as legislation establishing the Institute has not yet been passed.
Cost estimates are being updated by the Project Unit, but preliminary indica-
tions suggest cost overruns of about 65 percent over appraisal estimates.
Contracts totaling more than $6.0 million have been awarded. Over $1.0 million
has been disbursed since the beginning of FY76 and disbursements are expected
to continue at a high level.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
Loan and US$15 million Credit of June 22, 1971.    Closing Date:  June 30, 1976.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 8
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Frlit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
Loan and US$15 million Credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The project was initially delayed by difficulties in making the
loan/credit effective by thet due date. Progress with 3 of the 5 major project
components is satisfactory (refrigerated trucks, ferry boats, marketing
facilities).  A new extension approach has been initiated to increase the
citrus production, the fourth component. The fifth, the agricultural credit
survey, did not produce meaningful results, and other arrangements have been
made to prepare an agricultural credit project for Bank financing.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$24 million loan of June 22,
1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
The implementation pace of this project has been slower than
originally anticipated due to staff shortages experienced in the initial years.
First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and work is now progressing accord-
ing to the revised schedule. Problems in meeting the financial covenants
were considered in connection with the Elbistan project and have subsequently
been revised. The closing date has been extended to June 30, 1976 to allow
time to complete procurement.
Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million credit of
January 25, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Project construction schedules were revised in 1973, with the new
completion dates for Silifke, Koprucay and Tokat subprojects being about two
years behind the original schedule. Progress on construction of irrigation
and drainage channels and on-farm works at Silifke and Tokat is now proceeding
well, but is still behind schedule at Koprucay because of the extremely short
annual work season. Provisions for the employment of consultants and training
of national staff still remain to be implemented, but a revised timetable for
remedial action has now been agreed upon.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project:  US$76 million loan of April 28,
1972. Closing Date:   December 1976.
The project is over a year and a half behind schedule, due to
delays in beginning procurement, stemming largely from inefficient management.
Following continuing discussions between the Government, the company and the
Ban-i on these problems, a well qualified senior executive was appointed as tClh
president of the company, a new project manager has been appointed and mange-
ment problems have essentiall-y been overcome. The company is however experi-
encing short-term cash flow clifficulties, primarily due to substantial cost
overruns for the project; however measures to resolve this matter are under
review by the Government.



ANNEX II

Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project: US$37 million loan of June 30,
1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
The supply of water for Istanbul has increased by 69 percent since
1971, and water supply to the Asian side has doubled in the past year, but
shortages persist, particularly for municipalities adjacent to Istanbul.
Project progress is about one year behind appraisal estimates, but reasonable
progress is now being made. Institutional improvement in ISI is expected to
begin soon, since the draft reports of the management consultants were com-
pleted in September 1975.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project: US$2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Four consultant groups started work between November 1973 and
February 1974. Work on the Wastewater and the Bus/Traffic Engineering and
Control Projects is nearing completion. Phase I of the Urban and Transport
studies are completed, and are presently under review by the Government and
Bank prior to finalizing plans for carrying out Phase II.
LN. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$42 million loan
of June 30, 1972 as amended April 18, 1975. Closing Date: October 31, 1977.
An expansion of the original project was approved by the Bank on
October 11, 1973. Following early delays, procurement commenced in late
1973 and since then implementation has proceeded essentially on schedule.
About 80 percent of all goods have now been ordered. Physical completion is
later than originally planned, mainly as a result of the difficult equipment
delivery situation which is being experienced internationally. A Loan Amend-
ment of $18 million to finance the foreign exchange costs of the expansion
was approved on April 15, 1975, and made effective on August 28, 1975.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project: US$16 million credit of September 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project has started slowly due mainly to difficulties in secur-
ing the services of both local and expatriate technical staff. Salaries and
side benefits for local staff have recently been increased-and recruitment is
picking up. The basic project organization is now in place and implementation
is expected to improve provided all staff shortages are overcome as expected.
One foreign consultant is now on post, and action to recruit a second specialist
is underway.
Ln. No. 873-TU TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$40 million
loan of December 28, 1972.   Closing Date:  December 31, 1976.
Since the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory rela-
tionship has been developed with TSKB whose standard of performance is con-
sistently high. This loan to TSKB has been almost fully committed and when



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
completely disbursed will bring Bank lending to TSKB to $233 million, includ-
ing the loan of US$65.0 million signed in January 1975.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 TU, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1981.
After initial delays due to difficulties in engaging a suitable
engineering consulting firm, good progress is now being made.    Contracts for
on-farm development equipment: and for main dam construction have been awarded.
The dam contractor is expected to start work by the end of November 1975.
Although Topraksu and the Ministry of Agriculture have not yet employed ex-
perts for on-farm development and extension, agreement has been reached with
the Government on steps to resolve this issue and employ the experts as quick-
ly as possible.  In view of a substantial increase in project costs, a re-
vised financing plan is now tunder preparation by the Ministry of Finance;
however, the Government has indicated that it intends to fully cover increased
project costs.
Ln. No. 892 Istanbul Power Distribution Project: US$14.0 million loan of
May 25, 1973.   Closing Date:  December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project has been delayed by about three years by
lack of aggressive administration and costs have increased by nearly 130 per-
cent over appraisal estimates. Consultant studies of the Istanbul power mar-
ket and proposed company reor-ganization have been completed and the consultant
to study the gas supply system has now been appointed. The Government is
preparing proposals on how it: will cover the increased project costs and
revitalize the company's finances.
Ln. No. 893-TU Turkish State Railways: US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976.
After initial delays, procurement of track material and other Bank-
financed items is now progressing satisfactorily.    TCDD's locomotive produc-
tion, which is being financed by another external lending institution, and
the pace of track renewal have both been accelerated.    However, the project
remains about a year behind schedule. Although tarriffs have been raised
twice since the loan was made, other key provisions of the Loan and Guarantee
Agrcements have not been carried out as scheduled, but agreement has been
rea..ed with the Bank about revising some of the original targets which TCDD
should achieve.
L.n. No. 957-TU Antalya Forestry Project:  US$40 million loan of January 28,
'974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The date for effectiveness for this loan has been extended for a
time to December, 1975, to allow the Government additional time to re-
so.ve- the question of selecting a satisfactory new plant site location, the
a    site having met strong local opposition.   The feasibility study for



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 8
the new site east of Antalya has been completed, except for some aspects of
the forestry resource development component. Consultants for the latter work
have been engaged and are expected to begin work by December.
Ln. No. 1023 Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project:    US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Closing Date: July 30, 1982.
This loan to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the
Turkish Coal Authority (TKI) is to help finance the development of an open-
cast lignite mine in east central Turkey and the construction of an adjacent
lignite-burning 1200 megawatt power station and associated transmission lines.
Date for effectiveness of this loan, originally November 1, 1974, has been
postponed to December 15, 1975. Arrangements for the establishment of new
electricity tariffs have been agreed upon between the Government and the Bank,
which will enable the loan to be declared effective shortly, once 'remaining
conditions of effectiveness relating to joint financing from EIB and KfW are
fulfilled. Meanwhile engineering and contracting is proceeding with only
minor delays.
Ln. No. 1024-TU DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$40 million loan of
June 28, 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Submission of subprojects has been slower than anticipated. How-
ever, four projects totaling $18.7 million have been approved and disbursements
are expected to increase more rapidly in the first half of 1976.
Ln. No. 1078-TU TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey):    US$65 million
loan of January 22, 1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The loan was declared effective by April 24, 1975. Since then TSKB
has taken significant steps to mobilize additional domestic and foreign re-
sources and is channelling the bulk of its lending to Turkey's underdeveloped
regions. By the end of September 1975, about $32 million of the loan had
been committed.
Ln. N. 1130-TU Corum-Cankuri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of June 23,
1975.  Closing Date:  December 31, 1981.
The terminal date of effectiveness, originally September 23, 1975,
has been postponed to December 2, 1975 to give the Government additional time
to establish the project extension service and appoint a project director.
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK):    US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967.
Technical assistance contracts covering the second phase of the
work were terminated in November-December 1972. Achievement, though short
of target in some respects, is generally satisfactory and TEK now has a much

improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting system. Contracts for
the last phase of the work have been signed and final training program has
gotten underway, with one group of accountants having already completed train-
ing and further training groups being planned.
