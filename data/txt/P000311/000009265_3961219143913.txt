CAMEROON
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
Background
1.    Biological Significance. The Republic of Cameroon encompasses nearly 0.5 million square
kilometers spanning 10 degrees of latitude just north of the equator. Almost a third of its territory is
covered by tropical moist forests. Among African countries, Cameroon ranks second only to Zaire in
diversity of forest-dwelling primates, and among the top five in diversity of plant species. Cameroon is
home to the only remaining population of black rhinoceroses in west central Africa. The humid forests
of the littoral zone and the mountains of Southwestern Province rank among the world's top 100 areas for
endemic bird species and exhibit high endemism for amphibians, reptiles and plants.
2.    The lowland forests of southeastern Cameroon, although altered by accelerated harvesting
practices over the past two decades, support some of the most concentrated and diverse populations of
large mammals (elephants, forest ungulates, great apes) recorded in west or central Africa. Elephant and
bovid migrations provide ecological links between the forest and savanna mosaics of southeastern
Cameroon and adjacent regions of the Central African Republic and the Congo. These migrations, still
poorly understood, may be critical to maintaining populations of the keystone species that determine the
ecological character of this vast region.
3.    Sectoral Policy and Legislation. A detailed review of forestry legislation was made as part of
the Tropical Forestry Action Plan in 1987, as a result of which the Government began drafting a new
forest law. Adoption of a new forest law was included as part of the conditionality for the Structural
Adjustment Loan (Loan 3089-CM) made by the Bank to Cameroon in 1989. However, progress in
drafting the new law was hindered by the lack of a clearly defined national forest policy. Accordingly,
the Forestry Department initiated the preparation of a new forest policy, which was reviewed at a
workshop in Cameroon in May 1992. The Forestry Department also commissioned studies of forest
concessions and related fiscal revenue to provide specific recommendations.  Both studies were
completed in late 1992 and their recommendations were incorporated into the draft forest policy and
revised draft forest law. The forest law was passed by the Cameroon legislature in December 1993 and
promulgated by presidential signature in January 1994. An implementation decree (Regime des Forets,
No. 94/436) was issued on August 23, 1994. A decree, Regime de la Faune, regulating the establishment
of protected areas has been drafted. The official adoption of this decree will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed Grant.
4.    Cameroon's new forest policy represents an important step towards addressing sustainable
renewable resources management in the context of an overall national development strategy. The new
forest law defines the regulatory basis for management of the forest estate. The law provides for
participation of local communities in the management of certain categories of gazetted forests, and
requires the preparation and implementation of government-approved management plans for forests to be
regazetted under the law and as a prerequisite for granting future timber concessions. Effectiveness of
the law will depend on Government's capacity to develop management plans for sustainable forest
exploitation on a participatory basis and to monitor and enforce their implementation.
5.    The Government, with technical support from the United Nations Development Program, has
initiated a national environmental management planning process which will lead to a National



2
Environmental Management Plan (NEMP) within the next two years.' In going forward with the
proposed project in parallel with the NEMP process, the Government seeks to gain experience with
locally integrated resource management.  The innovative features of this project, with regard to
community participation in protected area management, should enhance the NEMP process with
examples of "best practice" based on Cameroonian models and help expand grassroot participation in
formulation of the NEMP. Policy studies carried out under the project will contribute to the overall
NEMP process as well. Data and analysis derived from baseline biological surveys will strengthen the
scientific rigor and quality of the biodiversity conservation strategy to be developed within the
framework of the NEMP. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MINEF), as the lead agency for
this project and the NEMP process, will ensure coordination among these parallel activities.
Sector Institutions
6.     MINEF was created in April 1992. In addition to its other responsibilities, it is mandated
through its Department of Wildlife and Protected Areas (DWPA)2 to supervise nature conservation
activities and is the governmental agency responsible for the organization of protected areas and
management of the country's natural heritage. MINEF has a staff of about 2,300, of which two-thirds are
in the field. MINEF is still in the process of growth and is also underfunded. Nevertheless, it is
vigorously acting to implement governmental policies concerning the protection of biodiversity,
extending protected areas and giving top priority to this proposed GEF project.
7.     The Ministry of Scientific and Technical Research (MINREST), through the Cameroon
National Herbarium (CNH), is responsible for implementation and overall coordination for botanical
surveys and inventories under a cooperative agreement with Kew Botanic Gardens and the National
Herbarium of France. Furthermore, MINREST, through the Institute of Zoological and Veterinary
Research (IZVR) and under a cooperative agreement with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), is
currently executing faunal surveys and inventories.
Project Objectives
8.    The project will be the first four-year phase of a long-term program and, as such, is modest and,
to some extent, pilot in nature. The project's main objective is to consolidate and upgrade the
management of protected areas in Cameroon by: (a) providing support to the Government in its efforts to
conserve and manage its biological resources; (b) promoting involvement of rural populations in
biodiversity conservation; and (c) encouraging sustainable utilization of renewable natural resources and
promoting sustainable and environmentally compatible development in regions surrounding the Protected
Areas.
9.    Institutional strengthening would focus on improving capabilities of MINEF in policy
development and information management; protected area planning, establishment and management;
buffer zone management; and community liaison activities. The project would also strengthen key
national institutions concerned with biodiversity-oriented research, including CNH, IVZR, the Garoua
Wildlife School and The University of Yaounde I.
The NEMP is the equivalent of the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP).
One Directorate, including three Sub-directorates for Fauna, Protected Areas and Administration,
with services at Provincial, Department and District levels.

Project Description
10.   The project would enhance biodiversity conservation and management at six Priority Project
Sites. These areas include the coastal Guinea-Congolean refugium (Campo-Ma'an, about 5,000 kM2);
and the western highlands (Mount KilumrIjim, 120 kM2; Mount Koupe, about 300 kM2; and Mount
Cameroon/Etinde, 350 kM2). The project would underwrite studies necessary to identify priority
protection zones within the Congo Basin lowlands of eastern Cameroon (Lobeke, about 4,500 kin
Boumba Bek, about 2,300 k2; and Nki faunal reserves, about 2,000 km2) and produce management
plans for critical core areas integrated within a network of multiple-use management zones. The project
would also finance conservation of savanna ecosystems including implementation of a recovery plan for
the endangered black rhinoceros. The improvement of infrastructure and MINEF management capability
for three national parks within the Savannah zone (Faro, 3,300 kM2; Bouba-Ndjidda, 2,200 kmi2; and
Benou6, 1,800 km2) would also be financed under the project.
11.   The project would strengthen key institutions concerned with biodiversity research and provide
resources, training and technical assistance to improve their ability to fulfill their mandate. This would
include support to the CNH to extend its program for botanical inventories, surveys and publication of
results under a cooperative agreement with the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in the United Kingdom,
and the National Herbarium in France. The project would support a zoological survey program
developed by IVZR in cooperation with WCS and several local universities and colleges. Basic
population and ecological studies of threatened fauna and important game species financed under the
project will improve the biological knowledge base in the area of wildlife management.
12.   The project will also strengthen the Studies and Planning Service (SPS) of DWPA. The SPS will
maintain information derived from faunal and floral inventories, legal and policy studies, and baseline
biological and sociological studies undertaken in the course of developing management plans for the
project sites. It will also serve as an information resource for MINEF and other sectoral ministries on the
current status of biodiversity conservation programs nationwide.
13.   Multiple use management of biological reserves and local community involvement in program
planning and execution will require a well integrated monitoring and evaluation program, based upon
criteria developed from socio-economic studies and baseline surveys, so that it can provide feedback on
the process. Socio-economic studies will employ rapid appraisal techniques to document existing
conditions and include periodic follow-up reviews throughout the course of the project. Ecological
baseline and monitoring studies undertaken under the project will provide a rigorous basis for evaluating
project results with regard to biodiversity conservation. Progress in the development of local bylaws to
regulate hunting and exploitation of non-timber forest products will be tracked through annual reviews.
The impact of these regulations will be reviewed at the end of the third year of project implementation.
14.   The proposed GET grant of SDR 4.1 million (equivalent of US$6.0 million), would finance 48
percent of total project costs, estimated at US$12.4 million and would be disbursed over a four and a half
year period. The Government would contribute approximately US$1.0 million in operating expenses.
Bilateral grants totaling US$5.4 million would finance 44 percent of total project costs.
Project Implementation
15.   Project Management. Principal responsibility for implementation of the proposed project will
be vested in DWPA. Interagency coordination during project implementation and participation in
periodic project monitoring and evaluation will be facilitated by an interministerial Technical Steering



4
Committee (TSC) chaired by the Secretary General of MINEF. The DWPA will be responsible for
contracting with other agencies and conservation-oriented Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to
help execute site-based activities of the project (e.g. management plan development and the baseline
studies, surveys and inventories) and for supervision of the work. The project will build and augment
DWPA capacity for financial management under a contract with an independent local management firm
for training and financial supervision of contracts. At the individual project sites, the management
structure will include Site Management Committees with representatives from local government,
traditional leaders and local and international NGOs.
16.   National Capacity Building.  Detailed and costed proposals have been developed for
strengthening the capacity of the Government in the areas of botanical and zoological research, surveys,
inventories and conservation priority assessment. Execution of these project components will be done
within the framework of existing bilateral or multilateral agreements between the executing agencies
(IVZR and CNH, respectively) and their international partner institutions. Institutional strengthening of
MINEF will focus on capacity building to undertake management of protected areas under DWPA and to
provide policy support through the Division of Legal Affairs on issues such as drafting of legislation and
other legal instruments necessary for gazettment of protected areas.
Project Sustainability
17.   Long-term sustainability of the programs developed under the project will ultimately depend on
Government's ability and commitment to appropriate the required budgetary resources. Management
plans for the protected areas to be developed under the project will provide a realistic and accurate basis
for planning and estimating recurrent cost requirements beyond the initial four-year project phase. As
recommended by the project Technical Review Panel, the Bank and Government will explore
mechanisms such as the establishment of a trust fund and/or the application of a second phase GET grant
to meet recurrent costs of core zone management beyond the end of this first phase once the cost
implications are more accurately known. Moreover, buffer zone management plans prepared under the
project would include a framework for the sustainable harvest of timber and other forest products and
identify future private investment opportunities for environmentally sustainable development.
Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
18.    Recent project experience in the renewable natural resources sector has confirmed the strategy of
strengthening implementation capacity of existing units within sectoral ministries rather than creating
ephemeral project management units. The implementation schedule of the project reflects experience of
Bank projects in the forestry and agricultural sectors. Moreover, experience to date with GEF-funded
biodiversity projects in Africa indicates that these projects are slow to start up, due to limited
implementation capacity of local institutions. The twinning of conservation-oriented international NGOs
with Government agencies under this project is meant to enhance short-term implementation capacity,
while building local institutional capability for implementation over the medium term. The selection of
sites where there is strong bilateral interest and, in most cases, financing for long-term technical
assistance already in place should also accelerate the rate of project implementation. GEF financing of
Government counterpart training, equipment and operating costs is meant to complement bilateral
investments by strengthening the capability of local institutions to undertake, over time, an expanding
role in project management and execution.

Rationale for GEF Funding
19.    The protection and conservation of natural forest and savanna ecosystems in Cameroon is of high
international importance. The protected areas, which have been selected by the project, represent not
only ecologically sensitive areas but also key habitats for globally threatened species. These protected
areas also feature samples of intact forest habitats that are quickly disappearing throughout western and
central Africa. Moreover, the Cameroonian forest ecosystems are under increasing pressure from a
rapidly growing population, commercial exploitation and increasing international demands for timber. If
the pace of the current forest degradation and destruction continues and efforts to conserve biological
diversity lag, many high priority areas will be severely impacted before viable conservation measures are
established.
20.    Due to severe resource constraints and other development priorities, Government funding is
insufficient for the operation and maintenance of the entire network of protected areas and insufficient
funds are available from other non-concessional sources to implement country-wide protection and
conservation programs. The GEF is uniquely placed to provide funding for the establishment of a
national framework for biodiversity conservation and be instrumental in bridging the gap between
bilateral grant and international NGO funding for selected activities and funding needs for national long-
term capacity building for biodiversity conservation.
21.    The GEF will help reconcile global benefits in long-term maintenance of biodiversity with
national and local interests in increasing sustainable revenues from protected areas. The need to preserve
genetic resources and thereby maintain the future development options that these represent (such as
pharmaceuticals and other untapped markets for forest products) is acknowledged at all levels. At the
local level, however, the desires to maintain traditional access to forest resources and to realize economic
benefits from activities financed under the proposed GET grant through increased tourism revenue or
local employment in project-related activities are paramount. The project will therefore focus on
establishing protected areas to maintain biodiversity that are also integrated into the local economies,
thereby ensuring that the local population can become a potent ally in biodiversity preservation.
Agreed Actions
22.    At negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that, prior to project effectiveness, the
Government will: (a) prepare and negotiate implementation contracts that are acceptable to the Bank
with selected NGOs for assisting in the execution of the project components for the Southeastern Region,
Campo-Ma'an, Mount Koupe and Mount Kilum/Ijim, the Savannah Ecosystem, zoological surveys, and
botanical surveys; (b) issue the decree on Regime de la Faune. The three decrees providing, in a manner
acceptable to the Bank, the necessary legal framework for project implementation and including
definition of the core conservation zones and external boundaries of the six Priority Project Sites, were
issued on February 8, 1995; (c) prepare and transmit to the Bank, the first year's training program, annual
work plan and budget for each component of the project, as well as a schedule for first year deployment
schedule of staff at headquarters and within the Priority Project Sites; (d) open a project account and
deposit thereinto an amount of CFA franc 10.0 million equivalent; and (e) establish the TSC with a
mandate and membership acceptable to the Bank.
23.    During negotiations, the Bank also obtained assurances that during project implementation, the
Government will: (a) maintain a working group within the DWPA with full time responsibility for
project administration and coordination under the supervision of a Project Coordinator at the rank of
Deputy Director under terms of reference and with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank;
I



6
(b) submit by December of each year an annual work plan and budget including a training program and a
field staff deployment schedule for each component of the project for the following year; (c) not later
than December 31, 1996, carry out jointly with the Bank a mid-term review of the project progress and
implement the recommendations of said review agreed upon with the Bank; (d) prohibit the extension of
current or the issuance of new logging or hunting concessions in the core conservation zones within the
Priority Project Sites until the completion of the project; (e) within six months of approval of
management plans for protected areas within the Priority Project Sites by MINEF, prepare and issue
necessary texts to gazette or regazette the protected areas in conformity with the plans; (f) not later than
December 31, 1996, establish one community managed game/hunting zone within the Priority Project
Sites of the Savannah Ecosystem and Campo-Ma'an; and (g) take the environmental mitigation measures
as outlined in the Environmental Analysis prepared for the project.
Environmental Aspects
24    The project has been assigned environmental analysis category "B". An environmental analysis
(EA) was prepared by the Government to assess potential project impact and concluded that it would
have overall positive environmental effects. Recommendations from the EA with regard to monitoring of
biological and sociological impacts have been incorporated in the overall project design for monitoring
and evaluation. An environmental mitigation plan has been prepared by the Government and was
reviewed by the Bank. Financing for monitoring the application of the mitigation plan is included in the
project.  The design of appropriate mitigations for potential negative impacts of site specific
developments will be addressed in the course of management plan preparation for each of the six Priority
Project Sites.
25.   During the course of project preparation, reconnaissance surveys were undertaken to identify the
presence of traditional forest dwelling people within the proposed project zones of the southeastern
region (Lobeke and Boumba Bek), and Campo-Ma'an. As part of the EA for the project, potential
impacts on indigenous people were evaluated and a plan was developed to address potentially adverse
impacts and aid in monitoring project implementation. The project would involve no involuntary
resettlement. The process of community consultation, in the course of management plan development, is
designed to incorporate the views of local communities in establishing the rules for use of areas gazetted
under the project. Regulations for management of such areas will be designed to protect the rights of
indigenous people to maintain traditional harvest and usage rights within the project zones.
Project Benefits
26.   The project would lead to global, national and local benefits. Global and national benefits under
the project would result from the maintenance of ecosystem functions, such as watershed protection as
well as conservation of unique flora and fauna and the genetic resources and future development options
these represent. National benefits would derive from the strengthened capacity in both the Government
and non-government sectors for conservation and renewable resource management and progress toward
establishing a sustainable harvest regime for forest products. Local benefits would result from the
establishment of multiple-use zones that would reinforce the rights of local people to maintain traditional
patterns and practices of harvesting natural forest products. In addition, project interventions aimed at
sustainable management of game and other non-timber forest products would seek to augment the income
of local communities that depend on the forest for their livelihood and provide a basis for increasing the
share of economic returns from harvest of forest products that local communities retain.



7
Project Risks
27.   The project faces four main risks. First, the Government may be tempted to generate additional
revenue through logging. This could weaken its resolve to establish core protection zones of sufficient
size to maintain ecosystem processes, or to grant usufruct rights to local communities at the expense of
lost revenues to the national treasury. Reforms under the new forest law which address increasing
stumpage fees for timber concessions should increase revenues from production forests which would
partially offset the loss of revenue of excluding core conservation areas from logging. However, the
proposed core protection zones: (a) are remote, with difficult logistics that limit their exploitation
potential; (b) have cultural values recognized by local communities which contribute to their protection;
or, (c) have potential for other forms of use which are compatible with conservation goals (e.g. tourism
and sport hunting). Second, a delay in issuance of necessary decrees and regulatory instruments could
delay effectiveness of the Grant. An implementation decree for the forestry section of the new law was
issued in August 1994. Prior to Grant Effectiveness, the Government will issue a decree covering the
wildlife and protected areas sections of the law. A series of three arretes defining the boundaries of the
Priority Project Sites were issued on February 8, 1995. Third, the preparation of management plans for
the reserves and buffer zones may proceed slowly because of the importance of involving local people in
the planning process. A strong project emphasis on community consultation using techniques such as
participatory rural appraisal and on raising community awareness of environmental/conservation issues
through education is intended to build a sense of project ownership in local communities. Significant
progress in negotiating boundaries and locally endorsed management regulations has already been made
at several sites where conservation-oriented NGOs have been involved. Finally, Government may not be
able to provide adequate counterpart funding on a timely basis. The project has been designed in such a
way to minimize the demands on the Government's budget and the impact of such a delay on project
implementation (Government funding is to pay primarily for local staff salaries). Moreover, Government
is to provide up-front financing in the amount of CFAF 10.0 million.

REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
A. General
1.1    The Republic of Cameroon encompasses nearly 0.5 million square kilometers (47.5 million
hectares) of land area spanning 10 degrees of latitude just north of the equator. In 1990, the population
was estimated at 11.1 million with an annual growth rate of 2.6 percent. The population density of 23
persons per square kilometer is the highest among the countries which share the West-Central African
rainforest zone. Forest and woodlands were estimated to cover 53 percent of the national territory with
more than half of this figure representing tropical moist forests. In 1990-91, 6.36 million hectares, or 25
percent, was under license for timber exploitation (down from a high of 8.1 million hectares in 1980-81).
B. Biological Diversity
1.2    Among African countries, Cameroon ranks second only to Zaire in diversity of forest-dwelling
primates, and among the top five in diversity of plant species. Several geological, historical, and climatic
factors contribute to the exceptional diversity of Cameroon's biota and to its potential endangerment. The
botanical richness of the southern littoral forests of Cameroon and Mount Cameroon is thought to result
from the isolation of these areas as Pleistocene "refugia." Remnants of the rich Guinea-Congolean forest
biota survived here during periods of dry climate when the range of tropical moist forests contracted
elsewhere. Mount Cameroon and the Mount Kilum and Mount Koupe regions of the westem highlands
retain montane relict species (particularly forest birds, bamboo and other vascular plants) that are endemic
to this region but show ancient affinities to afro-montane elements of eastem Africa. These may reflect
links to cooler and more mesic (wetter) conditions than those occurring in the region today.
1.3    The lowland forests of southeastem  Cameroon, although altered by accelerated harvesting
practices over the past two decades, nonetheless support some of the most concentrated and diverse
populations of large mammals (elephant, gorilla, bongo and other forest ungulates) recorded in west or
central Africa. Historical elephant migration corridors once provided ecological links between the fbrest
and savanna mosaics of southeastem Cameroon and adjacent regions of the Central African Republic and
the Congo. These migrations, now reduced due to poaching, are still poorly understood. Nevertheless,
elephants clearly function as keystone species through their role as seed dispersers and disturbance agents.
The loss of this species would likely result in changes to the ecological character of this vast region. The
dry sub-Sahelian forests and savannas of northem Cameroon in the region of Faro, Benoue and Bouba
Ndjidda National Parks contain the last viable remnants of the westem black rhinoceros. Emergency
interventions under the project will seek to preserve and augment this endangered population.
1.4    Both the humid forests of the Cameroon littoral (Campo-Ma'an) and the montane forests
(including Mount Cameroon, Mount Kilum and Mount Koup6) rank among the world's 100 most important
areas of endemic bird species (the Cameroon mountain region is among the top 30 and second only to the
Albertine Rift and Eastem Arc montane forests in Africa). Both areas are documented centers of endemism
for primates, plants, small mammals, amphibians, and reptiles as well. Increased cutting and buming of
forests as well as ongoing timber harvest in Campo-Ma'an are devastating these areas.



2                                                                                  Chapter 1
1.5    Establishment of National Parks and Reserves has been a major Government priority. So far, about
13 percent of the land area is under some form of protection. Cameroon includes seven National Parks,
nine Faunal Reserves and three biosphere reserves totaling over three million ha as well as ten Protection
and Recreation Forests and twenty-seven Hunting Reserves. Government policy is to increase this
proportion to 20 percent of the national territory. To date however, as a result of encroachment by slash
and bum agriculture - the single greatest danger accounting for most of the estimated 100,000 ha annual
deforestation - illegal poaching and bushfires, Cameroon's forests and woodlands are declining both in size
and quality. In the absence of land registration or of a national cadastral survey, occupancy of land is an
important indicator of ownership, and has encouraged encroachment and haphazard low density planting of
cocoa and coffee. However, revision of the land tenure law is not considered possible at present. Therefore
the major issue is how to efficiently protect the great richness of plant and animal species that exist in
Cameroon and that are not naturally found anywhere else in the world.
1.6   So far, the management of reserved areas has been inadequate. Boundaries are rarely demarcated.
Patrolling of the reserves is uncommon, thus encouraging incursions by people who tend to equate lack of
patrolling with lack of interest or ownership. Vehicles, budgets, infrastructure for the efficient policing of
the protected areas is rarely available. There are deficiencies in levels of staffing and training, a lack of
infrastructure and inadequate operating and investment budgets. This situation needs to be redressed
urgently.  Moreover, the quality of ecological inforrnation available about protected areas is often
inaccurate and/or out of date. A realistic reassessment of the status of the national parks and faunal
reserves is needed with ecological inventory management and operation plans.
C. Forest Policy and Law
1.7    Legislative Background. A detailed review of forestry legislation was made as part of the
Tropical Forestry Action Plan in 1987, as a result of which the Government decided to prepare a new
Forest Law. Adoption of this Law was included as part of the conditionality for the Structural Adjustment
Loan (Loan 3089-CM) made by the World Bank to Cameroon in 1989. However, progress in drafting the
new law was hindered by the lack of a clearly defined national forest policy. It therefore became necessary
to prepare such a policy to provide the basis for the new Law. The Forestry Department commissioned
studies of forest concessions and forest fiscality to provide specific recommendations for incorporation into
the forest policy.
1.8    The main weakness of the previous forest legislation (1981) was the lack of a legal framework for
planning land use and integrating forest protection and production activities, as well as agriculture. Under
the previous system in the humid forest zone, logging concessions were given for a period of five to fifteen
years on the basis of requests submitted by the forest industry. This resulted in a piecemeal exploitive
"mining" approach to forest management, with loggers constructing roads deep into the forest to exploit the
richest tirnber resources, opening up these areas to individual settlers. A further weakness of the previous
legislation was that under the land tenure law, usufruct rights permitted anybody to clear and cultivate land
in "public domain" forests, which make up most of the moist forest. Thus, in practice there was no
effective legal protection for the public domain forests, since by planting cocoa or coffee bushes, a settler
obtained the right to remain on the land for the 30 years or so of the life of his crop, and as such gained de
facto possession of the land.
1.9    The new Forest Law (Law 94-01) was passed by the National Assembly in December, 1993 and
promulgated in January, 1994. This law is based on the premise that Cameroon's forest resources
represent a unique natural resource that has been exploited in a non-sustainable way in the past. The



Background                                                                                3
policy explicitly recognizes the unique richness and importance of Cameroon's biodiversity, and assigns a
high priority to protection of this heritage. It includes categories of permanent and non-permanent forests
and provides for establishment of two classes of community or local government managed forests, one
within the state-owned (gazetted) "forets domaniales" and the other within the non-gazetted "forets du
domaine national". Both categories of forests are considered part of the permanent forest estate. In the
case of "forets domaniales" the State retains title to the lands so classified. Under the new Law, the
Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MINEF) is obliged to provide technical assistance to communities
for the development of management plans for both types of forests and to monitor their implementation.
1.10   The System  of Protected and Managed Areas.  Forest Law 94-01 also provides for the
establishment of 6 categories of protected areas including national parks and faunal/floral sanctuaries,
protection forests, recreational forests, hunting zones, etc. for which title and management responsibility
rests primarily with MINEF. Usage rights within these areas (principally for game, fish and non-timber
forest products) are defined by decree or acte de classement. The law provides latitude for development of
local bylaws and definition of local regulatory/enforcement procedures within the framework of locally
developed management plans.
1.11   A second major thrust to complement the new Forest Law is related to reclassifying and gazetting
forest land and thereby increase the area of the gazetted forests. The new Forest Law seeks to separate so-
called permanent forest from non-permanent forest. Permanent forest will comprise both the gazetted
forests of the State, including parks and reserves, and some forests managed by communities or local
government. In contrast, non-permanent forest will be made up of forests in the public domain and some
local community or village forests, as well. It is envisaged that the permanent forest would include much of
the humid forest zone in the south of Cameroon and therefore would necessitate gazetting large areas of
forest that are currently classified as Public Domain forests. The Government has demonstrated a
commitment towards protecting large areas of the permanent forest and established a three-year
moratorium in November 1991 on new forest exploitation licenses on three million ha of primary forest in
southern Cameroon. The Government has agreed to continue the moratorium.
1.12   Under the zoning plan prepared by MINEF (January 1993) as part of the Tropical Forest Action
Plan, most of the southern forest zone (approximately three million hectares) is to be classified as
permanent forest, which will include both protection forest and production forest as well as community
forests. The recently prepared five-year Action Program of MINEF for 1994-1999 calls for a strong
initiative toward gazettment of core conservation areas within the southeastern region (Lobeke and Boumba
Bek unprotected faunal reserves) and beginning of community consultations leading toward eventual
gazettment as permanent forest of approximately 2.6 million hectares.
1.13   Preparation and approval of management plans for the protection or sustainable production use of
the permanent forest would be an essential feature of all land use in the permanent forest. Under the new
Forest Law, Government is responsible for preparing these plans for protected areas and providing
assistance to local people in the case of community forests. For concession areas the private sector is
required to prepare management plans to be approved, and their implementation monitored, by MINEF.
1.14   The task of gazetting a large part of the moist forest zone of Cameroon will involve considerable
work. A start has been made with the preparation by MINEF's Forestry Department of a first draft of a
national land use plan with Canadian technical assistance. The "Zoning Plan for the Southem Forest of
Cameroon" (MINEF, January 1993) has been prepared on the basis of photo interpretation and forest
inventory work carried out for most of the southem forest zone of Cameroon. This draft zoning plan will



4                                                                               Chapter I
now have to be refined at the field level and an effective dialogue established with the local people before
preparation of the detailed zoning decrees. Technical assistance for this work is being provided through
Canadian and Japanese bilateral assistance.
D. Government Institutions
1.15   MINEF was created in April 1992. It is mandated through its Department of Wildlife and
Protected Areas (DWPA)l to supervise nature conservation activities and is the governmental agency
responsible for the organization of protected areas and management of the count.-y natural heritage.
MINEF is regionalized, has departmental representation, and has a staff of about 2,300, of which two-
thirds are in the field. MINEF staff is increasing and its operating budget is underfunded. Nevertheless, it
is vigorously acting to implement governmental policies concerning the protection of biodiversity, extending
protected areas and giving top priority to this Global Environment Facility (GEF) project.
1.16   Even if the number and the training of staff at the medium and upper level are acceptable, the
performance is weak as management capacities are insufficient. Technical equipment is also insufficient
and not adapted to needs. Communication, documentation and cartography are particularly insufficient.
Furthermore, integrated multiple-use planning is non existent at the national, provincial and, for most parts
of Cameroon, even at the local level. As the planning and management capacity of the decentralized
services are very limited, the need exists to benefit from the expertise of Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) as local partners for development. However, local NGOs have only been recognized recently and
their development remains incipient.
1.17   The Ministry of Scientific and Technical Research (MINREST), through the Cameroon
National Herbarium (CNH), is responsible for implementation and overall coordination for botanical
surveys and inventories under a cooperative agreement with Kew Botanic Gardens and the National
Herbarium of France. Furthermore, MINREST, through the Institute of Veterinary and Zoological
Research (IVZR) and under a cooperative agreement with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) is
currently also executing faunal surveys and inventories. The Garoua Wildlife School has two types of
courses: (i) two-year post baccalaureate course in wildlife management for francophone African countries;
and (ii) short courses in wildlife management with inputs from the Agricultural University of Dschang and
the Mbalmayo Forestry School.
E. Linkage with the National Environmental Management Planning Process
1.18  In October 1992, a multidisciplinary mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) visited Cameroon and prepared a report entitled
"Environment and Sustainable Development in Cameroon." This report contained five recommendations,
one of which was that the country should prepare a National Environmental Management Plan (NEMP)2.
DWPA has three Sub-directorates for Fauna, Protected Areas and Administration and has services at
Provincial, Department and District levels.

Following on this recommendation, MINEF, with the assistance of UNDP, has prepared a "Program of
Priority Actions for Environmental Management."
1.19   The NEMP process of national seminars, regional workshops and interministenral planning and
coordination is expected to result in preparation of a NEMP by June of 1995 which will outline the priority
agenda of the country with regard to environmental affairs. One component of this plan will be a National
Biodiversity Strategy to be prepared by MINEF with UNDP assistance and financial support from the
Government of Germany through the Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ).
F. Selection of Project Sites, NGOs and Donor Involvement
1.20   Aside from the internationally and nationally designated protected areas as project sites, six
priority regions representing a range of environments have been selected because of their importance for
global biodiversity conservation. These sites also form a continuum which spans the range of Cameroonian
experience with local community involvement in the conservation planning process.
1.21   They include 3:
-  Mount Kilum/Ijium Reserve. Established in 1983, this forest reserve covers 11,200 ha in the
north of the Bamenda Highlands. It includes the areas above Verkovi and Wvem (Ngongba
High Forest), the forest above Simonkov and Tadu, and forests to the south-west and north-
west of Lake Bambili. This is the second highest mountain in West Africa, with deep dissected
valleys, grassy plateaus and a shallow caldera lake. Open forest occurs from about 2,100 m to
the summit at 3,011 m, but burning, and grazing by stock are degrading many areas. It
supports 6,900 ha of the finest example of Podocarpus and Arundinaria bamboo forest in
West Africa. Fauna includes Bannerman's turaco and the banded wattle-eye (endemic to the
Bamenda Highlands), the rare Preuss's guenon and several very rare amphibians. It is a vital
catchment area, with a high surrounding human population. Uncontrolled fires are a major
problem, as are roads, livestock and soil erosion.  The reserve is presently supported
financially by the Overseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom (ODA) and
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), with technical assistance from Birdlife International.
ODA support is principally directed at programs for soil conservation and livestock
management that are carried out in collaboration with the regional development authority.
WWF provides support for environmental education and general project management.
*  Mount Koupe Reserve. Situated in south-west Cameroon, this is the first major peak (2,064
m) inland from Mount Cameroon. A small area is marked as a forest reserve on the official
maps of the region. Its flanks are forested from elevations between 900 m to the summit,
covering an area of 2,000 ha and including transitional lowland-montane forest, with montane
forest near the peak.  Tree species include Carapa grandiflora, Cephaelis manni,
Dicranolepis vestita and Ficus mucuso, with Podocarpus latifolius and Philippia mannii on
the summit. It is the principal (and perhaps only) locality for at least 15 species of plant. Over
190 bird species occur, including the endemic Mount Koup6 bush shrike; three threatened and
three near-threatened bird species also occur. The mountain also supports an endemic skink.

Primates include the rare red-eared guenon Cercopithecus erythrotis and drill. Threats to the
area include clearance for agriculture and cutting of trees, as the surrounding area is densely
populated; a local taboo which, until now, helped preserve the forest, is diminishing in
importance. The Mount Koupe Reserve currently receives support from the European Union
(EU) for environmental education and general program management with technical assistance
provided by Birdlife International.
*  Mount Cameroon. Situated near the coast 45 km west of Douala, this is the highest mountain
and only active volcano in West Africa. It is particularly important as one of the few sites in
tropical Africa supporting a full continuum between lowland and montane forest. Forest
occurs at elevations from close to sea-level to about 2,000 m covering about 175,000 ha.
Montane grassland occurs at higher elevations. The mountain is a major center of endemism,
and an important locality for Preuss's guenon, red-eared nose-spotted monkeys, chimpanzees,
and elephants. The endemic Mount Cameroon francolin, three species of threatened and four
near-threatened bird species occur. The skink Panaspis gemmiventris, the toads Didynamipus
sjoestedti and Werneria preussi, and the very rare tree-frog Hyperolius krebsi occur. Fire is
thought to be partly responsible for maintaining the forest-grassland boundary. Illegal cutting
of timber and hunting also occur. Only the Bambuko Forest Reserve on the north-west side is
somewhat protected. The Mount Cameroon Rainforest is currently managed by MINEF under
the supervision of the Conservator of the Limbe Botanic Gardens with technical assistance
provided by Kew Botanic Gardens with financing from ODA. ODA financing covers foreign
currency costs of carrying out botanical inventories, boundary surveys and village
consultations as well as general support to the Limbe Botanic Garden's research programs and
administration. The Government of Germany, under a recently initiated project (implemented
by GTZ), is financing technical assistance and other foreign currency costs for the preparation
of the management plan for the proposed forest reserves within a subregional land use planning
framework.
*  Campo-Ma'an Faunal Reserve. This reserve of 500,000 ha includes coastal plains and low
hills covered prinarily with dense tropical forest. The fauna is varied. It includes several
threatened species such as elephant and gorilla. A twenty-seven year old logging concession
has resulted in considerable environmental degradation. Heavy poaching of larger mammals
occurs, and the human population within the reserve is increasing. The reserve is presently
managed by DWPA. The Government of the Netherlands has expressed interest to provide
funding for research in sustainable forest management and development of management plans
for the proposed community forest zone through the Tropenbos Foundation.
* Three faunal reserves in the South-Eastern Region, including:
(i)    Boumba-Bek Faunal Reserve (2,300 kin2).  Consisting prinarily of mixed
evergreen and semi-deciduous transitional forests, supporting a full complement of
forest fauna including elephant, buffalo, bongo, bushbuck, giant forest hog,
bushpig and leopard, as well as gorilla, collared mangabey and chimpanzee;
(ii)   Lac Lobeke Faunal Reserve (1,500 km2).  Primarily supporting a mixed
transitional evergreen and semi-deciduous forest, and a wide variety of forest
fauna including elephant, buffalo, sitatunga, six duiker species, chevrotain, giant



Background                                                                              7
forest hog, bushpig, leopard, antbear, giant pangolin, nine diurnal primate species
and particularly high densities of bongo and pygmy antelope; and
(iii)   Nki Faunal Reserve (2,000 kM2). Consisting of about 195,000 ha of evergreen
and transitional rainforest, it includes the spectacular Nki waterfall. Elephant,
buffalo, bongo, collared mangabey, gorilla, chimpanzee and leopard are present,
as do long-snouted crocodile and the giant frog Conrauana goliath. The area has
been little disturbed.
*  The Savannah Ecosystem, which includes three national parks (Faro, 3,300 kM2; Bouda-
Ndjidda, 2,300 km2; and Benoue National Parks, 1,800 km2), is located at the bio-
geographical transition area between the Soudanian and Guinean savannas and supports a rich
wildlife typical of the area, including threatened species such as elephant, leopard, giant eland,
Nile crocodile, cheetah, primates, and, in particular of major interest for the project, black
rhinoceros. The major threats are poaching (particularly from neighboring Chad) and bush
fires.
G. Local Population Involvement in Biodiversity Conservation
1.22   Importance of Baseline Social Data. A major issue with biodiversity conservation programs is
that the local resident populations have only been sporadically incorporated into the protected area planning
and management process. Adequate information about the people and communities affected by protected
area plan are generally missing. The Government strategy explicitly recognizes that demographic, socio-
economic and ethnographic surveys should be conducted as an integral component of the process of
establishing protected areas. These surveys should proceed from a dialogue developed with local residents
using a participatory rural appraisal approach and addressing such issues as: who are the resident (and
recent imnigrant) populations; where are they located; how do they depend on the natural environment for
their livelihoods or incomes; and how will they be affected by the proposed protected areas. Consultations
and surveys need to elicit from local people their views on land and natural resource use and ownership and
seek to avert potential conflicts that may arise over the establishment of protected areas. The present state
of inforrnation concerning populations potentially affected by the project is summarized in the Project
Environment Assessment Report.
1.23   NGO Involvement. NGOs represent, to varying degrees, the local resident populations. Their
legislative and policy status is also undergoing change in the present political environment. In a recent
report on NGO involvement in natural resources management, four categories of NGOs were identified:
(a)   International conservation-oriented NGOs, of which there are about a dozen active in
Cameroon at present;
(b)   Indigenous NGOs, defined as organizations with a near 100 percent Cameroonian
membership, of which there are nearly 100;
(c)    Rural Associations, defined as inter-village associations having as their main objective the
provision of organizational structures and leadership which promotes viable socioeconomic
activities among villages sharing common values, traditions and goals;



8                                                                                Chapter I
(d)    Village Organizations, the most numerous category, which are truly grassroot level
organizations concemed with social and economic development.
1.24  In view of the past experience of intemational conservation-oriented NGOs in Cameroon, their
involvement in strengthening indigenous and rural/village associations is fundamental to biological
resources and natural resources management. The Govermment has sanctioned their pioneering work on
involvement of local populations in the conservation of biodiversity in the cases of Korup National Park,
Mount Kilum-Ijim, Mount Koupd and Mount Cameroon. Therefore, participation of local NGOs, such as
rural cooperatives, should be emphasized, building on past experiences.
H. Rationale for GEF Involvement
1.25   The protection and conservation of natural forest and savanna ecosystems in Cameroon is of high
intemational importance. The protected areas, selected by the project, represent not only ecologically
sensitive areas but also key habitats for globally threatened species. These protected areas also feature
samples of intact forest habitats that are quickly disappearing throughout westem and central Africa.
Moreover, the Cameroonian forest ecosystems are under increasing pressure from a rapidly growing
population, commercial exploitation and increasing intemational demands for timber. If the pace of the
current forest degradation and destruction continues and efforts to conserve biological diversity lag, many
high priority areas will be severely impacted before viable conservation measures are established.
1.26   Due to severe resource constraints and other development priorities, Govemment funding is
insufficient for the operation and maintenance of the entire network of protected areas and insufficient
funds are available from non-concessional sources to implement country-wide protection and conservation
programs. The availability of GEF funds will therefore enable the Government to pursue conservation and
related support actions. GEF financing will be limited to areas whose conservation has global importance
and which receive no or insufficient assistance.
1.27   The GEF will help reconcile global benefits in long term maintenance of biodiversity with national
and local interests in increasing sustainable revenues from protected areas. The need to preserve genetic
resources and thereby maintain the future development options that these represent (such as
pharmaceuticals and other untapped markets for forest products) is acknowledged at all levels. At the local
level, however, the desires to maintain traditional access to forest resources and to realize economic
benefits from activities financed under the proposed GEF grant through increased tourism revenue or local
employment in project related activities are paramount. The project will therefore focus on establishing
protected areas to maintain biodiversity that are also integrated into the local economies, thereby ensuring
that local population can become a potent ally in biodiversity preservation.
1.28   The GEF is uniquely placed to provide funding for the establishment of a national framework for
biodiversity conservation and be instrumental in bridging the gap between bilateral grant and intemational
NGO funding for selected activities and funding needs for national long term capacity building for
biodiversity conservation. First, the GEF project will be instrumental in creating an adequate knowledge
base conceming the biota and ecosystems, develop management plans, and achieve gazettement of the
biologically important core areas in collaboration with the surrounding communities. Second, it would
strengthen ongoing experiments in conservation and community land management supported by
intemational NGOs such as the programs developed at Mount Kilum and Mount Koupe and the more
recently initiated program in the area surrounding Mount Cameroon. And third, it would enhance - in

collaboration with bilateral donors - Government's capacity for participative protected area planning and
management.



2.  THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1    The project will be the first phase of a long-term program and, as such, is modest and to some
extent pilot in nature. Its first objective is to help Government to protect a significant amount of
Caineroon's biological diversity through careful management of selected reserves, including the
development of alternative activities for the local population in the buffer zones. The project will also
pursue a long-term strategy which will begin to build the necessary framework for effective management of
national parks and nature reserves in Cameroon and will act as a catalyst for complementary biodiversity
protection projects supported by the international NGOs and the international donor community. In this
respect, the project will strengthen key national institutions concerned with research, planning and
coordination of biodiversity conservation activities as well as local communities. The project will focus on
six sensitive ecological regions including ten national parks, faunal reserves and ungazetted sites
representative of the country's biological diversity: Mount Kilum/Ijim Reserve; Mount Koupe; Mount
Cameroon rain forest; the Campo-Ma'an Faunal Reserve; the Southeastern Region including the Boumba-
Bek, Lac Lobeke and Nki Faunal Reserves; and the Savannah Ecosystem region including three national
parks (Faro, Bouda-Ndjidda and Benoue). The experience gained in these protected areas will form the
basis for developing participatory management systems to be replicated over time in other reserves.
B. Project Description
2.2    The project would principally support activities to be undertaken within and around the six project
areas leading to gazettment and subsequent establishment of an effective management regime for core
conservation zones within each project area. Activities financed by the project will include:
(a)    completion of baseline biological and sociological studies;
(b)    survey and demarcation of reserve boundaries and development of intemal zoning plans;
(c)    establishment of basic infrastructure for reserve management and training of local
personnel;
(d)    development or enhancement of community participation, public awareness and
environmental awareness programs;
(e)    development of management plans for core areas;
(f)    preparation of legal documents for gazettment;
(g)    definition of long term ecological and sociological monitoring programs;
(h)    support to communities for local land management planning; assistance in developing
marketing programs for non-timber forest products; and
(i)   technical support for microenterprise development for ecologically compatible industries
(e.g. beekeeping, animal husbandry, wood carving, paper making, etc.)



The Project                                                                            11
2.3    At the national level, the project would strengthen key institutions concemed with biodiversity
research and provide resources to improve their ability to fulfill their mandate. This would include support
to the CNH to extend their program for botanical inventories, surveys and publication of results. The
project would also support a zoological survey program developed by the IVZR and WCS to undertake
surveys and basic population studies of threatened fauna as well as important game species to lead toward
development of biologically based harvest regulations.
2.4    The project would also provide modest support to strengthen the existing conservation infomiation
management unit within DWPA and improve its capacity to maintain and disseminate information derived
from faunal and floristic inventories, legal and policy studies, baseline biological and sociological studies,
and management planning exercises undertaken in the course of the project. This unit would serve as an
information resource for MINEF and other sectoral ministries on the status of biodiversity conservation
programs nationwide. Activities would include monitoring the status of threatened animal and plant
species, tracking the development and promulgation of local regulations conceming use and harvest of
forest resources and tracking progress on the preparation and implementation of management plans for the
project sites and other conservation areas in Cameroon. Under the coordination of the DWPA, the MINEF
Department of Legal Affairs will participate in development of local bylaws and regulations for forest use
and the MINEF Department of Environment will monitor application of the environmental mitigation plan.
Issuance of the decree on Regime de la Faune (Annex 1) will be a condition of Grant effectiveness
(para. 5.2 (a)).
C. Project Components
1.    Site-Specific Interventions
1.1    Mount Kilum-Ijim Forest (120 kln2)
2.5    The project goals are to ensure sustainable management of natural resources in the area of Mount
Kilum (Oku) and Ijim ridge and the conservation and restoration of the remaining montane forest
ecosystem. This project enters its second five-year phase with technical assistance provided by Birdlife
International and financial support from WWF and ODA. Principal activities proposed under the project
will include:
(a)    Establishment of the Mount Kilum-Ijim Forest as a Protected Area (Zone a Ecologie
Fragile) managed with local community participation and development of a management
strategy for the conservation of the forest ecosystem and watershed. This will include
completion of boundary demarcation, gazetting of the reserve and the establishment of
mechanisms for the management of the reserve by the local communities.
(b)    Promotion of sustainable use of forest lands in the project area through the development of
soil conservation, land management and agroforestry programs, improved livestock
management and husbandry, as well as the development of small scale industries such as
wood crafts, honey production, paper making, and eco-tourism.
(c)    Ecological research on the flora and fauna of the forest ecosystem to provide the scientific
data base required for management policies and activities. Special attention will be given
to taxa endemic to the area including Tauraco bannermani, Platysteira laticincta, the



12                                                                               Chapter 2
Preuss' and Greater White-Nosed Monkeys as well as economic plant species such as
Gnidia glauca and Prunus africana.
(d)    Conservation awareness and training programs aimed at sensitizing communities within
the project area of the values of forests and the need for sustainable utilization of forest
resources. Training opportunities, including on the job training, workshops and external
training will be provided to develop the local expertise required to sustain the project. The
project will also provide opportunities for the demonstration of community involvement
and participatory approaches to protected area management which can be adopted in other
parts of the country.
2.6    GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance the completion of baseline studies concerning
the current ecological status of the forest as well as the population dynamics of endangered species found
there. The project would also support the establishment of study plots and development of a detailed plan
for long term ecological monitoring to track key indicators of change in the forest ecosystem. GEF
financing would further support the regional Land Management Commissions in the development of local
land management plans by financing formal training, underwriting workshops and providing technical
assistance such as undertaking studies to identify options for meeting local fuelwood and timber needs.
The GEF would finance local costs of boundary establishment, demarcation and maintenance for the core
forest zones in addition to the technical and legal work required for gazettment (e.g. boundary surveys,
preparation of legal decrees).  GEF would cofinance activities such as establishment of fuelwood
plantations, agroforestry and soil conservation programs, improved livestock management and ongoing
development of local micro-enterprises and environmental awareness programs.
1.2    Mount Koupe Forest (300 kM2)
2.7    The Mount Koupe project is entering its third year of operation with technical assistance provided
by Birdlife International and financial support from WWF and the European Community. The activities
supported by the Project will include:
(a)    Establishment of the Mount Koupe Forest as a Protected Area (Zone a Ecologie Fragile)
managed with local community participation and development of a management strategy
for conservation of the forest ecosystem and watershed. This will involve negotiations
with the local communities for agreement on the boundaries and usage of the resources
within the reserve and development of local regulations to govern use and enforcement.
(b)    Development and promotion of appropriate agricultural practices, including agroforestry,
to optimize use of current fannlands; sustainable utilization of forest resources through
development of alternatives for bushmeat hunting (e.g. livestock and mushroom farming)
and promotion of controlled eco-tourism.
(c)    Ecological studies on the flora and fauna of the Mount Koupe forest with particular
emphasis on avian and mammalian indicator species. Researchers from both local and
foreign research institutions will be encouraged to undertake the required studies and will
also be used to train and develop local expertise.



The Project                                                                            13
(d)    Continuation of the ongoing conservation education program to raise local perception and
appreciation of the benefits of forests. Particular attention will focus on women as a target
group in view of their special role as users and conservators of biological resources.
2.8    GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance completion of the baseline floristic and faunal
surveys as well as baseline studies necessary to define a long tenn ecological monitoring plan. GEF
financing would cover local costs of boundary establishment and demarcation and other activities related to
gazettment of the forest protection zone under a decree based on locally adopted bylaws. GEF financed
activities would include preparation of a regional eco-tourism development plan and identification of
needed investments in infrastructure and local enterprise development for its implementation. GEF would
cofinance ongoing activities in environmental education, soil and water conservation, agroforestry and
livestock management.
1.3    Mount Carneroon/Etinde Rainforest (350 kn2)
2.9    The Mount Cameroon/Etinde Rainforest Conservation Project, managed by MINEF through the
Limbe Botanic Gardens with technical assistance from Kew Botanic Gardens (under financing from ODA),
and GTZ (under financing from the Government of Germany) is, after six years of operations, entering a
new three-year project cycle (1994 - 1997). Its expanded agenda and priorities include:
(a)    completion of baseline floral and faunal inventories of the Etinde and Mokoko forests and
the Onge River area and establishment of a baseline ecological monitoring program
concerning forest dynamics for these areas;
(b)    expansion of the current program for community consultation and establishment of a
council of community representatives to participate in program planning and review;
(c)    completion of boundary negotiations with villages adjacent to the Etinde, Mokoko and
Onge forests and establishment of a zoning system for forest use that includes the
definition of core protected zones;
(d)    preparation of management plans for the forest based on covenants for forest access and
use negotiated with the local communities. This will lead to gazettment of biologically
important core areas and corridors under the new Forest Law;
(e)    delineation and demarcation of core conservation zones and other boundaries and
organization of a community based program to enforce locally defined regulations on
hunting and harvesting of forest products; and
(f)    expansion of environmental awareness and education programs to communities living in
the areas adjacent to the Etinde and Mokoko forests.
2.10   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance local costs associated with completion of
floristic and faunal inventories, development of a long range ecological monitoring program, and
institutional strengthening of the regional MINEF unit to improve capabilities for conservation and
management of the forest reserves. GEF financing would partially underwrite local costs of boundary
demarcation and maintenance for the reserves and preparation of management plans leading to their
gazettinent.  GEF would cofinance the ongoing program  of village consultation, negotiation and



14                                                                                 Chapter 2
environmental awareness building in the community. GEF financed studies would include game surveys
necessary to develop biologically sound hunting regulations. The project would also support training and
equipping of forest wardens recruited from the local population to monitor hunting and harvesting
regulations, maintain boundaries and assist in data collection for ecological monitoring studies.
1.4    Campo-Ma'an (5,000 kIn2)
2.11   Campo-Ma'an and adjacent forests comprise an area of lowland forest habitat that is broadly
acknowledged to be of exceptional global importance for the conservation of botanical diversity. Of special
significance are the few remaining unlogged areas of lowland rainforest in the region east of the Mvini and
Bongola rivers and north of the Ntem river. The area is presently under the responsibility of MINEF,
effective protection efforts are difficult because of funding constraints. Under the project, the area will be
managed by MINEF in partnership with one or two conservation-oriented NGOs with expertise in forestry
related research and rural development. The Tropenbos Foundation is a potential implementing partner if
cofinancing for long term technical assistance is available from the Government of the Netherlands. The
Government has prepared legal descriptions and maps of the project zones of the Campo-Ma'an Reserve
which indicate clearly: (i) the external boundaries of the project zone; (ii) within the project zone, areas
within which no new timber or hunting concessions will be licensed or existing concessions extended or
"gre a gre" agreements made for hunting or timber extraction, for the duration of the project, and; (iii) the
boundaries and expiration dates of existing concessions within the core conservation areas of the project.
Principal actions of the component include:
(a)   improved surveillance and control of hunting within the core conservation zones including
the establishment of guard posts on Dipikar Island and the mountainous region east of
Mvini river;
(b)    completion of necessary biological surveys including specific studies on threatened species
including sea tortoises and manatees;
(c)    socio-economic studies to assess present use pattems and sustainable harvest potential for
game and other non-timber forest products, identify options to improve agricultural
practices and living standards of local residents, and identify appropriate boundaries
between areas zoned for different uses;
(d)    extensive baseline forestry research to provide a basis for management of multiple-use
areas for sustainable timber production;
(e)   initiation of small scale, ecologically compatible community development activities to
enhance revenues from use of land and forest resources;
(f)    development and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation program  based on
relevant biological, forest management and socioeconomic parameters identified by initial
baseline studies; and
(g)    development of a land-use plan for the Campo-Ma'an project area, in consultation with the
local population, as a basis for regazettment of specific zones for biodiversity conservation
and reparation of management plans after identification of long term requirements for
management and options for sustainable development.



The Project                                                                           15
2.12   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF will cofinance the overall program in partnership with the
Govenmment of the Netherlands. Specific activities to be financed will include the necessary biological and
sociological studies to identify areas of special importance for biodiversity conservation and determine
current usage pattems of the forest by local communities of sedentary and itinerant forest dwellers.
Baseline studies would also be carried out to define long term needs for ecological monitoring within the
protected area. The project will finance boundary surveys and underwrite the costs of consultation with
local populations and preparation of management plans for core conservation zones, multiple use and
production forest zones including studies that focus on sustainable timber, non-timber forest products and
game management from the multiple-use zones. The project will also finance specialized sectoral studies
(e.g. tourism, sport hunting) that would identify investment needs to help local communities realize
increased revenue from compatible development options. Assurances have been given during
negotiations that the Government will ensure that no permanent private dwellings will be established
within the corridor area and within the core conservation zones of Campo-Ma'an (para. 5.1 (b)).
Furthermore, the Government will, not later than December 31, 1996, establish a community game
management zone within Campo-Ma'an (para. 5.1 (c)).
1.5   Savannah Ecosystem (7,300 kM2)
2.13   This component will address priority conservation objectives within the Soudanian savanna zone of
northem Cameroon at both the species and ecosystem level. Priority consideration sites include three
National Parks: the Faro, Bouda-Ndjidda and Benoue National parks. Faced with increasing population
pressure around the sites and poaching, the establishment of long-term management plans for the areas with
the participation of local populations is to be undertaken as a priority. The program, to be executed by
MINEF in participation with the Garoua Wildlife School (GWS) and technical assistance from WWF and
the French Office for Overseas Scientific Research (ORSTOM) includes three principal activities:
(a)    preparation  of original development plan, within  the framework  of Schema
d'amenagement de la zone soudano-sahelienne, based in an integrated management
approach for the Priority Project Site, including Faro, Benoue and Bouba Ndjidda
National Parks;
(b)    design and development of a pilot program to involve communities in conservation
activities and in the management of one or more game hunting zones within the Priority
Project Sites. This would include involvement of traditional authorities in mobilizing
communities, and preparation of a management plan for the community managed hunting
zone, to be undertaken in consultation with the communities and with the involvement of
GWS;
(c)   reinforcement of the park infrastructure for the three parks within the rhinoceros range.
This will include improved communications (e.g. radios and walkie-talkies) and mobility
for park personnel (e.g. vehicles, motorbikes and bicycles) to enhance enforcement against
poaching and monitoring of wildlife, in particular endangered species including the black
rhinoceros. This component would also involve development of management plans for the
parks and a recovery plan for the rhinoceros population as well as training to upgrade
management skills of park personnel; and

(d)   research on the distribution, ecology and status of the population of westem black
rhinoceros in northem Cameroon including tracking, capture and radio collaring
individuals, monitoring their movements and possible relocation of part of the herd.
2.14   GEF Financed Activities. The component would be cofinanced by the GEF and Govenmment of
France with potential participation by the Government of the Netherlands. The project would finance
necessary research to accurately detennine the present status and distribution of the rhinoceros population
and develop a recovery plan. The project would upgrade enforcement of anti-poaching actions within the
rhinoceros range and initiate a program to enlist hunting zone concessionaires and local residents in
monitoring rhinoceros populations. The project would finance training and equipping of wardens or
rangers for effective patrols, with the collaboration of GWS. On a pilot basis, the project would underwrite
baseline socioeconomic studies and community consultation to develop one or more community managed
game hunting zones. During negotiations, assurances were given by the Government that a community
game management zone will be established no later than December 31, 1996 within the Savannah
Ecosystem Priority Project Site (para. 5.1 (d)).
1.6   Southeastern Region (8,800 kM2)
2.15   The southeastern region contains three areas of high conservation importance which remained so
far unprotected: Lobeke, Boumba-Bek and Nki Faunal Reserves. Their integration into a larger protected
area, including the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park in the Central African Republic has been recommended.
The program will be implemented by MINEF in partnership with GTZ, which will provide logistical
support and coordinate overall program planning and implementation of individual program components.
GTZ would provide technical assistance to MINEF to refine the existing zoning plan into a regional land
use plan and execute required studies to identify compatible rural development options. Baseline biological
studies, reconnaissance studies and socioeconomic studies of villages adjacent to the conservation zones
will be executed by the WCS, in coordination with GTZ, and with MINEF and MINREST counterparts.
WWF, in coordination with GTZ, will provide technical assistance to MINEF to conduct boundary surveys
and demarcate the core conservation zones, train MINEF personnel in protected area management, and
deploy enforcement units. MINEF will develop management plans for the core conservation zones of
Lobeke, Boumba Bek and Nki with input from the three NGOs associated with the project (GTZ, WWF
and WCS). The program will include:
(a)    establishment of a project management and institutional framework, and provision of basic
infrastructure for execution of biological and socio-econonic baseline studies and
improved enforcement regulations and control of hunting;
(b)   implementation of basic and applied biological studies, boundary reconnaissance,
sociological studies, and consultation with the local people, leading to the preparation of
management plans for the three core conservation zones;
(c)    execution of studies to identify sustainable development options, including game
management and timber harvesting within the project that are compatible with the
management goals of the core conservation zones (such as tourism, sport hunting,
collection of non-timber forest products);
(d)   (i) development of a management plan for one or more community managed forest/hunting
zones and a modest investment plan for improvement of community infrastructure; and (ii)



The Project                                                                             17
identification and delineation of hunting zones to be managed by DWPA and preparation
of management plans for the said zones
2.16   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would cofinance this component with the Government of
Germany and France, with GEF funds specifically targeted at strengthening MINEF management capacity
within the region and underwriting baseline studies necessary for establishment of the three reserves. Other
studies financed under the project would include identification of compatible development options including
tourism, sport hunting, and improved management of timber resources. The project would also underwrite
necessary social, economic and land use studies to permit refinement of the existing "Plan de Zonage" and
preparation of a regional land use plan and analysis of long term regional development options. The project
will finance basic infrastructure, equipment and vehicles needed for project management, improved
enforcement of hunting regulations and establishing a management presence within each of the proposed
reserves. Management plans developed under the project would indicate future infrastructure investment
needs and identify recurrent cost requirements for the three proposed reserves.
2.17   For all six site-specific areas, assurances have been obtained at negotiations that within six
months of MINEF approval of management plans developed under the project, the Government will
prepare and issue necessary regulatory texts to gazette or regazette the Protected Areas in the
Priority Project Sites in conformity with such management plans (para. 5.1 (f)). Also, the extension of
current or the issuance of new logging or hunting concessions in the core conservation zone within the
Priority Project Sites will be prohibited until the project has been completed (para. 5.1 (e)).
2.    Actions at the National Level
2.1    Botanical Surveys and Inventories.
2.18   The CNH, in collaboration with Kew Botanic Gardens and the French National Museum of
Natural History (Musee National d'Histoire Naturelle, MNHN) would undertake research needed to
document botanical diversity within the project zones and elsewhere in Cameroon through field surveys and
inventories, preparation and identification of reference specimens and publication of scientific results
through the Flore du Cameroun series. In addition to the assessment of botanical diversity within the
project areas, the collaborating institutions would also undertake reconnaissance surveys in other areas
identified as being of high potential importance for global and national biodiversity conservation. These
would include areas of the Takamanda highlands, the Rumpi Hills, the Bakossi Mountains, the coastal
zones of Douala-Edea and the Rio del Rey estuary. The purpose is to identify gaps in the existing protected
area network and to progress toward a systematic understanding of the distribution and status of botanical
diversity on a national scale.
2.19   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance modest renovation of facilities, essential
equipment and materials for botanical specimen collection, preparation, identification and curation as well
as information management and dissemination. It would also finance vehicles, equipment and local
operating costs associated with carrying out the program of field surveys, inventories and ecological
assessments. It would furthermore finance technical assistance for the design and execution of field
surveys and upgrading of professional skills of herbarium taxonomists and technicians through an
academic exchange program with Kew Botanic Gardens and the MNHN. The GEF would support part of
the ongoing publication costs for the Flore du Cameroun under an existing agreement between CNE,
MNHM and Kew Botanic Gardens.

2.2    Zoological Surveys and Inventories
2.20   There is an acute need for information concerning the status and distribution of faunal diversity in
Cameroon. Under the project, the national zoological survey program recently established with USAID
funding for one year, will be extended to undertake reconnaissance surveys of project sites and other
priority areas for documenting faunal diversity. Studies on the population dynamics of important game
species occurring within the proposed reserves and within the areas designated as multiple use zones will be
initiated. The overriding goal is to build knowledge that can ensure a rational biological basis for
regulation of game harvesting within the project areas. This programn will be carried out under a
cooperative agreement between the IRZV, WCS and the DWPA. Specific goals of the program over the
first three years would be: (i) to develop credible species lists for project sites and define long term studies
aimed at understanding population dynamics of target species; (ii) to complete reconnaissance surveys of
five additional areas of potential biological importance; (iii) to initiate population studies and an analysis of
hunting pressure for selected game species in order to establish a biological basis for hunting regulations.
2.21   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance the purchase of vehicles and equipment, and
necessary field costs to carry out the surveys. Funds would also be provided for hiring a program
coordinator with experience in conducting faunal inventories as well as with the design and execution of
population studies of forest dwelling mammals. The GEF will also finance training of IRZV and DWPA
staff in collection and analysis of zoological survey data and geographic information management system
applications, and provide funding for building renovation and purchase of equipment and supplies to
establish and maintain a research reference collection of Cameroonian fauna.
2.3    Baseline Surveys and Monitoring
2.22   The overall project goal is to ensure the continuing ecological integrity of the areas established for
biodiversity conservation. To accomplish this goal, the long term survival of the plant and animal species
which comprise this diversity must be assured. Biological monitoring and evaluation are, therefore,
integral components of project design and execution. A second aspect of program perfomiance which is
crucial to achieving the overall goal concems the success of establishing the conservation programs within
the local physical, cultural, and socioeconomic milieu in which they are embedded. The need to monitor
both the biological and sociological dimensions of project implementation is clear. Because of the short
(four year) time frame for implementation of the first phase of the project, the emphasis during this phase is
on the completion of crucial baseline studies to ascertain the status of biodiversity within the project areas.
Given the novel approach taken by the project in developing participatory management regimes that are
legally based on local bylaws and covenants, there is a special need to monitor the process of community
participation throughout the development and implementation of the management plans. Key objectives of
the baseline studies are to: (i) identify and collect background biological and socio-economic information
allowing for the development of predictive monitoring and trends analysis and the evaluation of
management scenarios; (ii) identify specific indicators to be monitored and; (iii) develop a monitoring plan
for each of the project areas that can be maintained by local project management authorities.
2.23   In the course of carrying out biological surveys and inventories, project personnel will identify both
the key elements (species, ecological associations, community types) of the conservation program and the
monitorable indicators which can be used to track their status. The actual parameters measured and
sampling protocols that are instituted will be highly site specific and can only emerge from baseline studies.



The Project                                                                            19
Definition of a long term monitoring and evaluation plan is a key element of the work program for each of
the local site management authorities during the first phase of the project.
2.24   The focus of the monitoring and evaluation program for social issues during the initial phase will
be to carefully document the process of community consultation and to track progress in developing
community involvement in the management of reserve areas. Particular attention will be given to: (i)
documenting the process of negotiations with local communities to establish reserve boundaries and
develop bylaws governing use and access to community forests, (ii) the establishment and functioning of
local steering committees and community councils and the role they play in reserve management, and (iii)
monitoring progress in local land management planning achieved under the pilot programs for the regions
surrounding Mount Kilum/Ijim, Mount Koupe, Mount Cameroon, and the Campo-Ma'an Reserve.
Further, the project will track participation of various community segments such as women, artisans,
hunters and traditional authorities in the project. Special sectoral studies financed under the project such as
analyses of tourism development potential for the Campo-Ma'an and Mount Koupe regions and the
analysis of options to increase wood production in the Mount Kilum/Ijjim region will include assessment of
possible impacts on various comnmunity segments (e.g. women, craftsman, hunters) and their social and
economic implications.
2.25   GEF Financed Activities. The GEF would finance: (i) biological inventories and studies on the
physical characteristics of the reserves; (ii) socio-economic surveys and consultation with local populations
with the goals of involving individuals and groups more closely with conservation activities and identifying
alternative economic projects; (iii) detailed management plans integrating the needs of the local
communities with the sustainable management of natural resources; and (iv) local educational and
sensitization activities on conservation and natural resource management. The baseline survey program
would principally be carried out by the local site authorities with support from the Working Group and the
collaborating conservation-related NGOs. The role of NGOs would be to work with the local site
authorities and the Working Groups to define requirements for baseline studies, identify key indicators to
be monitored and agree on an appropriate fornat and intervals for reporting of results.
2.4    Capacity Building
2.26   Training. A major task for the Project Working Group (para. 3.1) will be planning and managing
the training of MINEF staff to participate in the project. The project coordinator and other key staff
nominated by MINEF will participate in an initial training program on project management, including Bank
policies and procedures, prior to project effectiveness, financed through the Project Preparation Advance
(PPA). Under a local consulting contract, financed by the PPA, Government is currently evaluating the
long-term training needs of the DWPA and other relevant Departments within the Ministry in relation to
project implementation, and propose a three-year training program for approval by MINEF and the World
Bank. While a thorough training needs assessment has not yet been done, it is expected that this training
program would include: (i) continuing training and support to MINEF staff on administrative and financial
management; (ii) training for field officers (Forestry and Wildlife) to familiarize them with the new Forest
Law and policy on community participation in protected area management; (iii) specialized training for a
Conservation Education Officer; and (iv) specialized training for a Conservation Information Officer. One
of the key responsibilities of the NGOs will be to transfer knowledge to central and local levels to enable
them to take over site management in the long-termn.
2.27   Conservation Information Management. The project would also strengthen capacity of the
Studies and Planning Service (SPS) within the DWPA to manage information derived from faunal and

floristic inventories and surveys, legal and policy studies, information on gazettment status and boundaries
of reserves nationwide and the status of development and implementation of management plans for the
project sites. Before the end of this four year project phase, the Working Group will, in conjunction with
the botanical and zoological survey units, prepare an overview of the status of conservation of biodiversity
in Carneroon and a prioritization of future needs. Equipment, operating, training and associated travel
costs, in addition to short term technical assistance for the SPS, will be provided under the project.
D. Project Costs and Financing
1.     Cost Estimates
2.28   Total project costs over four years, including all incremental capital and operating expenditures are
estimated at US$12.4 million of which US$4.98 million, or 40.2 percent, is foreign exchange. Estimates
are based on prices prevailing in March 1994 and exclude taxes and duties. They include US$1.72 million
equivalent in physical and price contingencies. Physical contingencies have been included at the rate of 10
percent on all base costs, excluding technical assistance, studies, training and incremental operating costs.
Price contingencies are based on the Bank's projected increase of international and local prices. Total
physical and price contingencies amount to about 16.0 percent of the base costs. Project costs are
summarized below.

2.30   The proposed GET grant equivalent to US$6.0 million will finance approximately 48 percent of
total costs, including US$3.90 million equivalent of local costs. It will bear most of the costs incurred to
promote institutional strengthening at national level (74 percent) and the following portions at local
site/component level: (a) Savannah Ecosystem, 25 percent; (b) Kilum/Ijim Mountain Forest, 46 percent; (c)
Mount Koupe forest, 58 percent; (d) Mount Cameroon/Etinde, 78 percent; (e) Campo-Ma'an Reserve, 44
percent; (f) Southeastern Region, 46 percent; (g) Botanical surveys, 78 percent; and, (h) Zoological
surveys, 80 percent.
2.31   For each component co-financed either with other donors or the Government, financing is
partitioned by disbursement categories. The different financiers, including GEF and the Government, will
finance 100 percent of the categories in which they intervene. The purpose is to enable procurement and
disbursements to proceed efficiently and swiftly rather than risk potential delays from the need to conform
to different sets of rules within the same disbursement category.
2.32   Several donors will participate in the co-financing.  The Government of France and the
Government of the Netherlands will co-finance activities in the Savannah Ecosystem component
representing 41 percent and 28 percent, respectively, of the total costs of the component. The Govermment
of Germany will co-finance the activities in the Southeastem region (50 percent of the total costs), The
Govemment of the Netherlands will co-finance the activities in the Campo-Ma'an Reserve (51 percent of
total) and the Govemment of Great Britain, through ODA and Birdlife Intemational, will cofinance
activities for the Mount Kilum/Ijim and Mount Koupe components representing 49 percent and 29 percent,
respectively, of the total costs. The Govermnent of Cameroon (GOC) will finance 30 percent of the
incremental recurrent costs, representing 8 percent of the total costs.
2.33   Project Preparation Advance. An SDR 100,000 PPA, US$140,000 equivalent, was granted to
the Govemnent of Cameroon to assist in project preparation. The PPA financed preliminary field studies,
consultations with local communities, environmental impact assessment studies as well as preliminary
training of key project personnel.

3.    Project Impact on Government Budget
2.34   The Government's Public Investment Program will earmark an amount of CFA franc (CFAF) 100
million (US$ 140,000 equivalent) per year for the duration of the project. However, this amount will mostly
come from MINEF's re-deployment of personnel and re-allocation of expenditures without any net increase
of the overall investment and recurrent budget.

The Project                                                                         23
been completed, which notes the problem of a fragmented and overly regulated procureinent process in
Cameroon.
2.37   Civil Works. The infrastructure to be constructed and/or renovated under the project consists of
small buildings, shelters, tracks, etc. To the extent possible infrastructure will be bulked to amounts above
US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of US$530,000 equivalent and procured using ICB
procedures consistent with those set forth in sections I and II of the Guidelines of May 1992. Small civil
works costing between US$25,000 and US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of US$133,000,
will be procured using LCB procedures. These contracts will be procured under bidding advertised locally
in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Bank, provided that: (i) 45 days minimum shall be
allowed between the availability of bid documents and the bid submission deadline; (ii) all bids are opened
in public and bidders' representatives shall be allowed to be present; (iii) precise bid evaluation and post-
qualification criteria shall be defined in the bid documents; (iv) foreign companies shall not be requested to
obtain registration, income tax and social security clearances to participate in the bidding process; (v)
award shall be made to the lowest evaluated bid; (vi) before rejection of any low bid the Bank will be
consulted, and (vii) standard bidding documents will be cleared with the Bank before application of this
procedure.
2.38   Goods. Vehicles, equipment and supply contracts exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, up to an
aggregate amnount of US$586,000 will be procured through ICB in accordance with procedures consistent
with those set forth in Sections I and JI of the Guidelines of May 1992, and will be bulked annually above
US $50,000 equivalent. Under ICB procurement of goods, goods manufactured in Cameroon will be
allowed a preference margin of 15 percent or an amount equivalent to customs duties which ever is less, as
per Bank guidelines. For contracts between US$25,000 and US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount of
US$40,000, LCB procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and consistent with those described for
civil works in paragraph 2.29 above, will be used. Procurement of goods for less than US$25,000 per
contract and up to an aggregate amount of US$40,000 will be procured through prudent shopping
(international or local), on the basis of comparison of price quotations of at least three suppliers eligible
under the Guidelines and in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. A standard letter for
seeking price quotations and applicable conditions shall be agreed with the Bank, prior to any procurement
action.
2.39   Consultancies and Training. The strengthening of MINEF and MINREST and the establishment
and upgrading of protected areas will be supported by twinning arrangements with specialized international
NGO institutions. Birdlife International, with six years of program development experience in the
Bamenda Highlands has built a rapport with traditional leaders and villagers which is the basis for project
success in the realm of community involvement. WWF with fifteen years of continuous involvement in the
conservation sector in Cameroon is locally acknowledged for its leadership in program planning and design.
WCS has an ongoing partnership with MINREST in building national capacity for faunal research with the
involvement of individual researchers with years of experience in studying the Cameroonian fauna. GTZ
has long experience of collaboration with the Government in institution building.  Technical and
management support from these institutions will be procured through sole source procedures, up to an
aggregate amount of US$1,624,000 equivalent, because of their unique capabilities which could not be
duplicated by externally recruited consultants within the short, three year time horizon of the project. At
central level, GTZ will assist DWPA in establishing, maintaining and operating a unit responsible for
accounting and procurement, through a time based contract, up to an amount not exceeding US$40,000.
At the same time and with similar procedures, WWF will provide general guidance and counseling on
biodiversity conservation objectives, strategies and methods up to an amount not exceeding US$40,000.

WWF will also support the Savannah Ecosystem conservation component, execute reconnaissance studies
and provide input to management plan development in the Lobeke, Boumba Bek and Nki areas for an
amount not exceeding US$72,000 and US$324,000, respectively. WCS will execute baseline biodiversitv
and socioeconomic studies, provide input for management plan development for the three core zones, and
assist IVZR in design and execution of the zoological surveys program for amounts not exceeding
US$298,000 and US$215,000, respectively. Birdlife International will be responsible for the management
of the Mount Kilum-Ijim and Mount Koup6 components up to amounts not exceeding, respectively,
US$340,000 and US$200,000. Botanical surveys will be executed under a long-standing trilateral
agreement among the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, and the Mus6e National d'Histoire Naturelle in
Paris and CNH under a contract administered by the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew for an amount not
exceeding US$90,000. Execution of contracts satisfactory to the Bank with selected non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) responsible for project implementation will be a condition of Grant
effectiveness (para. 5.2 (b)).
2.40   Additional short term consultants and studies as well as training services, encompassing a wide
range of expertise not included in the previous management contracts, up to an aggregate of respectively
US$904,000 and US$364,000 will be procured in accordance with principles and procedures described in
the Bank's guidelines of August 1981 on the basis of a short list of qualified firms/consultants/institutions.
2.41   Miscellaneous. An amount equivalent to US$162,000 has been earmarked for the financing of
small economic and social activities in the multipurpose zones surrounding the protected areas. Because of
the limited value of the activities (less than US$25,000 equivalent) procurement will be done through
shopping or government procedures, acceptable to the Bank. These funds will be managed by the
conservation-related NGOs associated with the project and disbursements will be made only for agreed
expenditures included in the Bank-approved annual work programns.
2.42  Incremental operating and maintenance costs corresponding to incremental casual labor, travel
costs and allowances, utilities, annual office supplies, communications, vehicles and equipment operation
and maintenance up to an aggregate amount of US$1,558,000, will be procured through shopping or
government procedures, acceptable to the Bank. However, annual budgetary limits will be set and agreed
with the Bank before such expenditures are allowed. Criteria for travel costs and allowances will be set
forth in the implementation manual.
2.43   The project Procurement and Implementation Schedules as well as the Consultancies Plan are
indicated in Annexes 2, 3 and 4 respectively. The use of the Bank's standard bidding documents and
standard forms for all contracts has been agreed during negotiations (para. 5.1 (g))
2.44   Review of Procurement Decisions. Bank prior review will be needed for all contracts of civil
works and goods estimated to cost more than US$25,000 equivalent. The Bank's prior review will cover
advertising, draft bidding documents, bid evaluation, award proposals and draft contracts. Bank prior
review will cover about 95 percent of contracts. Other forrns of procurement of goods and works will be
subject to random review by the Bank after contract award. All management, consulting services and
training contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than US$25,000 each with firms and US$15,000
with individuals will be subject to prior review by the Bank of the short list (if the case), letter of invitation,
terms of reference, evaluation of technical and price proposals submitted by consultants, award proposal,
draft contract and final contract. Assurances have been given at negotiations that the Government will
employ procedures for review of procurement decisions and provide procurement information acceptable to
the Bank.

2.45   Procurement Information. Procurement infornation will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)    prompt reporting of contract awards and supply of two certified copies of the signed
contract to the Bank; and
(b)    comprehensive quarterly reports for each component will be submitted to DWPA who will
consolidate the information into semi-annual reports to be sent to the Bank. Quarterly and
semi-annual reports will indicate: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the
total project including estimates for physical and price contingencies; (ii) revised timing of
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract awards and completion time
for individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of
procurement; and,
5.     Disbursement
2.46   The GET grant of US$6.0 million will be disbursed over a 4.5 year period starting July 1995. The
schedule of disbursements is based on the standard Cameroonian disbursement profile for
agricultural/environment projects (August 1993), adjusted to take into account the expected four year life
of the project.
2.47   The proceeds of the GET grant will be disbursed as follows:

2.48   Disbursements will be fully documented. All expenditures above US$25,000 equivalent and all
foreign expenditures whatever their amount, will be eligible for direct payment by the Bank. All categories
of expenditures below US$25,000 equivalent will be eligible for reimbursement from a Special Account on
the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE). Provision has been made under the project for the design
and operation, within MINEF and within each component, of an efficient and effective accounting system.
Adequate provision for annual audit of the accounts has also been made to be paid by the Grant.
Documentation of SOEs will be made available for review by Bank supervision missions and auditors. No
withdrawals for the Campo-Ma'an and Savannah Ecosystem Components will be made until the
Grant Agreement between the Government of Cameroon and the Government of the Netherlands for
those components has become effective and a satisfactory contract with a NGO responsible for their
implementation has been signed (para. 5.3).
2.49   To expedite disbursements, a Special Account equivalent to US$200,000 and representing about
four months of eligible expenditures, will be opened in a commercial bank in Yaounde on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank and managed by the Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement. An amount of
US$200,000 will be withdrawn from the GET Grant Account at the time of effectiveness to constitute the
initial deposit. The Special Account will be replenished on a quarterly basis or when it is reduced to one
third of its original amount, whichever comes first, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of disbursements
for eligible expenditures. Should any disbursements be made for items not eligible, the Government will be
required to reimburse the corresponding amount.
2.50   A project account in local currency, operated by DWPA, will also be established in a commercial
bank acceptable to the Bank, with an initial deposit by Government of CFAF 10 million to cover the
Government's contribution to project expenditures. This account will be replenished by Government on a
quarterly basis or when it is reduced to one third of its original amount, whichever comes first.
Establishment of a Project Account and evidence that the Government has deposited thereinto an
amount of CFAF 10 million will be a condition of Grant effectiveness (para. 5.2 (c)).
6.    Financial Management, Accounting, Audit and Reporting
2.51   Financial Management and Accounting. For each component of the project, and for the project
as a whole, separate accounts will be maintained consistent with sound accounting practices, which will
reflect, in accordance with international accounting standards, the situation of the component/project. The
DWPA will be responsible for consolidating the accounts and preparing financial statements, disbursement
applications and records, and withdrawal applications, on the basis of information supplied by all
components. Because of the relative inexperience of DWPA with Bank procedures, provision has been
made under the project for strengthening DWPA capacity for financial management by secondment of
adequate personnel from other services of MINEF, design of a computerized accounting and budgetary
system, training of personnel, and support from GTZ for the operation of the system. MINEF has

seconded an accountant and a procurement officer with profile and qualifications acceptable to the Bank to
this unit. The project coordinator will be authorized to approve expenditure from the Special Account up
to a limit of CFAF 5 million.
2.52   Audit. Accounts of DWPA and other executing agencies will be audited by qualified independent
audit firms under procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Audited accounts and reports (short form report,
special report on the utilization of the GEF grant and the management letter) will be submitted to the Bank
for review within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit will include specific verification of
the legitimacy of all expenditures and an opinion on the reliability of the SOE procedures and the utilization
of goods and services financed under the project. The auditors will also provide a long form report
including detailed comments on the accounting and financial system and an assessment of the operational
efficiency of the project and its components. Assurances that the Government will have accounts of the
executing agencies audited each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and an
audit report prepared, in a form acceptable to the Bank, and sent to the Bank within six months after
the end of each project year were obtained at negotiations (para. 5.1 (h)).



3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.1    Project Management. The lead implementing agency for the project will be MINEF. MINEF
will be responsible for overall project coordination, supervision and administration.  Direct project
management will rest primarily with a Working Group attached to DWPA. This unit will be responsible
for preparing annual work plans and budgets, managing the GEF grant, monitoring and evaluating project
implementation, along with the agreed schedule (see Annex 3) and liaising with the NEMP. Its work
program will also include legal and policy work relating to the establishment of protected areas under
community management, establishment and operation of a documentation center and environmental
information system relating to biodiversity and wildlife management issues in Cameroon, planning and
implementing a program of conservation awareness at the national level, monitoring the ecological, social
and economic impacts of the project, and monitoring the implementation of the project environmental
mitigation plan. A staff member at the Deputy Director level has been assigned as the full-time project
coordinator and will report to the Director of DWPA.
3.2   The project coordinator will be responsible for overall program planning, management and
supervision. In addition, he/she will be responsible for being a liaison with NGOs, other government
agencies and the NEMP Secretariat on issues related to biodiversity conservation. Other staff will include:
(i) an Accountant and a Procurement Officer responsible for financial and administrative, budget
preparation and execution, and procurement; and; (ii) a senior technical officer responsible for monitoring
and evaluation, and technical review of work programs developed by the Site Management Units (SMUs)
for each project site (para. 3.6). In addition, two staff within the DWPA will also be assigned to the
Working Group, one to work on conservation education and one on information management. Other staff
from DWPA, the Forestry Department, the Division of Legal Affairs, and the Environment Department
may be assigned to the Working Group on a part-time basis. In addition, DPWA will provide the services
of a secretary and three drivers to meet the logistical needs of the Working Group. It will also provide the
necessary office space, and share in the cost of fumishings and utilities. During negotiations, it was
agreed that the Government will maintain a full-time working group for Project administration and
coordination under the supervision of the Project Coordinator as described above with qualifications
and experience acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.1 (a)). Assurances have also been obtained that, as a
condition of Grant effectiveness, the Government will provide an annual work plan and budget,
including a training program and a field staff deployment schedule for each part of the Project, for
the calendar year 1995, acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.2 (d)).
3.3    Technical assistance from the participating NGOs will provide support to MINEF for conservation
planning, program design and project monitoring and evaluation.  In addition, short-term technical
consultancies will assist the Working Group with specialized input on: (i) legal and policy aspects of
protected areas establishment; (ii) local community participation in protected area planning and
management; (iii) ecological and sociological dimensions of project monitoring and evaluation. Training
will be provided to improve skills of senior MINEF staff in areas relevant to project planning and
administration. The Working Group will organize workshops and ad hoc workshops for the SMUs on
management plan development; community participation; environmental education and public awareness;
ecological monitoring; and local land use planning and land management.
3.4    Reporting. The Working Group will submit each year, no later than December, for the Bank's
review and approval, the annual work program and budget, including a training program and staff
deployment schedule for the forthcoming year. The Working Group will also prepare semi-annual progress
reports to be submitted to the Government and to the Bank, following review by the Technical Steering
Committee. The reports, based on mandatory quarterly reports for the components and on regular field



Project Implementation                                                                   29
visits, will assess progress of operations against the agreed program and include a review of procurement
activities. Progress reports will be sent to the Bank within three months after the end of the period
reported. They will serve as a basis for Bank supervision mission (see supervision schedule, Annex 5). The
DWPA will furthermore be responsible for the preparation of a mid-term review report not later than
December 1996 (PY2) and a project completion report within six months of the project closing date. At
negotiations, assurances were obtained on the above reporting procedures (para. 5.2 (d)).
3.5    Workshops. The Working Group is also expected to conduct four annual workshops (including a
project launch workshop) involving staff from all the project sites and participating institutions. These
workshops, to be planned and managed by the project team, will provide an opportunity for experiences to
be shared among staff from different sites and for mutual support to be planned among different
components. The final workshop, towards the end of Project Year 4, will provide a basis for evaluating the
achievements of the GEF pilot project and determining the areas, if any, in which subsequent support may
be needed to ensure sustainable management of globally significant biodiversity resources in Cameroon. In
addition, the Working Group will organize workshops at the provincial level in the four provinces
participating in the project. These workshops will allow for a closer coordination of project activities
within the same ecological and socio-cultural framework, and will permit provincial and local field staff of
MINEF to follow project activities more closely. These workshops will be planned by the Working Group
in close collaboration with the Provincial Delegates of MINEF and the local authorities.
3.6    Monitoring. The Working Group will be responsible for monitoring project implementation
progress as well as project ecological, social, and economic impacts, along the agreed schedule (Annex 3).
Project implementation will be monitored through regular (quarterly) reports from the project sites. The
Working Group will prepare a consolidated report on a semi-annual (six month) basis, which will serve as
the basis for GEF project supervision. These reports will also include a review of procurement activities.
Progress reports will be sent to the Bank within three months after the end of the period reported.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that a mid-term review will be carried out jointly with the
Bank before December 31, 1996 to assess progress made in the execution of the project, and
promptly thereafter, implement their recommendations (para. 5.1 (k)). The Working Group will be
responsible for preparing the mid-term review and prepare an implementation completion report within six
months of the grant closing date. The mid-term review shall cover, inter alia: (i) legal, regulatory and
institutional changes executed and planned; (ii) management of the Priority Project Sites and quality and
adequacy of staff; (iii) kind and quality of local participation in management of Protected Areas and the
execution of altemative activities; (iv) definition of the share of the Recipient's contribution to cover the
operating expenses of the Project; (v) review of adequacy of indicators for monitoring and evaluating the
Project's progress in relation to the achievement of its objectives with particular emphasis on changes in
biodiversity and socio-economic behavior of the population concemed, and definition of a program for the
application of said indicators during the remaining completion period of the Project; and (vi) review of the
results of the NEMP relating to biodiversity conservation and modalities of their implementation.
3.7    The Botanical Studies Program. This component will be managed and administered by CNH
with technical assistance provided under an inter-institutional agreement between CNH, Kew Botanic
Gardens and the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. A Project Operations Committee will be
established with representative of the three collaborating institutions.
3.8    The Zoological Studies Program.  This component will be carried out under the existing
agreement between IRZV and WCS. A Project Operations Committee will be established with membership
drawn from DWPA, IRZV, GWS, WCS and WWF.



30                                                                               Chapter 3
3.9   Site Management. Each of the six Priority Project Sites is to be managed by an SMU under the
administrative supervision of MINEF but with considerable autonomy with regards to program
management and execution. Local site steering committees will be established to ensure meaningful
participation of all relevant stakeholders in site specific project design and periodic review. Each SMU is
comprised of a MINEF representative (conservator or regional officer) and management advisor(s)
sponsored by donor agencies or NGOs. The Working Group will liaise with the SMUs through the
respective provincial services of DPWA. MINEF will ensure that adequate numbers of suitably qualified
field staff are assigned to each of the project sites for the duration of the project.
3.10   The two-year old Mount Koupe Project is, at present, jointly financed by the EU, WWF and
Birdlife International. Under the project, the reserve will be managed by Birdlife International staff in
collaboration with regional personnel of MINEF and MINAG. In the case of the Kilum-Ijim Mountain
Forest Project, presently entering its sixth year of operation, community participation in project design and
implementation will be effected through the Regional Land Management Commissions established by the
Fons of Oku (Kilum) and Kom (Ijim) with representation of the appropriate sectoral agencies (Agriculture,
Forestry, Social Affairs) by the appropriate regional or district officers. The Kilum/Ijim Mountain Forest
Project staff, presently financed by Birdlife International, WWF, and ODA would continue to coordinate
part of project activities such as research and soil conservation programs. The local Land Commissions
would assume a larger role in land management planning, and development and enforcement of local
bylaws regulating use of the forest estate. The Mount Cameroon Rainforest Conservation Project has been
underway for three years, managed by the Limbe Botanic Gardens under the administration of the regional
office of MINEF with technical assistance and partial financing provided by ODA and GTZ. The
management of the component will be based on already established local steering committee with
representation of the Department of Forestry, local government, Kew Botanic Gardens and Limbe Botanic
Gardens. It will also include other government sectoral agencies as well as traditional leaders and other
representatives of local communities. The Campo-Ma'an Reserve is currently under the management of
MINEF. Under the project, it will be managed with technical and financial assistance provided by the
Government of the Netherlands. The model developed in the Mount Cameroon Project for consultation
with local villages and establishment of village committees and a council representing these communities
will be followed at Campo-Ma'an. The proposed reserves of Lobeke, Boumba Bek and Nki in the
Southeastem Region exist only on maps. During preparation, consultation with local residents began
within the Lobeke region. The program will initially be managed by regional management units established
within MINEF, in partnership with WCS and WWF. This unit will establish a local steering committee
and define a community participation process.
3.11   Specialized technical assistance for design of research needed to develop a black rhinoceros
recovery plan will be sought from an appropriately qualified international NGO. The research program
will be carried out in cooperation with MINREST and GWS. Preparation or updating of management
plans for the three parks (Faro, Bouba Njidda, Benoue) included in this component will be done by MINEF
with technical assistance provided by WWF. Baseline studies and design of a pilot project for local
community participation in management of one or more hunting zones within the project region will be
undertaken jointly by MINEF and the GWS with specialized technical input from ORSTOM or another
appropriately qualified institution.
3.12   Environmental Mitigation Plan. The environmental analysis carried out for this project has
identified a number of mitigating measures that have been incorporated in the plans for each site-specific



Project Implementation                                                                31
component.  The Environment Department within MINEF has the responsibility to monitor the
implementation of this mitigation plan. A training workshop will be organized during Project Year 1 for
Environment Department staff and colleagues who may be associated with this monitoring exercise.
Regular field visits will be conducted and annual reports prepared on the implementation of the
environmental mitigation plan (Annex 6). Agreement on the execution of the environmental mitigation
agreed measures outlined in the Project Environmental Assessment was reached at negotiations
(para. 5.1 (m)).
3.13   National Coordination. Intenninisterial coordination will be assured through a Technical Steering
Committee (TSC), chaired by the Secretary General of MINEF and comprised of membership at
Department Director or Division Chief rank from the Departments of Forestry, DWPA, Environment and
the Division of Legal Affairs within MINEF and include appropriate representatives from the Ministries of
Finance and Scientific Research such as the Director of IVZR and the Director of CNH. The TSC will
also include representatives of NGO partner organizations, academic and research institutions involved in
implementation of project components. The TSC will meet not less frequently than every six months to
review and approve annual work plans and to monitor progress in project implementation. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that prior to Grant effectiveness, the Government will establish a TSC
to be chaired by the Secretary General of MINEF with membership, functions and responsibilities
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.2 (e)).
3.14   Legal and Institutional Issues. The principal actions undertaken by the project will involve the
preparation of management plans and decrees for gazettment of conservation areas and community or
council forests. Through the SPS, the project will track inputs (including specially commissioned studies),
costs and outputs (e.g. decrees) to document the process of legal establishment of the reserves. The project
will document both the process and the products of the dialogues with local communities conceming the
development, enactment and enforcement of local bylaws and covenants. This is recognized as one of the
more innovative aspects of the project; documenting the lessons leamed in the process is seen as a priority
for GEF. Conceming institutional development, the performance goals for the botanical and zoological
research components are built into the work plans for these units. Including an extemal review of their
performance will be part of the mid-term project review. Performance of the SPS will principally be
reflected in the quality of the overview of national priorities for biodiversity conservation to be produced
during year three of the project. This document would be produced under guidelines approved by the TSC
and submitted to formal peer review in advance of public release.
3.15   Contractual Arrangements. In addition to management and technical contracts designed to
support the Working Group, the following contracts/conventions will be established as a means to help
DWPA execute certain project components: (i) contract with Birdlife Intemational for activities in the
Mount Kilum-Ijimn and the Mount Koupe components; (ii) convention with WWF for activities in the
Savannah Ecosystem component; (iii) contract with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ)
in establishing and operating the DWPA unit responsible for accounting and procurements; (iv) contracts
with WCS and WWF for activities in the three core zones of the Southeastem Region component and to
strengthen the IVZR research program; (v) separate contracts with Tropenbos and the Netherlands
Development Organization (SNV) for activities in the Campo-Ma'an component; and (vi) contract with
WWF for providing general guidance and counseling to DWPA on conservation activities country-wide.



4. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Environmental Impact
4.1    The project has been assigned environmental analysis category "B". An environmental analysis
(EA) prepared by the Government evaluated potential biological and sociological impacts and concluded
that the project would have strongly positive environmental effects. Recommendations from the EA with
regard to monitoring of biological and sociological impacts have been incorporated in the overall project
design. An environmental mitigation plan (Annex 6) was prepared which indicates key actions to be
monitored for each project component. The project includes financing to enable the MINEF Department of
the Environment to monitor implementation of the plan. The design of appropriate mitigation for potential
negative impacts of site specific developments such as construction of buildings or improvements in road
infrastructure will be addressed in the course of management plan preparation for each of the project sites.
B. Project Benefits
4.2    The project aims to ensure protection of globally important biodiversity through the conservation
of forest, woodland and savanna ecosystems. The project will strengthen Government's capacity for
protected area planning and management and build on successful local experience with community based
conservation. The implementation of scientific studies for biodiversity conservation and management
through national institutions will enhance national capacity for relevant research and monitoring of
biological resources.
4.3    The project will help guarantee Cameroon and the world community perpetual access to genetic
stock, use of biota for basic research and medicinal purposes. In addition, conservation of these unique
ecosystems will have a beneficial impact on the protection and conservation of soils and maintenance of
watersheds and cultural values (conservation of the way of life of indigenous populations). Such
ecosystems have, however, a non-negligible immediate and long term economic value with respect to
promoting tourism and ensuring the livelihood of an important part of the rural population. The
importance of bush meat and forest products (fuelwood, medicinal plants, fruits, etc.) in the economy of
rural populations is well known even if existing data do not permit a quantitative assessment. On the other
hand, it is tentatively estimated that about 5 percent of the annual flow of about 100,000 foreign visitors,
are attracted to Cameroon mainly by its wildlife, traditional cultures and natural landscapes, contributing
CFAF 1 billion/year to the national economy. Annual proceeds from park visits and hunting pernits,
however, range from CFAF 100 to 150 million. Tourism represents an underdeveloped potential source of
income for Cameroon and biodiversity conservation and management is instrumental to the maintenance
and expansion of the tourism sector.
4.4    The project will promote conservation of biodiversity while seeking to encourage sustainable
harvest of renewable resources (bushmeat, fruits, fuelwood, medicines, etc.). Although economic benefits
are substantial and potentially quantifiable, reliable data on the value of these non-timber forest products
are non-existent. Therefore the effective contribution of renewable natural resources to the rural and
national economy is severely underrated. Accordingly, as a part of the monitoring activities, the project
will collect and analyze data on wildlife related tourism and other uses and on their contribution to the
economy and will promote systematic and periodical surveys to assess the importance of wildlife and other
non-timber forest products for rural populations whose livelihood is increasingly threatened by unregulated
over-exploitation of game and other renewable resources.



Environmental Analysis, Benefits and Risks                                               33
C. Project Risks
4.5    The project faces four main risks. First, the principal risk concerns the government's temptation to
generate revenue through logging. This could weaken Government's resolve to establish core protection
zones of sufficient size to maintain ecosystem processes, to enforce implementation of management plans
for sustainable logging within major forest concessions, or to grant usufruct rights to local communities at
the expense of lost revenues to the national treasury. Reforms under the new Forest Law which address
increasing stumpage fees for timber concessions should increase revenues from production forests which
would partially offset the costs of excluding core conservation areas from logging. Moreover, areas being
proposed as core protection zones are either:  (i) remote, with difficult logistics which limit their
exploitation potential; (ii) have cultural values recognized by local communities which contribute to their
protection; or, (iii) have potential for other financially rewarding forms of use which are compatible with
conservation goals (e.g. tourism, subsistence and sport hunting, harvest of non-timber forest products).
4.6    Second, a delay in issuance of an implementation decree for the recently promulgated forest law
could delay effectiveness of the GEF grant. An implementation decree has been drafted and the sections
relevant to gazettment of protected areas and other categories of state or community managed forests have
been reviewed by Bank staff with specialization in forestry and social policy. Those aspects of the draft
decree which relate to gazettment of protected areas, management plan requirements for gazetted forests
and major forest concessions, and community participation in the planning and management of biodiversity
protection zones would, if implemented, provide an effective legal basis for project implementation.
4.7    Third, the preparation and adoption of zoning plans for the reserves may proceed slowly because
involving local people in the planning process will require time. A strong project emphasis on community
consultation using techniques such as participatory rural appraisal and on raising community awareness of
environmental/conservation issues through NGO implemented public education is intended to build a sense
of project "ownership" in local communities. Significant progress in negotiating boundaries and locally
endorsed management regulations has already been made at several sites where conservation NGOs have
been involved.
4.8    Finally, the last risk concerns the inability of Government to provide sufficient counterpart funds.
The project has been designed in such a way that delays in the provision of counterpart funds will only
have a minimal impact on project implementation. Most of Government funds relate to staff salaries for
which a regular mechanism of payment exists. Moreover, Government will as a condition of effectiveness
deposit an amount of CFAF 10 million in a project account to cover its share of operating costs for the first
three months of the project and assurances have been obtained that the project would be regularly
replenished. Also, the level of counterpart funding allocated to the project will be reviewed each year as
part of the Public Investment Program.

I REMNARQUE GENERALE
Les activites definies dans le projet de conservaticn de la btodiversit6 au Cameroun pour les trois prochaines
annees concement essenriellernent la realisation de'udes bzoloziques et sociolomques des-4ees a accroitre les
connaissances sur milieu. A partir des informamions ainsi recueiUies, des plans damrennagent seront dinis.
Les trots prochaines annees seront donc destine-s a rassembler des inforniaiors de base, analyser cs
infor-mations et preparer des plans d'amrnagement Ce programme est un prograrme de conception et non de
realisation.
Aucurt financemertr n'es-t prevu pour la crearncn de a-andes infrasarucures susceptibles de nuire i
1'environnernent. tant par leur nature que par leur arnpleur.
La realisation d'tudes et la production de plans d'arniagement ne sont pas cerseos erzendrer d'inpacts
nezaifs majeurs et direc  ans la mesure ou il s'atzi essentieUlement d'un exercice de ccnception et non de
mise en oeuvre.
Des actions pilotes et des mesures d'accompagnemenit seront menees dams certaines communautis villageoises,
sur une edhelle reduite, cec. dans le but d'initier un processus de concertation et de sansibilisation des
populations. Ces actions pilatoes et mesures daccompagnement reviEent le double objecciridaitifier les
besoins des populations e. de les associer a la re?.exion en cours, facilitant plus tard la mise en oeuvre des
plans d'amenagement.
Le projea vient egalement a. renfort d'actions de preservation ea valorisation de ['envircnrement entreprises
deouis plusieurs annees sur certains sites dont on a pu meatre en ividence les resultars positifs tant vis a vis de
i'environnemnent qu'en faveur des populations locales.
Ces acions nont pas entraine d'impacts majeurs netifs tant sur le plan enviroenemntl que sur le plan
sociologique et il est logique de penser que la poursuite de ces actions ne devraient pas fraire cneorer daatues
impacts nati:a.
Tant que les plans d'amniagement n'ont pas &e  produits, il est impossible de stipuler sur les irnpacts qui
risquent d'tre engendres par ces plans.
fl faudra attndre les r6sultats des etudes et les conclusions des plans d'am6magement pour pouvoir evaluer co
que ces plans risquent d'engzendrer comme impacts sur l'environnsnert social et biolozquc.
line nouvelle EE devra alors &re produite avant la mise en route de la seconde phase, dite phase
operationnelle.
II RECOMMAUNDATIONS GENERALES
1) METHODOLOGIES DES ETUDES
Toutes les etudes de base doivent are efeczuies par une equipe multidiscplinaire comprtnzt m
anthropologiste, un environnemetaliste et un agro-conomiste. Uine tefle demarche permema une approche
holistique qui fournira les solutions les plus ad6quates. La m6thodologie employve lars des ivds  socio-
economiques fera appel aux tediiques suivanes: disCLSSion avec des groupes-cble, anvues utwaivu,
observation participative et non participative.
2) SUJIVI DE l'EVALUATION DE L'1hPACr ENVIRONNEMEiNTAL
Line Evaluation dlrrpact Envirornemeneal est un exercice essentiellement prospeaf riahs6 i partir tur
idetiication du terrain et d'une appreciation du programme dacans at t'aaivit planiNieos.
LEIE comnporte de ce fait une nuarge d'incettude qu'il est irMortarit de couvrir par un stivi de lrEvaluas
des Ipracts sur l'Envirrmetnnert Ce suivi a pour objet de sassurer qu'auam autre mpact disoa oa  iret
majeur n'apparait au cours de la phase de mise en oeuvro du projet, ou qua les impacts ides possikm
bien le degre d'importance revie au cours de 1ISM. .~ suivi permet   alement do s'assurer que I
recomnnandations du Plan Moderateur ont bien ot appliquees.
Le suivi de MIE  doit etre raflis6 par une equipe r6duite fnctionrat grice a des mecamnmnes soples.

souples pernemant de s'assurer.

- que certains ir.aczs neiatifs identifies au depart ne prennent une envergure trcp imrportante au cours
du projet.
En effet une EIE diffre d'ne veritable Etude d'Irzmact. Tine EI mobilise des moyens hurnains et financers
important et la realisacion de ['6cude peut s'&taler, suivant limporrance ea la complexiret du projet, de 6 mois a

C'est pour cela qu'il es- important de s'assurer tout au long de la reiisanion du projet de l'exactitude de
l'evaluation des imrpacts aivironnementaux.
LEIE est un exercice plus souvent realise que lE  dans les pays en voie de doveloppememt pour plusieurs
raisons:
- le manque de donnees suffisamunent fiables et acruelles sur 1'environnoement

mecanisme de fonctiommnemerit souple.
La mission principale du NPS est de faire le suivi envirormemnetal des activits du projet de facon a s'assurwr
qu'il napparait aucun nouvel impact environnernezral, non identie au depart, ou que celui-d resce sans ec
traite. Ces nouveaux imopacts peuvent resulter soit d'ume mnauvaise apprcaiaon des decs du proje ou du fait
de l'imprecision des ilimnents dfinforffation disponibles au depart ]s peuver ialeanra  provenir de
duangernats inervaus au cours de la definition teodnique du projet.
Le travail du NPS consiste 6galenent a s'assurer que les effets mninimrsatours conseilles ont bien ern mis ea
oeuvre chaque fois que cela semble necessaire.
Le NPS aairera, le cas echint, I'attetion de l'equipe de coordinaticn sur des problInes enviromemawax
meritant qu'une acoon soit envisagee.
C) STRUCrURI ET 1ECANISM
1 Composition du NPS

LeN PS sera cornpose de 5 ou 6 personnes, qui au dpart se.urt nomnnnves de fago i lanxr la dynaique.
n ne faut pas redoercher la reprisentativiti au sein du NPS de taus les dipartemnas nxiiszsiies plus ou mons
concemes par 1' nviromomiern de peur de se retrouver avec une suun trcp lourde a Sarir. Le NPS cmtdl
sera base a Yaounmd de priefrence au MINEF. II ne faut pas chercher a rzaacher le NPS i une sunmwe
adminisrative bien dfifme, d'une part car il ne s'agit pas d'ur comite inst nio alisi, d'autre part car In
composmon de ses menbres pourra varier a la longue et de ce fait faire basader la rprisviti an faver

Ces personnes-relais devrctt jouer le role dobservateurs neutres.
4 FONCTIONNEMIENT DU NTPS
L'equipe du NPS sera ccnsituee
- d'un coordonateur, en lFoccurrence le directeur-adjoint de la direction de ErEivirornemeret, ou le
D!recaeur des Affarres Jundiques (D.AJ) du NE"qEF, suivanc leur disponibilire. Et=nt donnr le nombre reduir de
personnel dont dispose la dcrec-ion de ['Environnement par rapport a la charge de travail qui leur incombe, il
serait souhaitable que la responsabilite de la coordinarion du NPS revienne i la DAJ
- d'une eouie de 5 a 6 me-rbres (cf. plus haut) a lacuelle sera associe des reprisenanrs sur chaque
site.
UIn membre volontaire pris a partir de 1'equipe sera c.Largi d'assurer le contr8ie e. le s.ivi de la gesfion des
fonds et materlel. E serait souhaiable qu'il puisse assurer ces fonctions pendant les 36 mois du projeE. L
pourra cumuler le roie de gestionnaire et de me-nbre de la rmission.
Pour chaque mission, um chef de mission sera desigrte par le coordonateur. B aura pour tache principale la
coordination des travaux de synthese ct la redaction d'un rapport.
A chaque currpazie de mnissions de terrain. tw rapport sera presente a l'quipe de coordrration du projet. Ce
rapport faisant e'at des rcnrarques eventuelles et des anomalies constatees.
Pour la mission de terrain annuelle du NPSc l'aval sera donne par le coordonateur du NPS. B aura la
responsabilit6 de s'assurer que 1'equipe es; sufisamrment pr6par6e a sa rmission, notanmmenr que les objec;s
dobservation ont e&e susamrnment definis e le rrnat6riel d'6cude prepare.
La pre-aration de cee uission devra faire l'objet d'un documnent pr6paratoire innrt. les objecdfs de la
mnission, les therres precis d'observarion, un descriptif precis de la m6chodologie c des tedchiques
d'observation utilises, ainsi qu'un programrnme precis des lieux a visiter et des persortnes i rencontrer. Uine
justrficaion techique des lieux et personnes visites devra  glernent figurer dars le document pr6paratoire.
Les rendez-vous obtenus seront indiqu6s dans ce docurnent Ce documnent priseritera en annexe Videntificmion
des rnarqueurs d'observaricn qui seront utilises sur le ternain, et de maniere imnpirative les Lides dobservation
et ive=euerlcnent les Suides d'entreen.
i)- Freqnence des missions
fl semble coherent de prevoir une mission de terrain par sernestre pour le NPSd6c. L'irtervalle de ces missions
pouvant &re raccourc si une situation parciculiere le susciTe. Les missions des reoreser=tants sur les sites
seront semestriels cc devrornt rpondire aux mrnnes cnteres de preparation tels que ates plus haut. L'accord
pour la rialisanon dune mission sera dorme par le coordonateur du NPS qui pourra accpter ou non la
reaisaicon de la mission, apres reception des documnersas preparatoires.
L'organisarion diune mission  traordinaire pourra are sugger6e par l'un des mernbres de la rnission. n (eie)
saisira le coordonateur du NPS ainsi que l'equipe de coordination du projet. Un rapport precis expliquanrt la
raison de ceme demAnnde ec d&aillanr la problinatique pour laqueUe est denand6e ceme mission, sera foumi a
1'equipe de coordination du projeE. CeUe-a reste seule juge avec le coordonateur du NPS de l'utilit de cee
rmission.
Missions NPS decentralise : 2 fais/an; duree de 7 jours pour 5 personres (S-E; S; S-W; IN-W; N.) - 70 hfj/2n
Mission du NPS cenrral: I fois/an; - 66 h/jour/an
- une equipe de crois persornes pour les sites N-W (4 jours) + S-W (3 jours) + N (5 jours) - I I jours
- une autre equipe de trois persorrnes pour les sites S (4 jours) + S-E (7 jours) = I I jours
ii)- Methodologie de l'enquete de terrain
Devant l'umensite des pararnires auxquels on doit faire face lors d'une niission de terrain. ii est essaid de
se munir d!ui  protocole d'observaticn. A diaut de s'ere correcterair pripar6 a la mission, les rsu1ts
obtenus at le rapport de mission foumis a I'6quipe de coordinaion du projet ne pourroit itre corrernt
irrtccpreces at n'aurot aucune valeur.
prepararion des points a irudier
Pour chaque mission de tenain un dcoix de themes sp6cifiques, consideres coTme majeurs sart reraus (ex:
problarne d'erosion, etc.). Cec de fapn a pouvoir focaliser son attention sur quelques pamameis sp6ifiques
at ainsi eviter de se disperser dans une multintde d'6vauations abordees de maniire trop subjecive et
superfiielle. La sicon de ces thernes diependra en partie des acvites des sits visit&, notnet de celTs
reps conime i1 susceptibles d'tre les plus perrurbaries pour Ieatviromement (cf.; doanu= EIE). Ceu

Une recherche documentaire sera effecruee de facon a recenser tous les problernes pctrtdels ies a la
realisation d'une actiAlt: Parmu les ouvrages a explorer. le guide de la Banque Mondiaie (en an2lais) pourra
etre le document d'appui.

deaut de prearaion suftisanmment soigneuse, il devra repousser le depart de la mission jusqu'i ce que ses
membres lui fournissent un document comnplet, concret, et scientifquemaent fondi.
Ces documents (guides de terrain) seront conserves et joints aux rapports de mission r=dus a chaque fois i
'equipe de coordinzaon du projet.
Les rapports de mission et les guides de terrain seront evaalus lors des missions de supervisions de la Banque
Mondiale.
LEr APPORT
Pour chaque mission de terrain an rapport sera foumi.
Le rapport conportera plusieurs parties:
-1 une partie rdatanm le deroulesnent chronologique de la rmission
- 2 une parie analyique, technique (mnatrice avec ses explications)
-;3 une partie synthetque qui resume les observaticns faites, et propose evasueanent des
recormnandanons.
11 est essentiel qu'un equilibre soit respecte erwne ces parties pour que le rapport soit d'un irzt sciatifique:
+ la prerniere partie, narrarive, concensant la chronolooie de la nission, ne doit ean auan Cis
dtpasser 114 du rapport (ceat partie peutt tre irnfrieure)
+ la diwdine parie, la plus importante, doit consituer au minum la mioit du rappoft,
+ la troisie,ne.parie, la synthese, presemas  la synrthse a les recommandatons, reprina
le 114 restant du volumne.
Le rapport sera dabore par l'equipe ou la persorme se&= diplac6e sur le tenain  Les ruIltats des di'fs
speaiiles  de lequipe seront rnis en comnnun au cours de seances de travail. Une premrie ebauhe de
redaction sam fite, puis amiende par l'equipe chasZee de la syrthise et de la ridacticn mnae (NPSc).

RELA TION avec l'equipe chargeie de la coordinaion du projes GEF
Le depot du rapport aupres de la cellule de coordination se fera ax plus rard 30 jours aprs le reEour ou la fin
de la rnission.
L'equipe de coordination du projet a le devoir d'amrer I'arenToh du coordonateur du NPS si elle estime que le
travail presente ne possede pas la qualite requise. L'equipe de coordination du proje& pourra suspendre les
payements au NPS si apres 2 interpellations successives aucun effort n'a ke  rialise, ou si les delais de
producticn du rapport ne sont pas respeces.
5 FORYLTION
Avant la rnise en oeuvre des activites de suivi de I'EE, il serait souhaitable de privoir un selinaire de
fornation pour les mernbres du NPS.
Ce seminaire pourrait se drouler pendant tme semaine. En plus des mernbres du NPS cenral, deux personnes
ideitifiaes pour chaque site du projet, postulant pour &re la persoime-relais, sercnt invities. La persorme
s'rant montree la plus acave et la plus cornp&eere sera silectionnee a lissue du seminaire.
Ce serninaire pourra se derouler sur 4 jours ea coimportera les lignes directrices suivantes:
- les grands principes de l'elaboration d'une EIE
- les ellermets d'observation du milieu narurel
- analyse in exteso de toutes les activit6s de caque site du projet d'apres la mithodologie des
'criteres croises"
- realisation dune zille dtanalyse et idetflcatnnon des rnarqueurs environnerniaux devant itre
tiiliss par la suite sur le terrain
Ce siminaire sera anime par un specialiste international en relisation d'EE et par un consultant local ayant
dqai parcicipe a tme EE.
Ces deux consultants seront dcarges d!or_zniser la session de formation au point de vue technique (=c u de
la fornation). La preoaration logistique serait assurxe par le NPS (reservation de salles, convocarons, etc.).
D) COUTS DU PROGRAIMM DE SPV/I
Le budget estinatf pour la pniode des trois anmes du projet s'e&ve a eaviron 40.000 USS.
1 - Les coCts relanfs a l'evaluation senesuieile du suivi de ISML pour chaque site sont inclus dans les budgets
propres a chaque site.
2 - Les coCuts relatifs au fonctiomenet du NPS ainsi qu'a la formation de l'equipe sont inclus dans le budgt
desine au reiforcement institonnel.
