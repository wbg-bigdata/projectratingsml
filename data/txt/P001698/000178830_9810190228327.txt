INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI FOR A THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali in an amount equivalent to US$10.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Railway project. The
IDA credit will be on-lent by Government to the Regie du Chemin de Fer du
Mali (CFM) for 20 years including 4.5 years of grace at an interest rate of
6%. To cofinance the project, the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC)
and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) would make grants
equivalent to US$1.9 million and US$5.3 million respectively; the Caisse Cen-
trale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) and the Compagnie Francaise de Credit
pour l'Exportation (COFACE) would provide loans amounting to US$5.4 million
and to US$3.5 million respectively.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A report on "Recent Economic Developments in Mali" (233a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27, 1973. An economic
mission visited Mali in March 1976 and again in February 1977. Its con-
clusions are reflected in the following paragraphs. An Economic Memorandum
will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly.
3.        With a per capita GNP of $95 Mali is one of the poorest countries
of Africa and amongst the 29 least developed countries identified by the
United Nations. It is handicapped by serious obstacles to development.
The extreme variability of rainfall causes sharp fluctuations in crop and
livestock production. Access to foreign markets is made difficult by its
landlocked position and the long distances - more than 1000 km - to the
nearest seaports, Abidjan and Dakar. Development is also constrained by
the shortage of skilled manpower and the narrow domestic market for indus-
trial products. About 90% of the population depends for livelihood on crop
farming, animal husbandry, forestry and fishing. Exports consist almost
entirely of agricultural commodities and livestock. In 1972, the primary
sector accounted for 43% of GDP. The relative contribution of the primary
sector declined in 1973 and 1974 owing to widespread drought; in 1975 it was
somewhat lower than in 1972.
4.        Over the fifteen years following independence economic growth has
barely kept ahead of the growth of population. During the 1960s GDP, in
real terms, increased at an average annual rate of 2.8% as compared to the
average population growth rate of 2.1%. During the drought of the early
seventies, GDP declined; and Mali's problems were further aggravated by
international inflation, excessive credit expansion and growing budget
and balance of payments deficits. The Government has initiated action to
redress major financial imbalances through credit restraint, substantial

reduction of the subsidy element in the prices of essential consumer goods,
fertilizers and agricultural equipment and improved tax collection. Good
crop seasons in 1975 and 1976 facilitated the implementation of these
measures. Though the growth potential is significant, serious structural
problems remain.
The drought years: 1972-1974
5.        All economic sectors have in varying degrees been affected by the
recent drought, and their recovery is following different patterns. The
extent of losses of human lives is not known but has been severe among some
groups, particularly nomads and among them more so the elderly and the
children. From an estimated 5.5 million head in 1971 the cattle herd was
reduced to only 3.5 million head in 1974.
6.        During the drought years the rate of investment was maintained at
about 16% of GDP with the aid of an increasing inflow of external resources.
The resource gap is estimated to have widened to nearly a third of GDP in
1974, an extraordinary level by any standards. In an effort to keep essential
supplies at a sufficient level and retail prices for basic goods low, especial-
ly in urban centers, the government resorted to large imports of cereals, only
partly financed by external aid, and consumption subsidies. Thus, cereal
imports shot up from 64,000 tons in 1972 to 235,000 tons in 1974, at a time
when the average import price trebled and the bill for imported petroleum
doubled. To finance losses incurred by state enterprises charged with imports
and sales of subsidized goods, growing amounts of bank credit were used. With
the subsidies, price inflation was contained within strict limits, the GDP
deflator varying around 5-6% between 1970 and 1974. As supplies of exporta-
bles were affected by the drought, exports receipts did not increase as much
as the favorable world prices would have permitted and the policy of price
containment and subsidization translated into very large external deficits.
At the end of 1974, net foreign assets of the banking system were minus MF 64
billion (US$133 million), principally in the form of liabilities with the
'"operations account" at the French treasury.
Uneven recovery: 1975-1976
7.        Normal rainfall resumed in 1975 and primary production--cereals,
as well as cotton and groundnuts--increased by more than 20% and total GDP
by an estimated 12%. Recovery of physical production, however, has been
accompanied by higher rates of inflation resulting from both the substantial
reduction in Government subsidies and the delayed impact of international
inflation, and the GDP deflator is estimated to have jumped by 18% in 1975.
While the resource gap was reduced it remained very high, representing about
20% of GDP and foreign assets declined further to minus MF 90 billion (US$190
million). Public dissaving continued to increase as growth of revenues lagged
behind fast rising expenditures, particularly expenditure on personnel. The
wage bill increased rapidly because of cost of living adjustments and the
policy of government to serve as residual employer of nationals who complete
secondary or higher education. Current revenues did increase as a result of



- 3 -
efforts to improve tax collection, but not enough to keep pace with rapidly
growing expenditures. The current budget deficit widened from 3.6 billion
MF in 1972 to 7.6 billion MF in 1975, or about 27% of total current revenues.
8.        In 1976, real growth of GDP continued though at a moderate pace
(4 to 5%). At the same time, a slower rate of world inflation and redressal
measures by the government have begun to have a favorable impact in the
financial sphere.
9.        Credit expansion was reduced sharply, the overall increase in
outstanding indebtedness of the economy to deposit banks being of the order
of 10% over the first nine months of 1976. At the beginning of the year
the Central Bank discount rate was raised from 3.5 to 6.0% with correspond-
ing increases in the whole set of borrowing and lending rates of deposit
banks. And a new banking law, providing for legal minimum cash reserve and
liquidity ratios, is to be promulgated soon. The rate of inflation slowed
in 1976, even though prices of sugar, soap and groundnut oil had been raised
in 1975 and power tariffs as well as prices of gasoline and kerosene were
increased last year. Producer prices of agricultural products, with the
exception of groundnuts, remained unchanged. The combined losses of state
enterprises are expected to have been much lower in 1976 despite marketing
problems still experienced by some of them.
10.       The balance of payments deficit in 1976 is provisionally estimated
to have come down to US$32 million from US$43 million in the preceding year.
As in the past the deficit was largely financed through the "operations
account". The improvement in the balance of payments despite larger imports
is attributable to higher volume and prices of cash crop exports, exports
of foodgrains, some debt rescheduling, larger capital inflows and higher
transfer receipts. Despite this, Mali's net foreign assets have somewhat
further decreased, and at the end of 1976 were practically at minus MF 100
billion (US$200 million). The budget deficit for 1976 was still uncomfortably
large (MF 10 billion) and it is unlikely to be significantly smaller in 1977.
Foreign capital and debt
11.       Public investment is mainly financed by foreign aid.   During most
of the sixties the USSR and the People's Republic of China were the most
important aid donors. At the end of 1973, they held about one-third each
of Mali's external public debt' disbursed and outstanding. Gross disburse-
ments (grants and loans) from DAC sources increased from US$24 million in
1969 to US$108 million in 1974. Roughly 60% came from bilateral sources
(mainly France, United States, Germany and Canada). Since the early seventies
the amount of public aid received by Mali has increased very rapidly and grants
account for most of the increase. The average annual gross inflow of aid was
less than US$20 million in the early 1970-71, reached US$50 million during
the first years of the drought (1972-73), peaked at US$112 million in 1974
and has decreased only marginally since then. Four-fifths of total aid since
1970 has been in the form of grants.
12.       Mali's external public debt outstanding at the end of 1973 (ex-
cluding drawings on the operations account with the French treasury) was



US$368 million, including an undisbursed amount of US$85 million. IDA's
share in the total amount disbursed and outstanding was 17.4%. Repayments
of principal and interest due in 1973 would have claimed about 19% of foreign
exchange earnings (15% in 1972), but actual debt service payments were small
(1.2% in 1972, 1.5% in 1973) owing to the rescheduling since 1970 of Chinese,
Russian and some other debts under short-to medium-term arrangements. How-
ever, debt service projections indicate that the ratio may go up to about
19% by 1980, unless some further rescheduling of debt takes place. Mali
received five stand-by credits from the IMF between 1964 and 1971 which
have been repaid. Apart from the stand-by credits Mali drew SDR 5.00 million
under the 1974 oil facility and obtained another credit of SDR 3.99 million
(in March 1976) under the 1975 oil facility.
Development prospects
13.       The return of more normal weather conditions has strengthened the
economy's short run position. In the medium and long term, the government
must address two sets of interrelated objectives. The first is the need to
correct the profound financial imbalances that have developed over the years,
especially since the early seventies; the second is the need to accelerate the
pace of economic growth against a background of minimal improvement in per
capita income since 1960.
14.       The government has, since 1975, begun to tackle its financial
problems and has been relatively successful in re-establishing more economic
price relationships internally and relative to the rest of the world. Thus,
incentives to agricultural production are stronger; consumer prices more
closely reflect economic costs, the burden of subsidies has been somewhat
alleviated and credit expansion has slowed down. Reform of public enter-
prises has been undertaken, but is unavoidably a very gradual task; the budget
is still basically unbalanced but the government is now seriously reconsider-
ing its employment policy with a view to make it more selective; the external
accounts now benefit from a stronger export performance which is expected to
continue; it would be unrealistic to expect dramatic progress in the reconsti-
tution of external reserves in a matter of months or even a few years, but the
Franc area arrangements should provide the framework within which to undertake
this long-term task.
15.       Prospects for real long term growth are probably better than in other
Sahelian countries. Agriculture has considerable potential for expansion both
in the South where rainfed agriculture meets favorable conditions and in the
vast inland delta of the Niger river. The river also offers much potential
for power development to support industrial and mineral development. Planned
investment in new capacity for cotton seed oil extraction, cotton textiles for
export and sugar production, together with growing crop and livestock produc-
tion, will eventually strengthen the balance of payments. Mineral resources
(iron ore, phosphates) remain at present unexploited but may offer interesting
longer term development possibilities.
16.       The Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan (1974-1978)
gives high priority to agriculture, water and power development, industries



- 5 -
processing agricultural materials and road transport. The pattern of invest-
ment is well conceived, and allocation conforms broadly to the resource en-
dowment of the economy, but the investment target of MF 395 billion (about
US$783 million) in 1972 prices is no doubt over-ambitious, which means that
difficult choices will have to be made. Implementation of the plan has en-
countered serious internal and external resource constraints, and the objec-
tives for investment outlays are being revised downward. At the same time,
with regard to new investments, priority is being given to projects and poli-
cies that will help correct over time the structural weakness of the balance
of payments, with greater emphasis on export crops, animal husbandry, minor
irrigation works and the more efficient manufacturing activities. However,
the selection of projects, especially capital intensive undertakings, needs
to pay more attention to economic factors.
17.       The prospects for the Malian economy have improved following the
marked increase in output over the last two years and the stabilization
measures taken by the Government. Nevertheless, sustained and viable growth
in the longer run depends crucially on investments that will strengthen the
economy's export base and reduce its dependence on imports. Mali's capacity
to finance new investment, however, is severely constrained by the limited
savings potential resulting from the extremely low per capita income level,
a situation further complicated by serious financial difficulties in the
public sector. Borrowing on conventional terms would add considerably to
the burden of servicing an already sizeable external debt. External aid,
accordingly, should be on soft terms and finance, besides foreign exchange
outlays, a significant proportion of local currency costs.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
18.       The proposed credit would be IDA's thirteenth operation in Mali,
which would bring total commitments of IDA funds to US$119.2 million. Actual
commitments so far amount to US$108.7 million, most of which were made during
the past three years. Of this amount, US$53.2 million has been disbursed
as of February 28, 1977. Of twelve credits already approved by the Board,
five have been directed to the transport infrastructure, five to agriculture,
one in telecommunications and one in education. Transportation represents
the largest share (56%) of our past commitments followed by agriculture
(nearly 45%). A summary statement of these credits as well as notes on
the execution of ongoing projects are set out in Annex II.
19.       Experience with most ongoing projects has been satisfactory.   How-
ever, a telecommunications project experienced some difficulties which have
now been remedied as reflected in an amendment which was approved by the
Board on July 21, 1976. The Second Highway Project faced some cost overruns
due mainly to a delay of more than one year, and the Board of Directors ap-
proved in June 1975 a supplementary Credit of US$8.3 million to cover part of
these overruns. In addition, a dispute between the contractor and the Gov-
ernment was recently settled following extensive discussions between the two
parties. Other items of the project are either completed or well under way.



- 6 -
20.       The Bank Group and other external aid agencies have financed some
ten major development projects which geographically cover most of the coun-
try's cultivable area and benefit the majority of farm families, or about 90%
of Mali's population. Bank Group's operations in this sector include the
Mopti Rice Project, the Integrated Rural Development Project and the Live-
stock Project which were designed to assist the Government in its efforts to
achieve self-sufficiency in food and to improve export earnings. A fourth
IDA financed project, Mali Sud (Credit 669-MLI) for US$15.5 million, was
approved by the Board in December 1976. A Drought Relief Project composed
of more than 20 subprojects aiding the most adversely affected rural popu-
lation was approved by the Board in 1973. In addition three of the five
projects financed in the transportation sector are directly related to the
rural sector.
21.       Agriculture and livestock undoubtedly will continue to provide the
main development possibilities for Mali's largely rural population; the
largely semi-autonomous state corporations ("Operations") are the main channel
for external investment in these sectors. Because of the droughts in the
1968-74 period, these "Operations" have broadened their activities to include
food crops and livestock to permit farmers greater self-sufficiency. They
provide a reliable means for communication and logistics in remote rural
areas, as their networks of extension agents reaches down to the villages.
Increasingly, these "Operations" are being used by the Government as vehicles
for delivery of social services, specifically functional literacy for adult
farmers and preventive health care at the village level.
22.       The main objectives of Bank Group lending in the future are:    (a)
to promote agricultural development so as to help the country attain some
degree of food self-sufficiency as well as generate adequate supplies of agri-
cultural materials for processing industries and exports; (b) to strengthen
the infrastructure facilities; and (c) to mobilize resources from other donors
through co-financing. In keeping with these overall objectives and in line
with the priorities established in the Government's Five-Year Development
Plan, Bank Group lending will continue to support the Government in its
efforts to increase agricultural production and rural incomes. Preparation is
underway for a Rice Project in FY 78 and a Groundnuts/Cereals project in FY
79, the former consolidating and extending the first Mopti Rice Project, and
the latter a follow-up of the Integrated Rural Development Project. As for
infrastructure, a fourth highway project which might include primary road
rehabilitation and a program of road maintenance, is being considered for
FY 79. The emphasis on rural development and infrastructure, however, does
not preclude Bank Group financing in other areas. In this context we are
considering an Urban/DFC project for FY 79 designed to improve living con-
ditions through a basic package of urban services emphasizing environmental
sanitation and rehabilitation of existing facilities, and to assist Government
in creating new employment. Needless to say, successful achivement of these
objectives will depend, to a large extent, on the availability in sufficient
numbers of qualified manpower to design and carry out development projects. A
Second Education Project currently under preparation for FY 78 would address
priority manpower needs of the economy, specifically: the training and



- 7 -
upgrading of managers and planners for all priority sectors; the training of
an increased number of junior agricultural and livestock field technicians;
and the extension of functional literacy and numeracy to additional groups of
farmers in the Integrated Rural Development Project area (Credit 491-MLI).
23.       The proposed project would be the third railway project in Mali
since the country became independent in 1960. Execution of the two previous
railway projects has been disappointing. The first project (Credit 95-MLI)
was completed two years behind schedule, and the second (384-MLI) suffered
severe cost overruns that led to reduction in its scope and incorporation
of deleted items in the proposed third project. However, these projects,
together with two parallel lending operations for the Senegal Railway, have
been the vehicle for Bank Group advice and assistance which has done much to
keep the vital Dakar-Bamako line from total collapse. The proposed project
would provide for continuation of this action and for redoubled efforts to
improve the Regie du Chemin de Fer du Mali (CFM)'s operating and financial
efficiency.
PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN MALI
The Transport System
24.       The Malian transport network is fairly extensive and consists of
the following infrastructure: 13,000 km of roads, of which 1,600 km are
paved, 3,300 km all-weather roads and the remainder dirt roads and tracks; a
644 km railway linking Koulikoro and Bamako with the Senegal railway and the
port of Dakar; about 1,650 of inland waterways, which are navigable less than
seven months per year; and an international airport at Bamako and about a
dozen airfields for domestic commercial services. The two main international
routes are:
(a)  the railway from Bamako to the Port of Dakar about 1,280
km, 644 km of which are in Mali; and
(b)  choice of all road service or a road/rail combination from
Bamako to the Port of Abidjan, approximately 1,230 km in
length (a paved road leads from Bamako to Ouangolodougou,
Ivory Coast, which is on the Railway to Abidjan).
The road system and the railway are the principal means of transport. The
paved roads are concentrated in the Bamako-Sikasso-Mopti triangle, the fastest
growing area in Mali. The all-weather and dirt roads link outlying areas to
the paved road system or are feeder roads west of Bamako connecting agricul-
tural areas to the railway.
25.       The Government controls the major transport companies:   Regie du
Chemin de Fer du Mali (CFM) or Mali railways; Compagnie Malienne de Transport
Routier (CMTR), a trucking company carrying about 20 percent of total road
freight; Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV), a navigation company



- 8 -
handling about 70 percent of waterway traffic; and Air Mali, the only locally
based air carrier, which handles both domestic and a considerable amount of
international traffic. The Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW)
exerts full control over Malian transport enterprises, tariffs and traffic
regulations and allocations. MPTW will prepare a National Transport Plan
1978-84 based on an IDA study financed under Credit 599-MLI (Third Highway
Project). It has been agreed that this plan should not include any major road
construction parallel to the railway unless in consultation with the Associa-
tion (Section 3.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Within the
MTPW, the National Transport Office (NTO) is responsible for regulating
transport entities, approving tariffs and allocating export-import traffic
between the competing routes. Enforcement of regulations and control of rates
is generally effective but does not result in an economic route allocation of
international traffic. Road transport policies will be reviewed in a consult-
ing study financed under the Second Highway Credit (Credit 383-MLI) to be
completed in mid 1977.
26.       The Government's transport strategy has focussed on developing local
transport infrastructure in support of overall economic growth, on promoting
regional integration, and on building an appropriate international network to
link Mali with the coast. In addition to the two previous railway projects,
the Association has also financed three highway projects.
The Role of the Railway
27.       The railway provides the only mode of transport in the western part
of Mali, providing a link between Bamako and Kayes (second largest city in
the country), and numerous small towns and villages in between. It also
provides practically all domestic passenger and freight transport to the
Senegalese border. There is no road on this route, and the existing tracks
can only be traveled by jeeps and only during part of the year.
28.       The railway's main activity is carrying international traffic to
and from Dakar, the most economic route for most exports originating at
Bamako and west to the Senegalese border, and for all imports destined as far
as Segou, about 200 km east of Bamako. For imports, the cost differential
between the Dakar and Abidjan routes ranges from MF 7,200/ton for cement to
MF 20,300/ton for petroleum products. However, CFM has not carried as much
international traffic as this cost advantage would suggest as appropriate.
Inefficiency in terminal operations in Dakar and Bamako, as well as along the
international line, and the mandatory allocation of traffic by the Malian
Government instead of permitting normal market mechanism to operate explain
this shortfall. In addition, cumbersome customs procedures between Mali and
Senegal which started in January 1976, further hampered international traffic.
In relation to these problems, the proposed project provides for (a) consult-
ing services aimed at improving operations in both Mali and Senegal; and (b)
specific measures to reroute petroleum traffic from the more expensive Abidjan
route to the Dakar route. In March 1977, the Malian and Senegalese Govern-
ments decided to suspend temporarily application of the customs procedures
until revised, simpler procedures can be drafted in agreement with the Asso-
ciation (Section 3.04 draft Development Credit Agreement).



-9-
Railway Administration
29.       CFM was established in 1960 after the Dakar-Niger Railway was par-
titioned between Senegal and Mali. It is a government-owned public enterprise
operated on a commercial basis with a General Manager, who reports to a Board
chaired by the Minister of Transport and Public Works and who has sufficient
autonomy to permit effective management. CFM is being reorganized under a
CIDA-financed technical assistance program into five departments each headed
by a director. There are 1,500 permanent and 600 auxiliary employees. Man-
agerial and senior staff are well trained, but do not have enough experience.
Most mid-level staff need either theoretical or specialized training.
Theoretical training is provided by the Training Department (TD) which is
short of facilities and instructors. Fourteen technical assistants supply
on-the-job advice and some training.
30.       CFM's budgeting, accounting and auditing procedures are generally
satisfactory; some deficiencies mainly in cost accounting are being overcome
under the CIDA-financed program. CFM's track, fixed installations, motive
power and rolling stock are generally well maintained except for bridges,
some of which need emergency repairs, and some old passenger cars. The
proposed project includes bridge repair and the replacement of old passenger
equipment.
31.       Except for a substantial improvement in the mainline locomotive
availability, CFM did not achieve the operating and traffic performance
anticipated under the two previous railway projects because of the lack of
resources to complete rehabilitation of the track and equipment and the
weakness of its operational management which resulted in poor staff motivation
and discipline further aggravated by inadequate training standards. The
consequent increasing diversion of traffic to the Ivory Coast route and the
reluctance of the Government to implement recommended tariff increases resulted
in CFM's failure to meet agreed financial objectives.
Operations
32.       Physical constraints only partly explain the unsatisfactory turn-
around time of freight cars which is the main cause of CFM's inadequate
operating performance. Other reasons include: (a) lack of operational
management experience resulting in poor staff motivation and discipline;
(b) inadequate training standards; and (c) inefficient operations at Dakar
port and along the Senegalese part of the international line. A plan aimed
at improving CFM's operations is proposed under the project. A parallel
project for the Senegal Railway appraised in February 1977 will similarly
emphasize the improvement of operational efficiency.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
33.       The project is based on information supplied by the Government
and CFM and the findings of an appraisal mission in July 1976. Negotiations



- 10 -
were held from March 28 to March 31, 1977, with a Malian delegation led by
His Excellency M. Karim Dembele (Minister of Transportation and Public Works).
The Appraisal Report (No. 1355-MLI) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. Annex III provides a credit and project summary.
Project Description
34.       During appraisal of the proposed project CFM agreed to a 1977-81
railway investment plan estimated to cost MF 20 billion (US$40 million equiv-
alent) with a foreign exchange component of about MF 14.5 billion (US$29.6
million equivalent). The proposed project covers the first three years
(1977-79) of this plan.
35.       The proposed project comprises (a) track work to complete the
rehabilitation of CFM's track begun under the First and Second Projects
(US$3.83 million); (b) a bridge rehabilitation program, part of which was
deleted from the Second Project (US$7.32 million); (c) procurement of loco-
motives, railcars, coaches, tank wagons, and of spare parts (US$10.46 mil-
lion); (d) miscellaneous equipment (US$0.09 million); (e) training (US$0.35
million); and (f) consulting services to study (i) the joint operations of
the Senegal and Mali railways and (ii) the future of the Bamako-Koulikoro
line (US$0.39 million) and (g) contingencies (US$5.81 million).
Prolect Cost and Financing
36.       Total project costs excluding duties and other clearly identifiable
taxes are estimated at US$28.2 million. The foreign exchange cost is US$25.3
million or 90%. The financing plan is summarized below:
US$ million        % of total
IDA                         10.5              37
FAC/CCCE                    10.8              38
CIDA                         5.3              19
CFM                          1.6               6
28.2              100%
The proposed credit would finance 37% of total costs, consisting of US$9.5
million of foreign exchange costs and US$1.0 million of local costs. Spe-
cifically it would be used to finance bridge rehabilitation (US$9.7 mil-
lion), track maintenance equipment (US$0.1 million) and the foreign compo-
nent of consulting services for studies and training (US$0.7 million). The
Credit proceeds would be relent to CFM at an interest rate of 6% p.a. for a
term of 20 years including 4.5 years of grace. Finalization of the onlending
agreement is a condition of effectiveness. The proposed relending rate is
the highest CFM could afford under present productivity, traffic and finan-
cial performance assumptions. The co-financing in the financing plan is ex-
pected to be made available under the following terms: FAC and CIDA would



- 11 -
make grants equivalent to US$1.9 million and US$5.3 million respectively; CCCE
would provide a loan of US$5.4 million for 10 years including 5 years of grace
at an interest rate of 5.5%; and COFACE would provide a loan of US$3.5 million
for 5 years at an interest rate of 8%.
Prolect Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
37.       CFM will be responsible for execution of the project.   Track re-
newal, ballasting and rail joint welding would be performed by CFM's own
staff which produced an acceptable quality of work under the two previous
projects. Bridge repairs and reinforcements will be executed by an expe-
rienced firm, to be selected following the Association's guidelines on
international competitive bidding, except for minor related works and mate-
rial in a total amount not exceeding US$940,000 equivalent. Execution of
bridge rehabilitation and reinforcements will be supervised by Sofrerail
experts. Track maintenance equipment may be purchased by international
shopping, spare parts for track maintenance machinery will be purchased
from the original supplier. For the rehabilitation of training facilities
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local pro-
cedures acceptable to the Bank will be followed. The consultants and in-
structors providing technical assistance and training courses respectively
will be selected on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association.
The cost of items not subject to international competitive bidding will be
reviewed by the Association on the basis of international market prices.
The items being financed under bilateral aid and supplier credits will fol-
low donors' guidelines.
38.       The funds from the credit account would be disbursed as follows:
100% of foreign expenditures and 74% of local expenditures for bridge rehabil-
itation - US$6.6 million; 100% of foreign expenditures or 74% of local expend-
itures for track maintenance equipment - US$0.1 million; 100% of foreign ex-
penditures for consultants' services and training - US$0.4 million; and 100%
of foreign expenditures or 74% of local expenditures for rehabilitation of
training facilities and training equipment - US$0.1 million. US$3.3 million
of the proposed credit would be unallocated to cover contingencies and price
increases. The Credit would be disbursed during the period 1977-82.
Training and Technical Assistance
39.       Systematic training of CFM staff started only after the Training
Division (TD) was officially established in early 1969, but was limited by
meager facilities and the shortage of qualified instructors. Most of the
activities of the TD have been concentrated on the training and retraining of
skilled labor and low-level staff to meet the most pressing needs of CFM's
operations and on organizing courses for supervisory staff. The TD has also
implemented special programs to train and upgrade Malian instructors. The
training component included in the proposed project will improve the quality
of CFM's staff training by expanding physical facilities, providing training
equipment and adding new programs for middle-level staff.



- 12 -
40.       The training plan, which will enable the training and retraining of
some 400 personnel each year, involves (i) centralizing all the required
training facilities (previously scattered); (ii) relocating the TD offices in
the new center; (iii) building a small, secondary center in Kayes; and (iv)
purchasing training equipment for these facilities.
Studies
41.       The proposed project includes consulting services for about 65
man months (at an average US$70,000 per man year) for a study aimed at
improving joint operations of the Senegal and Mali railways along the in-
ternational line and to review the financial and economic justification for
rehabilitating or closing the Bamako-Koulikoro line. Implementation of the
consultant's recommendations on the latter study by the Government and CFM
will be done in consultation with the Association (Section 3.07 draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement). The joint operations study would recommend measures
for improving the terminal operations and train operations in Mali, Senegal
and along the line. Within this framework the consultants should assess all
areas where increased cooperation between Mali and Senegal would improve
operations (e.g., unifying traffic rules, establishing specialized workshops,
increasing inter-penetration of locomotives, and improving train schedules)
and should make specific recommendations. They should also investigate the
possible advantage of partial containerization of international traffic. The
Senegalese and Malian Governments and Railways would, in consultation with the
Association, jointly set (a) the objectives of the study; (b) its terms of
reference; and (c) implementation of consultant's recommendations on the
operational study (Section 3.06 draft Development Credit Agreement).
Traffic Forecast
42.       Freight traffic should reach 465,000 tons and 211.6 million ton-km
by 1981. This would represent an annual growth rate of 4.8% in tonnage
and 5.5% in ton-km based on the 1975 level (compared with 4.9% in tonnage and
4.1% in ton-km average annual growth rate during the period 1966-1975).
Imports of petroleum products will be the fastest growth element, climbing
from 32,000 tons in 1975 to 75,000 tons in 1981. Achievement of this forecast
traffic will require, in addition to the procurement of tank wagons under the
project, that the Government and CFM make long-term arrangements for the
transport by CFM of the petroleum products. This would include inter alia
modifications to the system of price stabilization for petroleum products,
which presently does not encourage the oil companies to use the cheapest
transport route for such products. Finalization of these arrangements
would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Project. Passenger
traffic is expected to grow at an annual rate of about 3%, reaching 140
million passenger-km in 1981 as opposed to 103 million passenger-km in
1975. Collection of passenger fares has deteriorated in recent years and CFM
agreed at negotiations to promptly implement a program satisfactory to the
Association to ensure the regular collection of fares (Section 3.06 draft
Project Agreement).



- 13 -
Financial Situation and Risks
43.       CFM's inadequate traffic performance and tariff-setting policies
over the past 10 years resulted in an unacceptable financial position.
The Government has already waived about MF 2.2 billion of CFM's debts. The
Government and CFM have also agreed during negotiations to (a) revalue CFM's
fixed assets as of December 31, 1976 and enter this revaluation in CFM's 1977
accounts; (b) undertake future revaluations of fixed assets when appropriate
in consultation with the Association; (c) achieve working ratios of no more
than 67% for 1977, 70% for 1978, 61% for 1979, 64% for 1980 and 60% for 1981
and 1982; (d) maintain CFM's working capital at stated levels; and (e) discuss
draft annual budgets with the Association prior to submitting them to CFM's
Board, and if necessary, CFM and Government will agree with the Association on
remedial actions (legal covenants on these points are reflected in Sections
4.06 (i), 4.06 (ii), 4.04, 4.05 and 3.05 respectively of the draft Project
Agreement). To achieve the 1977 working ratio target, the Government would
have to increase CFM tariffs in mid 1977 to produce a 23% increase in reve-
nues.
44.       A sensitivity analysis of financial forecasts was conducted under
the following assumptions: (a) stagnation of petroleum traffic at the 1976
level; (b) 15% decrease in revenues generated by exports; (c) 10% increase in
working expenditures; and (d) 20% increase in the cost of the bridge component
and 10% increase in the cost of the remaining components of the project. The
analysis showed that simultaneous materialization of all four assumptions
would result in an accumulated MF 5 billion (US$10 million) deficit over
1977-81. This could be overcome by tariff increases 20% above those assumed
in the main analysis.
45.       While the project is relatively straightforward to implement in
physical terms, there is a risk that CFM will not attain the operating and
financial targets set under the project, as reflected by the disappointing
performance under the first and second projects (see para 23 above). However
the operating and financial targets have in this case been set conservatively,
based on the experience of the earlier projects, and it is expected they will
be largely met. In addition, CFM's operating performance should be strength-
ened by: a) the measures included under the proposed project to ensure mate-
rialization of forecast increases in petroleum and other traffic; and b) man-
agement and organizational improvements to be undertaken under the parallel
Senegal railway project now under preparation. On the other hand, failure
to proceed with the project, particularly the bridge rehabilitation program,
would soon result in the total collapse of operations and the cutting of
Mali's main transport access to the sea. On balance, therefore, the risk
of not proceeding with the project appears to outweigh the risk of a short-
fall in operiting or financial performance.
Benefits and Justification
46.       Benefits from the project will be continued operation of the line,
reduced maintenance and operating costs, new equipment and substantially
increased capacity for petroleum traffic. The economic rate of return of



- 14 -
the entire project is estimated to be 23%, and individual components are
economically justified even under slow traffic growth assumptions utilized
for sensitivity analysis purposes.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Mali
and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
Regie du Chemin de Fer du Mali (CFM), the Recommendation of the Committee
provided in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed Devel-
opment Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       The following will be special conditions of effectiveness:    that
a subsidiary loan agreement has been concluded between the Government and CFM;
that long-term arrangements be finalized for the transport by CFM of petro-
leum products including, inter alia, modification to the system of price
stabilization for such products; and that assurances satisfactory to the
Association have been received in respect to the financing which will be
provided by the co-donors (FAC, CCCE and CIDA).
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI: RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit 277-MLI     Mopti Rice Development Project.   US$9.5 million Credit of
January 6. 1972 (as amended on April 11, 1975); Effective
Date June 26, 1972; closing Date May 31, 1978.
The project started in 1972 and is expected to be completed as
scheduled in mid-1978 with disbursements remaining within the credit total of
$9.5 million. At the end of 1976, civil works were virtually completed. The
total area to be developed has been reduced from 31,000 ha to 26,200 ha for
topographical reasons. From 1976/77 the project will focus on the improvement
of agricultural services which so far have not met expectations. After the
recent removal of a technical bottleneck, significant progress is expected
during the ongoing campaign.
Credit 321-MLI     Telecommunications Project.   US$3.6 million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective Date April 4, 1973; Closing
Date July 1, 1976 - Extended to June 30, 1979
Large cost overruns raised the cost of this project from US$4.3
million at appraisal to US$9.3 million recently estimated. Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE) agreed to join in the financing of the project
to a maximum of US$2.2 million equivalent. However, since the Government was
unable to contribute the US$2.5 million required to close the gap in the
financing plan, the Government and the beneficiary, Office des Postes et
Telecomunications du Mali (OPTM), agreed that the project would be executed
in two phases. The first phase of work would consist of the original project
reduced by the Segou/Mopti section of the Bamako/Mopti microwave route and
by the two principal automatic exchanges of Mopti and Kayes; the excluded
works would be included in a second phase which could form part of a future
second telecommunications project. As approved by the Executive Directors on
July 21, 1976, the revised project will be financed from the original credit
of US$3.6 million, the CCCE loan of US$2.2 million and US$1.0 million from
OPTM's own resources. OPTM has changed the management of the telecommunica-
tions service. The Government is prepared to support the introduction of
measures for strengthening the organization and improving the efficiency
of telecommunications operations. The closing date has been postponed to
June 30, 1979.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit 383-MLI      Second Highway Project.  US$17.8 million Credit of May 23,
1973 (as amended on June 12. 1975); Effective Date
September 12, 1973; Closing Date July 19, 1977
The IDA-financed portion of the project consists of: (i) rehabili-
tation of the Faladie-Segou road; (ii) consultant's services for supervision
of road construction and additional technical assistance to the Public Works
Department; (iii) preinvestment studies of the Bamako-Bougouni road; (iv)
a study of the trucking industry; and (v) procurement of highway equipment.
Two other items of the project, rehabilitation of the Bamako-Bougouni road
and purchase of more highway equipment, were to be financed with USAID assis-
tance. However, bids for reconstruction of the Bamako-Bougouni road (155
km) were so high that it was decided to drop that item, and USAID will only
finance purchase of maintenance equipment (for an amount of US$3.25 million).
Bids for reconstruction of the Faladie-Segou road (222 km) were also higher
than expected, but despite this, the works were awarded to the lowest bid-
der. The Board of Directors approved in June 1975 a Supplementary Credit
of US$8.3 million to cover the Association's share of the overrun. Unfor-
tunately, works have been delayed by more than one year, and there is a
dispute between the contractor and the Government. In addition there was a
dispute between the contractor and the government which was recently settled
following extensive discussions between the two parties. Other items of the
project are either completed or well under way.
Credit 384-MLI      Second Railway Project US$6.7 million Credit of May 23.
1973; Effective Date September 12, 1973; Closing Date
June 30, 1978
The project was expected to cost a total of about US$9.33 million,
with IDA participation of US$6.7 million and FAC-financing of US$1.8 million
equivalent, the rest being provided under Railway's own financing. Bidding
results disclosed a cost overrun of about US$2.6 million in the foreign
exchange component of the project. The cost overrun was caused by (a) low
original estimates; (b) sharp increases in world market prices; and (c) the
fact that only single bids were,received for some items. Additional bilateral
financing obtained for part of the freight cars proposed under the project
(Germany and France) and of the technical assistance (Canada) partly offset
the cost overrun. However, several items included in the project which had to
be deleted or significantly reduced will partially be financed under the
proposed third railway project which was appraised in July 1976. The Credit
will be fully disbursed by end May 1977 and the execution of the project is
satisfactory.
Credit 420-MLI      First Education ProJect US$5.0 million Credit of July 11,
1973; Effective Date November 15, 1973; Closing Date
December 31. 1979
The construction component of the project is a year behind schedule
due to cost overruns which led to a government decision to reduce the scope
of the project. However, implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.



ANNEX II
Page 4
All major construction and equipment contracts have been let and works and
equipment installation at the technical vocational institute are well ad-
vanced, with completion scheduled for Fall 1977. A continuing problem, at
the level of the government, is the availability of counterpart funds for
construction. In the short run, this can be countered by changing the dis-
bursement percentage for construction but the government must also undertake
better financial planning to ensure its contribution is met. The preinvest-
ment study of basic education is on schedule and progressing satisfactorily
and the experimental phase would be financed under the Proposed Second
Project.
Credit 443-MLI     Drought Relief Project.  US$2.5 million Credit of
December 7, 1973; Effective Date June 30, 1976; Closing
Date December 30, 1977
The Credit is almost totally disbursed and 11 of the 25 sub-projects
have been completed, basically as conceived. Cost overruns, mostly due to the
increase in price of basic materials and equipment, and the impact of the
dollar devaluation over the project period have made it impossible to finance
the entirety of the remaining 14 sub-projects with the Credit proceeds.
Government and IDA are discussing the matter and it is expected that other
donors will finance the bulk of the US$300,000 needed.
Credit 491-MLI     Integrated Rural Development Project.   US$8.0 million
Credit of July 1, 1974; Effective Date December 9, 1974;
Closing Date September 30, 1978
Most of the project components which had been delayed at the start
are now under way, specifically: livestock, health and rural tracks. The
project is making satisfactory progress in the primary marketing of ground-
nuts. The project, however, has obtained less than satisfactory results in
increasing the adoption rates of improved cultivation methods by farmers.
Improvement of OACV extension services would be the prime objective of a
second project presently being requested by Government. It would also be an
opportunity to change OACV statutes to give it greater financial autonomy and
operational flexibility.
Credit 538-MLI     Livestock Project.  US$13.3 million Credit of April 11,
1975; Effective Date July 24, 1975; Closing Date
December 31, 1979
After initial delays caused by the project's complexity and the
remoteness of the area, project implementation is now proceeding satisfac-
torily. ODEM is now efficiently executing the second veterinary vaccination
campaign under the project and has reached an advanced stage of preparation
for the Seno Mango grazing scheme (a prerequisite under the Credit Agreement
for undertaking the well construction program), for pond construction, and
for setting up the Mopti trial station. Accordingly, a new abattoir site
has been allocated to ODEM, and detailed preparation is being resumed. Con-
struction of the Project headquarters is under way; housing construction is
expected to start soon. Training of lower and medium level project staff



ANNEX II
Page 5
is under way, and individual training programs of senior Malian project staff
is being prepared. A project monitoring system will be prepared with the
help of a consultant.
Credit 599-MLI     Third Highway Project.   US$10.0 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date March 10, 1976;
Closing Date June 30, 1979.
The project consists of (a) construction of 1,200 km feeder roads
by force account; (b) elimination of backlog maintenance of about 944 km of
paved roads by force account; (c) procurement of equipment for the Public
Works Training Center and two Subdivisions; and (d) technical assistance for
implementing maintenance programs, operating the above Training Center and
preparing a country-wide transport plan. The Credit became effective on
March 10, 1976. About 203 km of feeder roads, for which the project provides
retroactive financing, were constructed in 1975. The first stage of the
maintenance program for paved roads, consisting of training the newly formed
brigade with the assistance of consultants, started in April. The Govern-
ment has started procuring the equipment financed under the project, and
is receiving the first deliveries. It has also called for proposals from
several foreign consulting firms to carry out the transport plan together
with Malian professionals.
Credit 669-MLI     Mali-Sud Agricultural Project.   US$15.5 million Credit
of December 23, 1976; Closing Date December 31, 1981.
The project consists of expanding cotton, kenaf, maize and rice
production mainly through the intensification of improved cultivation meth-
ods; providing project farmers with technical advice, seed multiplication
facilities applied research and credit; improving animal husbandry of cotton
farmers; expanding cotton processing facilities, improvement of kenaf set-
tling ponds, construction of a rice mill, provision of storage for inputs
procurement of vehicles for CMDT and improvement of agricultural tracks;
undertaking studies for the future development of the areas freed from on-
chocerciasis; improving the rural health services in the area; and training
of CMDT staff, and of the rural population through young farmers and black-
smith's training and a functional literacy program. The Credit is expected
to become effective on June 30, 1977.

Procurement
Arrangements:    Track renewal, ballasting and rail joint welding would be
performed by CFM's own staff which produced an acceptable
quality of work under the two previous projects. Bridge
repairs and reinforcements will be executed by an experi-
enced firm, to be selected following the Association's
guidelines on international competitive bidding, except
for minor related works and material in a total amount
not exceeding US$940,000 equivalent. Execution of bridge
rehabilitation and reinforcements will be supervised by
Sofrerail experts. Track maintenance equipment may be
purchased by international shopping. Spare parts for track
maintenance machinery will be purchased from the original
supplier. For the rehabilitation of training facilities
competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance
with local procedures acceptable to the Bank will be
followed. The consultants and instructors providing
technical assistance and training courses respectively
will be selected on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Association. The cost of items not subject to inter-
national competitive bidding will be reviewed by the
Association on the basis of international market prices.
The items being financed under bilateral aid and supplier
credits will follow donor's guidelines.
Consultants:       Total consultant's services would amount to 65 man/months.
(a) 38 man/months of technical assistance to CFM
to study and recommend measures for improving
operations along the international line from
Dakar-Bamako.



ANNEX III

(b) 19 man/months of technical assistance to CFM to
study the advantage of partial containerization
of international traffic.
(c) 8 man/months of technical assistance to CFM to

for rehabilitating or closing Bamako-Koulikoro
line.
Rate of Return:     The economic rate of return of the entire project is esti-
mated at 23%.
