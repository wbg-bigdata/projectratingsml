SUMMARY
i.         This report appraises a project covering the first three years
(1977-79) of the 1977-1981 investment plan of the Regie du Chemin de Fer
du Mali (CFM). CFM operates the Malian section of the international line
from Bamako to Dakar, which is the cheapest transport route for about 70% of
Mali's imports and exports. The objective of the physical component of the
project is the continuation of the rehabilitation and modernization of CFM
facilities begun under the First and Second Railway Projects (Credit 95-MLI,
1966 and 384-MLI, 1973). The training and technical assistance component is
designed to improve CFM's traffic and operating performance. The project
includes track work, bridge repairs, motive power and rolling stock, staff
training and studies. The estimated cost is MF 13.8 billion (US$28.2 million
equivalent), net of taxes, with physical and price contingencies of about MF
2.8 billion (US$5.8 million equivalent); the foreign component is estimated at
MF 12.4 billion (US$25.3 million equivalent). The project is expected to be
co-financed by CFM (MF 0.8 billion), France (FF 53 million), Canada (Can.
$5.2 million), and IDA (US$10.5 million) under a proposed Credit to be onlent
to CEM.
ii.        Despite substantial progress achieved by CGM in motive power avail-
ability and track maintenance, execution of the two previous projects has
been disappointing because (a) physical execution was hampered by the lack
of experienced CFM managerial and supervisory staff and by a severe cost
overrun that led to reducing the scope of the Second Project and (b) agreed
financial targets were not met mainly because of CEM's inability to carry
available traffic. The latter led to an increasing diversion to the more
expensive Ivory Coast routes. However, project implementation, together with
two parallel lending operations for the Senegal Railway, has been a major
element in preventing the total collapse of operations on the Senegal/Mali
railway system. The anticipated improvement of CFM's operating performance
under the proposed project would enable it to gain traffic and hence improve
its financial situation.
iii.       Mali's transport system consists of about (a) 13,000 km of roads,
1,600 km of which are paved; (b) 1,650 km of waterways navigable less than
seven months a year; (c) a small airport network (12) with one international
airport at Bamako; and (d) a 644 km railway linking Koulikoro and Bamako to
the Senegalese border, where it connects through the Senegal Railway system to
the port of Dakar. In addition to its importance for international traffic,
the Railway is the only transport service for passengers and freight movements
between Bamako and Kayes, the second largest city in the country. Interna-
tional traffic through Senegal is regulated by a Traffic and Customs agreement
between Governments and a convention between Railways. Under strong Associa-
tion pressure, the two Governments agreed in March 1977 on a temporary sus-
pension of cumbersome customs procedures, which were instituted under a Jan-
uary 1976 convention on international railway traffic, until a revised agree-
ment on simplified procedures can be drafted in consultation with the Asso-
ciation.



- ii -
iv.       The Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MPTW) exerts full
control over Malian transport enterprises, tariffs and traffic regulations
and allocations. MPTW will prepare a National Transport Plan 1978-84 based
on an IDA study financed under Credit 599-MLI (Third Highway Project). This
Plan should not include any major road construction parallel to the railway
unless in consultation with the Association and this was agreed during
negotiations.
v.        CFM was established in 1960 after the Dakar-Niger Railway was par-
titioned between Senegal and Mali. It is a Government-owned, public enterprise
operated on a commercial basis with a General Manager, who reports to a Board
chaired by the Minister of Transport and Public Works and who has sufficient
autonomy to permit effective management. CFM is being reorganized under a
CIDA-financed technical assistance program into five departments each headed
by a director. There are 1,500 permanent and 600 auxiliary employees. Man-
agerial and senior staff are well-trained but do not have enough experience.
Most mid-level staff need either theoretical or specialized training. Theo-
retical training is provided by the Training Department (TD) which is short
of facilities and instructors. Fourteen technical assistants supply some
on-the-job training.
vi.       CFM's budgeting, accounting and auditing procedures are generally
satisfactory; some deficiencies mainly in cost accounting are being overcome
under the CIDA-financed program. CFM's track, fixed installations, motive
power and rolling stock are generally well maintained except for bridges, some
of which need emergency repairs, and some old passenger cars. The proposed
project includes bridge repair and the replacement of old passenger equipment.
vii.      Physical constraints only partly explain the unsatisfactory turn-
around time of freight cars which is the main cause of CFM's inadequate
operating performance. Other reasons include: (a) lack of operational
management experience resulting in poor staff motivation and discipline; (b)
inadequate training standards; and (c) inefficient operations at Dakar port
and along the Senegalese part of the international line. A realistic plan
aimed at improving CFM's operations is proposed under the project. A parallel
project under preparation for the Senegal Railway will similarly emphasize the
improvement of operational efficiency.
viii.     Freight traffic should reach 465,000 tons and 211.6 million ton-km
by 1981. This would represent an annual growth rate of 4.8% in tonnage
and 5.5% in ton-km based on the 1975 level. Imports of petroleum products
will be the fastest growth element, climbing from 32,000 tons in 1975 to
75,000 tons in 1981. Achievement of this forecast traffic will require
the procurement of tank wagons under the project and the finalization of
long-term transport arrangements. Passenger traffic is expected to grow at an
annual rate of about 3%, reaching 140 million passenger-km in 1981 as opposed
to 103 million passenger-km in 1975.
ix.       CFM will be responsible for execution of the project, which will
require extensive IDA supervision. IDA-financed bridge repairs will be



- iii -
carried out by a qualified firm selected under Bank-approved international
bidding procedures.   Consultants providing technical assistance will be
selected on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association. Possible
savings could be used to finance additional investments as agreed with the
Association.
x.        Benefits from the project will be continued operation of the line,
reduced maintenance and operating costs, new equipment and substantially
increased capacity for petroleum traffic. The economic rate of return of
the entire project is estimated to be 23% and all individual components are
economically justified even under slow traffic growth assumptions utilized
for sensitivity analysis purposes.
xi.       CFM's inadequate traffic performance and tariff-setting policies
over the past 10 years resulted in an unacceptable financial position which
the Government has agreed to restore by waiving about MF 2.2 billion of
CFM's debts to it prior to Credit negotiations. The Government and CFM
agreed at negotiations to (a) revalue CFM's fixed assets as of December 31,
1976 and enter this revaluation in CFM's 1977 accounts; (b) undertake future
revaluations of fixed assets when appropriate in consultation with the Asso-
ciation; (c) achieve working ratios of no more than 67% in 1977, 70% in
1978, 61% in 1979, 64% in 1980 and 60% for 1981 and 1982; (d) maintain CFM's
working capital at stated levels; and (e) discuss draft annual budgets with
the Association prior to submitting them to CFM's Board.
xii.      A sensitivity analysis of financial forecasts was conducted under
the following assumptions: (a) stagnation of petroleum traffic at the 1976
45,000 level; (b) 15% decrease in revenues generated by exports; (c) 10%
increase in working expenditures; and (d) 20% increase in the cost of the
bridge component and 10% increase in the cost of the remaining components
of the project. The analysis showed that simultaneous materialization of
all four assumptions would result in a cumulated MF 5 billion (US$10 million)
shortage over 1977-81. This could be overcome by tariff increases 20% above
those planned in the main analysis.
xiii.     The proposed project with conditions as stipulated is suitable
for an IDA Credit of US$10.5 million to the Government of Mali with relending
to CFM for a term of 20 years, including four and a half years of grace,
at an interest rate of 6% per annum, which is the highest CFM could afford
under projected productivity, traffic and financial performance.






MALI THIRD RAILWAY PROJECT
APPRAISAL REPORT
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Mali Republic and the Regie du Chemin de Fer
du Mali (CFM) have asked the Association to finance part of their railway in-
vestment plan for continued rehabilitation of CFM's infrastructure and equip-
ment and for improved management, operations and finances. The proposed
project comprises track work, bridge repair, motive power and rolling stock,
staff training and studies for improving operations on the international line
between Bamako and the Dakar Port. The estimated cost of the project is about
MF 13.8 billion (US$28.2 million equivalent) with a local component of about
MF 1.4 billion (US$2.9 million equivalent). The project will be financed
jointly by CFM, the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) in association
with the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA) and IDA under a proposed US$10.5
million (MF 5.15 billion equivalent) credit.
.1.02     This would be the third railway project in Mali since the country
became independent in 1960. The first (Credit 95-MLI, US$9.1 million, 1967)
was fully disbursed on January 20, 1975. Disbursements under the second
(Credit 384-MLI, US$6.7 million, 1973) should be completed by late May 1977.
Prior to independence, what was to become the Mali Railway benefited in part
from a US$7.5 million Bank loan (Loan 100-FR) to the Office Central des
Chemins de Fer, a French Government agency concerned with managing railways in
francophone West Africa. In addition to these projects, the Association has
also financed three highway projects: Credit 197-MLI, US$8.9 million, 1970;
Credit 383-MLI, US$9.5 million, 1973; and Credit 599-MLI, US$10 million,
1976.
1.03      Physical implementation of the two previous railway projects has
been disappointing. The first project (Credit 95-MLI) was completed two
years behind schedule due to long bidding procedures and delays in track-
laying work resulting from inexperienced managerial and supervisory staff.
The second project (Credit 384-MLI) suffered severe cost overruns caused by
under-estimatation of costs at appraisal and world price inflation thereafter
(see Annex I). This largely reduced the scope of the project and several
deleted items have had to be incorporated into the proposed project (quarry
equipment, track ballasting and welding, coaches and bridge repairs).
1.04      Except for a substantial improvement in mainline locomotive avail-
ability, CFM did not achieve the operating performance anticipated under the
two previous railway projects because of (a) the lack of resources to com-
plete rehabilitation of the track and equipment, (b) inefficient operational
management, (c) poor staff discipline, and (d) inadequate training despite
maximum use of the meager facilities. This resulted in weakening CFM's
traffic performance, which was further handicapped by poor track and operating
conditions on the connecting Senegal Railway and inadequate cooperation
between the Mali and Senegal Railways. Consequently, an increasing share of



-2-
Mali imports and exports were diverted to the more expensive Ivory Coast
routes. This loss of potential traffic and the reluctance of the Government
to implement recommended tariff increases resulted in CFM's failure to meet
agreed financial objectives.
1.05      CFM was once part of the Dakar-Niger Railway (DN) which operated
under a single management until 1960 when DN was dissolved. Its assets were
split between CFM (38X of assets) and the Regie des Chemins de Fer du Senegal
(62% of assets). Since the two railways basically operate one system,
parallel Loans/Credits have been made to each to produce coordinated results.
Senegal was granted Credit 96-SE (US$9 million, 1966) parallel to Credit
95-MLI; and Loan 835-SE (US$6.4 million, 1972)/Credit 314-SE (US$3.2 million,
1972), parallel to Credit 384-MLI. The Senegal Railway's performance in
implementing the projects and meeting operational and financial objectives has
been even more disappointing than CFM's.
1.06      Despite the inadequate performance of both railways, implementation
of the previous projects helped prevent the total collapse of operations along
the Dakar-Bamako line, which is the main transport axis between Dakar and
eastern Senegal and which is vital for Mali imports and exports. In addition,
CFM achieved substantial progress in locomotive availability and track condi-
tion. Further Bank Group assistance to the two railways, including the pro-
posed project, would provide the continuation of the physical rehabilitation
of the line and for technical assistance to improve its operating efficiency
and financial viability.
1.07      This appraisal is based on information supplied by the Government
and CFM and the findings of an appraisal mission in July 1976 comprising
Messrs. P. Levy (Financial Analyst), J. Duchemin (Consultant Railway Engineer),
S. Kanoun (Financial Analyst, EDI), H. Levy (Economist), G. Morra (Training
Officer) and D. Stockmann (Railway Engineer).
2. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      The Vepublic of Mali, located in Sahelian Africa, covers some
1.2 million km and has a population of about 5.3 million. It is a land-
locked country; its principal outlets are the ports of Dakar in Senegal
and Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, both about 1,200 km from Bamako, the
capital. Mali's economic activity, mostly agriculture and livestock, and
population are concentrated in the southwest, where there is enough rainfall
and conditions are suitable for fast-growing, drought-tolerant export crops
such as groundnuts and cotton, and staple foods, such as millet and sorghum.
The northern parts of the country are largely uninhabited desert.
2.02      Gross Domestic Product (GDP), less than US$100 per capita, grew
at about 5% between 1970 and 1972, dropped in 1973 and 1974 due to the



- 3 -
drought but increased by almost 13% in 1975. Agriculture accounts for about
25% of the GDP. The two main export crops, groundnuts and cotton, are crucial
to the economy as they provide about half of the country's total foreign
currency earnings.
2.03      The country suffers from several significant development constraints:
(i) long distances to export-import outlets, (ii) few known mineral resources,
(iii) a weak agricultural base stemming mainly from low and ill-distributed
rainfall, (iv) a serious shortage of skilled manpower, both technical and
managerial, and (v) commmunications problems due to the country's large size
and its widely dispersed population. The five-year 1974-78 National Develop-
ment Plan assigns high priority to agriculture, irrigation, electricity
generating capacity, agro-industries and the transport system.
B.   The Transport System
2.04      The Malian transport network is fairly extensive (see Map IBRD
12493), consisting of: (a) 13,000 km of roads, of which 1,600 km are paved,
3,300 km all-weather roads and the remainder dirt roads and tracks; (b) a
644 km railway linking Koulikoro and Bamako with the Senegal railway and the
port of Dakar; (c) about 1,650 km of inland waterways, which are navigable
less than seven months per year; and (d) an international airport at Bamako
and about a dozen airfields for domestic commercial services.
2.05      According to the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW),
traffic in the different transport modes in 1973 was the following:
Road:             310 million ton-km and 720 million pass-km
Rail:             156 million ton-km and 95 million pass-km
Waterways:        30 million ton-km and 20 million pass-km
Air:              10 million ton-km and 65 million pass-km
2.06      The road system and the railway are the principal means of trans-
port. The paved roads are concentrated in the Bamako-Sikasso-Mopti triangle,
the fastest growing area in Mali. The all-weather and dirt roads link out-
lying areas to the paved road system or are feeder roads west of Bamako
connecting agricultural areas to the railway. IDA's Third Highway Project
(Credit 599-MLI, January 1976, US$10 million) includes improvement of two
roads, Sefeto-Toukoto and Madina-Badinko, in this latter category.
C.   The Role of the Railway
2.07      The railway provides (a) the cheapest transport for about 70% of
Mali import and export traffic and (b) all domestic passenger and freight
transport west of Bamako to the Senegalese border, including the only land
transport link between the capital and Kayes, Mali's second largest city.
There is no road on this route, and the existing tracks can only be travelled
by jeeps and only during part of the year. A report on the Bamako-Kayes



corridor prepared in 1976 under UNDP financing by the consulting firm Louis
Berger International, Inc. concluded that construction of a road between
these two cities was not economically justified. The alternate routes from
Bamako to the Port of Abidjan are both about 1,200 km, whether by road or by a
road/rail combination; paved roads lead from Bamako to Bobo-Dioulasso in Upper
Volta or to Ouangalodougou in Ivory Coast, and from either point to Abidjan by
rail. A longer and more expensive route through the Port of Lome in Togo is
rarely used.
2.08      The railway's main activity is carrying international traffic
to and from Dakar, the most economic route for most exports originating at
Bamako and west to the Senegal border, and for all imports destined as far as
Segou, about 200 km east of Bamako. For imports, the cost differential
between the Dakar and Abidjan routes ranges from MF 7,200/ton for cement to MF
20,300/ton for petroleum products (Table 1). However, CFM has not carried as
much international traffic as this cost advantage would suggest as appropriate.
From 1972 to 1975, international traffic grew from 204,000 tons to 252,000
tons via the Dakar route but from 84,000 tons to 240,000 tons via the Abidjan
routes. The main problems hindering international traffic on the Dakar line
are operational difficulties on the Senegal railway line and at the Port of
Dakar, insufficient coordination between the two railways, and slow mainline
and terminal operations in Mali. Another important factor is that the Mali
Government allocates traffic instead of permiting the normal market mechanism
to operate (see para. 2.12). The Mali Railway was able to increase considerably
its transport capacity during the drought emergency, and it should be able to
operate at comparable levels of efficiency in the future. An aim of the
proposed project is to enable the Mali and Senegal Railways to regain traffic
of bulk commodities such as petroleum, fertilizers and cement which have been
diverted to Abidjan at an unnecessarily high cost.
2.09      International traffic through Senegal is regulated by an agreement
between the Governments of Senegal and Mali providing for tax-free movement of
goods between the countries. In early 1976, to cut down on smuggling, the two
Governments created a complicated system of customs procedures that has
resulted in long delays in loading operations and border formalities, further
hampering international traffic. In March 1977 the two Goverments decided to
temporarily suspend implementation of the system until a revised agreement
simplifying present procedures could be drafted in agreement with the Associ-
ation. To protect the line from possible political interferance, any sub-
stantial interruption in international traffic between Senegal and Mali for
any reason other than technical or other reasons beyond the Borrower's control
should be considered a default.
D.   Transport Coordination and Planning
2.10      The Government exerts full control over the major companies in
the transport sector: CFM, Mali Navigation Company, which carries about 70%
of waterway traffic; Mali Road Transport Company, which carries about 20%



- 5 -
of total road freight; and Air Mali, the only locally based air carrier,
which handles both domestic and a considerable amount of international traffic.
Furthermore, the Government regulates all rail tariffs and most air, river
navigation and trucking tariffs, and controls the truck fleets of state
enterprises. A significant part of road freight, however, is carried by
small, independent operators. A comprehensive study of the trucking industry,
financed under the Second Highway Credit (383-MLI), is being carried out by
the consulting firm Tractionel (Belgium) and should be completed in mid-1977.
2.11      The Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPW) is responsible
for overall transport coordination and for the planning and execution of
public works. There are few problems of intermodal investment coordination,
since the road system caters mainly to areas not served by the CFM. In
the case of the Bamako-Kayes corridor, the possible construction of a road
parallel to the railway was recently analyzed by consultants, who advised
against it. The Government has agreed that it will not undertake any major
road construction parallel to the railway line except in consultation with the
Association. The completion in 1975 of a paved road parallel to the Bamako-
Koulikoro line may pose a local transport coordination problem which merits
close scrutiny to avoid duplication of investments. The Government will
prepare a National Transport Plan 1978-1994 which will be based on a study
financed by IDA under Credit 599-MLI.
2.12      Within the MTPW, the National Transport Office (NTO) is responsi-
ble for regulating transport entities, approving tariffs and allocating
export-import traffic between the competing routes. Enforcement of regula-
tions and control of rates is generally effective. The allocation of inter-
national traffic is tentatively made at the beginning of each year and imple-
mented by NTO on a weekly basis. Year-end assessments show that the railway
generally carries much less than originally assigned, resulting, as mentioned
in para. 2.08, in an uneconomic route allocation of the country's international
traffic. The difference between planned and actual railway traffic is ex-
plained by the operational problems already cited, and the active marketing
policies of truckers operating over the Ivory Coast route.
3. MALI RAILWAY
A.   Organization and Management
3.01      CFM, owned by the Government, was established in 1960 as an auton-
omous public enterprise to be operated on a commercial basis. It is under
the authority of the Minister of Transport and Public Works, who also scrves
as Chairman of the 16-member CFM Board. The Board comprises six minis,ers, the
Director of Post and Telecommunications, and nine other members representing
the users, the National Assembly, and staff.



- 6 -
3.02      CFM is being reorganized under the ongoing Second Railway Project
through a CIDA-financed technical assistance program carried out by CANAC,
a Canadian consulting firm. An organization chart is shown in Annex 2. The
new organization provides for five departments: planning,-accounting and
control; operations; marketing; personnel; and supply and stores. Each is
under a director reporting to the General Manager who is assisted by an
Assistant General Manager, a legal advisor and an administrative assistant.
The assistant general manager acts ex officio as director of the planning,
accounting and control department whose project division supervises major
investment programs. The director of operations coordinates the activity of
the track and building and mechanical divisions. Marketing and tariff-setting
are the responsibility of the marketing director. In addition to being
responsible for staff management, the director of personnel has authority
over the training division. Supplies and stores are under the control of
the director of supply and stores. A management committee, consisting of the
Director General and the five directors, meets weekly to coordinate the work
of the different departments. This new organization is expected to have a
beneficial effect on CFM's managerial, operating and financial performance.
B.   Staff and Wages
3.03      CFM's 1976 budgeted personnel consists of 618 permanent staff and
1,434 auxiliary staff, about 600 of whom are temporary laborers mostly work-
ing on track maintenance. Among permanent staff, 45 are in managerial or
senior supervisory positions and 150 are foremen. Since appraisal of the
Second Railway Project in mid-1972, CFM staff has decreased by 128 despite
a 20% increase in traffic units p.a. (passenger-km plus ton-km). Staff
productivity has increased by 25% from 100,000 traffic units per employee
in 1972 to 125,000 in 1976. The plan of action shown in Annex 2 sets a tar-
get of 183,000 traffic units per employee for 1980, while keeping the staff
at its present level. The percentage of personnel costs to total working
cost is expected to increase from the present 40% to an acceptable 45% (para.
6.08). Present annual salaries range from MF 249,000 (US$500 equivalent) for
a temporary laborer to MF 1,900,000 (US$3,900 equivalent) for upper-level
managerial staff. The average annual foreman's salary reaches MF 1,170,000
(US$2,400 equivalent).
3.04      Most of management and senior staff consists of specialists, who
studied in foreign universities and joined the railway a few years ago; all
do not yet have adequate practical experience and most lack the confidence
and authority which accompany experience. The result is that most day-to-day
decision-making is left to the General Manager. Some of the middle-level
supervisory staff have long-term experience with the railway but lack tech-
nical knowledge, while others have had adequate theoretical training in local
schools but need specialized training.
3.05      In addition to the above-mentioned temporary Canadian technical assis-
tance, France (OFERMAT) provides 14 technical advisors, one of wnom works with
CFM's general management while 13 work with technical departments, where they
provide some on-the-job training to Malian counterparts. The number of French



-7-
technical advisors has been reduced from 18 in 1973 to the present 14 on the
request of CFM's management. This number is adequate and should not be
further reduced until Malians trained under the project can take over. The
Government and CFM have agreed that CFM will maintain technical assistance,
with emphasis on training Malian counterparts at levels and numbers to be
annually assessed in agreement with the Association.
3.06      Systematic training of CFM staff started only after the Training
Division (TD) was officially established in early 1969, but was limited by
meager facilities and the shortage of qualified instructors. Most of the
activities of the TD have been concentrated on the training and retraining of
skilled labor and low-level staff to meet the most urgent needs of CFM's
operations and on organizing courses for supervisory staff. The TD has also
implemented special programs to train and upgrade Malian instructors. The
training component included in the proposed project will improve the quality
of CFM's staff training by expanding physical facilities, providing training
equipment and adding new programs for middle-level staff. Details are given in
Annex 4.
C.   Budgeting and Accounting
3.07      CFM's Budgetary Planning and Statistics Division prepares annual
capital and recurrent budgets under the control of the chief accountant who
reports to the Assistant General Manager in the latter's capacity as Director
of the Planning and Control Department. To become effective, the budget must
be approved by CFM's Board and signed by the Minister of Transport and Public
Works.
3.08      Accounting is done on a commercial basis by a division of the
Department of Planning, Accounting and Control and is the responsibility of
the chief accountant; another division of this department is in charge of cost
accounting. Both of these divisions fall under the supervision of yet a
third division (Division of Control and Methods) which acts as an internal
audit. CFM's accounting system, recently improved under the reorganization
carried out by CANAC, is satisfactory.
3.09      In accordance with an agreement reached  under Credits 95-MLI and
384-MLI, an independent firm of auditors acceptable to the Association
was appointed to audit CFM's accounts. Since 1973 the auditor's reports
have complied with the Association's auditing requirements and have been
made available within the required time, i.e. not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year. It has been agreed that the covenant on
the auditing of CFM, included in Credit Agreement 384-MLI and the relevant
Project Agreement, will be similarly applicable to the proposed Credit and
Project Agreements.
D.   Railway Property
3.10      The single-track, meter-gauge Mali Railway is 644 km long.  The
track is adequate, and, when ballasting and rail joint welding are completed,
it will be in good condition. The line's four major bridges and about



8
60 small masonry or concrete bridges, however, are in very poor condition and
there is some risk of collapse. Telephone lines were renewed under the First
Railway Project. The completely dieselized locomotive and railcar fleet
consists of 17 line and 8 shunting locomotives and 4 railcars. They are in
satisfactory operating condition since under Credit 384-MLI spare parts were
acquired and maintenance'operations reorganized in the Korofina workshops.
The passenger car fleet consists of 30 cars; eight are more than 25 years
old and in poor condition. The freight car fleet was partially renewed
under Credit 384-MLI and consists of 328 cars for commercial traffic. A
brief description of railway track, bridges and equipment is given in
Annex 5. Details of locomotives and rolling stock are given in Table 2.
E.   Operations
3.11      Table 3 summarizes available traffic and operating statistics from
1972 to 1975. Since data on freight car turnaround time, specific reasons
for train delays and standing times of freight cars are not available, these
statistics do not comprehensively assess CFM's operating efficiency. This
lack of information also adversely affects CFM's operational management's
decision-making ability. Therefore, creating an adequate reporting system
is to be included in the terms of reference of the proposed operational
study (see para. 4.14 and Annex 9).
3.12      CFM's mainline locomotives are mainly used for hauling freight
trains, while passenger traffic, except for the weekly international round
trip and some mixed trains, is carried by railcars. The availability of CFM's
locomotives improved from a low 51% in 1972 to 73% in 1975. However, between
1973, when 5 new units were put into service, and 1975, the average annual run
only marginally increased. This is inadequate use of available equipment.
Similarly, the 1975 annual run and paying traffic per freight car did not
improve as compared with the low 1973 performance.
3.13      One of the main reasons for the unsatisfactory operating perfor-
mance is freight car tunaround time, which French technical advisors estimate
at 15 days. This is an average for both international and national traffic,
and since the turnaround time for national traffic is considerably shorter
than for international traffic, the latter is especially poor. Worn-out
switches, outdated plain roller bearings which cause hot boxes on older freight
cars and unsuitable passenger car bogies result in derailments. However,
these physical constraints only partially explain the low performance. Other
important reasons are organizational and managerial: low training standard
despite TD's strong effort, inefficient operational management resulting in
little staff motivation and discipline, lack of a central wagon control and
insufficient statistics. In addition, freight car utilization has been
severely hampered by (a) inefficient terminal operations at Dakar Port;
(b) the poor condition of track in Senegal; (c) the poor operating perfor-
mance of the Senegal Railway; and (d) inadequate coordination between the
Mali and Senegal Railways on operations at Dakar Port and along the Senegalese
section of the international line.



-9-
3.14      Delivery of spare parts financed under the Second Railway Project
and new locomotives to be acquired under the proposed project should raise
locomotive availability to 84% by 1980. The provision and installation of
switches, adequate roller bearings for freight cars and bogies for passenger
cars under the proposed project should reduce the number of derailments.
Implementation of (i) the CFM reorganization being carried out by CANAC,
(ii) the proposed training program, and (iii) recommendations resulting from
the proposed operational study should result in satisfactory turnaround times
and train punctuality, which in turn should lead to better use of new and
more reliable equipment. In addition, implementation of a parallel railway
project in Senegal should provide for more reliable operations along the
Senegalese part of the international line. CFM and the Association have
agreed on a technical plan of action providing for a staggered program for
improving CFM's locomotive abilability and freight car productivity (Annex
3).
F.   Traffic
Freight Traffic
3.15      The main freight items carried by CFM are:
(a)  national traffic:  cement (about 45,000 tons/year)
from the Diamou cement plant near Kayes mainly to Bamako;
(b) exports: groundnut products (close to 30,000 tons/year),
produced mainly between Bamako and Kayes; cotton and cotton
products (about 10,000 tons/year), originating mainly
in the Bamako-Sikasso-Segou area; and cola nuts;
(c) imports: foodstuffs, mainly sugar and flour (about
60,000 tons/year) and petroleum products (close to
35,000 tons/year).
The traffic forecast presented in Table 4 and detailed in Annex 6 shows
that by 1981, the last year of the Plan, total freight traffic should reach
465,000 tons, or 211.6 million ton-km. This would represent an annual
growth rate of 4.8% in tonnage and 5.5% in ton-km based on the 1975 level;
the annual growth rate in tonnage during the period, by traffic category,
would be: 3.5% in national traffic, 7.1% in exports, and 4.8% in imports.
Imports of petroleum products will be the fastest growing item, climbing
from 32,000 tons in 1975 to 75,000 tons in 1981, with the railway carrying
46% of the country's petroleum imports compared to 28% in 1975. In addition
to increased tank capacity and service availability, the lower cost of ship-
ment via Dakar as compared with Abidjan will be an important factor behind
this substantial growth. The anticipated improvement of CFM's operating
efficiency and reliability and expected operational improvements on the
Senegal line should also allow CFM to partly recapture Mali bulk exports
and imports presently diverted along the Ivory Coast routes. The planned



- 10 -
increases in petroleum traffic are based upon the following actions being
taken: (a) agreements reached during the preparation of this project that
the oil companies will concentrate loading (in Senegal) in one place rather
than the present three; and (b) long-term arrangements to be made for the
the transport by CFM of petroleum products, including, inter alia, modifi-
cation of the system of price stabilization for such products. Finalization
of these arrangements (b) will be condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. The Government and CFM have also prepared adequate plans for the
transport of bulk commodities (fertilizer, cotton, cement).
Passenger Traffic
3.16      During the 1965-75 period, the number of recorded passengers de-
creased from 561,000 to 492,000, a rate of about 1% per year. Passenger-km
increased from 62.1 million to 102.7 million, or 5.3% per year. The average
distance travelled almost doubled during the period, from 111 km to 209 km.
These figures reflect a substantial drop in short-distance passengers and an
increase in passengers travelling long distances, mainly on the international
line. This phenomenom resulted not from road transport competition (which
is non-existent) but from a failure to meet the demand for service on the
national operations coupled with poor quality service. The above figures may,
however, overestimate the real drop in the number of passengers, as statistics
are derived from fare collection data. It is likely that collection has
deteriorated in recent years, particularly for domestic passengers travelling
short distances. The Regie has undertaken to promptly implement a program
satisfactory to the Association to ensure the regular collection of fares.
The traffic forecast (Table 5 and Annex 8) takes into account the purchase of
one railcar, trailers and passenger cars under the proposed project and antici-
pates an annual average increase in passenger-km close to 3% for national
passengers and 5.2% for international passengers over 1975 volumes.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   The Plan
4.01      During appraisal of the proposed project, CFM and the mission
agreed on a 1977-81 railway investment plan estimated to cost MF 20 bil-
lion (US$40 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of about
MF 15 billion (US$29.6 million equivalent). The revised plan is summarized
in Table 6 and detailed in Annex 9. Its main components and costs are as
follows:



- 11 -
MF Million   US$ Million Equiv.
a)  Track (including equipment for
a ballast quarry)                            2,093             4.27
b)  Bridge repairs and rehabilitation            3,585              7.32
c)  Improvements to telecommunications              33             0.07

GRAND TOTAL                          19,591             39.98
B.   The Project
4.02      The proposed project covers the first three years (1977-79) of
this plan and includes the following:
(a) Track - MF 1,875 million (US$3.83 million)
(b)  Bridges - MF 3,585 million (US$7.32 million)
(c) Telecommunication - MF 33 million (US$0.07 million)
(d) Rolling Stock - MF 5,127 million (US$10.46 million)
(e) Workshop - MF 11 million (US$0.02 million)
(f) Training - MF 174 million (US$0.35 million)
(g) Studies - MF 189 million (US$0.39 million)
(h) Contingencies - MF 2,846 million (US$5.81 million)
The estimated cost is MF 13.8 billion (US$28.2 million equivalent), net of
taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of about MF 12.4 billion
(US$25.3 million equivalent). Further details are in Table 6.



- 12 -
4.03      Track material for the Kayes-Senegal border line (91.7 km) was
financed under Credits 95-MLI and 384-MLI, and renewal of track is being
carried out on 70.2 km of the line. The proposed Project includes renewal
of the remaining 21.5 km.
4.04      Some 210 km of line require stone ballast and another 400 km
requires welding of rail joints. The proposed project would provide for
the ballasting of 100 km and welding of 130 km of line over the three-
year project period. A ballasting and welding program was originally
included in the Second Project but was deleted due to cost overruns. A
welding machine with a capacity of about 43 km p.a. provided under that
project will be used. The ballasting and welding programs will prolong the
life of track material and reduce maintenance costs.
4.05      Implementation of the ballasting program will require a reliable
supply of ballast which cannot be assured by small local suppliers. The
project would therefore help CFM to locate a ballast quarry and provide
equipment for its operation.
4.06      To ensure a smooth execution of the track ballasting and welding
program, the proposed project would include the provision of spare parts
for the maintenance of CFM's tamping machines and equipment for track
maintenance.
4.07      During the past year, most derailments have been attributable
to faulty switches. In order to reduce the number of derailments, the
proposed project would provide for the purchase and installation of 68
switches. In addition, the project would provide the financing needed
for the extension of loops in three stations so as to increase the number
of possible crossing points. The longer loops will be needed because the
purchase of three heavy locomotives, financed under the project by France,
will permit CFM to operate longer freight trains.
4.08      At appraisal of the Second Project the bridges were found to be in
poor condition.   FAC-financed studies completed by SOFRERAIL in 1973 showed
that most of the bridges between Bamako and the Senegal border were in poor
condition, and a speed limit of 10 km/h is now enforced on them. The project
includes urgent bridge repairs, some of which were deleted from the Second
Project, and reinforcement so that the axle load can be raised to 17 tons and
diesel main-line locomotives will be able to operate without speed restric-
tions on all bridges. For safety reasons this item has highest priority.
4.09      The renewal of telephone lines was satisfactorily completed in
1972 under the First Railway Project, but reliable connections between Bamako
and the Senegalese network remain to be installed. This would be under-
taken in the proposed project.
4.10      A review of motive power and rolling stock requirements in light of
traffic forecasts and realistic assessments of equipment availability and
utilization have revealed an immediate need for three main-line locomotives,



- 13 -
two shunters, one railcar, four trailers, four passenger coaches, 14 ballast
and 18 tank wagons. The three 1800-HP main-line locomotives, type CC-2400,
will be provided under an agreement already reached between CFM and France.
4.11      To follow up the effort made under the previous projects to equip
the workshops, financing has been included for the purchase of a grinding-
lathe for repairing crankshafts of diesel locomotives.
C.   Training
4.12      The proposed CFM 3-year training expansion program to be financed
under the project aims at improving the standard of railway operations and
maintenance by training and retraining a total of about 1,500 skilled laborers
and low- and middle-level staff. The insufficient training facilities in
Bamako would be expanded and consolidated in a single, new training center
with a dormitory, additional classrooms, workshops, demonstration rooms,
stores, training materials, and equipment. A small secondary training center
would also be constructed at Kayes. The project includes (i) financing short
training programs abroad for four senior Malian instructors (Section Chiefs)
and 11 experienced supervisory staff (Division Chiefs); (ii) training three
Malian instructors in Mali by an expatriate instructor; (iii) recruiting of
three expatriate instructors; and (iv) purchasing furniture/equipment, didactic
materials and training equipment for the two centers. Details are given in
Annex 3. During negotiations the Government and CFM agreed to (a) make avail-
able sufficiently experienced Malian personnel for training as instructors;
(b) make arrangements satisfactory to the Association for the training of
senior instructors and supervisory staff; and (c) insure that sufficient
numbers of personnel are released from individual departments for training.
D.   Technical Assistance
4.13      The main objective of Bank Group railway projects in Mali and
Senegal is to develop an efficient and financially viable international
railway line between Dakar and Bamako. The proposed project includes con-
sulting services to study joint operations. The operational study would
recommend measures for improving the terminal loading points and train
operations in Mali, Senegal and along the line. Within this framework the
consultants should assess all areas where increased cooperation between Mali
and Senegal would improve operations (e.g. unifying traffic rules, estab-
lishing specialized workshops, increasing inter-penetration of locomotives,
and combining training schemes) and should make specific recommendations. The
consultants should also investigate the possible advantage of partial con-
tainerization of international traffic. Draft terms of reference for these
services are given in Annex 9. After agreement with the Association on the
objectives and terms of reference of the study, the Mali Government and
Railway would have to obtain clearance from the Senegalese Government and
Railway. Following completion and review of the study, implementation of the
consultants' recommendations will be subject to mutual agreement by both
countries and the Association. The proposed project also provides for a study
of the financial and economic justifications for rehabilitating or closing the



- 14 -
Bamako-Koulikoro line, whose bridges are in such poor condition that the line
has had to be closed to freight traffic. The Government and CFM will consult
with the Association on implementation of the consultant's recommendations.
4.14      Cost estimates are based on the following:  for tracks, on updated
prices quoted for the last section of renewal; for the ballast quarry and
its equipment, on recent quotations made during Credit 384-MLI; and for
ballasting and rail joint welding, on CFM estimates of local cost. Prices
were updated to 1976 prices and reviewed by the Association. Costs for
bridge repairs and reinforcements were derived from a 1973 SOFRERAIL study
and updated as of 1976 in agreement with CFM. Locomotive and rolling stock
are based on figures negotiated by CFM, CIDA and FAC for Canadian and French
financing respectively. Cost calculations for consultant services were based
on a yearly average of US$70,000 per man-year. Physical contingencies have
been provided at 10% on the foreign and local cost of track and bridge compo-
nents. Price contingencies have been calculated at 13% on civil works, and 9%
on equipment for 1976, 12% and 8% respectively for 1977-79, 10% and 7% respec-
tively for 1980-81 for all items financed by CFM, France or IDA.  For items
financed by Canada, price contingencies were calculated at 14%. Overall price
contingency element allows for cost increases for the project averaging 16%.
Detailed cost estimates are given in Table 6 and summarized below:

E.   Financing of the Project
4.15      The project is expected to be co-financed by CFM, FAC/CCCE (France),
CIDA (Canada) and the Association. The financing plan is given in Table 7 and
summarized below:
MF Million                               US$ Million
Source     Local      Foreign       Total           Local      Foreign      Total

Under this plan, 56% of local costs would be financed by Mali, 10% by France
and 34% by the Association.  France would provide 42% of the foreign exchange
costs, Canada 21% and the Association 37%.   The proposed IDA Credit would be
used to finance track maintenance equipment (US$0.1 million), bridge rehabili-
tation (US$6.6 million), training (US$0.2 million), studies (US$0.3 million)
and physical and price contingencies (US$3.3 million). At negotiations the
Government agreed that in case of any shortfall in funds it will provide
the amounts necessary or secure alternative financing to assure full implemen-
tation of the project.
4.16      The foreign component of this financing plan is expected to be
made under the following terms:

It was agreed at negotiations that the Government will relend the
IDA Credit to CFM at an interest rate of 6% p.a. for a term of 20 years
including 4.5 years of grace. Finalization of the onlending agreement
will be a condition of credit effectiveness. The proposed rate is lower
than the present Bank lending but it is the highest CFM can afford under
present productivity, traffic and financial performance assumptions.
F.   Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.17      Track renewal, ballasting and rail joint welding would be performed
by CFM's own staff which produced an acceptable quality of work under the two
previous projects. Bridge repairs and reinforcements will have to be executed
by an experienced firm, to be selected following the Association's guidelines
on international competitive bidding, except for minor works and material for
a total amount not exceeding US$940,000 equivalent. Execution of bridge
rehabilitation and reinforcement will be supervised by SOFRERAIL experts.
Track maintenance equipment may be purchased y international shopping. Spare
parts for track maintenance machinery will be purchased from the original sup-
plier. For the rehabilitation of training facilities, competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the
Bank will be followed. The consultants and instructors providing technical
assistance and training courses respectively will be selected on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association. The cost of items not subject to
international competitive bidding will be reviewed by the Association on the
basis of international market prices. The items being financed under bilateral
aid and supplier credits will follow donors' guidelines.
4.18      Association Credit disbursements would be made for the foreign
cost of the bridge component cif Mali border. The credit will be used as
following:
a)  Track maintenance equipment    52% of local cost and 100% of
foreign cost
b)  Bridge repairs and               74% of local cost and
reinforcement                   100% of foreign cost
c)  Training                         69% of foreign cost /1
d)  Studies                         100% of foreign cost
/1   France will finance the balance of the foreign compo-
nent of this item under a parallel lending operation.
The estimated annual rate of disbursement for the total amount of the invest-
ment plan is given in Table 8. The estimated quarterly rate of disbursement
of the IDA credit is given in Table 9. It is proposed that any savings on
Credit-financed items be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items of
the same nature identified during subsequent reviews carried out in agreement
with the Association.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Investment Objectives
5.01      The project comprises the first three years of the railway's
1977-81 investment plan and is a logical continuation of the rehabilitation
and modernization program undertaken during 1973-76 with IDA assistance.
The project's objectives are to ensure continued operation of the railway
and to provide it with the capacity required to carry forecast traffic at
increased efficiency levels by (a) rehabilitating and improving track,
bridges and rolling stock; (b) providing new equipment for freight and
passenger traffic; (c) training; and (d) providing consulting services to
initiate technical changes including increased cooperation with the Senegal
Railway.
B.   Economic Return of Proposed Investments
5.02      All main physical components of the proposed project have been
evaluated separately, and a single return has also been determined for the
whole project. A sensitivity analysis to test the effect of changes in
main assumptions on the rate of return, including variations in investment
costs and forecast traffic (Tables 4 and 5), has been undertaken for all
project components; in this analysis, prices of equipment are allowed a lower
increase than civil works, as the former are based on quotations by the
manufacturers to the bilateral lending agencies and should be close to the
final prices. The critical assumption in the economic analysis, in view of
stagnating traffic on the Senegal section over the past years, is that the
Mali-Senegal railway line will exist through the economic life of the in-
vestments, i.e., the next 20-30 years. This assumption affects the economic
return of all project items whose justification depends on the international
traffic, except passenger equipment serving domestic traffic only, and the
bridges, whose rehabilitation would still be justified on domestic traffic
alone (see para. 5.04). The management of the Senegal Railway has been
strengthened recently and the Senegalese Government has asked the Bank to
finance needed physical investments and a major training program. Details of
the economic analysis are presented in Annex 11.
Track
5.03      The track program, which will extend beyond the plan period, com-
prises the equipment and labor needed for welding 400 km of line, ballasting
212 km and installing new switches. Execution of this program will decrease
maintenance costs of track and rolling stock, reduce derailments and decrease
heavy costs in track rehabilitation which otherwise would be necessary if the
program were not carried out. The economic rate of return for the track
investment is 23%, estimated on the basis of 1975 traffic levels. If invest-
ment costs were 20% higher than estimated, or if benefits should fall by
20%, the rate of return would drop to 20% and 19%, respectively; if these two
events were to occur simultaneously, the return would be 16%. which is satis-
factory.



- 19 -
Bridges
5.04      The proposed bridge rehabilitation program is urgently required
as some bridges are near collapse. Their condition has already forced sus-
pension of heavy freight traffic between Koulikoro and Bamako and resulted
in the enforcement of speed limitations of 10 km/h on several bridges between
Bamako and the Senegalese border. If the rehabilitation program is not
carried out, there are serious risks of bridge failures, which would cause
closure of the line. Suspension of railway service would be catastrophic to
Mali's economy; it would force diversion of all international traffic to the
more expensive Abidjan routes (Table 1) and would leave the region west of
Bamako practically without freight and passenger transport services; the lack
of transport services would curtail production and exports (mainly of ground-
nuts) and would result in the closing of the cement plant in Diamou. The
assessment of events if bridges are not rehabilitated soon is uncertain;
failure of the smaller bridges could probably be temporarily overcome through
emergency replacements, but should any of the four larger bridges collapse, it
could not be rapidly replaced. For the purpose of evaluating the proposed
bridge investment, it is conservatively assumed that no interruption of
traffic would take place before 1981, and that in that year a collapse of a
major bridge or of several smaller would result in closing the line to traffic
for 6 months; the rehabilitation of all bridges would be undertaken at that
time. On the basis of forecast traffic, avoiding such an event would yield a
rate of return of 25% for the bridge investment component of the project.
The rate of return would drop to 18% if bridge rehabilitation costs were 20%
higher than estimated and to 17% if benefits were to fall 20%. Based solely
on benefits from frustrated production, the return on the bridge program would
be 16%. The figures underestimate the actual return, as neither benefits from
eliminating present operating restrictions on the line nor costs of potential
accidents during bridge collapse have been included in the analysis.
Passenger Equipment: Railcars, Trailers and Coaches
5.05      The passenger equipment included in the project is to (a) replace
one railcar and two trailers equipment destroyed in an accident in 1974 and
(b) supplement passenger cars presently running at more than 100% capacity. The
project would help to prevent further deterioration of passenger cars which
cannot now be properly repaired and maintained. The new equipment would allow
the railway to continue implementing its policy of shifting national traffic
from locomotive/passenger car to cheaper railcar/trailer operations. Because
there are no alternative transport services, net revenues are taken as the
minimum economic benefit of rail passenger service. The rate of return for
the proposed passenger equipment is 14% on the basis of the traffic forecast
in Table 5. The return would drop to 13% if investment costs were 10% higher
than estimated. If passenger traffic growth were 30% lower than forecast, the
economic return would be 12%, which is satisfactory.
Tank Wagons
5.06      The traffic forecast envisages a substantial diversion of petroleum
from the Abidjan route to the Bamako-Dakar railway. The proposed investment
in 18 tank wagons would provide an additional capacity of about 14,600 tons/



- 20 -
year. This additional capacity would be fully utilized in 1980 with the sup-
port of the measures outlined in para. 3.15. At a differential in economic
costs of MF 20,344/ton between the Abidjan all-road route and the Dakar
route the rate of return on the tank wagon investment is 50%. Were the tank
wagons to cost 10% higher than estimated, the return would be 46%. If allow-
ance is made for the capacity already built up in tanker trucks over the
Abidjan routes, and depreciation of the vehicles is excluded from road trans-
port costs, the Dakar route would still be MF 10,107/ton cheaper than Abidjan
for transport of petroleum products; the rate of return for the tank wagon
investment would be, in this case, 9%, which is acceptable.
5.07      The financial sensitivity analysis (para 6.15) considers an
extreme case which assumes that all the new petroleum imports would flow
via Abidjan, reflecting no improvement over the present situation. Under
this highly hypothetical event the purchase of tank wagons would be un-
necessary. However, under the more realistic and less pessimistic assump-
tion that the increase in petroleum traffic were 50% less than forecast,
and considering the MY 20,344/ton differential between the Dakar and
Abidjan routes, the tank wagon investment would have a return over 10%
and would still be justified.
Replacement of Bogies
5.08      The proposed purchase of 16 bogies would permit the modernization
of 8 passenger cars, which would otherwise have to be gradually scrapped.
Their original bogies often break down because of a design fault, and it
will soon become impossible to continue repairing them. The passenger cars
to be modernized have been in service for five years and, except for the
bogies, are in good condition. The alternative of buying new cars instead
of replacing the bogies would generate essentially the same benefits at a
considerably higher cost. Modernization of these cars, compared to scrapping
them, would avoid a loss in passenger revenues and would yield a return of
37% for the bogie investment. If investment costs were 10% higher than
estimated, the rate of return would be 34%.
Extension of Loops
5.09      The project includes extension of three loops which, together with
existing ones, will allow longer trains to operate on the line. The longer
trains will be hauled by the three new 1800 HP locomotives to be provided
under the project with CCCE/COFACE financing. The three new locomotives
will be able to handle the same tonnage as four of the 1400 HP locomotives,
presently the heaviest locomotives on the line, at a savings in investment
and operating costs. Heavy trains running from Dakar to Bamako are split at
Kayes due to higher gradients on the Malian line. This split-up will be
avoided by the utilization of the new, heavier locomotives without affecting
the utilization of freight cars.   The rate of return for the proposed in-
vestment, compared to purchasing smaller locomotives and not extending the
loops, is 13%. If the loops were to cost 10% more than estimated, the return
would be 11%, which is satisfactory.



- 21 -
C.   Rate of Return of the Whole Project
5.10      All the project's components are economically justified.  Con-
sidering costs and benefits of all components, the return for the whole
investment project is 23%. Physical implementation of the project is rela-
tively straightforward and the operating targets, on which the project's
return is calculated, have been set conservatively, following the experience
of the earlier projects. Failure to proceed with the project, particularly
the bridge rehabilitation program, could soon result in the total collapse of
railway operations and the closure of Mali's main access to the sea. There-
fore, the risks that would remain by not proceeding with the project appear to
outweigh the risks of difficulties in physical implementation and of a short-
fall in operating performance.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Background
6.01      CFM's financial goal is to generate from its operation enough
funds to cover (a) its operating expenses, (b) an appropriate renewal
of its fixed assets, (c) its debt service, and (d) an acceptable contri-
bution toward its investment needs, while maintaining its competitiveness
over alternative routes. The object of this financial analysis is to
examine to what extent implementation of the proposed project, achievement
of operating targets and forecast traffic together with appropriate tariff
increases will allow CFM to meet its financial goals.
6.02      The financial tables (10 to 14) have been prepared in current Mali
francs under inflation assumptions shown in Table 15, in order to allow a
realistic assessment of CFM's liquidity position during and after implementa-
tion of the project. Tables showing breakdowns of operating revenues and
working expenses have been prepared both in constant and current MF. All
proposed targets are based on current prices.
B. Past and Present Finances
6.03      Between 1964-65, which immediately preceeded the start of the
First Project, and 1975, CFM suffered net operating losses each year except
1970 and 1971 when it achieved operating ratios of 99% and 95% respectively.
Consolidated CFM income statements and relevant financial ratios are given
in Table 10 and summarized below. The figures in line "A" show Second Rail-
way Project appraisal forecasts; the figures in line "B" show actual results.

The table shows that working costs grew faster than expected for the period,
which was a normal result of an inflationary trend. Revenues did not meet
appraisal forecasts except in 1974 when traffic was boosted by exceptional
cereal imports under the international food relief program to the Sahel
countries. In addition to CFM's disappointing traffic performance, the
Government implemented agreed tariff increases almost two years behind
schedule, and even then at a rate which was too low to offset the impact
of inflation on CFM's operating costs. In current terms, CFM's operating
costs increased by about 25% between 1972 and 1974 and by an additional 30%
between 1974 and 1976. CFM's tariffs remained unchanged through 1974 and
were increased by about 35% in 1975. In real terms working expenses increased



- 23 -
by about 5% while revenues per traffic unit decreased by about 14% between
1972 and 1974. The 1975 tariff increase barely matched the 10% increase in
operating costs expressed in real terms in 1975-76.
6.04      The last time CFM revalued its fixed assets was 1968 and this
revaluation was entered into the 1969 accounts. As a result, depreciation
charges shown in the subsequent accounts have been progressively under-
estimated and do not accurately represent the current replacement value of
CFM's fixed assets. The mission made a tentative revaluation of fixed assets
as of December 31, 1976 resulting in an increase in the depreciation charges
from the recorded MF 672 million to MF 1,179 million, and a revision in the
operating ratio from the reported 99% to a more realistic 112%. An immediate
revaluation is necessary, and the Government and CFM have agreed to it in
principle. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment and CFM that CFM will revalue its fixed assets as of December 31, 1976
and incorporate the updated values into its 1977 accounts; thereafter, it
will periodically review its fixed assets in consultation with the Asso-
ciation, and if required, undertake appropriate revaluation.
6.05      The following table shows CFM's consolidated balance sheets as of
December 31, 1972 and 1976, the latter as projected at the appraisal of the
Second Railway Project and then at the outcome. Details are given in Table
II.

Changes in CFM's financial situation between 1972 and 1976 call for the
following comments:
(a) CFM was far from achieving the projected financial
performance.
(b) The working capital deteriorated from MF 565 million
to MP (698) million between 1972-76. This decrease,
which resulted from insufficient cash generation, is
reflected in the accounts by a MF 1,426 million accu-
mulation of unpaid interest, commitment charges and
loan repayment terms on IDA credits due to the Govern-
ment and by NF 739 million in past due taxes by the end
of 1976. Given the tight financial situation of CFM,
the mission in consultation with CFM's management re-
quested the Government to restructure CFM's balance
sheets by offsetting the above debts with a subsidy to
compensate for losses incurred over previous years (see
Table 11). On February 15, 1977 the Government issued
a decree to that effect.
(c) The inventories contain an estimated 1/ MF 300 million
worth of obsolete items. These inventories should be
revised, and CFM has agreed to make the appropriate
write-offs not later than December 31, 1977.
(d) The uneasy 60/40 debt-to-equity ratio would change to a
more acceptable 38/62 debt-to-equity ratio as a result
of the above-suggested revaluation of fixed assets.
C.   Future Financial Position (1977-81)
Background
6.06      During the period 1977-81 the freight traffic will grow at an esti-
mated average rate of 5.1% p.a. in terms of ton-km. At present tariff levels
the increase in revenues generated by this extra traffic will be more than
offset by the expected escalation in working expenditures due to material
price inflation, staff costs and to the rising financial charges. A success-
ful implementation of the technical plan of action and of the recommendations
of the operations and containerization studies would allow CFM to improve
its operating efficiency and the quality of its services, thereby capturing
a larger share of traffic. The strengthening of CFM's financial management,
being carried out by CANAC under the ongoing reorganization particularly
the creation of essential cost-accounting and tariff divisions, will allow
better control over finances.

6.08      Working and operating expenses for the period 1977-81 are detailed
in Table 11. Personnel expenses account for about 45% of working expenses.
They have been calculated under the following assumptions: (a) staff will
decrease slightly in line with staff productivity forecast (para. 2 of Annex
3); and (b) salary increases will be limited to the inflation rate (Table 15)
except for 5% annual promotion increases. Depreciation allowances are based
on revalued fixed assets. High financial charges account for the book losses
shown in the above table. Despite these losses, projected cash generation
will be satisfactory provided CFM implements measures described in paras. 6.09
and 6.10.



- 26 -
6.09      CFM has been successful in controlling its working expenses and
maintaining them at a reasonable level. However, its working and operating
ratios and overall financial performance have been unsatisfactory because
of low tariff levels, insufficient traffic and inadequate operating effi-
ciency. Implementation of the technical plan of action and an aggressive
commercial promotion program carried out by the newly created commercial
department should improve CFM's financial position in the long run. Imme-
diate, selective tariff increases are required to produce an increase in
revenues 20% above those that would be generated under the present tariffs.
At negotiations the Government provided the Association with the evidence that
CFM will increase its domestic and international tariffs by an average 23% by
May 31, 1977. Furthermore, the Government and CFM have agreed that CFM will
implement a cost-based tariff system based on the Association-financed
SOFRERAIL studies, amended as necessary in consultation with the Association.
6.10      Implementation of this tariff increase should lead to a 67% working
ratio and a 100% operating ratio in 1977. Projections based on the assumed
improvements in operations, the materialization of traffic forecasts and of
further selected tariff increases show that CFM could achieve working ratios
of 67% in 1977, 70% in 1978, 61% in 1979, 64% for 1980 and 60% for 1981
and 1982. At negotiations, the Government and CFM agreed to take steps to
achieve these ratios, which would require additional tariff increases of about
15% in 1979 and 1981.   The rate of return on net fixed assets in use achieved
by CFM would be 0% in 1977-78, 1% in 1979-80 and 2.5% in 1981.
6.11      Assuming all the above recommended financial measures are imple-
mented and traffic and performance forecasts materialize, the projected
sources and applications of cumulated funds from 1977 through 1981 will be as
follows (details are in Table 13):
-----------------iMF Million-----------------

- 27 -
CFM's working capital will improve immediately in 1977 as a result of the
Government's debt service and tax waiver and the first tariff increase. As-
suming that CFM borrows MF 2.0 billion in 1980/82 to purchase planned motive
power and rolling stock, it will thereafter progressively increase to reach MF
1,292 million in 1981.
6.12      This working capital would be in line with desirable level which,
on the basis of the mission's assessment of CFM needs, was established
to cover all the following:
1/6 of annual staff costs (2 months), plus
50% of annual expenses for materials excluding fuel
and lubricants, plus
25% of annual expenses for charges, plus
25% of interest and loan repayments due the following year.
The Government and CFM have agreed to maintain CFM's working capital at the
above-estimated level.
6.13      CFM's consolidated balance sheets resulting from this analysis are
given in Table 11 and summarized below:

The table shows that:
(a) CFM's current assets position and working capital
should improve significantly in 1977 and progressively
increase to a satisfactory level by 1981; and
(b) Debt-to-equity ratio for 1981 is high, but acceptable
given the relatively soft conditions agreed by the
proposed lenders for the financing of the Project.



- 28 -
In order to prevent CFM's present and future borrowing from expanding beyond
a safe level, CFM has agreed that it will not incur any long-term debt in
addition to that related to the project, unless its net cash revenue for the
fiscal year or the twelve consecutive months immediately before the date of
incurrence, whichever is greater, be 1.5 times the maximum debt service
requirements of any succeeding year on all debts of CFI, including the debt to
be incurred.
6.14      Due to CFM's anticipated difficult financial situation, agreement
has been reached between it, the Government and Association that, during
each year of the project, CFM will discuss with the Association (by November
15th at the latest) the estimated financial results for the current year
and the draft budget for the next year. This will enable the Bank to offer
comments on the budget before CFM presents it to its Board and the Government
for approval. It was also agreed that if necessary, CFM and the Government
will promptly agree with the Association on remedial actions.
D.   Sensitivity Analysis
6.15      A sensitivity analysis of financial forecasts was conducted to test
the impact on CFM's financial position of a possible decrease in its cash
generation and/or a possible increase in the cost of the proposed project.
The following assumptions were used: (a) reduction of petroleum product
traffic to 45,000 tons per annum, (b) 15% decrease in revenues generated by
exports, (c) 10% increase in working expenditure, and (d) 20% increase in the
cost of the bridge component and 10% increase in the cost of the remaining
components of the project.
6.16      Should all four sensitivity assumptions materialize simultaneously,
CFM would be short MF 5.4 billion, equal to about 20% of its operating reve-
nue over the period 1977-81, to pay for its investments, renewals and debt
service. The Government should agree to provide funds or secure alternative
financing in case of such shortfalls. However, if the Government is not in a
position to do so, CFM would be able to compensate for any partial or total
materialization of the sensitivity analysis assumptions by increasing its
tariffs above those levels planned in the main analysis and/or have recourse
to additional borrowing. While each option is feasible, it is likely that a
combination of both would have to be used. Any specific solution would have
to be worked out in agreement with the Association.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations the following principal items were discussed
and agreed upon by the Government and CF1:
(a) renewal of the covenant included in Credit Agreement
384-MLI and the relevant Project Agreement that any

4.12).
Ci) the Government and CFM will, in consultation with the
Association, agree with their Senegalese counterparts
on (i) objectives of the study on joint operations along

nancing or in servicing CFM's debt (paras. 4.15 and 6.14);



- 30 -
(1)  CFM will revalue its fixed assets as of December 31,
1976 and incorporate the updated values in its 1977
accounts and thereafter will make additional reval-
uations as may be appropriate in consultation and
agreement with the Association (para. 6.04);
(m)  CFM will write off obsolete items in the inventory
not later than December 31, 1977 (para. 6.05);
(n)  CFM will implement not later than January 1, 1978
a cost-based tariff system based on Association-
financed SOFRERAIL studies and amended as necessary
in consultation with the Association (para. 6.09);
(o)  CFM will take necessary measures to achieve working
ratios not exceeding 67% for 1977, 70% for 1978, 61%
for 1979, 64% for 1980 and 60% for 1981 and 1982
(para. 6.10);
(p)  the Government and CFM will take measures by Decem-
ber 31, 1977 to keep CFM's working capital at an
agreed level (paras. 6.11 and 6.12);
(q)  except unless otherwise agreed with the Association,
CFM will not incur any additional long term debts un-
less its net cash revenue for the fiscal year or the
twelve months prior to the date of incurrence be 1.5
times the maximum debt service requirements of any
succeeding year on all debts of CFM, including the debt
to be incurred (para. 6.13);
(r)  during each year of the project, CFM will discuss its
estimated financial results for the current year and
draft budget for the following year with the Associa-
tion no later than November 15 and, if necessary,
CFM and the Government will promptly agree with the
Association on remedial actions (para. 6.14).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit is the final-
ization of long-term arrangements to be made for the transport by CFM of petro-
leum products, including, inter alia, a modification for the system of price
stabilization for such products (para. 3.15).
7.03      The finalization of the on-lending agreement will also be a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit (para. 4.16).
7.04      Inasmuch as agreement has been reached on all the above-mentioned
issues, the proposed project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$10.5 million to
the Government of Mali with relending to CFM for a term of 20 years, including
4 1/2 years of grace, at an interest rate of 6% per annum.

PLAN OF ACTION
Introduction
1.        The physical and financial rehabilitatiorn of CFM is a major con-
cer-i of the Govern_mca-S.   T7rerefore, the Government is willing to assist CFM
in carrying out its physical rehabilitation and to achieve financial viabil-
ity so as to permit it to meet all operating expenses (including adequate
allowances for depreciation and renewal funds) and debt service obligations
out of internally generated funds, and to cont-hibute toward its investment
needs.  The Government and CFM intend to  Gimplement the following measures
to fulfill these objectivesO
p       erat ions
2.        CFM will take all necessary steps to improve its operating effi-
ciency and to achieve the following targets by fiscal years 1978 and 1980:
Actual          Objectives
Targets                                        1975         1978      1980

traffic not later than December 31, 1977. Detailed data on utilization
(specifically, loading time, time spent in yards, time needed between
forwarding station and station of destination, unloading time, waiting
time in stations and sidings) of international, pooled freight cars in
the Malian as well as in the Senegalese network is urgently required and
should be provided by CFM's Operations Department in close cooperation with
the CFM's operational management. A quarterly report on these data should
be made available to CFM's management and the Association starting March 31,
1978.
4.        CFM will establish a system of control to be agreed upon by the
Association that will permit prompt evaluation of progress in its physical
rehabilitation and in attainment of the targets referred to above, starting
December 31, 1977.
5.        The availability of rolling stock is defined as the time the locomo-
tives, railcars and cars are available for operation; it is an indicator of
workshop and depot performance. Targets for mainline locomotive availability
set by the Association can be achieved by CFM after scrapping three 1150-type
locomotives and after delivery of three new locomotives with expected high
availability in the first years of operation. The availability will further
increase after a spare part stock for all locomotives of French manufacture
operated in West Africa is established in France under French financing. The
number of locomotive failures should be reduced by improved performance in
the workshops and the depots and by maintenance schedules better adapted to
the local conditions.
6.        The average load factor for freight cars shows efficiency of
utilization but also reflects to some extent the specific weight of main
commodities. The factor is calculated by dividing the total net tonnage
per year by the total number of freight cars in stock. Improvement of this
factor would stem from higher loading capacities (40 tons instead of the
previous 20-25 tons) of the new freight cars financed under Credit 384-MLI
and from an aggressive marketing campaign by CFM.
7.        The average journey per day per freight car in stock is defined
as the ratio of the total number of km of all freight cars and the total
number of freight cars in stock. This indicator can be improved by higher
availability and better utilization of the car fleet. It is expected that
after implementation of the operation study included in the project, the
utilization of the freight car fleet, particularly in international traffic,
will substantially increase.
8.        The productivity of freight cars is measured in ton-km per car per
year and is the product of the number of km per day of freight cars in stock
and the average load per freight car in stock multiplied by 365 days.
9.        The turnaround time is defined as the number of days between two
loadings. The turnaround time for tank wagons operated between Dakar and
Bamako should improve after implementation of consultants recommendations.

10.       Staff productivity indicates staff performance il. relation to
the total of yearly ton-km and passenger-km. In setting new targets, it
was assumed that the total staff (including permanent and temporary staff)
could be slightly reduced after implementation of the proposed ballasting
and welding program and that traffic will increase according to the traffic
forecast (see Tables 4 and 5).

TRAINING
Background
1.         CFM operates a single 644 km track running from the Mali/Senegal
border through Bamako to Koulikoro on the Niger River and has a staff of about
2,000 including auxiliary personnel. Some training was carried out during
the 1960's, but more systematic training began in February 1969 with the
establishment of the Training Division (TD). About US$180,000 was allocated
to training (US$130,000 to purchase training equipment and US$50,000 for
training abroad) under Credit 384-MLI. However, only about US$30,000 has
been spent on equipment; the balance is being used to meet cost overruns
from other project components.
A.   Current Training Activities
2.         CFM managerial, operational and financial performance has been
poor, and a number of measures should be undertaken by Government to remedy
it, including (a) expanding the program to train personnel at all levels;
and (b) improving effectiveness of technical assistance (OFERMAT) provided
through FAC. Between 1969 and the end of 1976, TD trained or retrained about
1,170 personnel. 1/
3.         Most of TD's activities have concentrated on training and re-
training skilled workers and low-level personnel. Management courses for
low-level supervisory personnel and special programs to train Malian instruc-
tors have also been carried out. Until now, the training program has con-
sisted mainly of theoretical courses. Technical assistants have trained
counterparts with varying degrees of success.
4.         Besides TD's small accommodations, the training facilities
consist of seven classrooms, one small, unequipped workshop and three
offices for instructors. Most of these facilities are rundown and placed
in various buildings with little furniture, teaching material and train-
ing equipment. Furthermore, TD's administrative offices are far from
the classrooms.
5.         The teaching staff consists of eight full-time and one part-time
Malian instructors and two full-time and one part-time technical assistants
(expatriate). As requested by the operating departments, this staff conducts
courses for locomotive drivers and for personnel of the Workshops (W), Oper-
ations (OP) and Way and Works (WW) divisions as well as for certain adminis-
trative personnel. Occasionally, lectures and/or practical demonstrations are
given by other technical assistants on management and work methods. The
capability of instructors varies from barely adequate to good.

ANNEX 4
Page 2
6.        The Chief of TD is a Malian engineer who is assisted by a technical
assistant provided by OFERMAT, the assistant is an engineer with experience in
training railway personnel and seems to have the confidence of both the
Director General and other senior officials. The Chief of TD appears to be
dedicated and has established a good working relationship with the technical
assistant.
7.        The TD has made a positive beginning in training and retraining
skilled workers and low-level supervisors, the limited training resources and
number of instructors notwithstanding. However, considerable effort is now
required to carry out an expansion program, which will include practical
training and new courses for middle-level personnel.
B.   The Program for Expansion of Training
8.        The estimated total cost of the rehabilitation and expansion of
training facilities in Bamako and Kayes to enable TD to meet increased
training demands is about MF 130 million (US$0.27 million equivalent, of which
CCCE has agreed to finance MF 60 million, (US$0.12 million equivalent).
9.        The plan, eventually to enable the training and retraining of
about 400 personnel each year, involves (i) centralizing all the required
training facilities (previously scattered); (ii) relocating the TD offices
in the new center; (iii) building a small, secondary center in Kayes; and
(iv) purchasing training equipment for these facilities. The details are
as follows:

10.       An expanded training program would require more Malian and
expatriate instructors on a full-time basis as well as retraining
and/or upgrading some of the present instructors. The breakdown of addi-
tional instructors is estimated as follows:
(a) Malian instructors
- OP - 1 instructor
- W - I instructor
- WW - I instructor
3
In addition, four experienced Malian Section Chiefs will be selected for training
abroad. On their return, they will be responsible for the training of the re-
maining Section Chiefs who cannot be released for training abroad.
(b) Expatriate instructors
- conduct general and pedagogical training
of 4 new Malian instructors plus re-
fresher/upgrading courses for present          1 instructor
instructors (1 month)
- conduct seminars and demonstrations on
specific technical activities/problems        3 instructors
for OP, W, WW middle personnel (11 man-
months)                                        4

11.       Selection and training of Malian instructors and recruitment of
experienced expatriate instructors are two of the essential factors for
effective implementation of the training program. Although some difficulties
are expected in selecting suitable Malian personnel, it is very important that
they receive sound pedagogical, theoretical and practical training from
experienced teachers. Similarly, the recruitment of expatriate instructors
should be based not only on their knowledge of railway operations but also on
their experience in training railway personnel of developed as well as under-
developed countries. Generally, technical assistance to railways in franco-
phone Africa is provided by the French Assistance Program through OFERMAT.
With some exceptions, the Bank Group's experience with the level and quality
of the technical assistance providing the training has not always been satis-
factory.
12.       Expanded facilities would enable TD to establish a permanent
training structure capable of continuing the following:
(a)  orientation and training of new recruits;
(b)  training of skilled workers and low-level supervisors
to bring their performance up to standard;
(c)  upgrading training of personnel to provide selected
staff with career development opportunities;
(d)  seminars for medium level personnel.
13.       However, until necessary resources are available, special emphasis
should be placed on an interim program (end of 1976 - Sept. 1977) and a two
years priority program (Oct. 1977 - Sept. 1978, Oct. 1978 - Sept. 1979) for
training and retraining of CFM staff in the following categories:

Three expatriate instructors will be involved in this program. A more senior
one will initially spend one month in Bamako to collect pertinent data and to
familiarize himself with the group's needs and CFM activities. The group will
then travel together to a host-railway (Canada or France or Belgium), under
the supervision of the Director of the TD and possibly the senior expatriate
instructor, for a period of four to six weeks. Upon returning to Mali, the Sec-
tion Chiefs will train others who are unable to travel abroad, while the
senior expatriate instructor assisted by two other expatriate instructors will
conduct a three-month in-service training of the eleven Division Chiefs in
Bamako to ensure that the new technology observed abroad is properly applied
to the needs and realities of the CFM.
C. Financing of Training
14.       An agreement has been reached between CFM and CCCE providing about
MF 60 million (US$122,450) for the rehabilitation of physical training facil-
ities and the purchase of some furniture and training equipment. IDA will
finance the cost of: (a) the construction of a small dormitory; (b) the
balance of the required furniture and training equipment; (c) an expatriate
instructor to give one-month pedagogical training to three new Malian in-
structors; (d) training abroad of four Section Chiefs; and (e) training
eleven Division Chiefs abroad and in Mali under the supervision of three
expatriate instructors for a total of eleven man-months.

D.   Joint Training Effort by Senegal/Mali Railways
15.       Serious consideration has been given to unifying the training
effort of the Senegal and Mali Railways because this would be the best
solution for certain railway activities. Officially, the management of
the two Regies appear to support this, but they also recognize the political
and administrative difficulties involved.
16.       This action should not be pursued until the Senegalese Railway
has established a training division and determined its training needs.
However, dialogue should continue between the two railways aimed at (a)
agreeing on possible areas of collaboration, such as (i) training of local
instructors and (ii) seminars for medium/high level personnel on specific
technical subjects as well as general principles of management, and (b) plans
to implement such programs.

ANNEX 5
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF RAILWAY PROPERTY
Track
1.        The 644-km long, single-track meter-gauge Mali Railway was built
between 1881 and 1906 to connect Kayes on the Senegal River to Bamako and
Koulikoro on the Niger River. It was connected to the Dakar-St. Louis Railway
in 1924 to form the Dakar-Niger Railway. The track material between Kayes and
Bamako was renewed prior to 1960; 70.2 km of the 91.7 km between Kayes and
the Senegal border is being renewed with 30 kg/m rails under Credit 95-MLI.
Released secondhand ma:terial, mainly 26 kg/m rails, has been used to replace
45 km of light rails of 20 kg/m in poor condition between Bamako and Koulikoro.
2.        Stone ballast is lacking on about 210 km of mainline track between
Toukoto and Kayes. Rail-joint welding has been carried out only on 183 km
of track. A ballasting and joint welding program was proposed in the Second
Credit but was deleted due to cost overruns. A welding machine provided under
Credit 384-MLI was delivered at the beginning of 1976.
3.        There are four major bridges and about 50 small masonry or concrete
bridges whose maintenance has been neglected for many years. FAC-financed
studies completed by SOFRERAIL in 1973 showed that some bridges selected for
inclusion in the proposed project are near collapse. Speed limitations
of 10 km/h are now enforced.
4.        Telecommunications wiring has been renewed, and new train control
equipment was provided under Credit 95-MLI which should meet operating
needs for some years ahead. Signalling equipment is simple, but it is ade-
quate for the frequency and speed of trains.
5.        New workshops were provided at Bamako under Credit 95-MLI and with
possibly minor additions, particularly equipment, should meet CFM needs
for some years. Buildings at Bamako are adequate, but wayside buildings
are generally in poor condition due to lack of proper maintenance.
6.        Details of locomotives and rolling stock as of June 1976 are
given in Table 2 and Annex 6.

2.        Average availability has improved with spare parts ordered under
384-MLI Credit and better organization of maintenance introduced by French
technical assistance staff. Further improvements are expected after a spare
part stock for locomotives of French manufacture operated in West Africa is
established in France for immediate delivery under French financing.

ANNEX 7
Page 1
FREIGHT TRAFFIC FORECAST
1.        The forecast is based on an analysis of the main products trans-
ported by the railway. Information for the analysis was obtained from Mali
Railways, the Government, and from public and private enterprises concerned
with agricultural and industrial development plans, foreign trade and domes-
tic supplies.
2.        The railway is the only transport mode in southwest Mali and there-
fore handles all domestic freight traffic in this area. Regarding interna-
tional traffic, the railway is cheaper than the road/rail routes via Abidjan
(Ivory Coast) for most export traffic originating from Bamako west to Senegal,
and for about 70% of Mali's import traffic. During the Sahel drought (mainly
in 1973-74) the capacity of the Mali-Senegal Railway was insufficient to
carry all the emergency relief supplies, and large volumes were sent via
Abidjan generating a substantial expansion of the truck fleet. As a result,
the Abidjan road and road/rail routes increased their share of Mali interna-
tional traffic, reaching about 50% of total exports and imports in 1975.
With improved operations and expanded capacity provided under the project, the
railway could recapture part of Mali international traffic by concentrating
its effort on carrying petroleum products--the railway's single most important
item of freight--for which it has a strong comparative advantage over the
Abidjan routes in cost and quality of service. The freight traffic forecast
(see Table 4 of main text) retains this hypothesis and assumes that the
remaining freight traffic will, on the average, increase at a modest rate.
National Traffic
3.        Cement - The Diamou plant, 50 km from Kayes, has a capacity of
75,000 tons, but its maximum production so far was 48,000 tons in 1973.
It is assumed that production will reach 55,000 tons in 1980.
4.        Other carload traffic - Forecast of this item was made by
the CFM based on an analysis of the main clients.
Exports
5.        Cola nuts - This product is exported from the Ivory Coast to Senegal
via Mali because sea transport spoils the flavor of cola nuts. Transport of
cola nuts started in 1970 and grew rapidly from 2,600 tons in that year to
about 14,000 tons in 1976. The growth rate will probably be more moderate and
has been projected at 6% from the 1976 level.
6.        Cotton seeds, fibers and textiles - The forecast is based on data
gathered by the Bank mission which appraised the Mali-Sud Agricultural
Project in November 1975. Production from the Bamako and Fana plants (125
km northeast of Bamako, to open in 1979/80) will be evacuated via Dakar
while most of the country's production will be evacuated via Abidjan. It
is expected that exports of cotton seeds will cease in 1980 as the surplus
will be used by a new plant to open that year in Koutiala.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
7.        Groundnuts, groundnut oil and cakes - With the exception of some
4,000 tons of cakes exported by SOMIEX via Abidjan in 1975, all groundnut
products have been exported via Dakar, and this pattern is expected to
continue. The present forecast is based on data from the appraisal report
of the Bank's Integrated Rural Development Project (May 1974). The report
foresees groundnut production increasing by about 33% between 1975 and 1979,
but levelling off thereafter. Exports of groundnuts are expected to decline
in 1977 and 1978, reaching the 1976 level in 1979, while exports of oil and
cakes are expected to jump in 1977 due to the opening of a new groundnut oil
plant in Kita. These figures have been adjusted following the experience of
the 1973-75 period when exports of groundnuts and cakes reached 60% of the
forecast made in the appraisal of the rural project, and exports of oil
reached 80% of the forecast. From 1977 onwards oil produced in Koulikoro will
be generally for domestic consumption, and exports of oil and cakes will be
mostly from the Kita plant; this plant will be located about 400 km from the
border compared to 642 km from Koulikoro, therefore the average transport
distance for oil and cakes will be substantially reduced. Exports of ground-
nuts are expected to continue to originate as at present mainly from around
the Kita area; average hauling distance has been forecast to remain at 390 km.
8.        Karite - Karite is a crop which has shown large variations in the
past, from about 10,000 tons in 1969 and 1971 to practically zero in 1972,
1973 and 1974. Export of karite is expected to remain at 2,000 ton/year
between 1977 and 1981.
9.        Cereals - The record crop in 1975/76 yielded an estimated 18,000
tons for export. Agricultural development plans will make it possible
to increase exports. However, 1975/76 was exceptional, and exports will
not exceed 5,000 tons in 1977.
10.       Other carload exports - Traffic in this category increased
from 10,800 tons in 1971 to 17,900 tons in 1975, with some fluctuations.
A level of 13,000 tons is expected in 1976 with a growth rate of 5%
thereafter. Less-than-carload exports have generally been less than 500
tons/year and, therefore, have been left out of the forecast.
Imports
11.       Cement - As the Diamou plant has not been able to satisfy the
country's internal demand, cement has been imported from both Abidjan and
Dakar. Plans for substantially expanding the capacity of Diamou or for
building a new plant have been considered by the Government, but no deci-
sion has been made. Cement imports will most likely grow about 5% annually
and the shares carried over the two routes will remain about the same.
12.       Machinery, vehicle and materials - It is assumed that the 1970
level will be reached again in 1977 and that this traffic will increase
5% annually thereafter.



ATNEX 7
Page 3
13.       Fertilizers - Imports of fertilizers have fluctuated markedly,
although generally increasing due to the implementation of several agricul-
tural projects. A major source of fertilizer is a Senegalese plant located
near the railway line east of Dakar. Fertilizer traffic by rail is expected to
increase 6% annually from a base of 14,000 tons in 1976.
14.       Foodstuffs (including sugar, flour, maize, rice, millet, etc.) -
Large quantities of emergency relief supplies were imported during the 1973-74
drought, reaching 167,000 tons in 1974, or about 100,000 tons over the normal
level. Imports fell below normal levels in 1976 due to a record cereal crop.
The forecast assumes that under normal conditions it will be necessary to
import some 20,000 tons of cereals and that total imports of foodstuffs
(including sugar and flour) will remain at 50,000 tons per year.
15.       Petroleum products - Imports via Dakar from 1971 to 1975 were
between 32,000-35,000 tons/year, while total imports grew at 6% per year
to a total of 115,000 tons in 1975. Petroleum imports are expected to
continue to grow at 6% per year. Based on c.i.f. prices depending on whether
it is refined at Dakar or Abidjan and regional consumption, about 80% of
Mali's imports of petroleum products should come from Dakar and the remainder
from Abidjan. Despite this, supplies from Dakar have been low because of a
lack of tank-wagons and of incentives to the oil companies to increase trans-
port over this route. The acquisition of 20 new tank-wagons late in 1975
resulted in a substantial traffic increase in 1976 to an estimated 48,000
tons. Ten new tank-wagons bought by a private company should be put into
service early in 1977 and an additional 18 wagons will be provided under the
proposed project. At least 75,000 tons of petroleum products could be
imported via Dakar in 1981.
16.       Salt - Salt is imported from Senegal.  The same steady growth
rate registered in the past years has been assumed for the future.
17.       Other imports - These imports were forecast to grow at 4%
annually, assuming 5% GDP growth and elasticity of imports to GDP of
0.80. Less-than-carload are expected to remain at the past level, i.e.
1,000 tons/year.

ANNEX 9
Page 1
INVESTMENT PLAN 1977-1981
The CFM plan covers the five-year period 1977-1981 and includes
the three-year project.
Track
1.        Track material for the renewal of the 91.7 km line between the
Senegalese border and Kayes was financed under Credit 95-MLI and Credit
384-MLI; and 70.2 km of rails have been relaid. The renewal of the remaining
21.5 km is included in the plan.
2.        Stone ballast is lacking on about 210 km of mainline track, and
rail-joint welding has been carried out only on 183 km of track. A ballast-
ing and welding program deleted from the Second Credit due to cost overruns is
included in the plan. CFM's capacity requires that the entire welding program
be spread over 9.2 years and the ballasting program over 3.5 years. It is
expected that 100 km of track can be ballasted and 130 km can be welded during
the three-year project. An additional 87 km of line can be welded through
1981 and the ballasting program can be completed within the plan's time. CFM
proposed the establishment of its own quarry at Toukoto to obtain a more
reliable ballast supply; at present the railway fully depends on small local
contractors who use manual labor for ballast production. These contractors
often do not consider themselves bound to agreed prices and regular delivery.
Consequently, ballast supply for track maintenance is sporadic, and therefore
the railway has been hesitant to undertake a track rehabilitation program
which depends o  a constant ballast flow to the site.  The railway needs
about 600,000 m  of good ballast per year for maintenance, track renewal
and the welding and ballasting programs during the first 3.5 years of the
plan and about 30,000 m3 per year thereafter. Consequently, a program
has been prepared to locate a ballast quarry and then to provide quarry
equipment. The maximum production capacity of the quarry will be about
200 m3/day. Ballast cost per m3 is expected to drop from 2,000 MF at
present to 1,200 MF.
3.        The plan includes such track-maintenance equipment as spare parts
for ballast tampers, small mechanical tools and gang cars for the transport
of track workers and material.
4.        Provision is made in the plan for purchasing and installing 68
switches to reduce the number of derailments mainly in the stations. More-
over, it will be necessary to extend loops in 3 stations to permit operation
of longer trains after arrival of the 3 heavy locomotives included in the
plan.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Bridges
5.        There are four major bridges and about 50 small mansonry or concrete
bridges whose maintenance has been neglected for many years. Studies completed
in 1973 by SOFRERAIL showed that some bridges to be rehabilitated under the
present plan are near collapse. Speed limitations of 10 km/h are now enforced.
The bridge rehabilitation program comprises urgent repairs and reinforcement
so that the axle load, originally 12 or 14 tons, can be raised to 17 tons,
which will allow the operation of the diesel locomotives without speed re-
strictions on the bridges.  This item i3 considered of high priority.
Telecommunications
6.        The renewal of telephlone lines was satisfactorily completed in
1972 under the First Railway Project.  But it is still necessary to install
reliable connections between Bamako and the Senegalese network.
Rolling Stock
7.        Locomotives:  Data show that in 1975, 22,598 gross ton-km were
carried per horsepower per year. Assuming improvement in operations during
the period of the present plan, 24,500 gross ton-km will be carried per horse-
power per year in 1980. According to traffic forecasts, about 450 million
gross ton-km will be transported by CFM in 1980. The existing locomotive
fleet and three new locomotives of 1800 lip (type CC2400) will cover this
requirement under the assumptions of 84% availability and scrapping the BB500
and the three BB1150 locomotives. Allowances are made in the plan for acqui-
sition of 3 additional locomotives in 1980 to cover increasing traffic demand
in the early 1980's. Justification for this item has to be prepared before
financing.
8.        Shunting locomotives:  CFM proposes to operate shunting locomotives
as follows:
Kayes                                   1
Diamou cement plant                     1
Bamako                                  2
Korofina workshops                      I
Track maintenance                       1
Track welding program                   1
Reserve and maintenance (22%)           2
Total                          9
9.        Domestic passenger traffic estimates for 1980 are 504,000 passengers
(100.8 million pass-km), an increase of about 72,000 passengers (22.6 million
pass-km) from 1975. The general policy of the railway regarding national
traffic is to change locomotive/passenger car operations to cheaper railcar/
trailer operations. Three railcars and eight trailers were financed during



ANNEX 9
Page 3
the Second Project. Unfortunately, one railcar and two trailers were de-
stroyed in an accident in 1974. Taking traffic forecasts into account, the
present plan provides for one railcar and four trailers which would both
compensate for the accident of 1974 and meet the future traffic.
10.       International passenger traffic is increasing somewhat faster
than national traffic and is expected to reach 77,000 passengers (32.3 mil-
lion pass-km) in 1980, an increase of about 18,000 passengers (7.8 million
pass-km) over 1975. So financing for four new cars, an item which was deleted
from the Second Project, is included in the plan.
11.       Moreover, rehabilitation of existing passenger cars is essential
because many cracks occur on present bogie frames, reducing reliability
and raising maintenance costs. New, technically more suitable bogies will
be purchased during the plan.
12.       There will be 405 freight cars on CFM's books after delivery in 1976
of the 49 cars financed under the Second Railway Project (including 29 tank
wagons, see Table 2); 77 cars over 45 years old should be scrapped, reducing
the freight car fleet to 328. A pool of 187 Malian and 185 Senegalese general
cargo cars is allocated to international traffic. Assuming a 93% rate of
availability, a net load of about 26 tons per general cargo car (excluding
tank cars) and a turnaround time of about 12 days, the international pool
will be able to handle the 269,000 tons forecast for 1980 (see Table 4).
This traffic forecast does not include imports for the construction of
Manantali Dam and for the planned construction of a new cement factory (and/
or extension of the existing plant). It is expected that the present turn-
around time of about 15 days can be reduced by about 3 days by 1980 after
recommendations of the operation study are implemented and import and export
traffic are more balanced. The ratio between export and import flows, ex-
cluding petroleum products, was 0.54 in 1975 and is expected to reach 0.69 in
1980.
13.       The fleet of freight cars now allocated to national traffic com-
prises 112 cars. Assuming an average load of 35 tons for cement traffic,
an availability of 93% and a turnaround time of about 4 days, 19 covered
cars will be required to meet the traffic volume of 55,000 tons of cement
in 1980, which represents about half the national traffic. A total of 86
cars will be needed to handle 61,000 tons of other commodities of national
traffic in the same year (average net load 19 tons, 10 day-turnaround time,
93% availability). Seven cars of the fleet allocated to national traffic
will be used as reserve and for peak traffic. The need to purchase new cars
should be reviewed once final agreements have been reached on the construc-
tion of the dam and the cement factory and after precise transport require-
ments are established. The plan contains allowances for new freight cars for
1980 and 1981 to cover expected traffic increase.
14.       Under the plan roller bearings for 49 freight cars should be pro-
vided to reduce accidents and train delays caused by hot-boxes.

15.       The total capacity in 1980 of tank cars will be as follows:
Number          Capacity (m3)           Remarks
CFM tank cars               24                900
Senegalese tank cars        37               1480    {      For international
Private tank cars           10                400    {      traffic only
New tank cars               18                720           Included in the
present project
Total                       89               3500
Assuming an a-vailability of 85% and an average turnaround time of 12 days
(to be sure of a permanent traffic flow and to meet traffic peaks), the 89
tank cars will cover the traffic demand in 1980.
16.       To ensure good progress under the track rehabilitation program
and reduce interference with traffic during work execution, the purchase
of 14 ballast wagons is included in the plan.
Workshop
17.       To supplement efforts made during the previous projects to improve
workshops, a grinding-lathe for repairing small crank shafts of diesel loco-
motives will be purchased.
Training
18.       Some training was carried out by the CFM during the 1960's, but
more systematic training took place only after the Training Division (TD)
was officially established in February 1969. Some US$180,000 was origi-
nally allocated for training (US$130,000 to purchase training equipment
and US$50,000 for training abroad) under Credit 384-MLI; however, only
US$30,000 was actually spent for this purpose; the balance was used to meet
cost overruns of other components of the project. The training component
involves (i) the construction of a railway training center including a dormi-
tory for students; (ii) the construction of a small secondary training center
at Kayes; (iii) the purchase of furniture, didactic materials and training
equipment for the two centers; (iv) short training programs abroad for four
Malian instructors and 11 experienced supervisory staff; and (v) the recruit-
ment of four expatriate instructors.
Studies
19.       In 1980 imports will represent about 52% of the total freight
traffic of CFMI. These imports come by ship through Dakar port. Container
transportation would significantly reduce delays both in the Dakar port and
at the Bamako station and would reduce the turnaround time of freight cars.
Moreover, it would improve the railway's competition with the Ivory Coast
route. Consultants will quantify the benefits of containerization to



ANNEX 9
Page 5
CFM and to the national economy. Tentative terms of reference for this study
are given in Annex 10.
20.       The transport of international traffic is disrupted by bottlenecks
in terminal operations at Dakar port and main stations, operational difficul-
ties on the line, and insufficient cooperation between the Mali and Senegal
Railways. This leads to a low productivity of equipment, particularly turn-
around time of freight cars, resulting in poor quality of service and in
loss of traffic. Provisions are, therefore, made in the project for a study
to review in detail and to present recommendations on the operational condi-
tions of the whole international line. The study will also assess all areas
where improved cooperation between the Mali and Senegal Railways would in-
crease operational efficiency. Tentative terms of reference for this study
are given in Annex 10.
21.       The third study included in the plan deals with the economic and
financial justification of a possible rehabilitation of the Bamako-Koulikoro
line. The line has recently been closed to heavy freight traffic because of
the dangerous condition of several bridges. A paved road between the two
cities, likely to attract much of the railway traffic, was completed in 1975.
Tentative terms of reference are given in Annex 10.

II. STUDY OF BAMAKO-KOULIKORO LINE
A.   Objectives
1.        The 59-km railway section Bamako-Koulikoro links the capital with
Koulikoro on the Niger River. Traffic on this line has been severely cur-
tailed due to the dangerous condition of several bridges and smaller struc-
tures. Based on a study by SOFRERAIL in 1973, CFM has estimated that the
rehabilitation of the bridges would cost about MF 960 million including
upgrading of the structures to a capacity of 17 tons/axle. A paved road
linking the two cities was completed in 1975 and is attracting much of the
railway traffic. The proposed study would provide the basis for a Government
decision on whether to rehabilitate the Bamako-Koulikoro railway line or
to close it.
B.   Scope of Work
Consultants will be asked to:
Engineering
(a) review the SOFRERAIL report;
(b) based on the report and on inspection of the structures, make
a list of structures that are in dangerous condition and of
those that would need to be reinforced to 17 ton/axle capacity;
and
(c) make a cost estimate of the recommended works and prepare a
tentative investment plan, with indication of priorities.
Traffic
(a) review historical freight and passenger traffic over the
section;
(b) review industrial and agricultural plans and estimate the
traffic that they could generate over the link;
(c) prepare a traffic forecast, freight and passenger, for local
and international traffic between Bamako and Koulikoro; and
(d) assuming the railway line is rehabilitated, make a modal
split of forecast traffic between Koulikoro, based on economic
rail and road costs.
Economic Evaluation
(a) evaluate the economic return of the proposed railway rehabili-
tation program of the Bamako-Koulikoro line, taking into account;



ANNEX 10
Page 4
(i) the costs of bridge rehabilitation;
(ii) investments needed in trucks and buses if the railway line
is closed;
(iii) the railway traffic forecast under (d) above; and
(iv) the differential in transport costs between road and rail.
(b) make a sensitivity analysis of the economic return with regard
to main variables.
Financial Evaluation
assess the impact in the railway's operating costs and revenues
of the two alternatives studied, i.e., rehabilitation of the
line or its closure.
C.   Closure of Bamako-Koulikoro Line
If the study concludes that the line should be closed, the
consultants will make appropriate recommendations to implement its closing,
in particular regarding:
(a) provision of road passenger services over the section; and
(b) utilization of railway property.
III. STUDY ON MALI-SENEGAL RAILWAY OPERATIONS
A.   Objective
1.        The objective of the study is to improve the operational efficiency
and the quality of service on the international line in order that the Mali
and Senegal railways (CFM and CFS) can adequately perform their economic role
and improve their finances. To achieve this objective consultants will review
in detail the present operational conditions on the international line and
terminal operations and will assess all areas where improved cooperation
between Mali and Senegal might increase efficiency. Consultants will prepare
appropriate recommendations and assist in their implementation.
B.   Review of Present Operations
2.        The consultants shall review all aspects of operations including:
-    present operation regulations for national and international
traffic;
-    national and international passenger and freight train timetables;



ANNEX 10
Page 5
train dispatching and wagon control system;
statistics on wagon turnaround time;
utilization of motive power and rolling stock;
shunting operations in stations, particularly at Bel Air
marshalling yard, Dakar Port and Bamako station;
maintenance scheduling;
facilities and organization of loading and unloading of main
products (petroleum, cement, fertilizers, groundnuts, cotton,
foodstuffs);
signalling and telecommunications systems;
safety problems;
staff training.
3.        On the basis of the above studies, consultants will analyze in
detail inefficiencies or operational problems which could be solved by in-
creased cooperation between CFM and CFS. This analysis should cover, but not
be limited to, the following:
-    rationalization and standardization of operating regulations
and procedures;
-    regulation of the freight wagon pool for international traffic;
-    introduction of a suitable train dispatching and wagon control
system;
-    standardization of statistics for management decisions;
-    routine exchange of information about traffic demand;
-    standardization of technical equipment and installations;
-    exchange of rolling stock between CFM and CFS networks;
-    possible specialized workshops so that certain maintenance
and repair jobs would be done solely in Senegal and others
in Mali;
-    execution of joint training programs.

C.   Implementation
4.        Immediateiy aZzer Board approval, consultants should be asked
to submit offers. Within two months experts should start the field inves-
tigations.  Their snort- and long-term recommendations would be submitted
to both Governments, railways, and the Association after 6 months for
discussion and approval. Agreed recommendations should be executed with
consultants assistance within a 6-month period. A tentative time schedule
is given below:
-    Invitation of about 4 consulting firms
for bidding                                       July 1977
-    Evaluation of submitted offers                    September 1977
-    Consultants in the field                          October 1977
-    Report submitted by consultants                   April 1978
-    Discussion and approval of recommendations        May 1978
-    Implementation of recommended short-term          December 1978

ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.        The economic evaluation consists of a separate benefit-cost analysis
for each project component and of a calculation of the economic return for the
project as a whole. For the analysis, individual project items are grouped
into components according to the investment objectives of that particular
component. The effect of changes of main hypothesis on the components' re-
turn is tested through sensitivity analysis 1/.
2.        All costs and benefits are expressed in constant 1976 Mali francs.
Investment costs are net of taxes and include physical contingencies.
Track rehabilitation and improvement program
3.        Investments under this category include renewal of track on 21.5 km,
ballasting of about 210 km of line, welding of 400 km of rails, and purchase
of the following: equipment for setting up a ballast quarry, 60 switches to
replace worn out equipment, 5 gang-cars, 14 ballast wagons and other miscella-
neous elements. Benefits would be a reduction in the number of derailments
because of the improved condition of the track resulting from the replacement
of worn-out switches; a decrease in track maintenance costs; an increase in
the lifetime of rails and sleepers; savings in rail cuts which would be neces-
sary given existing rail deformations if welding is postponed or not done; and
savings in maintenance costs of rolling stock. Benefits from an increase in
speed, namely, a better utilization of locomotives and rolling stock that will
be made possible by ballasting and welding of the line, have not been quanti-
fied. The monetary values of assessed benefits and the costs of the investment
are presented in Table 2 to this Annex. Benefits are estimated on the basis
of 1975 traffic levels. As shown in this table, the main benefit of this in-
vestment is the reduction of derailments. An average derailment is estimated
to cost MF 4.59 million. This cost is broken down as follows:
(a) track repair, assuming an average of 50 m are destroyed per
accident,
-    equipment (rails, sleepers, fastenings, etc.)  MF 2.25 million
-    labor and repair equipment .....     ............. MF 0.45 million
(b)  motive power repair, assuming that in 25% of the
accidents there is damage to one locomotive and
that repair costs are 2% of purchase price
(MF 270 million) .......      ..........................  MF 1.35 million
1/   In the sensitivity analysis, investments costs for civil works are
increased by 20% and for equipment only by 10%, as the price of the
latter is based on recent quotations by the manufacturers to be
bilateral lending agencies.

(c) rolling stock repair, assuming that 2 cars are
damaged ir. each ac.i1:rt nnd that repair costs
2% of purchase price (MF 13.5 million per car) ...  MF 0.54 million

in the project are shown below and would substantially increase if ballasting
is not carried out.

4.        The economic rate of return on this investment is 23%.  The rate of
return would drop to 20% if investment costs are 20% higher than estimated, to
19% if actual benefits would fall short by 20%, and to 16% if both events were
to occur simultaneously.
Bridges
5.        The physical condition of the bridges on the Koulokoro-Kidira line
was studied by the consulting firm SOFRERAIL in 1973. The study concluded
that over 50 bridges between Bamako and Kidira, including four main bridges
at Papara (68 m), Bagouko (40 m), Mahina (400 m), Toukoto (350 m)) needed
urgent repairs, and that some of them exceeded acceptable deformation limits.
In addition, all bridges between Kayes and Kidira date from the original
construction in 1920 and are designed for a load charge of 10 ton/axle, sub-
stantially below the maximum axle load of 17 tons of Malian locomotives.
The bridges have continued to deteriorate since this study was made. Speed
limits of 10 km/h are being enforced on several bridges between Bamako and
the Senegal border, and heavy freight traffic has been completely halted on
the Bamako-Koulikoro section. Under these conditions, there is a serious
risk of bridge failure, and further deterioration could soon force suspension
of all railway traffic.
6.        While it is not possible to predict with accuracy which bridge
would collapse, and when this would happen, for the purpose of the economic
evaluation, it is assumed that if the bridge rehabilitation program is not
carried out, line closure would take place by 1981. Given the present con-
dition of bridges, with several near collapse, this is a conservative assump-
tion, Suspension of rail service would force diversion of all international
traffic to the more expensive routes via Abidjan, causing a substantial
increase in Mali's international freight bill. Agricultural and industrial
product4ocn in the railway's zone of influence would be frustrated by a lack of
access to ra-w materials or by a means of evacuating finished products.
Passenger traffic would be cut between Bamako and the Senegalese border.
Therefore, benefits of the proposed bridge rehabilitation program quantified
in the evaluation include (a) difference in transport costs between Dakar



ANNEX 11
Page 3
and Abidjan routes and (b) frustrated value added for main agricultural and
industrial products. Benefits from passenger traffic are not included in
this computation to avoid double counting with the evaluation of passenger
equipment (para. 9).
(a)  Difference in transport costs.  The increase in transport costs
for diversion to the Abidjan routes would cost the Malian
economy MF 3,193 million in 1981. Calculation of this figure
is presented in Table 2 to this Annex.
(b)  Frustrated value added.  The two main products of the area
served by the railway are groundnuts (and its derivatives)
and cement. Their value added in 1981 is estimated as follows:
(i) Groundnut products. It is estimated that all groundnut cakes
and oil production from the new plant at Kita would be
frustrated and that 20% of forecast groundnut railway traffic
originating north of Bamako would be evacuated via Abidjan.
Value added in 1981 would be MF 5.54 billion computed as
follows:

(ii) Cement. It is assumed that production from Mali's only
cement plant at Diamou, near Kayes, would cease completely
if there were no railway service. Based on 1970 value added/
gross output ratio of 0.35, for a production of 55,000 tons
in 1981, value added would be MF 480 million.
Total rail marginal costs for groundnuts and cement would be MF 325 million
in 1981.
1/   Based on 1975 data, see IBRD Memorandum Economique - Mali, May 1976.
2/   Taking value added/gross output = 0.76, according to data for 1970
from Comptes Economiques de Mali, Service de la Statistique.



ANNEX 11
Page 4
7.        The economic investment costs of the bridge rehabilitation program
are MF 3,944 million, of which MF 661 million would be allocated in 1977, MF
1,824 million in 1978; MF 730 million in 1979, MF 365 million in 1980 and MF
364 million in 1981.
8.        The costs to Malian economy in terms of frustrated production,
diversion of international traffic and suspension of passenger services if
the bridge rehabilitation program were not undertaken and the line had to be
closed permanently by 1981 would be enormous. At a 12% discount rate, the
present value of such losses over a period of 20 years would amount close to
ME 49,000 billion (US$100 million). Therefore, permanent closure of the line
would not be a realistic course of action. In evaluating the proposed bridge
investment program the most likely alternative is assumed to be delaying this
program until a bridge failure occurred, making operation of the railway
physically impossible. Assuming this would happen in 1981 and the time
required to put the line back in service were six months (a very conservative
assumption, considering that to repair or replace a bridge, parts would need to
be imported from Europe and an experienced foreign contractor would need to be
hired), the economic return of the proposed bridge investment, compared to
delaying it until 1981, would be 25% (at a 12% discount rate, the net present
value - benefits minus costs - of undertaking the project now compared to 1981
would amount to about MF 6,000 million). Were investment costs 20% higher
than estimated, or benefits 20% lower, the return would fall to 18% and 17%
respectively. The bridge program would be justified even in the higherly
hypothetical case that the Senegal section was closed to international traffic:
based on benefits from frustrated production alone, the rate of return would
be 16%.
Passenger equipment
9.        This component of the project comprises the purchase of I railcar
with 4 trailers and 4 passenger cars. The purpose of the railcar and trailers
is to replace 1 railcar and 2 trailers destroyed in a 1974 accident and to
provide additional capacity required to meet increasing national passenger
traffic. With a capacity of 60 passengers for the railcar and 74 passengers
for each trailer, 120,000 km (1980 target) travelled annually, and an occu-
pancy factor of 80%, this investment would provide an increase in annual
capacity of 34.18 million pass-km. This capacity would carry, beginning in
1979 (when the equipment will be fully operational), all incremental national
traffic from 1976 and about some 25% of 1976 national passenger traffic, thus
supplementing passenger equipment presently utilized at very high occupancy
factors and preventing its further deterioration. At average revenues of MF
11.20/pass-km in first class and MF 7.30/pass-km in second class, revenues
generated by this equipment would be:

Annual maintenance costs are estimated at MF 66.4 million, and direct operat-
ing costs at MF 16.8 million.
10.       The four new passenger cars (82 seats each) would replace 4 old
44-seat cars that will be scrapped and provide capacity to handle the fast-
growing international passenger traffic. Based on 1976 traffic and utiliza-
tion of equipment, the 2 cars assigned to replace old equipment should carry
6.5 million pass-km annually (2nd class), and at MF 9.24/pass-km would mean
a revenue of MF 60.1 million annually. The two cars assigned to handle the
incremental international traffic should carry 50% of the new traffic (the
other 50% will be carried in Senegalese trains), and would generate the
following revenues:

The maintenance costs of 2 passenger cars is estimated at MF 15.8 million per
year.
11.       Based on the above costs, taking net revenues as minimum economic
benefits (omitting the consumer surplus) in the absence of alternative trans-
port services, and assuming they remain constant beyond 1981, the economic
rate of return on the railcar, trailers and passenger cars is 14%. With 10%
higher investment costs, the return would be 13%. Should traffic growth be
30% lower than estimated, the return would be 12%. These results are satis-
factory.
Tank wagons
12.       The project provides for 18 tank wagons at an investment cost of
MF 310 million, divided equally between 1978 and 1979. The traffic forecast
calls for an increase in petroleum traffic over the Mali railway from 31,600
tons in 1975 to 72,000 tons in 1980 and 75,000 tons in 1981. The 18 tank
wagons, each with a capacity of 34 ton (40 m3), an availability of 85% and a
turnaround time of 13 days, would be able to transport 14,600 tons per year.
1/ This capacity would be fully utilized by 1980. At a cost differential
between the Abidjan road route and Dakar of MF 20,344/ton, the economic rate
of return on this investment is 50%. Were investment 10% higer than esti-
mated, the return would be 46%. If consideration is taken of the existing
truck capacity over the Abidjan routes, and depreciation of trucks is omitted
from road transport costs the difference between Abidjan and Dakar routes
would be reduced to MF 10,107/ton, and the rate of return for the tank wagon
1/   For the purpose of the evaluation of the investment, capacity has been
calculated on present availability and turnaround time. With expected
increase in efficiency for 1980, the capacity would be 20,600 tons per
year.



ANNEX 11
Page 7
investment would fall to 9%. At a differential in cost of MF 20,344/ton
between the Abidjan and Dakar routes, the proposed tank wagon investment would
have a rate of return above 10% even if traffic in 1980 were only 60,000 tons,
or 12,000 tons below the forecast.
Bogies
13.       This investment comprises 16 new bogies to replace the original
ones in 8 passenger cars, used in the international express trains. These
have a design fault causing periodic cracks and high repair and maintenance
costs, and are reaching a limit of possible repairs. It is estimated that
if bogies are not replaced soon the 8 cars will be immobilized by 1981 (1 car
would be immobilized in 1978, 2 in 1979, 2 in 1980 and 3 in 1981). Based on
1976 revenue from international passenger traffic and a fleet of 13 passen-
ger cars, the loss in revenues (taken as minimum economic benefits as in the
case of passenger equipment would be MF 19.8 million in 1978, MF 59.4 million
in 1979, MF 99.0 million in 1980, and MF 158.4 million from 1981 to 1992. At
a cost of MF 332 million for the 16 new bogies, the rate of return for this
investment is 37%. If investment costs were 10% higher than estimated, the
rate of return would be 34%.
Extension of loops
14.       The project includes extension of 3 loops by 250 m each, at a
total cost of MF 306 million, equally divided between 1977 and 1978. The
purpose of these loops is to allow longer trains on the line, which can be
hauled by the three new CC-2400 (1800 HP) locomotives financed by CCCE/COFACE
under the proposed project. These three locomotives can handle the same
tonnage as 4 of the CC-1600 (1400 HP) locomotives which are at present the
heaviest main-line locomotives in CFM's fleet. The investment in loops will
save MF 166.50 million in locomotive investment cost (4 small locomotives at
MF 427 million each compared to 3 big locomotives at MF 472 million each for a
comparable supplier and financing source), and MF 21.96 million annually in
locomotive operating costs. Assuming that investments in loops and loco-
motives would take place in 1978, and operating cost savings start in 1979,
the rate of return for the investment in loops is 13%; if the loops were to
cost 10% more than estimated, the rate of return would be 11%, which is
acceptable.
Evaluation of the Complete Project
15.       The economic rate of return for the complete project, considering
the best estimate for all costs and benefits is 23%. The cost and benefit
streams for the whole project are presented in Table 3 to this Annex.

2/ Benefits derive from:  a) elimination of hiring of auxiliary personnel to maintain track platform and embankments pre-
sently necessary (MF 59 million in 1976 budget) because track maintenance gang need to do extra manual tamping for
lack of ballast on the line; b) welding will reduce maintenance need of track joints and allow reduction of mainte-
nance gang from 7 to 6 people (savings of MF 9 million annually).
