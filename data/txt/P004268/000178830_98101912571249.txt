1. ENERGY AND THE POWER SECTOR
Overview
1.01       Malaysia is dependent on oil for almost all of its commercial energy
requirements; oil consumption of 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1980
accounted for about 93% of commercial energy used. Fortunately the country is
a net exporter of oil. Petroleum exports have risen in value from about
US$340 million in 1975 to US$3.1 billion in 1980. Against this the net value
of crude imports in 1980 was US$800 million, providing export earnings of
US$2.3 billion or roughly 18% of total export earnings on crude account.
However, the rapid growth in oil consumption, averaging about 8.5% over the
last 10 years, will either reduce exportable surplus or lead to early
depletion of reserves. Diversification away from oil is, therefore, a major
policy objective. Fortunately the country has discovered substantial gas
resources, estimated at nearly three times the level of oil reserves in terms
of energy equivalence. Measures to substitute oil by gas in several sectors
like power generation, household consumption and transportation are being
pursued.
Energy Resources
Oil
1.02       Oil production increased from about 100,000 bpd in 1975 to about
276,000 bpd in 1980. Official estimates of remaining recoverable reserves at
January 81 were 1.74 billion barrels, which are considered conservative.
Industry sources put ultimate recoverable reserves at about 3-3.6 billion
barrels./l Even with higher reserves, with consumption growing at 8-9% p.a.,
the country could be a net importer of oil by the mid 1990s if no substitution
of oil takes place.
Gas
1.03       Total proven gas reserves as of January 1980 were 31.2 trillion
standard cubic feet (scf), but expected reserves are 43 trillion scf. About
70% of the reserves are nonassociated gas, produced independently of oil pro-
duction. Associated gas is currently p--'uced at the rate of about 260 mil-
lion cu ft per day, about 90% of which is flared. There are about 20 fields
with nonassociated gas, all offshore with the majority near Trengganu. None
of these is producing yet. Two fields offshore Sarawak are under development
by Shell in order to supply gas to a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plant in
/1 Oil and Gas Sector Memorandum. World Bank, Energy Dept., June 1981.

Bintulu coming on stream in 1983, which will yield 6 million tons of LNG per
year for export to Japan. Gas will also provide for industrial development in
the Bintulu area including an amonia/urea plant. Also a gas gathering system
and pipeline are planned from gas fields offshore Trengganu to transport the
gas onshore, where a 450 MW combined-cycle power generating plant is planned
for startup in 1984. Government is also formulating other plans for gas
utilization, including the possibility of a pipeline across Peninsular
Malaysia to transport gas to the more populous west coast, for use as fuel for
existing or new power plants and in various other industries. A study on gas
development and utilization is being undertaken by Petronas (para. 1.09). The
Bank has assisted in drafting terms of reference, developing a framework for
negotiations and advising on the consultancy contract. Consultants for this
study have been selected.
Hydro Power
1.04      Hydroelectric generating capacity in Peninsular Malaysia is 640
MW, with annual production of about 2,000 GWh. An additional 600 MW of
capacity (2,300 GWh) is under construction. Further schemes amounting to
about 1,000 MW (about 5,000 GWh) have been identified and are in various
stages of planning.
1.05      Considerable hydroelectric potential is available in Sarawak and
Sabah, where there is little demand for electricity. In Sarawak alone
presently known hydropower potential is about 10,000 MW. A feasibility
study was conducted for transmitting 1,500 MW of baseload power from Sarawak
to the Peninsula by overland transmission lines and submarine cables. The
project is reported to be economically attractive, but technically
challenging and needing large capital investment. Also its implementation
period might be 10-12 years (para. 3.09).
Coal
1.06      Total coal reserves are estimated at 400-500 million tons, mainly
in Sarawak. Only 20% of these are considered economically exploitable and
the quality is poor. Hence, domestically produced coal can not play any
significant role in reducing the country's dependence on oil. The
possibility of basing future electricity production on imported coal is
under consideration (para. 3.10).
Sector Organization
1.07      A cabinet committee on energy formed in 1980 is responsible for
evolving the energy policy. It consists of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime
Minister, and Ministers of Energy, Trade and Industry, and Science and

Technology. This committee is supported by a "Committee of Officials"
chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Government and having representatives
from Petronas, Treasury, the Ministries of Energy, Science and Technology,
Trade and Industry, the National Electricity Board and the Economic Planning
Unit (EPU).
1.08      The Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, created in
1979, has in theory, the responsibility for coordinating the activities of
diverse governmental agencies dealing with energy. However, in practice,
the Ministry's responsibility for energy policy so far, has been limited and
consists primarily of jurisdiction over the National Electricity Board
(NEB). In 1980, an Energy Unit was created in the Ministry to act as a
secretariat for the cabinet committee on Energy. This unit is expected to
have a wider role in the energy sector in future.
1.09      Petronas, established in 1974, as a Government company, has operat-
ing responsibilities in the oil and gas sector. Malaysia's Petroleum
Development Act gives it exclusive rights over exploration and production of
petroleum.  It supervises work programs for exploration and production of
contracting oil companies and has authority to negotiate future production
sharing agreements. Exploration activities are undertaken through a
subsidiary company, Petronas Carigali Berhad, formed in 1978.
Energy Sector Issues
1.10      The principal task in the energy sector is to reduce the heavy and
increasing dependance of the country on oil and thereby extend the life of
its oil reserves and protect foreign exchange earnings. Rapid development
of gas resources, with a clear understanding of how best to use the gas, is a
major issue.
1.11      Simultaneously, developing an information base on other energy
resources like hydropower, coal, renewable resources, etc., and analysis of
the demand side, on which the data base is limited, are important to
long-term policy decisions.
1.12      Promoting conservation through various efficiency improvement
programs and pricing mechanisms is also an important policy objective.
Bank Involvement
1.13      Traditionally the Bank's involvement in the Energy Sector was
primarily in the electric power subsector (para. 1.29). However the Bank is
currently assisting the Government in two studies, viz. the gas utilization
study (para. 1.03) and the National Energy Resources survey. The latter is
being financed by the Bank under the Ninth Power Loan (1808-MA) and Bank

The Power Sector
Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.14      Value added by the electric power sector accounts for only about
2% of GDP. However, electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing
and mining industries which amount to about 20% and 5% of GDP respectively.
1.15      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Malaysia's econo-
mic development. Between 1970 and 1980, when GNP grew at an average rate of
about 7.5% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an average
rate of about 12.8%. The elasticity coefficient of 1.7 is comparable to
those for countries at similar stages of development.
1.16      Electricity accounts for about 28% of the total consumption of
commercial forms of energy. Nearly 86% of electricity production is by use
of liquid petroleum fuels; the total petroleum fuel used for power genera-
tion in 1980 was about 12.5 million barrels.
Power Sector Organization
1.17      Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous Government-
owned entities. The largest of these is NEB, serving Peninsular Malaysia with
the exception of a part of the State of Perak which is supplied by the Perak
River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE). Also small generating and distri-
buting licencees exist in isolated areas where NEB's supply is not yet avail-
able. The two states on the island of Borneo are supplied by Government-owned
statutory authorities the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the Sarawak
Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO).
1.18      In the state of Perak, PRHE and its distribution subsidiary, Kinta
Electric Distribution Co., Ltd. (KED), generate and distribute electricity
within their concession area to some 85,700 customers; the bulk of the output
is sold to the mining industry. PRHE is a profitable operation. The company
is incorporated in the United Kingdom and operates under a concession granted
by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years with a break clause after
50 years. The Government has acquired all the ordinary shares and is now the
sole owner of PRHE. The General Manager of NEB is a director on the board of
PRHE.  The final integration of PRHE with NEB is scheduled in October 1982.

1.21      In FY80, the consumption of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia was
8,025 GWh. The per capita consumption was 720 kWh per annum and per capita
production was 810 kWh.



1.22      NEBEs sale of electricity to different categories of consumers in
FY80 was as follows:
Sales
Category                (GWh)          %
Residential             1,148         15.8

Total              7,265        100.0
The transmission and distribution losses in NEB system of 10% in 1980 are
reasonable (Annex 15, Table 4).
Access to Electricity
1.23      The overall degree of electrification in Peninsular Malaysia at the
end of FY80 was 61%; approximately 1.35 million households out of a total of
2.21 million had electricity. However, the intensity among different states
varied widely, with 80 to 90% electrification in the states of Selangor,
Melaka and Penang and only about 40% in the states of Pahang, Kelantan and
Kedah.  Annex 1 shows the level of electrification by states in Peninsular
Malaysia. The degree of electrification in Sarawak and Sabah is about 25% and
45%, respectively.
Rural Electrification
1.24      Rural electrification in Malaysia began in the 1950s when during the
emergency, a large number of villages were electrified from diesel generators
to provide perimeter lighting for security reasons. Originally, the installa-
tions were operated by NEB-s predecessor organization (the Central Electricity
Board) on the basis of cost reimbursement from the Government. After the
emergency, the majority of the small systems were sold to private licensees as
they were uneconomic on a full NEB service basis; 65 such licensees still
exist.
1.25      Rural electrification with social objectives, however, commenced
on a small scale with the first five year Malaya development plan (1956-60),
and slightly accelerated during the second five year plan (1961-65).
During that decade about 600 villages with about 62,000 consumers were
electrified. Thereafter, greater importance to rural electrification has
been given in each successive five year development plan as illustrated below.

1976-80              3,160            230,000              277
1.26      Under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA), financing of a
rural electrification study was included in order to formulate a
comprehensive rural electrification plan and to review its technical,
economic and financial implications.  The study was completed in August 1978
by the Middle West Service Company of Chicago in association with the
Perunding Bersatu Sdn. Bhd. of Kuala Lumpur.
1.27      The implementation of the growing rural electrification program
was constrained by several factors, viz. organization, staff, materials
procurement, way leaves, etc. In 1978, NEB set up a Rural Electrification
Department, headed by a Chief Engineer, reporting directly to the General
Manager, and having implementing units in each state. Special steps were
also taken to coordinate materials procurement, way leave and other
activities which were causing delays. As a result the implementation
performance of the NEB for the rural electrification improved from about 60%
to 96% of the planned program each year, towards the end of the Third
Malaysian Plan (1976-80).
1.28      The rural electrification program for the Fourth Malaysian Plan
(1981-85) has been formulated. Detailed discussion of its contents appear
in later sections (paras.3.16-3.20).
Experience with Past Loans
1.29      The Bank has made nine loans to the National Electricity Board of
the States of Malaya (NEB), aggregating US$283.2 million (net of cancella-
tions). The projects under the first six loans have been completed and are
operating satisfactorily. Project performance audit reports (PPARs) were
made for the fifth and sixth loans in 1979 and 1981 respectively. The fifth
project was completed about 3 months behind schedule with a cost overrun of
15% whereas the sixth project was delayed by eleven months and the cost
overrun was 31%.  Both these projects were executed as planned and achieved
their major objectives. The PPAR for the sixth power project (report



- 9 -
no. 3506 of June 22, 1981) notes that NEB is a well managed utility and
has some effective staff training programs. It concludes that, apart
from the utility's declining financial performance, due to tactors beyond
the control ot its management, the project was a success.
1.30      The implementation of the seventh power project is substantially
completed, with the third generating unit at Prai in service since October
1980. A cost saving of $3.0 million was achieved in the loan amount. The
eighth power project is about six months behind schedule but no cost overrun
is expected. The ninth power project which is in the early stage of
implementation, is on schedule.
2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower will be the National Electricity Board of the States
of Malaya (NEB), an autonomous Government-owned corporation established in
1949. NEB reports to the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts.
Organizational Structure and Performance
2.02      NEB is both a regulatory and an operating agency responsible for
the generation, transmission, distribution of electricity in the Peninsular
Malaysia. NEB has the legal power to set tariffs and to grant licenses to
independent electricity works.
2.03      All members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the
Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts who establishes their
terms. The Chairman of the Board is the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet and
the Deputy Chairman is the General Manager.
2.04      NEB's organization chart is presented in Annex 2.  The operation
is divided into four departments: Development Planning, Major Projects,
Operation and Administration. The Development Planning Department was
created recently and is still in the process of consolidating its functions
and responsibilities within the organization. It is expected that in the
future the Development Planning department will act as a catalyst to improve
coordination of operations of the different departments.
Manpower and Training
2.05      A number of senior officials have retired in the last three years.
The replacements are experienced professionals who have managed to keep the
operation running without disruption.
2.06      At the end of FY81, NEB had 21,144 employees.  Table 2.1 shows the
evolution of manpower during the past five years by categories and compares
it with the growth of sales and number of customers served.

2.07      The growth in number of unskilled employees during the past five
years (17.4%) has been substantially larger than the increase in staff at
the management and technical levels. This imbalance is partially explained
by NEB's growing involvement in rural electrification. It also reflects the
perceived shortage of trained staff, mainly in the financial area.
2.08      NEB has been trying to correct this situation through an intense
training program. This program includes training in a modern and well
equipped training center as well as scholarships for studies in local
institutions and abroad. The center initially concentrated its efforts in
training technical personnel and now is expanding to management and
financial areas.
Management Systems
2.09      NEB prepares annual budgets for capital and operating
expenditures. The execution of the budget is monitored every month and
revisions are incorporated periodically.
2.10      There is a well-staffed and equipped Data Processing Center.
Accounts receivable for three districts, as well as payroll and inventory
control are computerized. The computer is also used for engineering
applications. NEB is planning to introduce additional computer applications
such as financial planning and billing.
2.11      Accounting systems are well designed and provide adequate
information, but there have been growing delays in the preparation of
financial reports. NEB is presently preparing an action plan to modernize
its management information system.
Audit and Internal Control
2.12      NEB accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse and Co. and a local
firm, Hanafiah, Raslan, Mohamad and Partners. Both firms have been accepted
by the Bank in previous loans to NEB. The Government recently enacted a law
requiring the Auditor General to audit the accounts of all government-owned
corporations. Due to staff constraints, the Auditor General decided to hire
the same two firms to continue as external auditors to NEB, which, according
to the new norm, will report directly to the Government. During negotia-
tions assurances were obtained that NEB will continue to employ independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit NEB's accounts and to send its
audited financial statements and auditors' reports to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.
2.13      Under Loan 1808-MA it was agreed that the Internal Audit Unit now
under the Chief Accountant will be reporting to the General Manager by the
end of 1981 and that the scope of its work will be expanded to cover other
areas of operations. Accordingly, a corporate audit unit has been approved
by the NEB Board and its establishment is awaiting the approval of the
Public Services Department.



- 12 -
Taxation
2.14      NEB has been exempted since January 1980 from payment of corporate
taxes, development tax and customs duties.
Billing and Collections
2.15      Bills are prepared monthly by district offices.  In all districts
the meter readers themselves prepare bills on-the-spot and hand them to
customers. This procedure, although placing some burden on the internal
control, accounts for the comparatively low level of receivables outstanding
(41 days at the end of FY80). Collections are made through district
offices, post offices and collection agents. Customers are required to
maintain a guarantee deposit equivalent to 60 days of consumption.
Dividends
2.16      NEB pays dividends to the Government on the equity invested.  The
amount paid is decided every year by the Board of Directors. The
Electricity Act sets a limit of 6% on NEB-s equity as the maximum dividend
payout.
Insurance
2.17      Since 1964 NEB has retained a firm responsible for providing
advice on risk management. As a result NEB has a mixture of self-insurance
for minor risks and insurance policies for major ones. Every year a
detailed review is undertaken to ensure proper coverage.
Industrial Investment
2.18      NEB has a 60% investment participation in two factories, one
produces cables and the other transformers. NEB is now organizing a meter
factory in which it would have similar participation. To avoid over-
stretching of NEB's cash resources, previous loans to NEB include a covenant
that limits investment in industrial activities to a maximum of 1% of its
gross fixed assets as revalued each year. This covenant will be repeated in
this loan.

3. THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
Historical Trend
3.01      NEB's sales of electricity have grown at an annual average rate of
12.8% in the ten year period 1970-80. During the period, the share of
industrial consumption, including mining, has been maintained at about
40-42%; and the share of commercial load has remained around 30%.
Residential consumption has grown steadily from about 12% to 16% of the
total sales (Annex 3). The growth trend has been stable and reasonably
predictable in the short term.
Load Forecasts
3.02      NEB regularly conducts load forecasting studies to determine
short-term (5 years) as well as long term (20 years) forecasts. Short-term
forecasts are based on time series analysis of historical data for the
period 1969-80 and also includes provision for extension of service areas as
well as the provision for "step input" loads. It segregates regional
distribution of demand to permit transmission system planning.
3.03      Regression analysis is used to derive long-term forecasts of
energy generation, utilizing economic and demographic parameters and
historical data for the past 15 years to derive the relationships. The
forecasts up to the year 2000 on the basis of such an analysis show the
growth rate to lie between a low of 8.7% and a high of 10.4% p.a. NEB has
accepted a mean of 9.3% growth rate for long-range planning, which is
reasonable. NEB proposes to improve its forecasting capability for which
a special working group has been set up with representatives from EPU
and other ministries. The group will endeavor to use supply side forecasts
for synthesizing the power demand and also study the long range effect of
Government action on conservation and oil substitution measures on the power
demand.
3.04      A combination of the short-term and the long-term forecasts
results in the following demand projections for electricity generation in
the NEB system.

/a Actuals.
3.05      These forecasts are at present used for determining the long-range
planning of the generation program. However, NEB proposes to review and up-
date the forecasts every year.
3.06      Annex 3 shows the sales of NEB by category, since 1969 as well as
projections up to 1990.
Present Generating Capacity
3.07      NEB-s present installed capacity is about 2,168 MW consisting of 28%
hydro, 61% central steam stations, 6% diesel and 5% gas turbines (para. 1.19,
Table 1.1), the latter three categories using liquid petroleum fuels. Hydro
stations produced about 14% of the electricity, but a major share of some 86%
is produced by petroleum fuels (para. 1.20, Table 1.2).
Committed Generation Projects
3.08      NEB expects to commission about 2,040 MW of additional generating
capacity by the end of 1985, through projects under different stages of
implementation. These consist of Bersia, Kennering and Kenyir hydro stations
(592 MW), Pasir Gudang and Port Klang oil-fired thermal stations (840 MW),
Connaught Bridge Gas Turbine Station (160 MW) and Paka combined cycle thermal
station (450 MW). Annex 4 shows the sequence of commissioning of these
projects. Annex 5 graphically shows the projected growth of the peak demand,
and the installed capacity for the period 1981-86, from which it may be
observed that the installed capacity and reserve are expected to be critical
in the period 1982-85, but will become adequate in 1986, if the new plants are
commissioned as scheduled. Annex 6 gives the system energy capability for
each year during the period, which shows adequacy of energy capability.

Long Range Generation Program
3.09      The Government is anxious to reduce the dependence of electricity
generation on fuel oil, which will still be the major fuel for power
generation up to 1985. Several options are under consideration. These
include expansion of the Paka combined-cycle thermal plant, using offshore
gas, to 900 MW or higher; piping of gas from the east coast to the west coast
to support gas-fired thermal generation; installing coal-fired thermal units
at Port Klang and/or developing other sites for coal-fired stations;
accelerating development of hydro schemes on Peninsular Malaysia including Ulu
Trengganu (200 MW), Pergau (100 MW), Lebir (50 MW), and Tembeling (110 MW);
developing of large hydro capacity in Sarawak and transmission of electricity
to Western Malaysia, over 1,400 km away, including about 600 km of submarine
transmission. Investigations by a group of German and Swiss consulting
engineering companies (SAMA Consortium) under a technical assistance program
by the German Agency for Technical Development (GTZ), which were completed in
April 1981, have shown that about 1,500 MW of baseload hydro-energy can be
economically supplied to Western Malaysia by hydro projects in Sarawak in
10-12 years. Detailed feasibility studies are proposed by the same consortium
of consultants.
3.10      Formulation of a long-range power development program is, therefore,
a complex exercise dependent on policy decisions about gas utilization (para.
1.03), suitability of local coal for power generation or use of imported coal
(para. 1.06) and development of mining and/or other infrastructure for coal
handling and transportation as well as investigation of suitable sites for
coal-fired thermal stations, feasibility studies for hydro schemes, and
consideration of nuclear options as well. During the appraisal of this
project, NFB requested Bank assistance to finance a study to prepare the
power development strategy for the next 20 years. They also requested
assistance for financing another study for coal utilization for power
generation which will address various issues, e.g. suitable sites, infrastruc-
ture needs, environmental safeguards, coal purchase strategy, etc. The Bank
has agreed to finance both these studies using savings from the Ninth Power
Loan (1808-MA). The Terms of Reference for the studies were cleared with the
Bank and consultants have been appointed for the coal utilization study.
3.11      Pending the formulation of the long-term development strategy, the
Government has decided to permit NEB to go ahead with the expansion of the
Paka gas-fired combined cycle station to 900 MW. Also a decision to proceed
with Ulu Trengganu hydro scheme has been taken. Feasibility studies for the
Pergau and Tembeling hydro schemes are in progress.
3.12      NEB has in-house capability for determining the least cost sequence
of installation of generating plant, using the WASP program and regularly
conducts such studies. The program under implementation up to 1986 is the
least cost alternative. The expansion of Paka and the commissioning of



- 16 -
Ulu Trengganu hydro plant are justified in 1987 and Commissioning of the
Pergau hydro plant in 1988. The Government also decided to accelerate the
installation of coal-fired units 3 and 4 (300 MW each) at Port Klang to reduce
dependence on oil for electricity generation. NEB has included them in its
investment program and appointed consultants for the engineering.
Transmission
3.13      Transmission development studies were carried out by Preece Cardew
and Rider, consultants in 1976 and 1977 and these are reviewed and updated by
NEB. Major transmission program up to 1985-86 consists of constructing
275 kV transmission backbone system to integrate all generating facilities on
Peninsular Malaysia and also to facilitate regional development and accelerate
rural electrification program for the east coast, which has not, hitherto,
been served by the grid.
3.14      Major 275 kV transmission lines included in the program are as
follows (Map IBRD 16192):
(a)  Prai-Temangor (117 km);
(b)  Temangor-Tanah Merah (115 km);
(c)  Kuala Lumpur - Port Klang (32 km);
(d)  Kuala Lumpur - Kg. Awah (138 km);
(e) Kg. Awah - Paka (201 km);
(f)  Paka - Kenyir (110 km);
(g)  Kenyir - Tanah Merah (169 km); and
(h)  Rawang - Chendriang (151 km).
All these lines, except the Kenyir-Tanah Merah line, are under different
stages of implementation. The proposed project includes Kenyir-Tanah Merah
line.
3.15      Major 132 kV lines in the program up to 1985-86 are as follows:
(a) Tanah-Merah - Kota Baharu (in Kelantan);
(b) Tanah-Merah - Kaula Krai (in Kelantan);



- 17 -
(c) Tanah-Merah - Gong Kedak (in Kelantan);
(d)  Kenyir-Kuala Trengganu - Gong Badak (in Trengganu);
(e)  Paka - Kemanan - Tg. Gelang (in Trengganu);
(f)  Paka - Dungun (in Trengganu);
(g)  Paka - Durian Mas (in Trengganu);
(h)  Kamaman - Ayer Puteh (in Trengganu);
(i)  Kg. Awah - Bera-Baru - Bandar Muadzam Shah (in Pahang); and
(j)  Gurun - Jiniang (in Kedah).
The proposed project includes items (b), (d), (h) and (j). These lines along
with the associated substations will provide grid power for supporting the
urban and rural electrification programs in these relatively less developed
states.
Distribution
3.16      For administrative convenience, NEB has divided Peninsular Malaysia
into 25 districts, each headed by a District Manager (DM) with complete
responsibility for subtransmission, distribution, sales and consumer liaison.
Each district is also responsible for planning and implementing expansion of
the distribution network. Since the implementation time for most of the
distribution extension schemes is less than one year, normally such planning
is formalized only one year ahead, for inclusion in NEB's capital expenditure
budget. However, conceptual planning for the next three to four years is
carried out at the district level. Recently, NEB has taken two steps to
provide a longer timeframe for distribution planning. One, the distribution
division at headquarters has been made responsible for coordination of
distribution planning. Two, it has appointed a firm of local consulting
engineers, Tenaga Ewbank Perunding, to prepare a ten-year perspective
development plan for distribution facilities in each state. For example,
these consultants have studied the optimum strategy for extending power supply
facilities to central Kedah state. The present project includes financing of
the 33 kV infrastructure subtransmission in Kedah (para. 4.11), based on these
studies.
Rural Electrification
3.17      In Malaysia, an urban area is defined as a gazetted controlled area
that has a population of 10,000 or more. Therefore, rural electrification
(RE) projects are defined as projects which supply electricity to areas
outside the urban areas. In 1980, there were 73 urban areas in Peninsular



- 18 -
Malaysia, having about 34% of the total population. Wihile separate statistics
of the degree of electrification in urban and rural areas are not available,
it is estimated that by the end of 1980 about 85% of the urban households and
55% of the rural households had electricity.
3.18      The degree of electricity in different states varies considerably,
the Western states in the Peninsula generally have a much higher degree of
electrification than the eastern states (para. 1.23 and Annex 1). Pahang,
Kelantan, Kedah, Trengganu and Johor are the least electrified states, with
only 40 to 55% of households having electricity. The degree of electrifica-
tion in rural areas is considerably lower than above; for example, in Kedah,
the coastal area has about 90% electrification but in the noncoastal areas,
the electrification is only about 10%. Similar situations exist in other
states also.
3.19      The rural electrification activities in Malaysia are carried out
through two types of programs. The first is the normal distribution
expansion program of NEB which is funded by NEB and includes schemes which
are financially viable (RE-l). These are implemented by the Distribution
Department through District Managers. The second is the rural electrification
program fully or partially funded by the Government which is designed to
accelerate rural electrification activities (RE-2). This program includes
schemes primarily originating from local and provincial authorities who
interact with NEB's District Managers and the rural electrification
department. The program is approved by the Government on the basis of NEB's
recommendations. The selection criteria for inclusion of projects in this
program are social and technical, e.g., (a) equitable distribution of schemes
among states so that the less developed states get a higher allocation, (b)
proximity of the area to other infrastructure facilities, (c) ease of
implementation from the point of view of distance from the grid, and (d) cost
per consumer connected. These criteria relate to equity and cost but benefit
analysis is not customary. This program is mainly implemented by the Rural
Electrification Department of the NEB.
3.20      Annex 7 presents a summary of the rural electrification program
expected to be implemented during the Fourth Malaysia Plan (1981-85). The
program envisages an investment of M$868 million (US$377 million) and will
result in electricity supply to about 400,000 residential consumers. Current
projections show that the level of electrification in rural Malaysia will
reach 75% by 1990, 85% by 1995 and 95% by the year 2000.
Minihydro
3.21      Its rugged topography and heavy rainfall makes Peninsular Malaysia
particularly attractive for the development of minihydro schemes. The
definition of minihydro is taken to be those stations which have output
between 50 kW and 1,000 kW with heads varying from low (2-15 m), medium
(15-70 m) to high (above 70 m). Schemes with lower or higher output are also
considered depending on their merits.



- 19 -
3.22      The Government has assigned a high priority to the development of
the minihydro resources, perceiving them as an economical option for providing
electrical energy to rural areas for improving the quality of life and
promoting development. The NEB has been made responsible for the minihydro
development in Peninsular Malaysia.
3.23      A pilot program to implement six minihydro schemes was formulated to
provide NEB with experience to study feasibility of schemes and select appro-
priate technology. Equipment for these schemes was purchased by negotiations
with suppliers in countries having experience in minihydro development,
including China, India, Japan, Germany and Canada. The program was extended
to the 22 schemes now in progress. The Intermediate Technology Development
Group of the UK provided advice and training of personnel for undertaking this
program.
3.24      To accelerate the minihydro program, the Government employed three
consulting firms in 1980, to explore minihydro potential in the country and
propose about 100 viable schemes. The consultants were assigned responsibi-
lity for investigations in different regions as follows:
Shawinigan Engineering, Canada - Western Peninsular Malaysia
Stanley Consultants, USA        - Eastern Peninsular Malaysia
Enex Consultants, New Zealand  - Sarawak & Sabah.
The consultancy contracts are with the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) in the
Prime Minister's Office, with the NEB having the coordination role for all
technical aspects. The financing is from the government funds.
3.25      For financing the implementation of the schemes, the Government has
requested ADB and World Bank participation for the Western and Eastern parts
of the Peninsula, respectively. Therefore, the proposed project includes
minihydro projects in the eastern states of Peninsular Malaysia (para. 4.13).
3.26      In order to implement the minihydro schemes, and continue further
investigations for future programs, the NEB has set up a Minihydro Deparment
(para. 4.20).

4. THE PROJECT
Objectives
4.01      The objective of this operation is to support NEB's efforts to bring
the benefits of electrification to those provinces now having a low degree of
electrification. By expanding the Peninsular grid transmission to the eastern
provinces NEB is establishing the foundation for subsequent electrification
which will support the development of local manufacturing and economic
activities. The project will assist the Government in providing a distribu-
tion network to rural households in villages which have not previously had
access to electricity. Also minihydro projects will be constructed in the
eastern states of Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang and Johor to provide electricity
in rural areas.
Project Description
4.02      This project will embrace most of the Government-s rural electrifi-
cation program in the less developed states of Trengganu, Kelantan, Kedah and
Pahang in Peninsular Malaysia during the time period from 1983 to 1985.
4.03      The project will consist of the following elements:
(a)  a 275 kV transmission line from Kenyir (Trengganu) to Tanah Merah
(Kelantan).
(b)  132 kV transmission lines and stepdown substations as follows:
(i) Tanah Merah-Kuala Krai with substation at Kuala Krai
(Kelantan).
(ii) Kenyir-Kuala Trengganu-Gong Badak with substations at
Kuala Trengganu and Gong Badak (Trengganu).
(iii) Gurun-Jiniang (Kedah) with substation at Jiniang.
(iv) Kemaman-Ayer Puteh (Pahang).
(c) Rural Electrification schemes in the States of Kedah, Kelantan,
Trengganu and Pahang.



- 21 -
(d) Minihydro schemes in Trengganu, Kelantan, Pahang and
Johore.
(e) Consulting services.
Transmission Lines and Substations
4.04      The 275 kV transmission line from Kenyir to Tanah Merah (169 km)
will be a double circuit line with twin ACSR conductors (300 sq mm). It will
complete the 275 kV transmission ring in Peninsular Malaysia (see Map IBRD
16192), permitting integrated operation of the proposed generating facilities
on the east coast (Paka, Kenyir, Ulu Trengganu) with the major generating
facilities in the west. 275 kV substations at Kenyir and Tanah Merah are
already under construction. The project provides for additional switching and
control equipment and communication facilities.
4.05      All 132 kV lines included in the Project are radial lines, needed to
transmit power from the 275 kV grid to establish main grid input points for
the subtransmission and distribution network (see Map IBRD 16192). The
physical particulars of the 132 kV lines are given in the table below.

Rural Electrification
4.07      The five year program for the period 1981-85 for rural
electrification in Peninsular Malaysia envisages an investment M$868 million
(para. 3.20 and Annex 7). The allocation of resources among the states for
the Government financed RE-2 Drogram is made on the basis of several criteria
(para. 3.19), including the principle of equity which implies that the lesser
electrified states get a larger allocation. On the other hand the NEBfinanced
projects (RE-1) are judged purely on the basis of financial viability. The
allocation in different states in the period 1981-85 is as follows:



- 23 -
Allocation (M$ x 106)
State                        RE-2                RE-1

Total                  524.9              342.7
4.08      The five-year program for rural electrification in the states of
Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu and Pahang is summarized in Annex 8. The total
investment is estimated to be M$538 million, with RE-1 projects accounting
for M$204 million and RE-2 projects M$334 million. About 204,000 new
consumers will be connected, including about 188,000 households.
4.09      Annex 9 summarizes the three year time slice (1983-85) of this
program which is included in this project. This shows that the project is
expected to result in the electrification of rural households in the four
states as follows:
Households proposed
State                          to be electrified
Kedah                                32,178
Kelantan                             40,220

4.10      The main components of the rural electrification program included
in the project are as follows:
Item                                           Unit                Quantity

- 25 -
4.11      The total program consists of a large number of subprojects in each
state. However, two large subprojects which deserve special mention are:
(a) the central Kedah Valley 33 kV system development project, which
consists of construction of about 147 km of 33 kV overhead lines
and 33 kV/11 kV substations at five locations, viz. Sg. Tieng,
Naka, Kuala Nerang, Sik and Baling to create infrastructure for
electrification in Kedah state. This 33 kV backbone transmission
network will be fed by the 132 kV extension from Gurun to Jiniang
(para. 4.05). Consultants have been appointed for the engineering
and construction management of this subproject (M/S Tenaga
Ewbank of Malaysia).
(b) the electrification of the Jenka Triangle area in Pahang State, in
the districts of Temerloh and Jerantut, covering an area of about
300,000 acres. The area has 29 FELDA (land development) schemes
with about 100,000 acres of oil palm land and 60,000 acres of
rubber plantations. NEB has recently established 132 kV/11 kV
stepdown substations at Bandar Pusat and Kg. Awah from which
supply will be extended to about 14,000 households in the area.
Social and Economic Profile
4.12      Annex 10 gives the basic statistical profiles of kampungs (tradi-
tional villages) in these four states and also in the whole of peninsular
Malaysia. The total population in these states is 3.29 million which is 29.6%
of the total in the peninsula. Nearly 65% of the population live in kampungs;
the extent of electrification is 44% in Pahang, 41% in Trengganu, 21% in
Kelantan and 16.4% in Kedah. Over 60% of the families in kampungs in
Trengganu, Kedah and Kelantan have a family income of under M$250 per month.
The main activities in kampungs are based on forestry, agriculture (including
paddy, rubber, palm oil), fishing and cottage industries.   For every 1,000
households there are about 25 commercial establishments (mainly shops) and
about 3 to 4 small industrial units.
Minihydro
4.13      Minihydro projects will include those schemes in the eastern states
of peninsular Malaysia which are found technically feasible and economically
justifiable. During the appraisal and negotiations, selection criteria were
agreed for those schemes to be financed by the proposed Bank loan (para 4.14).
The consultants will carry out detailed design and benefit/cost analysis of
each scheme.



- 26 -
4.14      The minihydro schemes will be of three types, viz:  (a) those which
will be connected to the grid immediately on commissioning; (b) those which
are remote from the grid but will replace existing diesel generation; and
(c) those which will serve isolated communities not likely to have supply from
other sources in the near future. The justification for implementing schemes
in the first category will be based on their being able to provide energy at a
lower cost than the long-run marginal cost of supply from the grid.   The
evaluation of benefits from the second category of schemes will be based on
cost savings due to the displacement of diesel generation.  For the third
category of schemes, the justification will be based on the direct and surplus
benefits arising out of the use of electricity by the consumers in the areas
served by the schemes. They will also have to be proven to be the least cost
alternatives for electricity supply. The schemes having an internal economic
rate of return (IERR) of at least 10%, will be considered acceptable for Bank
financing under this project.
4.15      Investigation so far shows that those schemes in the first category,
i.e., those which can be connected to the grid immediately on completion, have
comparatively high benefit/cost ratios since the plants can produce and
deliver energy to the grid at high load factors of operation, without being
constrained by the pattern of demand, which would be the case in the schemes
in the second and the third categories. Also, it is found that the grid will
extend to most of the remote schemes, by 1990. Therefore, the optimal design
of such schemes will take into account the possibility of the grid tie, which
will permit the use of otherwise surplus energy.
4.16      The consultants identified 214 potential sites in the states of
Kelantan, Trengganu, Pahang and Johor on the basis of a desk study of topo-
graphical maps, hydrological data and other available information. Of these
164 sites were considered viable for further study. Reconnaissance visits
made to these sites showed that 115 sites were not suitable for development
due to various reasons, such as difficulty of access, lack of market in the
vicinity, excessive civil works cost, etc. Further detailed investigation
resulted in the rejection of four more sites on technical grounds, leaving
45 sites which were evaluated in detail for plant size, layout, market, cost,
benefit, etc. resulting in 41 feasible sites distributed as follows:

4.17       Annex 11 gives a summary of the capacity, energy capability and
preliminary cost estimate for these sites. The interim report from the
consultants which will cover details of all investigations and studies, is
expected to be available in May 1982. The Government has appointed a techni-
cal evaluation committee to scrutinize data submitted by the consultants in
the course of their investigation and progressively give clearance to them for
further detailed engineering and design for promising sites. The committee
has cleared the above schemes for further work. It is proposed that the Bank
staff will review a few schemes in detail with NEB and EPU staff and if
satisfied, will delegate the selection of other schemes to the committee.
Cost Estimate
4.18       Annex 12, Tables 1, 2 and 3, give the detailed cost estimates for
the 275 kV transmission line, 132 kV transmission lines and substations and
the rural electrification projects in the states of Kedah, Kelantan, Trengganu
and Pahang. The cost estimates for the minihydro schemes are based on the
preliminary studies which will be refined at the detailed engineering stage.
4.19       Table 4.1 below gives a summary of the project cost estimate.  All
costs are based on March 1982 prices. The price contingencies are worked out
on the basis of the following inflation factors, for local and foreign costs:
8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983-85, and 6% p.a. thereafter. The costs are net
of taxes and duties since the NEB is exempt from them.

Engineering and Construction
4.20      Merz and McLellan Consulting Engineers (MM) of the UK, along with
the local consulting firm of Tahir Wong, were appointed consultants by the NEB
for the engineering and construction supervision of the 275 kV transmission
line, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank (para 4.21). The
engineering and construction of the 132 kV lines and substations will be
carried out by NEB's transmission department which has adequate experience in
such works. The local consulting firm of Tenaga Ewbank Perunding will be
responsible for the engineering and construction supervision of the Central
Kedah Valley 33 kV system development projects. Other components of the rural
electrification projects will be carried out by the respective departments of
NEB, viz. the rural electrification department, the distribution department



- 29 -
and the NEB District Manager's organization in the states. Stanley Consul-
tants, Inc. of the USA are responsible for the investigation and engineering
of minihydro schemes up to the point of the preparation of tender documents.
NEB has established a minihydro department for the implementation of the
minihydro schemes. The department is placed under the Chief Engineer (Rural
Electrification) reporting directly to the General Manager. An adequate
organization chart has been approved and recruitment is in progress. Also
training of the staff is underway through technology transfer program included
in consulting services contracts. It is expected that this department will be
able to take over the responsibility for the implementation of the minihydro
projects. However, it was agreed that advisory services from consultants will
be sought in various areas like vendor selection, construction supervision,
etc., according to the terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
4.21      The consulting services for 275 kV line would amount to about
68 man-months of which 31 man-months will be provided by the local consul-
tants. MM's man-month rate for the head office services is about E 3,010
($6,000). The man-month cost for the local consultant is M$4,900 (US$2,130).
The man-month cost including travel, subsistence and other direct reimbursible
expenses works out to US$10,000 equivalent. The services of Stanley
Consultants, Inc. for minihydro work and Tenaga Ewbank for the Kedah Valley 33
kV system development are not being financed by the Bank. Estimation for
further consulting services for the minihydro projects is based on a man-month
cost of $10,000.
Procurement
4.22      The Bank loan would be used to finance foreign cost of equipment and
services procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
The contracts will be packaged as follows: The construction of the 275 kV and
132 kV lines will be executed by contracts covering supply and erection. The
following materials for the rural electrification projects will be procured by
ICB procedures following Bank guidelines: Aluminum alloy conductors and
accessories, steel poles, cross arms and accessories, 11 kV and 33 kV U. G.
cables, insulators, 11 kV and 33 kV switchgear, 33/11 kV transformers and
energy meters. Procurement of the distribution materials will be carried out
in two or three lots.
4.23      For the procurement of equipment for the minihydro plants, the
turbine-generator and station equipment will be divided into three categories
viz high head, medium head and low head plants. Bidders will be free to bid
for any one or all of these. Since the number of high head plants is large,
flexibility will be provided in the tenders to divide this into two parts,
i.e. a supplier may quote for half the number, at his option. Such a strategy
will permit smaller manufacturers to tender without violating the time
constraint for delivery. It is proposed to carry out prequalification of
suppliers for the electrical and mechanical equipment.
4.24      All bidding packages for goods and services estimated to cost over
US$500,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procure-
ment documentation, covering all foreseen contracts.



- 30 -
Implementation Schedule
4.25       Annex 13 gives the implementation schedules for the various elements
of the project. The construction of the 275 kV line and 132 kV lines and
substations is expected to be completed by December 1985, and the minihydro
projects by June 1986. The rural electrification program extends up to
December 1985.
Financing Plan
4.26      The following financing plan is proposed for the project:
Source                     Foreign    Local    Total
IBRD                         86.3        -        86.3
Supplier's Credit            15.5       10.0      25.5
Commercial banks             51.7        -        51.7
NEB's resources               -         19.7      19.7
Government                    -        132.3    132.3
Total                  153.5      162.0    315.5
NEB will borrow from commercial banks with the guarantee of the Government.
Supplier-s credit is proposed for financing the 275 kV transmission line
construction. The Bank loan, which will financing about 27% of the project
cost, will be used to finance the foreign costs of 132 kV lines and sub-
stations, minihydro projects, selected distribution equipment and consulting
services.
Disbursement
4.27       The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials, 100% of local
expenditures exfactory of locally manufactured items and 70% of the cost of
imported items procured locally; and (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for
consultants- services. No disbursement will be made for expenditures prior
to the loan signing.
4.28      Annex 14 gives the disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan
based on the implementation schedule. The regional and the IBRD disbursement
profiles for loans for transmission and distribution projects are also shown
in the annex which show that the disbursement schedule for the project is
generally in line with them in the first four years. Disbursements are
expected to be completed by December 1986.

Improvement of Rural Electrification Program
4.29      It has been agreed that several measures will be introduced to
improve the efficiency of the rural electrification program which include:
(i) strengthening the planning of the rural electrification program,
(ii) designing and implementing an information system which will enable
evaluation of the rural electrification program already implemented to provide
feedback for improving future planning, (iii) examining the design standards
for rural distribution to achieve cost reduction without reducing safety and
reliability standards below aceptable limits, and (iv) introducing measures
to ensure that productive uses of electricity are encouraged in the Government
financed rural electrification schemes. NEB has agreed to prepare detailed
proposals and implementation programs for these, acceptable to the Bank by
September 1, 1982 and implement them by September 1, 1983.
Ecology
4.30      Transmission and distribution projects will be designed and carried
out in accordance with the current technological practices and will cause
minimum disturbance to the environment. No safety hazards are foreseen. The
minihydro projects will also be engineered and implemented to confine adverse
ecological effects to a minimum. Since all minihydro schemes will be of the
run-of-the-river type without storage, the environmental problems will be
mainly concerned with the forest clearance for access roads and small areas
for powerhouse construction. NEB proposes to closely coordinate these
activities with the Ministry for Land Development and the state agencies
concerned with agriculture and forestry.
5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
5.01      Detailed financial statements and performance indicators for fiscal
years 1976 through 1980 are presented in Annex 15. During this period, as
shown in Table 5.1, the growth rate of operating costs exceeded that of
revenues. In spite of this, NEB generated profits every year until 1979 and
managed to maintain a rate of return on net revalued assets varying between
5.0% and 7.5%.
5.02      FY80 was the first year in NEB's history in which it incurred an
operating loss. During that year NEB had to face steep increases in fuel
costs. The Government allowed an increase in tariffs by 13.2% only in October
1979. A further increase of 51.6% in December 1980 was permitted after the
close of FY80. As a result, NEB could not comply with the 8% rate of return
on revalued fixed assets covenanted for FY80 under Loan 1443-MA.

5.03      The effect of the increased operating costs mentioned in para. 5.01
is reflected in a decline in the NEB's internal cash generation to finance
capital expenditures. This is shown in Table 5.2. From a participation of
about 40% in FY76 through FY78, internally generated funds dropped to 20% in
FY80. The resulting gap was covered by equity increases.

5.04      As shown in Table 5.3, NEB-s capital structure remains sound.
Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 46% at the end of
FY80. Similarly, NEB's liquidity position improved substantially because of
Government equity contributions of M$362 million (US$160 million) during
FY79 and FY80. Net working capital increased from a negative figure in FY76
and FY77 to a positive M$71 million in FY80.

Present Financial Position
5.05      During FY81 NEB experienced a substantial reduction in its sales
growth rate./l This was due mainly to delays in the completion of the
transmission line from Prai to the load center of Kuala Lumpur and the need
to put Port Dickson Thermal plant out of service for unscheduled maintenance.
Additionally, it appears that the steep tariff increase implemented in
December 1980 triggered electricity conservation actions by the consumers.
As a consequence NEB's rate of return on revalued assets was 6.4% in FY81 and
the self-financing ratio (SFR) was 10.2%, compared to 25% covenanted under
/1 Sales increase in FY81 was 7.4% compared to 11.1% in FY80.



- 34 -
Loan 1808-MA for that year. This low SFR is due to reduced sales volume, as
explained above, larger capital development expenditure and a substantial
increase in working capital. During FY81 NEB's financial position was
reinforced with a M$300 million (US$133 million) equity contribution received
from the Government to cover revenue foregone in FY80 because of delays in
approving NEB's tariff increases. At the end of FY81 NEB's long-term debt
as a percentage of total capitalization was 42% and its current ratio was 1.4.
Future Profitability
5.06      Detailed financial projections and monitoring indicators are
presented in Annex 16 and the assumptions incorporated in these forecasts
are shown in Annex 17. A summary of the projected income statements for
FY82-86 is presented in Table 5.4. Under the assumptions followed, NEB-s
rate of return on net revalued fixed assets is expected to exceed 7% every
year after FY83. This is adequate considering that NEB-s cash requirements
are met and that the average rate base is projected to increase more than
three-and-a-half times between FY81 and FY86. The operating ratio is also
expected to improve slightly during that period.

Tariffs
5.07      Although NEB has the legal power to adjust its tariffs when
required, in practice the Government determines the amount and timing of
tariff increases. In 1975 an automatic fuel cost variation charge was



- 35 -
introduced but it was abolished at the time of the last tariff increase of
about 52% in December 1980 when the Government decided that the electricity
tariffs would normally be revised only once a year to avoid cost
uncertainties for industrial consumers and to help control inflationary
pressures. After that increase, NEB's average tariff of M21.9 (US9.5)
became one of the highest in the region compared to US7.9 in Thailand,
US06.8 in Indonesia, US8.4 in Singapore, and USo7.8 in Philippines. It may
be noted that the NEB pays for the fuel oil used for power generation at the
international price (M$520 per ton). Also recent calculation (May-81) based
on the NEB's investment program for the period 1981-86 for generation,
transmission and distribution indicated the average long-run marginal cost
of supply to be about Ml9.0 per kWh, which is lower than the current tariff
level.
5.08      Under Loan 1808-MA NEB agreed to (a) exchange views with the Bank
on any proposed changes on its tariff structure; and (b) review with the
Government at least three months before the end of each year the measures
necessary for NEB to comply with the covenanted self-financing ratios. It
was agreed to continue this covenant. In addition, during negotiations the
following procedure for tariff reviews was agreed with the Government:
(a) NEB's tarriffs will be normally reviewed and revised annually
at about the beginning of its fiscal year taking into
account (i) the increases in operating costs including increases
in fuel prices in the 12 months which are not reflected in its
electricity tariffs; (ii) the best estimates of such increases in
the following 12 months; and (iii) the need to generate revenues
to meet the agreed self-financing percentages.
(b) Should the actual increases in fuel prices during a year be
substantially greater than the best estimates assumed in (ii) of
(a) above for that year, the Government will take appropriate
interim measures as necessary.
(c) If NEB's financial results for a year indicate that it will not
achieve the agreed self-financing percentages in that year (Year
A), then the tariffs for the immediately succeeding year (Year B)
will be set at a level which will permit NEB to recover in
Year B the shortfall in the agreed self-financing percentages for
Year A.
5.09      Projected tariffs for the period FY82-86 are presented in Table 5.4.
It is assumed that during that period tariff increases will be almost entirely
limited to adjustments for inflation.

Financing of Development Program
5.10      A financing plan for the period FY83 through FY87 is presented in
Table 5.5. According to this plan, the NEB will contribute about 25% from
internally generated funds to its total financial requirements which is
adequate considering NEB's large development Program (para. 5.12). It has
been assumed that after FY82 Government equity contributions will be limited
to the reimbursement of capital expenditures for rural electrification.

of financing including the Overseas Economic Corporation Fund (Japan), the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (UK), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development, the Asian Development Bank and several international and local
commercial banks. It is therefore considered that the NEB will have no
difficulty in raising the funds required to finance its development program.
In addition, during negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government
will provide adequate funds to help finance the NEB's development program if
the need arises.

Self-Financing Ratio
5.12      NEB recently revised its investment program for FY82 through FY85.
The updated program is more than two and a half times the program projected
for the same period at the time of appraising the Power IX project in 1978.
This increase is largely due to updating of construction cost and more capital
intensive coal-fired thermal schemes now proposed. NEB's contribution to
construction in each year of the forecast period, using this revised
investment program, is analyzed in Annex 18. That analysis shows that, given
the tariff level assumed, NEB will attain the self-financing ratios (SFRs)
shown in Table 5.6. That table also presents the SFRs previously agreed under
Loan 1808-MA and those agreed during negotiations. The new SFRB have been set
so that adequate flexibility is preserved. To maintain the previously agreed
SFRs, given the substantially higher projected investment, would result in
unrealistic tariff increases. Currently NEB's tariffs exceed the long-run
marginal cost and are higher than those of neighboring countries (para.
5.07). The projected SFRs are expected to result in rates of return on net
revalued fixed assets in excess of 7.0% after FY83 (Table 5.4) which is a
satisfactory performance.

Liquidity Position
5.13      NEB's net working capital is expected to increase in the future; the
current ratio as projected will remain above 1.3 from FY82 through FY88.
Under Loan 1808-MA it was agreed that NEB would limit its current liabilities
to one-third of its cash operating expenses. NEB has managed to reduce such
ratio from 42% in FY78 to 32% in FY80. It is now considered that at this
stage a current ratio covenant is more appropriate to monitor NEB-s liquidity
position. Such covenant, agreed during negotiations, requires that NEB's
current ratio should be not less than 1.1 at any given time.
Debt Control
5.14      Under the assumptions followed, the debt service coverage ratio is
expected to exceed 1.8 each year during the period FY82 through FY88. NEB's
capital structure is also expected to remain sound. Its long-term debt will
not exceed 60% of the total capital employed. Previous loan agreements
require NEB to limit its long-term debt to 60% of the sum of equity and debt.
This test will be continued under this loan.

6. JUSTIFICATION
275 kV Transmission
6.01      The need for the transmission line between Kenyir and Tanah Merah is
justified by technical studies of the system transmission expansion. The
construction of the line will permit full utilization of the output from
Kenyir Hydroelectric plant and the Paka combined-cycle,gas-fired thermal
plant, both scheduled for completion by 1985. Selection of 275 kV as the grid
voltage has been justified by long-range studies and a number of 275 kV lines
have been constructed or are under construction (para. 3.14). In the case of
the Kenyir-Tanah Merah line, it was established that the construction of a
275 kV line would be a lower cost alternative than the construction of 132 kV
lines, with the necessary power transfer capacity.
132 kV Lines and Substations
6.02      The 132 kV lines and substations included in the project are
necessary for extending the grid supply to areas with existing and potential
demand. Each proposal has been studied in comparison with two other alter-
natives, viz. (a) establishing or augmenting diesel generating stations to
meet the demand and (b) carrying out the extension by 33 kV or 11 kV lines.
In all cases the proposed alternative has been demonstrated to be the least
cost solution.
Minihydro Schemes
6.03      Each minihydro scheme financed by the Bank Loan will be subjected to
selection criteria (para. 4.14) which will ensure that the investment would
have an acceptable internal economic rate of return (IERR).
Rural Electrification
6.04      Poverty eradication is a major objective of Malaysia's development
effort. The Government has a two-pronged approach to the problem, namely:
(a)  job creation, particularly in the modern industrial sector, labor
absorption from low productivity occupations in the rural areas;
and
(b)  productivity improvement, especially of the rural poor.
6.05      The rural electrification program (RE) supports these objectives
by facilitating industrial decentralization and industrial expansion outside
the 70-75 gazetted towns in Peninsular Malaysia. The development plans
greatly emphasize the creation of modern off-farm jobs, accessible to rural



- 39 -
centers. Already, some 76 industrial estates have been established and
energized.
6.06      The program is expected to contribute to the vitalization of
the disadvantaged communities and provide the possibility of using
electricity to improve the productivity of the poor.
6.07      The program consists of:
(a) RE 1, financed by the National Electricity Board (NEB); and
(b)  RE 2, fully or partially funded by the Government on a grant
basis.
The benefits of these schemes are intermixed. Although RE 1 is highly
profitable, a part of its income comes from the infrastructure created under
RE 2: 33/11 kV lines, distribution transformers, etc. This is because RE 2
focuses mainly on project construction and on a limited group of customers,
- those who live in traditional kampungs. Regulations, currently in force,
debar RE 2 managers from connecting medium and large commercial and
industrial loads. But, after the RE 2 network is completed it is taken over
by district managers in charge of RE 1 who then quickly extend their service
to industrial and commercial consumers. Thus the RE 2 program understates
the benefits of investment and the RE 1 program overstates them. Because of
intermixing of benefits separate IERR estimates for each would be
misleading. Also adequate data is not available either on the basis of past
experience or future projections to carry out suitable modifications to the
benefit estimates to attempt realistic segregation. Therefore the IERR has
been calculated for the combined program.
Benefits
6.08      The total benefits due to the sale of electricity to consumers
consist of (a) direct benefits in terms of revenue collected by the NEB
at the prevailing tariffs; and (b) surplus benefits which accrue to the
consumers by either substituting electricity for other forms of energy in
use or by promoting the use of appliances and tools which could not be used
without electricity.
6.09      Identification of consumer surplus is a complex and difficult
task. The Rural Electrification Study for Malaysia by the Middle West
Service Company of the USA in 1978 (para. 1.26) carried out surveys and
conducted interviews to assess these benefits.
Domestic Consumers
6.10      Domestic consumers in Malaysia use electricity for lighting, fans,
ironing, rice cookers, water heaters, televisions and refrigerators. Con-
sumer surplus is derived due to saving in cost compared to other sources of



- 40 -
energy (e.g. kerosene for lighting), greater convenience (e.g. electric iron
vs. charcoal iron) and additional consumption of service (e.g. better quality
and longer lighting hours). Also the consumers' willingness to pay for
appliances like fans, irons, rice cookers and television sets is much greater
than the NEB's tariff due to perceived benefits to the household. Household
surveys also revealed that consumers feel that electricity brings them
benefits in terms of improving their children's education, improving the
security of their kampungs (villages), and many also think that it will
improve their social and economic life.
6.11      The cost saving is most substantial in the case of lighting since
kerosene costs considerably more than electricity. Currently, kerosene costs
M151.0 per liter in Malaysian villages, which in terms of cost per kWh works
out to almost M$1.06. (A kerosene lamp giving light equivalent to a 60 W
incandescent lamp requires one liter of kerosene for eight hours' service).
At offshore prices (Mc70 per liter), the equivalent price would be M$1.45 per
kWh. The estimated savings per household per month are shown in the table
below:
Savings due to Electricity for Lighting
Monthly                                  Monthly
Electricity item                cost M$    Kerosene item                 cost M$

Cost saving = 7.78M$/household/month



- 41 -
6.12      Similar cost savings can not be worked out for fans, cookers, irons,
refrigerators and television sets. For example, charcoal irons may be less
expensive to use but consumers prefer electric irons for their convenience.
Similarly, the decision to use electric rice cookers is also mainly based on
convenience. Fans, refrigerators and television sets are rarely used when
electric supply is not available, but the survey indicated that over 50% of
the households would acquire a television set if electricity was available.
Thus, for these uses, factors such as convenience, better quality of goods and
services, improvement in the quality of life, etc. dictate the choice.
6.13      Additionally, electricity in the household can extend working hours
because of better lighting, lighten household chores due to improved
availability of water supply and a greater ability and willingness to work in
the tropics under electric fans, and increase productivity of the rural work
force due to the introduction of electrically-operated tools and equipment.
If these changes add one extra working manhour per day per family, the gain
would be approximately M$20.0 per month at the current wage rate of M0.90 per
hour.
6.14      The crucial question therefore is "How much are consumers willing to
pay for electricity for the convenience and other advantages?" The answer
partly depends on the income level and the preference function. The per
capita income in Malaysia in 1980 exceeded US$1,600 and is expected to be
US$2,600 a year, in 1980 prices by 1990. Government's development policies
are aimed at reducing income disparities between urban and rural population.
Even in 1978, nearly one-third of the rural households had an annual income of
over M$3,000 per year (Annex 10). Thus rural income levels are substantially
higher than other developing countries like India, Thailand or Indonesia. One
indication of the higher prices that rural households are prepared to pay can
be obtained from the price charged by private licencees, which is M40/kWh, in
the areas where NEB supply is not available. Another instance is the Jenka
Triangle area where a large number of households use small domestic generators
(1 kW to 3 kW range) which cost over M$1.0 per kWh.
6.15      In view of the difficulties in establishing precise values for these
benefits, for the IERR calculations, the benefits for residential consumers
are taken as only (a) revenue to NEB; and (b) kerosene savings.
Commercial Consumers
6.16      A large percentage of commercial consumers in rural areas are shops
and restaurants (coffee shops). Shops usually sell a variety of basic
necessities. Refrigerators are rarely used by these establishments when
electricity is not available. Most of them buy iceblocks from ice factories
located in nearby town centers, a block weighing about 65 kg costs over M$5.0.
Most shops increase their profits by the use of refrigeration. The Middle
West survey showed that the increase in profits range from M$2.0 to M$5.0 per
day for the small shops and to M$10 to M$30 per day for coffee shops.



- 42 -
It therefore appears that from refrigeration alone, the surplus is
considerable. There are other benefits such as to hairdressers, tailors,
local repair shops, etc. Working out the weighted average of the different
types of commercial activities, the surplus benefit ranges from 55% to more
than 100% of the direct benefits. For the IERR calculations, a conservative
average figure of 55% is used for benefit calculation (Total benefit = 1.55 x
current tariff = 37.2 Me/kWh).
Industrial Consumers
6.17       For industrial consumers, the total benefit is equated to the cost
of supply from diesel generators since, if the RE program is held up, the
industry would produce electricity from diesel generators. The diesel
generated electricty price therefore represents the wllingness to pay level.
To be conservative, the cost of diesel generation from large central diesel
stations is used. Annex 19 shows the estimation of diesel generation cost,
which works out to M439.89/kWh in 1981 prices. Sensitivity of IERR to change
in the estimated benefit is also worked out.
IERR Calculations
6.18      Annex 20 shows the analysis of the costs and benefits of the Rural
Electrification program. The IERR for the program works out to be about 26%,
with sensitivities as follows:
Costs                               IERR (%)
Capital cost          +  10%    23

Risks
6.19      There is no unusual risk in a transmission and distribution project
of this type. Minihydro schemes are being investigated in sufficient detail
to reduce uncertainties.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During the negotiations, the following agreements were reached with
the NEB and the Government.
(a) With NEB
(i)  NEB will employ auditors acceptable to the Bank to audit NEB's
accounts and to send audited financial statements and auditor's
reports to the Bank within six months of the end of each
fiscal year (para. 2.12).
(ii)  NEB will limit its industrial investment (para. 2.18).
(iii) NEB will appoint consultants to provide advisory services
for the implementation of the minihydro schemes (4.20).

(i) Government will provide or arrange for adequate funds to
finance NEB's development program, if necessary (para. 5.11).
Recommendations
7.02      With the above agreements, the Project constitutes a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$86.3 million to the NEB including a front end
fee of about US$1.3 Million, for a period of 15 years including a grace
period of three years, with the guarantee of the Government.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
Price Contingencies
1.        The following escalation rates were used both for foreign and
local costs: FY82: 8.5%; FY83 through FY85: 7.5% and FY86 and thereafter
6.0%.
Revenues
2.        Early years load forecast was adjusted downwards to allow for
recovery of the growth slowdown experienced in FY81. As the transmission
line to bring electricity from Prai Thermal Plant to the Kuala Lumpur area
is completed, the currently suppressed demand is expected to be satisfied.
The supply will further improve as several projects are commissioned.
3.        The last tariff increase in December 1980 set the average rate at
MP21.9/Kwh (USc/9.52), higher than the long-run marginal cost of supply
estimated at about Mq19.0 for 1981. Since this tariff level is adequate, it
was considered that additional adjustments were not realistic except in
cases of drastic increases in fuel cost. Accordingly it was assumed that
during the forecast period (FY82-88) NEB's tariff would be adjusted
almost exclusively for inflation.
Fuel Cost
4.        It was assumed that oil prices are going to remain stable through
FY82 and that they will increase 2% in real terms in FY83 and 3% thereafter.
Additionally changes in fuel mix were assumed as Bersia, Kenering and Kenyir
hydroelectric projects are commissioned. Due to the present uncertainties
about pricing of gas and coal, it was assumed conservatively that they would
be priced equivalent to oil.
Capital Expenditure
5.        Investment reflects the latest development program prepared by
NEB, escalated as indicated in para. 1. NEB's development program is
discussed in Chapter III.
Equity
6.        It was assumed that after FY83 the Government will not make any
equity contribution in excess of the reimbursement of capital expenditure
for rural electrification projects.

ANNEX 17
Page 2
Borrowings
7.        Given NEB's previous experience and current opportunities, the
relative participation of different sources in future borrowing was assumed
to be distributed as follows: bilateral and export credits 45%;
multilateral 20%; commercial banks (foreign and domestic) 30% and suppliers
credit 5%. In the past NEB has received bilateral and export credits on
very soft terms (3-1/2 to 4-1/2% p.a.). It was assumed that these loans
will be contracted at 5% p.a. in the future. On the basis that both
international and domestic inflation rates will be about 6% p.a. it was
assumed that annual interest rates would be 10% for multinational loans, 12%
commercial bank loans and 9% suppliers credit. This results in a weighted
average of 8.3% p.a. To be on the conservative side 10% p.a. was used in
the projections.
Notes on Financial Ratios
8.        Self-financing ratio, which measures NEB's contribution from
internally generated funds to its capital investment, is calculated on a
3-year average investment which includes the previous year, the test and the
next following year (see Annex 18).
9.        For the computation of the rate of return on net average fixed
assets, fixed assets, accumulated depreciation and consumers contribution
are revalued using the fixed capital formation deflator published by the
central Bank of Malaysia. For the forecast period the escalation rates
presented in para. 1 were used.
10.       Current Bank overdrafts in the case of NEB are actually revolving
loans contracted at very favorable interest rates (8-1/2-9% p.a.). The
customary yearly repayment is not required in the case of NEB and commercial
banks advise NEB well in advance whenever they are considering that the loan
or part of it should be repaid. Because of these special characteristics
these loans were not included in the computation of net working capital and
current ratio. Nevertheless, if in the future they become repayable within
the following 12 months, these loans, or part of them, should be treated as
current liabilities.

Since the diesel stations are currently operated at over 60% load factor (l.f.), which
is inappropriate, the above figures are adjusted to correspond to a 60% l.f. operation.
Investment is based on US$750/kW, and the capital cost on 12% OCC and a 14-year life
span for diesel sets. Based on the annuity formula, the capital charge would be 15.09%
a year.
/b  The retail fuel cost at international prices is about M71/liter, or US$50/bbl (diesel)
for a heat value of 6 million BTU. A 14,000 BTU/kWh heat rate for diesel sets would
yield a fuel cost of M26.25/kWh (generation) at 1980 prices.
/c Present value (p.v.) is derived by using a 12% annual discount rate. Based on the
estimates the marginal cost of power supply from central diesel stations is M39.89 per
kWh including a fuel cost of 31.29/kWh, in 1981 price.

/a  Investment between 1986 and 1995 at 2% of earlier investment each year, to sustain growth.
/b  O&M Cost = 2% of investment.
/c  Bulk Sapply Cost =  Mc16.98 per kWh at the point of sale, based on LRMC calculations by the Bank Mission in May 1981.
/d  Growth in Sales:  Domestic = 4% p.a.; Commercial & Industrial = 5% p.a.
/e  Growth in Housholds = 2% p.a., after 1987.
/f  Domestic Revenue   @ Mc20 per kWh (prevailing tariff).
/g  Commercial Benefit @ M37.2 per kWh (para. 6.16).
/h  Industrial Benefit @ Mc39.9 per kWh (para. 6.17).
/i  Rerosene Saving $7.78 per household per month (see para. 6.11).
/j Industrial and commercial sales have been reduced to 80% of the forecast to account for the price elasticity of
demand, which implies elasticity for commercials sales = -0.35 and that for industrial sales = -0.20. (Elasticity of
-0.1 means 1% reduction in sales for 10% increase in price).
