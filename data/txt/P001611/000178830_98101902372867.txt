INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
structural adjustment loan to the Republic of Malawi for the equivalent
of US$45 million.  The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 9.6 percent per annum.
I. THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled Memorandum on the Economy of Malawi (Report No.
1677-MAI), dated September 30, 1977, was circulated to the Executive Directors
on October 10, 1977. A Basic Economic Mission visited Malawi in May/June
1979 and the reports that resulted from the mission will be distributed to the
Executive Directors in early June 1981. Annex I contains the basic country
data.
Background and Development Strategy
3.        When Malawi gained independence in 1964, its economy was charac-
terized by surplus labor and few natural resources other than a favorable
climate and moderately fertile agricultural land. It lacked capital, tech-
nology, entrepreneurship, skilled labor and managerial talent. Being land-
locked, it had to depend on other countries for access to the sea.
4.        Despite these constraints, the Government was determined to achieve
rapid, sustained economic development. It has opted for an outward-looking,
export-oriented growth based on agriculture and agro-based manufacturing.
This strategy has been reflected in the Government's policies toward the
agricultural and manufacturing sectors, toward prices and wages, and toward
the roles of domestic and foreign investment. In order to attract foreign
capital and managerial skills, Government policy has encouraged the establish-
ment of an open, market-oriented economy with the private sector as the
*       primary engine of economic growth.  Relatively low tariffs and limited use of
quantitative restrictions on imports have prevented the emergence of highly
inefficient local import substitution industries so characteristic of many
other developing countries. The Government has deliberately restrained those
forces which would raise wages above market-determined levels (e.g., trade
unions, excessive decreed wage increases), thus encouraging the establishment
of labor-intensive manufacturing firms and agricultural estates. Moderate
wage expansion, coupled with growing labor productivity in most sectors of the
economy, has helped to keep Malawian goods competitive in international trade.
Wage moderation has also kept the demand for labor high and the resultant
rapid expansion of employment opportunities has helped control the rural-urban
income gap and hence rate of internal migration.



2-
5.        Public investment has been intended primarily to support private
efforts in the directly productive sectors through provision of essential
infrastructure, public utilities and supporting services. The Government has
opted for a two pronged approach to agriculture, involving the traditional
smallholder and estate sectors. Attaching high priority to public invest-
ment in the traditional sector, the Government has undertaken, in the past, a
number of regional integrated rural development projects involving provision
of infrastructure and agricultural inputs and services. More recently, it
embarked on the National Rural Development Program (NRDP), an ambitious 20-year
program designed to extend agricultural services to smallholders countrywide.
The estate sector has been left largely in private hands (except for public
enterprise participation in sugar and in some tobacco estates) and the
Government has limited its role to that of providing a favorable investment
climate. The Government's decision to emphasize directly productive sectors
and related economic infrastructure has resulted in relatively slower develop-
ment of the social services such as health and education until recent years.
Evaluation of Past Performance
6.        In terms of its stated objectives, Malawi has an impressive record
of accomplishments. Aggregate and per capita real incomes have grown rapidly.
Real GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5 percent per annum over 1967-79 and per
capita income at about 3.0 percent per annum. Growth in all sectors (except
in subsistence production) exceeded 5.0 percent per annum. By 1979, GNP per
capita in current prices reached IJS$290. Over the same period, inflation
averaged 9.0 percent per annum.
7.        At independence, investment constituted only 8.6 percent of GDP and
domestic savings were virtually nil (0.5 percent of GDP). What little capital
formation that took place had to be financed from foreign sources. But since
then, the picture has changed dramatically. Between 1967 and 1979, gross
domestic investment grew at an average annual rate of 12.5 percent per annum,
raising investment's share in GDP from 16 to 29 percent. The domestic
resource mobilization effort has been even more impressive. Domestic savings
rose from 4 percent of GDP in 1967 to 17 percent in 1979, increasing the share
of investment financed from domestic sources to about 60 percent. Owing
mainly to government mobilization of foreign assistance but with increasing
contributions for private and public enterprise ventures, net foreign long-
term capital flows have increased from a total of US$66 million over 1967-69
to US$328 million over 1977-79.
8.        Over the 1967-79 period, export volumes grew at an annual average
rate of 4.5 percent while real imports grew at 3.5 percent. Agriculture
accounts for some 90 percent of export earnings. Since 1967, agricultural
estate production has been growing much faster than smallholder output and
this has been reflected in export performance. During 1967-79, agricultural
exports from estates expanded at 15.0 percent per annum while smallholder
exports recorded no growth. Thus, the estates share of agricultural exports
increased from 32 percent in 1967 to 65 percent in 1979. Since the bulk of
estate exports is in tobacco and tea, the concentration of Malawi's exports
has increased significantly.



9.        The country's favorable export performance can be partly attributed
to the policy of moderate wage increases and to growing labor productivity
which has kept Malawi's products competitive in the international market.
Over the same period, wage employment expanded almost as rapidly as the
modern sector as a whole (over 8 percent per annum) suggesting a labor-
intensive pattern of growth.
Recent Economic Crisis
10.       Notwithstanding these impressive achievements, the Malawian economy,
increasingly dependent on two primary commodity exports, tea and tobacco
(para. 8) has remained highly vulnerable to international price fluctuations.
Since 1974 the country has experienced periodic balance of payments disequilib-
ria of increasing severity due primarily to (a) rapid escalation in import
prices, particularly of fuel and intermediate and capital goods; (b) cyclical
swings in export prices of tobacco and tea; and (c) significantly higher
costs of transport for both exports and imports owing to rising ocean freight
charges, port congestion in Mozambique, and disruptions of the overland
route.
11.       While the Government managed to successfully steer the economy
through balance of payments crises in the past, the deterioration in the
balance of payments since 1978 has been less tractable (Table 1). Malawi's
worsening external position during the past three years was due mainly to an
estimated 35 percent fall in the terms of trade between 1977 and 1980.
Export prices fell 8 percent (due mainly to declines in tobacco prices) while
import prices were rising by about 41 percent. The fuel import bill more
than doubled between 1977 and 1980. The effects of the growing trade deficit
were compounded by a doubling of the non-factor service payments due mainly
to rising transport costs arising from rapid increases in sea and air freight
charges, the closure of the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border in 1976, intermittent
fighting in Mozambique delaying or severing transit and adding to port con-
gestion. In 1978 and 1979, transport charges accounted for as much as
28 percent of the value of imports, f.o.b. In fact, during 1978-80, the
deficit in non-factor services was considerably larger than the deficit in
trade.

12.       While Malawi's current account deficits have averaged 8-9 percent of
GDP since independence, the deficit reached 17 percent of GDP in 1978, 19
percent in 1979, and 14 percent in 1980. Part of these deficits was covered by
inflows of foreign capital (and increased use of IMF facilities). In contrast
to past experience, however, whereby the bulk of capital inflows were grants
and soft loans, over 35 percent of the 1978-80 capital flows were on commercia:L
terms. Such commercial borrowing will have a pronounced effect on debt servi-
cing in the next few years. On the basis of loans committed by the end
of 1980, Malawi's debt service ratio is projected to increase to over 20
percent in the early 1980s (as compared with 7 percent in 1977 and 12 percent
in 1979). Because capital inflows have not been sufficient to cover the
current account deficits, Malawi has also experienced a sharp drop in foreign
exchange reserves. Between the ends of 1977 and 1980 gross official reserves
fell from US$84 million to US$74 million (from the equivalent of four months
to two months of imports). Over the same period, net official reserves fell
from US$41 million to minus US$40 million.
13.       Malawi's budgetary position has also seriously deteriorated over the
past several years (table 2). From independence through 1974/75, government
expenditures and revenues expanded roughly in line with the increases in
GDP; while deficits grew larger, they still did not exceed 8-9 percent of GDP.
In the past five years, however, expenditure growth outstripped the increase
in revenue and the share of government deficits in GDP rose to an average of
12 percent in 1978/79 - 1980/81.
Government Stabilization Program Under IMF Standby Arrangement
14.       Faced with these problems, the Government in 1979 initiated a
number of short-term demand management measures culminating in a two and one
half year standby arrangement with the IMF covering the period through
December 31, 1981. The economic dislocations at the end of 1979, however, led.
to replacement of this arrangement with a new two-year standby arrangement
covering the period April 1, 1980 through March 31, 1982 (drawing on the
second through fourth credit tranches and the supplementary financing facility
for US$64.8 million equivalent). As part of the financial program, the
1980/81 budget provided for increases in excise taxes on cigarettes, spirits
and beer, in import duties including those on capital goods, and in the
airport tax. These measures followed increases during the previous fiscal
year in the rate of surtax on imported and domestically produced goods (from
15 to 20 percent), and in the levy on imported fuel to a rate equivalent
to over 60 percent of the value of imported fuel. Together, these tax measures
were expected to raise additional revenue equivalent to about 3.5 percent of
1980 monetary GDP.
15.       Government recurrent expenditures in the 1980/81 budget were limited
to an increase of eight percent over the 1979/80 level (given projected
inflation, a decline in real terms) and increases in development expenditures
limited to what could be financed from additional foreign aid. In agreement
with the IMF, the Government set quarterly ceilings on the expansion of net
bank credit to Government (an increase of 15 percent in 1980/81 as compared
with 51 percent in 1979/80). To limit external borrowing on commercial terms,
a ceiling of MK 25 million (US$31.5 million) of new government or government
guaranteed borrowing of 1 to 12 years maturity was set for the first year of
the program.

16.       The Government has also raised the lending and borrowing rates
charged by financial institutions twice over the past two years. The Bank
discount rate was increased from 7 to 8 percent in August 1979 and to
10 percent in March 1980. Major lending and borrowing rates were adjusted
upwards on both occasions, by amounts totalling more than three percentage
points in all cases. Presently, lending rates range between 11.5-16.5
percent for agriculture and 13.5-18.5 percent for all other sectors. Deposit
rates range between 8.75 and 11.75 percent. The domestic inflation rate
has averaged 13 percent over the past two years. In addition, the minimum
liquidity ratio was raised from 25 to 30 percent. In agreement with the IMF,
the Government set quarterly ceilings on total domestic credit expansion for
1980/81, limiting the increase to 11 percent compared with 30 percent in the
previous 12 months.
17.       The fiscal position weakened considerably in 1980/81.  Revenue
growth was much less than expected because of stagnant economic activity.
Moreover, a number of public enterprises experienced serious financial diffi-
culties. Substantial recourse to domestic credit sources to finance extra-
budgetary demands meant that the ceilings on net bank credit to Government for
December 1980 and March 1981 were exceeded, the latter by a substantial
margin. The IMF ceiling on total domestic credit was also exceeded in March
1981, even though private sector credit was kept well within the target
implicit in the financial program. For this reason, the Government became
ineligible for further drawing in December 1980. Further drawing on IMF
resources will recommence now that the financial program for the second year
has been approved by the Executive Board of the Fund on May 13, 1981.
18.       The program covering the second year of the standby arrangement
with the IMF focusses mainly on redressing the fiscal imbalance. The 1981/82
budget provided for a reduction in real government expenditures, and introduces
increases of 15 percent in specific excise and customs duties, an across-the-
board tariff increase of 3 percentage points and a 10 percent tax on hotel and
restaurant services; these measures are expected to increase government
revenue by 5 percent. In light of these actions, and the proposed price
increases for certain statutory corporations (para. 50) the program for
1981/82 provides fora zero increase in net bank credit to Government, and
a 12 percent increase in total domestic credit. The ceiling on external
public borrowing on commercial terms was set at MK 30 million (US$37.7 million)
for the second program year.
Emerging Structural Problems
19.       While the primary cause of the present crisis is the sharp deteriora-
tion in the country's international terms of trade, it has revealed several
underlying structural weaknesses in the Malawian economy: the slow growth of
smallholder exports and the narrowness of the export base; the modern sector"s
dependence on imported oil, and the progressive depletion of domestic fuelwood
resources; the deteriorating financial position of the public enterprise
sector; growing budgetary deficits owing to a rapid expansion of expenditures
combined with a relatively slow growth of revenues; a growing imbalance
between government recurrent and capital expenditures; and increasing economic
adjustment difficulties caused by the rigidities in the system of administered
prices and wages.



- 8 -
20.       Lack of Diversification of Estate Exports.  Agriculture accounts for
90 percent of Malawi's export earnings with estate agriculture contributing 62
percent and smallholder exports 28 percent of total merchandise exports during
1979. Estate exports are heavily concentrated on tobacco and tea, and several
factors will constrain future growth of these two crops. Fuelwood is in
increasingly short supply in Malawi, presenting a problem for the production
of flue-cured tobacco. Under prevailing technology, it is estimated that a
sustained yield from two to four acres of timber are needed for every acre of
flue-cured tobacco. Most large estates have reforestation programs included
in their investment plans but smaller estates which now rely on available bush
timber would soon have to start planting their own woodlots. In addition,
shortage of credit and scarcity of managerial talent in the country are
expected to become a serious constraint to further rapid expansion of both
burley and flue-cured tobacco. Growth of tea production will also be hampered
by the lack of suitable new land and the shortage of fuelwood. If the estate
sector is to maintain its role as the country's principal foreign exchange
earner, it must diversify into other crops. Moreover, the economy will have
to look increasingly to smallholder agriculture to broaden the export base
beyond tobacco and tea.
21.       Slow Growth of Smallholder Production.  Despite sizeable public
investment in smallholder agriculture, smallholder exports have stagnated over
the past ten years following a decade of rapid growth. While such performance
can partly be attributed to limited coverage of past agricultural projects,
low producer prices have almost certainly played an important role. An
analysis of prices by the Government and the Bank has shown that, on balance,
pricing has treated the smallholder sector less favorably than the estates,
and within the smallholder sector, it has subsidized the production of maize
and rice, while taxing production of export crops such as cotton, groundnuts,
and smallholder tobacco. A price incentive problem also applies to meat,
poultry and dairy products which are mostly produced by smallholders. Here,
pricing decisions have been more ad hoc and arbitrary than in the case of
crops, with price increases occurring infrequeptly and in quantum jumps,
making adjustments difficult for both consumers and producers.
22.       Rising Cost of Energy Resources.   Energy issues, as elsewhere, are
becoming increasingly important in Malawi. Fuelwood represents some 80
percent of the total energy consumed in Malawi. In the rural areas, wood is
used for cooking and for curing tobacco and tea. As a result of population
growth and expansion in tobacco and tea production, the demand for fuelwood is
outstripping available supplies, leading to deforestation and environmental
problems. With respect to petroleum, Malawi is totally dependent on imported
resources. While volume only increased by 8 percent between 1977 and 1980,
the value of imported petroleum doubled and the share of imported petroleum in
total imports, c.i.f., rose from 10 to 15 percent. Thus, the Government's
difficult task in the sector is to provide for the energy needs of the rural
areas while reducing the modern sector's dependence on imported oil.
23.       Deteriorating Finances of the Public Enterprises.  As a group,
Malawi's statutory boards and public enterprises have functioned well both by
providing essential services with reasonable efficiency and by making a
reasonable contribution to their own investment requirements. However, the



- 9 -
financial situation of several of these entities has deteriorated during the
past two years. The Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation
(ADMARC--a monopoly marketing institution for smallholder crops) which has
operated as a relatively efficient marketing institution suffered a substantial
loss in 1980 as a result of higher fuel costs, losses from improper crop
handling and poor transport planning. Air Malawi suffered large losses on its
international service which had to be discontinued at the end of 1979.
Domestic tariffs were increased by 60 percent in early 1980 and international
charter rates were raised later that year. To reduce losses further, additional
tariff increases of domestic and cargo service may be necessary. Malawi
Railways finances have been adversely affected by rising fuel costs and
transport problems at the ports and on lines through Mozambique. Despite a
1979 tariff increase of 17 percent, the company suffered an operating loss for
the first time since 1972 and its overall cash deficit, after debt service and
renewal investments, rose substantially. Hitherto financially sound Electricity
Supply Commission (ESCOM) also began to experience large cost overruns on its
Nkula project, primarily as a result of transport difficulties. While tariff
increases of 10 percent in 1979 and 5 percent in 1980 helped to alleviate the
cash deficit, the company is still experiencing cash flow difficulties. The
Malawi Housing Corporation and Capital City Development Corporation (CCDC)
have been channeling Government funds and external loans into housing and
construction of the new capital at Lilongwe, and are now experiencing difficul-
ties meeting their mounting debt service obligations out of their low income
from rents. MHC increased rents for low cost housing by 40 percent but it is
not generating sufficient funds even to provide for maintenance. The Malawi
Development Corporation (MDC) is a wholly government-owned holding company
with interests in agriculture and agroindustry, manufacturing and commerce.
Its financial position has steadily deteriorated in recent years, as the
liquidity position of its subsidiaries declined with the onset of recent
economic crises, and MDC has had to provide more guarantees for its subsidiaries'
borrowings. It has also accumulated medium-term debt, borrowed mainly on hard,
terms to finance equity investments. Given the large projected interest
payments, MDC is expected to run at a loss during 1980 and 1981. The deteriora-
tion in the performance of these public enterprises is having an adverse
impact on the Central Government's budget by increasing the requirements for
subsidies or for deferment of debt service owed to Government. In addition,
the demand by the public enterprises for new medium-term external credit or
for additional domestic borrowing has increased.
24.       While Press Holdings, Ltd. is a private enterprise, its operations
are so large that they have a profound impact on the country's economic life.
Press is a holding company with wholly-owned subsidiaries and associate
companies in most sectors of the economy, including agriculture, industry,
wholesale and retail trade, building and construction, transportation, banking
and insurance. Until 1979, Press and its subsidiaries had been consistently
profitable, but thereafter, the group's financial position deteriorated
rapidly. Press' enormous cash needs have placed severe strains on Malawi's
two commercial banks and this led to restricted domestic credit expansion
to the rest of the private sector. Unless Press' financial and operational
problems can be resolved rapidly, they will have an adverse impact on the
country's output, employment and exports.



- 10 -
25.       Budgetary Deficits and Underfunding of Recurrent Activities.
The Government has generally managed its finances prudently. Revenue has
increased as rapidly as GDP, the recurrent account (since 1972/73) has con-
sistently generated surpluses to contribute to development finance, and budget
deficits have been relatively modest. Since 1978/79, however, the Government's
fiscal position has deteriorated. While revenues have increased slightly
faster than GDP, recurrent and development account expenditures have grown
even more rapidly owing to a rapid expansion of development projects. In
addition, there is growing evidence of underfunding of recurrent budget
requirements. Control over recurrent expenditures has been tight because of
domestic revenue constraints and the need to expand government savings to
finance development. On the other hand, because of the availability of
foreign finance on concessionary terms, capital projects have been relatively
easy and inexpensive to finance. As a consequence, the expansion of government
exployment and expenditures for goods and services has not kept pace with the
growth of capital expenditures. The problem has become particularly acute in
agriculture (and to a lesser extent in road maintenance and in health). The
lack of adequate provision for recurrent operations has reduced the benefits
originally expected from project investments.
26.       Rigidity of Price Controls and Wage Policy.  A system of formal and
informal price controls has evolved for most domestically manufactured goods
in Malawi over the past decade. Administered by the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism, formal controls are exercised over a set of fairly
homogeneous products such as cement, fertilizers, and sugar; they also cover
commodities that figure predominantly in the consumption of low income groups,
such as maize meal, vegetable oils, bread, milk, matches and fish. In
addition, the requirement that manufacturers notify the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism in advance of price increases and wait for a letter of
'no objection" is in effect an informal price control to cover practically all
goods in the formal manufacturing sector not subject to the above formal price
controls. With increased inflationary pressure, the system has begun to
create serious disincentives for producers. Long delays between price
increase applications and approval have adversely affected the financial
position of many businesses. Similar delays have characterized granting of
tariff increases for the country's principal statutory bodies.
27.       The Government has also adopted a system of wage controls designed
to restrain real wage increases. However, administration of wage controls
has been destabilizing with the Government holding down wages for as long as
possible and then granting large wage increases to make up for several years
of real decline. This has resulted in serious adjustment problems for the
economy. For example, the minimum wage for urban unskilled workers, which had
remained unchanged since 1973, was increased by 12.5 percent in 1980 and by
additional 56 percent in January 1981. (Even with these quantum jumps the
minimum wage in 1981 is only three-quarters of its 1973 level in real terms).
The civil service wage structure has not been adjusted since 1978.

II. THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIUM-TERM PROGRAM 1/
Government's Medium-Term Objectives
28.       Recognizing these problems, the Government has formulated a medium-
term program covering 1981/82 - 1985/86 in consultation with the Bank and the
IMF to reduce the balance of payments current account deficit to manageable
proportions while ensuring moderate growth of per capita income. The Ministry
of Finance, the Economic Planning Division (EPD), the IMF and the Bank's
appraisal mission have worked together to design the overall policy and
macroeconomic framework and conferred on sectoral strategies and targets. The
projections and targets contained in the program are conservative, based on
realistic assessment of external resource availability and international terms
of trade movements. The Government's major objectives for the next five years
are the following:
-    a real GDP growth rate of 4.8 percent (comprising average
growth rates for smallholders of 5.0 percent per annum, estates
of 2.9 percent, manufacturing 7.5 percent and 4.1 percent for
the remainder of the economy);
-    increased diversification of sources of foreign exchange
earnings or savings through the development of new smallholder
and estate crops, faster smallholder export crop growth and the
development of livestock and forestry industries and agro-
businesses; and
-    improvement in internal and external balance through
measures which improve the financial performance of public
enterprises and public budget thus reducing dependence on
external resources and domestic borrowing to manageable
levels and providing for an improvement in foreign exchange
reserves.
Balance of Payments Prospects
29.       Malawi is expected to experience continuing balance of payments
problems over the next five years. On the basis of present IBRD commodity
price projections, Malawi's 1985 terms of trade will only be 2.5 percent
higher than the relatively poor 1980 year, a level still some 20 percent
below the average of the mid-1970s. While export prices are expected to
improve, most of the improvement will be absorbed by rising import costs,
especially for fuels and fertilizers; the real prices for the important tea
and sugar crops are projected to decline over the period. Since there is
little prospect for a significant improvement in port conditions or in the
rail lines in Mozambique, transport costs will continue to constitute a
significant drain on foreign exchange. Due to heavy borrowing on commercial
terms by the Government and public enterprises in the late 1970s, debt service
1/   The section is substantially the same as Part II of the President's
Report on the Structural Adjustment Loan (Report No. P-3024a-MAI).



- 12 -
will rise dramatically in the early 1980s. Moreover, since by the end of 1980
gross official reserves stood at a level equivalent to 1.5 month's worth of
imports, the Governmnt is establishing priority to the buildup of reserves to
more prudent levels.
30.       Table 3 shows balance of payments projections over the 1980-85
period. Since the growth of traditional estate crops is expected to be slow
(in tea and tobacco), export expansion will depend upon the growth of existing
smallholder crops, and the development of new crops and agro-industrial
exports. Traditional smallholder exports (groundnuts, cotton, rice, and
tobacco) are projected to grow at just over 7 percent per annum 1980-85.
From a low initial base, "other exports" (including new crops and agro-
industrial exports) are projected to grow at almost 20 percent per annum over
the same period. Projections for imports of various types have been related
to the growth of certain sectors of the economy through elasticities; the
overall elasticity of real imports with respect to real GDP is about 0.6,
roughly what it has been in the past. On the basis of the foregoing assump-
tions, Malawi's current account deficit is expected to average over US$260
million per annum over the five-year period. In nominal terms, it would
climb from US$227 million in 1981 to US$287 million in 1985. As a share of
GDP, the deficit would fall from 12.4 percent in 1981 to 8.6 percent in 1985.
In the absence of increased flow of foreign resources, Malawi's economic
situation will deteriorate further during 1981 and 1982. Without additional
Bank assistance and increases in aid flows from other donors over and above
those likely from firm sources for those two years, the financing gap would
amount to US$50 million in 1981 and US$30 million in 1982. Monetary and
fiscal stringency would have to be even more severe. Import volumes would
decline still further leading to growing shortages of essential intermediate
and capital goods and stifling economic activity, and real GDP growth would
fall below the 3.5 percent growth rate now projected for the next two years.
31.       Malawi will be able to service a moderate amount of external debt
on relatively hard terms. Assuming that the public and private enterprise
sectors borrow about US$30 million per year on average from foreign sources
on commercial terms (12 percent interest and repayment in 7 years including 2
years of grace) and the Government borrows the remainder on average terms
of 6 percent interest, 6 years grace and 25 years repayment, Malawi's debt
service ratio for public debt would rise from 12 percent in 1979 to a peak of
about 24 percent in 1982, declining thereafter to 16 percent in 1985. This
projection also assumes that grant aid will grow at 5 percent per annum in
real terms (a conservative estimate compared to the 30 percent real growth per
annum between 1977 and 1980) and that the Government will build up its official
reserve holdings to equivalency of 3 months of imports by 1985. In 1985, the
Bank Group's share in Malawi's public indebtedness would be 18 percent, and
its share in debt service, 5 percent.
Government's Program for Structural Adjustment
32.       The policies for obtaining these objectives have been incorporated
in a comprehensive structural adjustment program which is designed to address
each of the economy's structural problems discussed above (paras. 19-27). The
elements of this program, which is described in detail in the Government's
Letter of Development Policies (Annex IV), fall under four main categories:
(a) Improvement in balance of payments;

(b) Improvements in price incentives and income policies;
(c) Resource management; and
(d) Institutional improvements.
Measures to improve balance of payments relate to development of smallholder
and estate agriculture, energy resource development and agroindustrial
investments and are designed to expand exports and to bring about efficient
import substitution. Improvements in price incentives and income policies
would be achieved by granting more frequent and more gradual price tariff and
wage increases which would make adjustments easier. A comprehensive review
of the existing price control system will be carried out with a view toward
introducing greater flexibility. Measures in the resource management category
aim at improved financial performance of the Government and the statutory
corporations, reduced domestic borrowing and ensuring adequate budgetary
allocations to key economic and social sectors. Finally, the institutional
improvements include measures to strengthen the Government's planning,
economic monitoring and debt management capacities, and institutional reform
packages for MDC and Press Holdings, Ltd.
Improvement in Balance of Payments
33.       Promotion of Smallholder Exports.  Expansion and diversification
of Malawi's exports is central to the structural adjustment process. The
Government's program includes several measures designed to promote smallholder
exports. These include an expansion of recurrent budgetary support for
agricultural extension and research services, an increase of investment in
smallholder development projects, and a strengthening of Malawi's principal
agricultural marketing organization, ADMARC. In addition, action is being
taken to improve the mechanism for determining producer prices for smallholders.
Recognizing that low producer prices provide inadequate incentives for farmers
to produce and market cash crops, the Government established an interministerial
Price Advisory Committee in 1978. The Committee completed one comprehensive
price review in 1980; the Government will further institutionalize this
practice by carrying out annual crop price reviews in advance of each growing
season. To facilitate the working of this committee the Government, in
consultation with the Bank, has formalized the methodology to be used in these
reviews and has distributed it to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), EPD, and ADMARC. This methodology takes into account three
criteria: export parity prices of crops, growers' crop margins and ADMARC's
financial requirements. Final price decisions will depend critially on the
relative weights attached to these criteria. During negotiations agreement
was reached that by October 31, 1981, the crop price decisions made by the
Government for the 1981/82 growing season, based on the methodology, would be
reviewed with the Bank (para. 68). Incentives for cotton production
have deteriorated and its market output has stagnated because cotton
prices have not been changed since 1977 while input (pesticide) prices have
gone up. During negotiations the Government agreed to increase by September 1,
1981, the producer price of cotton to a level acceptable to the Bank prior
to the start of the 1981/82 growing season (Section 3.05 of the Draft Loan



- 15 -
Agreement). The Government also intends to begin annual price reviews for
wholesale and retail prices of livestock and livestock products. However,
since it does not have reliable data on the costs of production or on supply
and demand, the Government will carry out a study designed to consolidate its
knowledge of livestock products industries and has requested Bank financing
under the proposed Technical Assistance Loan. Its terms of reference were
agreed upon by the Government and the Bank during negotiations. The study is
scheduled for completion by March 31, 1982, with the Government exchanging
views with the Bank on its findings and recommendations not later than
June 30, 1982 (Section 3.03(a) of the Technical Assistance Loan Agreement).
34.       ADMARC provides valuable crop and input marketing and distribution
services to smallholders and operates the country's grain silos. Hence,
increasing the efficiency of ADMARC's operations (para. 23) would greatly
benefit smallholder agriculture and promote agricultural exports. The
Government has requested the FAO to conduct a study of ADMARC's marketing and
distribution system. The study would focus on the potential for reducing
marketing, transport and storage costs and improvements in crop quality
through grading, insect/pest control, and training of ADMARC personnel.
35.       Expansion of Estate Exports.  The performance of Malawi's tobacco
industry will remain critical to the economy from the standpoint of generating
foreign exchange and employment. Malawi grows several types of tobacco each
having its own unique problems. For example, growing scarcity of fuelwood
and stagnant world demand will place a constraint on the expansion of dark-
fired tobacco. Moreover, flue-cured tobacco will also be adversely affected
by rising fuel costs and the shortage of management talent. The Government
will examine the mix of varieties which would maximize tobacco earnings. At
Government request, using resources provided under the NRDP (Phase I Project,
857-MAI), and Shire Valley Agricultural Consolidation Project (Phase III,
823-MAI) the Bank Group will finance studies which would (a) examine the
long-term world outlook for dark-fired, oriental, burley and flue-cured
tobacco; (b) identify measures to improve the efficiency of existing tobacco
estates and smallholder farms (taking into account the energy requirements for
different varieties); and (c) explore the possibility for future tobacco
production and diversification. The terms of reference for these studies have
been agreed upon by the Government and the Bank, and the findings of the
studies will be reviewed with the Bank by June 30, 1982.
36.       Energy Development.  The Government has attempted to cope with the
country's energy problems through price/tax policies to limit the consumption
of petroleum and through investments aimed at developing new energy sources.
Oil imports have been subject to tax at rates equivalent to 30-60 percent and
domestic prices regularly adjusted to reflect the full c.i.f. value of fuel
plus tax. This policy has played an important role in holding the rate of
increase in domestic consumption of petroleum to 1.7 percent per annum 1973-79
(about one-quarter of the growth rate of the modern sector of the economy).
The Government has also launched investments in wood energy and ethanol. The
IDA-financed Wood Energy Project (992-MAI) includes (a) a pilot program for
the establishments of a national network of 88 nurseries operated by the
Forestry Department for the production of seedlings for sale to the public who
would be encouraged to grow their own woodlots; (b) establishment of 13,000 ha.



- 16 -
of fuelwood and pole plantations for commercial and industrial use; and
(c) the establishment of an energy unit to investigate more efficient use
of wood energy and alternative sources of energy. In connection with this
project, the Government is committed to increasing wood prices gradually
to levels which reflect full production costs. By the end of 1981, based on
a general review of pricing policies affecting forestry products, the Govern-
ment would reach ageement with the Bank on the 1982/83 increase in the price
of fuelwood. The ethanol project (with IFC loan and equity participation)
involves the conversion of the molasses by-product from sugar production and
would replace some 8-10 percent of Malawi's current petrol consumption result-
ing in substantial foreign exchange savings.
37.       The Government recognizes that a comprehensive energy sector study
is needed to assess available resources, project future demand and supply, and
examine alternative sources of energy and the possibilities for intrasectoral
substitution. The Government has asked the Bank to carry out such a study in
collaboration with USAID. The study would emphasize development of fuelwood
but would also examine the possibilities for coal and for further investments
in hydro power and in the production of energy from biomass. During negotia-
tions, the general scope of work, composition of the mission and timetable
for completing the sector study were agreed on by the Bank, USAID and the
Government. The energy sector mission is expected to visit Malawi in August
1981.
Price Incentives and Incomes Policy
38.       Wages and Prices.  The Government recognizes that administration of
its wage and price policies destabilizes the economy and has adverse effects
on the profitability of public corporations and businesses. In its Letter of
Development Policies, the Government has expressed acceptance of the principle
of more frequent and more moderate increases in prices and wages. By October
1981, the Government will conduct a review of its incomes policies, with a
view toward introducing greater flexibility to the system, and discuss the
findings with the Bank.
39.       Exchange Rate.  Since June 9, 1975, the currency of Malawi, the
Kwacha, has been pegged to the SDR at MK 1 = SDR 0.9487. The exchange rate
for the US dollar is determined on the basis of IMF's daily calculations of
the US dollar/SDR rate. Consequently, over the past three years, the value
of the Kwacha has appreciated relative to the US dollar by some 10 percent.
However, Bank missions have found little evidence to suggest that the exchange
rate has had much negative impact on export production. Under IMP standby,
the exchange rate will be subject to periodic reviews, and the Government and
the Bank will continue to study its impact on Malawi's export industries.
40.       Interest Rates.  The Government has raised lending and borrowing
rates twice over the past two years (para. 16). These were significant
increases and helped to ration scarce credit to more important uses and
provide better incentives for savings. The increases in lending rates were an
important factor in reducing the demand for imports. Many of the lending
rates are positive in real terms but in the present inflationary environment,
additional adjustment may become necessary. In consultation with the IMF, the
Government will continue to monitor its interest rates policy to ensure that
appropriate incentives are maintained.



- 17 -
Resource Management
41.       Public Expenditure Program.  To contribute to the achievement of
targets for growth and structural changes in a highly constrained financial
environment, public resources must be used as efficiently as possible. The
Government in consultation with the Bank has produced a five-year (1981/82-
1985/86) public expenditure program covering the Central Government recurrent
and capital expenditure and those public enterprise investments externally
financed through the Government's budget. This program, in our view, reflects
the Government's commitment to an improved allocation of public resources:
low priority expenditures have been reduced or eliminated; the past imbalance
between recurrent and capital expenditures has been largely corrected; and the
proportions of total expenditures directed towards key economic and social
sectors have been increased.
42.       Public Investment.  The overall size and sectoral composition of
the five-year public investment program (1981/82-1985/86) appear to be satis-
factory. The size of the investment program represents a very modest increase
over the efforts of recent years and is consistent with the expected avail-
ability of foreign loan and grant resources. In the aggregate, the projected
public investment expenditures total about MK 710 million at constant (1980/81)
prices. Average annual investment expenditures of MK 140 million would be
somewhat lower than the preliminary estimates of actual expenditures for
1980/81.
43.       In view of Malawi's difficult financial position (especially during
1981 and 1982) the Government has given priority to the completion of ongoing
projects over the undertaking of new investments; more than 60 percent of
development expenditures in 1981/82 will go to ongoing projects. Resources
allocated to new projects will be concentrated on sectors that are likely
to contribute most directly to increased production or to the development
of skilled manpower. Investments in sectors that are not directly productive
will be reduced drastically to economize on scarce funds. During the five
year period, the Government will continue to review the composition of the
investment program as part of its regular budgetary process. During negotia-
tions, agreement was reached that the Government would by March 31, 1982
provide the Bank for comment with an up-dated, detailed three-year public
investment program covering FY82/83-84/85 (Section 3.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
44.       The sectoral allocations for the five-year program reflect the
Government's emphasis on smallholder agriculture, transport and manpower
designed to support its strategy for diversification of agricultural produc-
tion and exports (table 4). The program calls for a significant increase in
the share of total outlays going to agriculture (22 percent versus the 18
percent reached over the previous five years) and to the social services--
education (10 percent versus 4 percent), health (4 percent versus 2 percent).
The share of water supply and sanitation also more than doubled (8 percent
versus 3 percent). A moderate reduction is called for in the share going to
transport (36 percent from 42 percent). In addition, the Government is com-
mitted to reducing appropriations for "government buildings", (expenditures
on government buildings and facilities and equipment for the army and police)
both absolutely and proportionately; in all, the share of government build-
ings will be about one-third of the levels reached in recent years. During

negotiations, discussions were held with the Government on how its increased
allocations to the social sectors could best be geared to redressing Malawi's
urgent manpower needs and to improving the effectiveness, efficiency and
coverage of its programs in health, water supply and education. General
agreement was reached that the Government could, over the next five years,
make considerable progress in alleviating its immediate skilled manpower
constraints while establishing a cost-effective means of providing social
services consistent with available financial resources.
45.       The bulk of agricultural investment is directed toward implementa-
tion of the NRDP (para. 5). Over the next five years, the Government will
concentrate investments on completing existing projects and on projects in
existing cultivated areas where manpower and infrastructure are most developed
and therefore immediate production increases are likely to be greatest.
Increased allocations to forestry projects such as the Wood Energy Project,
Timber Plantations, and Community Forestry reflect the Government's commitment
to the development of forest resources to strengthen the country energy
resource base. A larger share going to the veterinary services is designed to
support the Government's goal of supporting a dynamic livestock sector that
can play a key role in the overall diversification strategy.
46.       Expenditures in the transport sector are directed toward improving
the administrative and socioeconomic integration of the country, increasing
access to rural areas to support agricultural development, and maintaining
efficient external transport links. The main thrust of road investments
will be on improvement of regional road links and the lakeshore road, and
extension of the feeder road network to handle a larger volume of agricultural
output. Investments in the railways will give priority to maintaining and
increasing rolling stock. Investments in rolling stock are urgent because of
Malawi's need to return wagons to Zimbabwe and because of the long turnaround
time arising from port congestion in Mozambique.
47.       While financial circumstances constrain spending in socioeconomic
sectors, reduced expenditures on government buildings and transport has
released resources for additional investments in some key areas. The Government
recognizes the critical role of education, health and water supply in develop-
ing skilled manpower and in improving the health and productivity of the labor
force. In education, the Government's objectives are to relieve the skilled
manpower constraint through the expansion of secondary school and technical
school enrollment through the expansion of the Polytechnic Institute. A
senior-level program of post-basic training in management and public adminis-
tration will also be implemented. Malawi's Primary Health Care program is
designed to provide widespread services for the population through a system of
central hospital, district hospital and primary health care centers. During
the next five years, the investment program in health will center upon expand-
ing rural health facilities consistent with the availability of trained
manpower. Investments in water supply and sanitation will provide support for
the Government's goal of safe water and sanitary waste disposal for the entire
population by the year 1990. The five-year investment program emphasizes
improving urban access to water (especially in Lilongwe where rapid expansion
has overtaxed the system) and an extension of the rural program of community
shallow wells, gravity-fed piped systems and boreholes.



-  20  -
48.       Recurrent Expenditure.  The Government has undertaken to rectify the
underfunding of agricultural operations in 1981/82 by providing an additional
MK 4.4 million (US$5.5 million) over that provided in the 1980/81 budget to
the key departments of agriculture and research, fisheries, and veterinary
services. To date, they have allocated MK 1.6 million to agriculture and they
will provide an additional MK 2.8 million in a supplementary allocation.
According to our estimates, these allocations would be sufficient to cover
existing operations while making an adequate provision for recurrent activi-
ties scheduled to be transferred from development to revenue account during
the year. The supplementary allocation is consistent with the Government's
objective of emphasizing smallholder output and exports as a key element in
the structural adjustment process. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that by October 31, 1981 the Government would have appropriated an additional
MK 2.8 million (see para. 68).
49.       For the remainder of the five-year development program period, the
Government has committed itself to providing funds for an expansion of recur-
rent operations consistent with the requirements implied by its investment
program. According to Bank projections, a Government commitment to improved
revenue performance raising the share of revenue in GDP from the 14.5 percent
to 16.5 percent over the Plan period; would allow recurrent expenditures in the
key economic and social sectors to grow at 4 to 5 percent per annum in real
terms (table 5). Such growth should be adequate to provide for expanding
recurrent operations implied by the Government's past and planned investment
program (see para. 50). During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
Government would by October 31, 1981 provide the Bank for discussion, its
updated five year budget, balance of payments and national accounts projections
(see para. 68).
50.       Resource Mobilization.  The Government's objective is to mobilize
additional revenues to provide for a real expansion of recurrent expenditures
(as well as for needed local resources on development account) while reducing
its reliance on domestic borrowing. In its letter of Development Policies,
the Government has stated its objective to expand revenues through more
frequent adjustments of specific taxes and departmental charges to compensate
for inflation, the introduction of new taxes, and improved administration.
Such revenue measures would allow the Government to meet its commitment to
provide for real growth in recurrent expenditures in the key economic and
social sectors and gradually reducing overall deficit from 9.5 percent of GDP
in 1981/82 to 5.5 percent in 1985/86. In addition to the large increases in
taxes introduced over the last two years (para. 14), the Government has
introduced the following measures in its 1981/82 budget: (a) an increase of 15
percent in all specific import and excise duties; (b) an introduction of 10
percent tax on hotel and restaurant services; and (c) across-the-board tariff
increase of 3 percentage points. There will, however, be reductions in
non-tax receipts, especially from statutory bodies, so that in 1981/82, total
revenue is expected to grow by only 5 percent. The Government has also
requested technical assistance from the IMF to help the Ministry of Finance
build up capabilities in budget management and fiscal forecasting.
51.       Government Borrowing.  In its 1981/82 budget, the Government will
attempt to reduce its net domestic borrowing from the banking sector to
zero through restraints on recurrent expenditure, cutbacks in development

expenditure and revenue increasing measures mentioned above. Moreover, under
IMF Standby, external debt ceiling remains on the government and government
guaranteed external borrowing of 1-12 years maturity. The ceiling for 1981/82
is K 30 million (para. 18).
52.       Finances of Statutory Bodies.  A series of measures has already
taken to help improve the financial position of the statutory bodies and
further actions are planned. In the fall of 1980 a Department of Statutory
Bodies (DSB) was established in the Office of the President and Cabinet to
monitor the activities of all public enterprises. The DSB, in cooperation
with the Treasury, has just completed a review of the recent performance and
FY81-82 outlook for these enterprises. The DSB has also started to provide
assistance to various enterprises in their medium-term financial planning.
Its staff will soon be strengthened by experts recruited under U.K. technical
assistance.
53.       The Government plans to grant more frequent, moderate public utility
tariff increases in line with increased costs, in order to ensure that they
can make contributions to their investment requirements. On March 1, 1981
Government increased the Electricity supply Commission's tariff by 10 percent.
During negotiations, agreement was reachedt that by October 31, 1981, the
Government would increase the Blantyre Water Board's tariff to a level accept-
able to the Bank (see para. 68). Moreover, by October 31, 1981, the Government
plans to review with the Bank its proposed measures to improve the financial
performance and economic management of Air Malawi and Malawi Railways (see
para. 68). To date the Government has asked the UK and UNDP to send consultancY
teams to review the financial and management plans of Air Malawi and Malawi
Railways. Preliminary studies have already been completed and further in
depth reviews are planned.
54.       Two other statutory bodies of a somewhat different nature have
also experienced financial problems in the past few years, i.e., ADMARC
MDC. As noted earlier (para. 34), a study of ADMARC's administration and
marketing operations to be undertaken in the coming year, is designed in large
part to identify ways to reduce unit costs of transport and handling. MDC's
financial problems stem from a very unfavorable debt structure, and losses
incurred by several subsidiaries. Two of MDC's loss unprofitable subsidiaries
have recently been closed down, and new management for MDC has been appointed.
The MDC has also requested Bank financing of two management consulting
studies to improve budgetary controls over production, working capital and
investment decisions.   In addition, by October 1981, MDC in conjunction
with the Ministry of Finance and DSB will complete a review of MDC's present
and projected financial position and discuss the findings with the Bank.
Institutional Improvements
55.       In line with its commitment to better economic management, the
Government has recently instituted new procedures to improve monitoring of its
investments and management of its debts. It will also reinforce its planning
capacity and ensure improvements in the management and financial practices of
MDC and Press Holdings.



- 23 -
56.       Monitoring of Investments.  The Government has created an Investment
Coordinating Committee (ICC) to monitor investments by all public institutions
and major private corporations to ensure that they are economically justified
and financially feasible and that their financing arrangements do not place
undue burden upon the institution or on the country. The Committee, which
includes high-level representation from the public and private sectors, would
review and recommend project submissions to the Malawi Cabinet. It applies
standard economic and financial rate of return analysis to projects costing
more than MK 0.5 million. All large projects would also be subject to detailed
technical review by independent consultants. To provide a basis for monitoring
the investment program, agreement was reached that the ICC would apply
specific criteria for screening major projects based on generally accepted
principles of project analysis (see para. 68).
57.       Economic Planning.  Present government planning capacity  is being
severely strained by the increasing demands of day-to-day economic management
in a period of economic crisis. The Government has, therefore, requested UNDP
financing for higher-level training in economics and planning, shorter-term
planning courses and consultancy services for in-house training. However, the
Government feels an immediate need for experienced external personnel to assist
the Ministry of Finance, EPD and MOA. Terms of reference for these personnel
will be drawn up through consultation among UNDP, the Bank and the relevant
Government officials; upon acceptance, the UNDP will fund the project and the
United Nations Department of Technical Cooperation for Development will act as
executing agency.
58.       To provide a better basis for economic management and planning, it
is also essential to augment the capabilities of the National Statistical
Office. The UNDP currently is considering a project aimed at strengthening
the system of national accounts (and supporting statistical requirements such
as national household survey capability, input-output work, agricultural
surveys, etc). The project would:
(a) create a comprehensive plan for the development of
statistical resources;
(b) finance expatriate service staff for the major
statistical areas; and
(c)  provide for the training of young Malawians.
Government has accepted the UNDP's proposal to fund the preparation of a
project document. Upon completion of the document by the UNDP, the Govern-
ment, UNDP and Bank would agree to consider responsibilities for finance and
staffing.
59.       Institutional Reforms Aimed at Promoting Agro-industrial Investment.
MDC and Press Holdings, Ltd. are expected to participate in the development of
agro- and forest-based industries which can make a substantial contribution to



- 24 -
Malawi's structural adjustment. Because of financial difficulties, neither
MDC nor Press is in a position to make substantial new investments in the near
future. For this reason, the Government's medium-term program includes a
reform package designed to strengthen these two organizations. Those measures
relating to MDC have already been mentioned in para. 54, under statutory
corporation finance. Though Press is a private holding company, because of
its size and its impact on the economy, the Government and the company have
agreed to make Press group's financial restructuring a part of the Government's
medium-term program.
60.       Press has already taken a number of measures designed to improve the
performance of its subsidiaries and the management of its financial resources.
It has suspended payments of dividends since 1979, has closed down some of its
unprofitable operations and trimmed its labor force by over 20 percent.
Furthermore, it has employed the services of an international management
consulting firm to conduct studies of each of Press' subsidiaries and to make
recommendations about changes in management and financial practices and
possibly closing down unprofitable operations. The study will be conducted in
two phases: Phase I, completed in March 1981, covers overall corporate
structure and development strategy and an investigation of the subsidiaries
with the most serious problems; Phase II, to be completed by the end of 1981,
covers the remaining subsidiaries. Some of the consulting firm's recommenda-
tions are already being implemented while others will follow the completion
of reports. The ICC will in the future review the economic viability and
financial arrangements of all of Press' proposed investments.
61.       The above measures taken by Press and the Government are important
and, if properly implemented, will improve the profitability of Press and
facilitate its financial restructuring. Such a financial restructuring,
however, is unlikely to precede the completion of the consulting firm's study
and the implementation of many of its recommendations. During the tranche
review, the Bank would examine Press' progress in implementing measures to
improve its profitability and management practices and in developing a long-
term program of financial restructuring (para. 68).
62.       Institutional Reforms Aimed at Strengthening Malawi's Debt Management.
Although Malawi's debt reporting and management performance have been satis-
factory in the past, there is a need to strengthen debt management capability
and to monitor external borrowing more closely. During negotiations, agreement
was reached that by October 31, 1981, the Government would submit for Bank
review its proposals to improve its capacity to monitor and manage its public
and government-guaranteed private debt, as well as establish a target range
for future public debt service ratios (para. 68).
III. THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
63.       The Government made a formal request to the Bank for a structural
adjustment loan in April 1980. The loan was appraised in September 1980,



- 25 -
and a post appraisal mission visited Malawi in January 1981. During this time
a program of action has been developed through a close dialogue between the
Government of Malawi and the Bank. There has also been close coordination
with the IMF. The agreements reached by the Government with both institutions
combine to make up the elements of the SAL program.
64.       The proposed Structural Adjustment Loan is designed to respond to
Malawi's serious financial crisis which threatens the country's economic
prospects. The loan supports the program described in the Government's Letter
of Development Policies (Annex IV) and provides foreign exchange to finance
critically needed imports (para. 66). Chart 1 provides a summary matrix of
the Government's action program. The adjustment process is expected to take
several years to implement. The five-year public sector investment plan and
supporting macro-economic and sectoral policy reforms to restore economic
growth and financial stability are complex undertakings which the Government
intends to address as part of a phased program over the next five years. The
proposed loan is the first of what can be expected to be a series of structural
adjustment loans to help Malawi through the difficult transition period. A
second SAL operation is programmed for FY 1983. In addition, a related
technical assistance loan (No. P-3025a-MAI) is being submitted separately. It
provides funding for management consultant studies of MDC and a livestock
study as well as consultant support to help MDC's export marketing capabilities
and to study currently unidentified aspects of the structural adjustment
process. Malawi's longer-term development objectives are to broaden its
economic base for exports and to meet the growing needs of its domestic market
efficiently substituting local production for imports. Specifically, it plans
to diversify its investments in the agro-industrial, agricultural and energy
sectors in order to protect Malawi from external shocks (oil prices, fluctuating
commodity prices) while continuing to emphasize programs which will raise
smallholder productivity and develop the full potential of its most important
development resource, its people. In this regard, Malawi is seeking to strike
a sensible balance between investments in human resource development and
productive endeavors to revitalize its economy.
65.       The loan negotiations were held in May 1981 with a delegation
headed by Mr. G. Kalinga, Senior Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Finance. A
supplementary loan data sheet is attached as Annex III. In our discussions
with the Government on the different aspects of the adjustment program, we
have reached an understanding on the specific steps which will lead to the
implementing of the Government's intentions and the proposed time frame for
those measures. There will be regular exchanges of views, the first of which
will take place no later than October 31, 1981 (Schedule 3 of the Draft Loan
Agreement).
Allocation of the Structural Adjustment Loan
66.       All of the US$45 million under the loan would be used to help
finance all imports other than a short list of excluded items as specified
in Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement. It is estimated that eligible
imports in 1981 will total about US$250 million. The proposed loan would
finance about 18 percent of this, thus resulting in rapid disbursement.

Counterpart Funds
67.       The Malawian Kwacha equivalent generated by the foreign currency
withdrawal from the loan account would be credited to a special account
in the Reserve Bank of Malawi and used for development purposes in the Central
Government Budget. The Government has stated that it intends to use them
to finance essential recurrent and capital expenditures in the key economic
and social sectors (Section 3.01(a) of the Draft Loan Agreement).
Disbursement and Procurement
68.       The loan would be disbursed in two tranches in accordance with
progress in the execution of the economic program. US$25 million would be
available for disbursement after the loan is declared effective. The remain-
ing US$20 million would be available for disbursement after a review of
performance in October 1981. The conditions for the release of the second
tranche will be: (a) supplementary appropriation of MK 2.8 million over the
amount already budgeted in 1981/82 to rectify underfunding of agricultural
recurrent activities (para. 48); (b) submission of crop pricing decisions by
the Government based on the recommendations of the Price Advisory Committee
(para. 33); (c) submission of proposals to strengthen debt management and
establishment of a target range for future public debt service ratios (para.
62); (d) application by the ICC of generally accepted principles of project
analysis in screening major public and private sector investments (para. 56);
(e) Government provision of updated balance of payments and public finance
projections (para. 49); (f) Government plans for rehabilitation of major
enterprises in the private and public sectors (paras. 53 and 61); and (g)
increases in the Blantyre Water Board tariff to a level acceptable to the
Bank (para. 53).
69.       The proposed loan would reimburse the foreign exchange costs of
eligible imports on the basis of evidence provided by the Reserve Bank.
The Reserve Bank would be responsible for the collection of the necessary
documentation, the preparation and submission of withdrawal applications and
the maintenance of necessary accounts for the loan fund. Withdrawal appli-
cations submitted to the Bank will be prepared by the Reserve Bank which is
to conolidate invoices so as to provide for withdrawal applications of at
least US$10,000 (Section 2.09 (b) of the Draft Loan Agreement). The Foreign
Exchange Control Department of the Reserve Bank would administer and process
the foreign exchange applications for imports to be financed out of the loan.
It has around 40 professional/clerical staff and is capable of handling these
additional responsibilities. During negotiations, agreement was reached thai:
Government would ensure that this Department would be adequately staffed
throughout the project life and that public and private importers alike shall
have adequate assistance in preparing tender documents (Section 3.03 of the
Draft Loan Agreement.)
70.       Because of the country's urgent need, it is proposed to permit
retroactive financing of eligible imports paid for on or after a date three
months prior to Board Presentation up to an amount not exceeding US$4.5



-   34  -
million equivalent or 10 percent of the loan amount. No reimbursement would
be made for imports for which other sources of financing have been secured.
Disbursements should be completed within 9 months from effectiveness.
71.       All imports would be processed from Bank member countries, Switzer-
land and Taiwan. All procurement would be through normal commercial channels,
except in the case of contracts costing over US$3 million which would be
procured through broad international tendering among suppliers from the
Bank's member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan with contracts awarded to the
lowest responsive bidder. The contracts would be subject to ex post review,
that is, a brief report containing evidence that each was let in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, would be submitted prior to or with withdrawal
requests. We expect that over 75 percent of the transactions will be for
smaller items procured through normal commercial channels. Only a very few
individual transactions would be likely to exceed US$3 million and to attract
international interest. They are likely to be for commodity procurement,
principally, fertilizer fuel, and pharmaceuticals. Regarding fertilizer and
pharmaceuticals, Malawi already has well established tendering procedures
which are overseen by either the Medical Buying Board or by OPTICHEM, res-
pectively. Transactions are widely advertised and bidding is highly competi-
tive.  Regarding fuel, supplies are obtained several months in advance through
limited competitive shopping among various suppliers.
Benefits and Risks
72.       The principal benefit of the loan is that it provides support and
encouragement to a program of medium-term structural adjustment aimed at
restoring economic growth and financial stability. This program, as outlined
earlier, is based on the Government-s strategy for agricultural diversifica-
tion, promotion of agro-industrial exports and efficient import substitution
(fuel as well as manufactured goods). The direct support comes through
provision of additional foreign exchange resources which will allow the
Government more room to maneuver in implementing the needed policy and insti-
tutional changes. Equally important, however, is the fact that the loan has
provided an effective vehicle for an ongoing dialogue on economic policy and
for the provision of technical assistance, that is, the funding of studies
under a separate technical assistance project.
73.       The principal risk of the loan relates to the capacity of the
Government to implement the program in its entirety. Shortages of trained
personnel in the civil service jeopardizes not only the timely implementation
of the Government-s new public investment program but also of policy and
institutional reforms envisaged in the program. Moreover, the pricing and
incomes policies and proposed tariff increases may meet with resistance
from affected parties.
IV. BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
74.       Over the past 15 years Malawi has received 23 IDA credits totalling
US$257.2 million and four Bank loans totalling US$29.2 million, of which two



- 35 -
were on Third Window terms. Of the total Bank Group assistance, US$98.2
million (34 percent) was for agriculture, US$37.8 million (13 percent) for
power development, US$73.4 million (26 percent) for education, US$65 million
(23 percent) for roads, US$3 million (1 percent) for a development finance
company (INDEBANK) and the balance of US$9 million (3 percent) for water
supply and to finance feasibility studies for a pulp mill at Viphya. The
first Bank loan to Malawi was made on Third Window terms in June 1976 and the
first standard Bank loan in April 1977. The most recent IDA credit, SDR 32.2
million (US$41.0 million equivalent) for a fourth education project to develop
secondary education was approved on March 26, 1981 and is expected to become
effective in August 1981. IFC's investments in Malawi consist of a loan of
US$6 million made in 1976 for a textile mill, another of US$9.5 million for
sugar development in 1977, a US$0.6 million equity investment in INDEBANK in
1979, and a US$2.0 million loan to Malawi Hotels Limited for tourism in 1979.
A US$262,000 equity investment and a loan of US$1.7 million for the production
of ethanol from molasses were approved on July 29, 1980. A summary statement
of Bank Group operations and notes on the execution of ongoing projects are
provided in Annex II. Project implementation has been fully satisfactory.
75.       During the next five years, Bank Group assistance to Malawi will
be closely tailored to Malawi's structural adjustment needs and to increasing
agricultural productivity. The third phase of the NRDP, to help raise agricul-
tural production in the north, has already been appraised and the fourth phase
of NRDP is under preparation. A second equity investment to INDEBANK is
planned and possible investments in energy, health, agro-industry and water
supply (phase II) are being investigated. Additional assistance for education
and for structural adjustment are also expected to figure prominently over the
next several years. The Bank Groups economic and sector work will continue to
provide support to the lending program by focusing on key sectoral issues
affecting the economy: agricultural financing and production; assessing the
most cost-effective approaches to providing social services; investigating
energy investment opportunities; and public sector management.
V. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
76.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Malawi and the
Bank and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the loan are
listed in Annex III. The condition of disbursement of the second tranche is
that the Government shall be making satisfactory progress in carrying out
commitments undertaken in its Letter of Development Policy and in executing iLts
structural adjustment program (paragraph B of Preamble, and Schedule 3 of draft
Loan Agreement).
77.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

VI. RECOMMENDATION
78.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. BANK PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. S-17-MAI      Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0
Million Credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effective-
ness: August 28, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project helps determine the infrastructural requirements
and provides technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest
resources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed. Part of the credit proceeds that
remained were used to assist in putting together a financial package for
the proposed mill. The package is still incomplete, however, and the pro-
posed project is still being analyzed by the Government. The Closing Date
was extended to June 30, 1981.
Credit No. 523-MAI       Second Highway Project; US$10.0 Million Credit
of December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness;
February 21, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project consists of reconstructing to two-lane bituminous
paved standard the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (about 70 miles), including a
bypass around the Lilongwe industrial area and reconstructing the Ligadzi
bridge; and a pilot program in one district for improving development and
maintenance of district roads. Construction works for the main road are
complete and savings of approximately US$3.5 million were realized for this
component. Results from the pilot program for district roads improvement
and maintenance indicate clearly that the program has been successful and
that it is feasible to extend it to other districts. The savings from the
reconstruction component are being used to extend the pilot program to three
additional districts; accordingly the Credit Agreement was amended by letter
of June 9, 1978 and the Closing Date was extended to June 30, 1982.
Credit No. 590-MAI       Second Education Project; US$11.6 Million Credit
of November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness;
February 24, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project provides for constructing 22 model primary schools
as examples for replication by communities and facilities at the schools
for a rural education program; it establishes a new primary teacher college;
adds practical subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on
facilities to increase female enrollment. As costs permitted, the project
scope was enlarged to include computer facilities for the Malawi Certificate
Examination and Testing Board and additional staff housing. All contracts
have been awarded and, except for minor additional construction at a number
of primary schools, the project has been substantially completed. At the
Government's request the Bank Group recently extended the Closing Date to
December 31, 1981 to permit completion of all contracts.

Loan No. 1286-MAI        Second Karonga Rural Development Project;
US$9.2 Million Loan of June 24, 1976; Date of
Effectiveness: August 18, 1976; Closing Date
December 31, 1981
The project, financed on Third Window terms, consists of seasonal-
and medium-term credit to farmers, extension service, market complexes,
health facilities, boreholes and other infrastructural facilities, agri-
cultural and hydrological research, preparatory investments for the National
Rural Development Programme, and rehabilitation of berthing facilities at
Chipoka Lake terminal. Improvement of Chipoka harbor has been completed.
Although understaffing hampers implementation efficiency and small cost
increases have occurred, the project's progress is satisfactory.
Credit No. 711-MAI       Blantyre Water Supply Project; US$7.0 Million
Credit of June 3, 1977; Date of Effectiveness;
April 18, 1978; Closing Date: March 31, 1982
Initial delays in project implementation occurred due to revision of
the project's scope, but implementation is now proceeding reasonably well.
Detailed engineering is substantially complete; bid documents have been issued
and awards made on three of the four contracts being financed by the Associa-
tion with the award of the fourth contract expected shortly. However, due to
the initial delay, commissioning of the works is now scheduled for late 1982,
rather than December 1980 estimated at appraisal.
Credit No. 758-MAI       Third Highway Project; US$10.5 Million Credit of
January 18, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: June 29,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The project consists of constructing the 52-mile Kasungu-Jenda
road to two-lane bituminous surfaced standard; strengthening three short
sections of the Zomba-Lilongwe road; and providing consultant services
for the supervision of the roads, and for the feasibility and engineering
studies of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. Construction works on the Kasungu-Jenda
road are almost completed, and strengthening works on the Zomba-Lilongwe
road are well underway. Studies for the Jenda-Mzuzu road are nearing
completion, and consultants are preparing tender documents.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 823-MAI       Shire Valley Agricultural Consolidation Project;
US$10.7 Million Credit of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: September 6, 1978; Closing Date
December 31, 1982
The project is the consolidation phase of the Shire Valley Agri-
cultural Development Programme and includes extension services to support
increased cotton and foodcrop production, seed multiplication and afforesta-
tion programs, production credit, livestock and fisheries development, health
and potable water supply facilities, a smallholder irrigation development
study and some rural roads. It will provide social and infrastructure
services to about 70,000 families. The Valley attained self-sufficiency
in food crops for the first time in its history in 1977/78. Cotton produc-
tion also regained the levels attained in the early 1970s. Guar bean pro-
duction is rising rapidly, but groundnut production is declining. The
project had a slow start because of staffing shortages and procurement
delays. Although steps have been taken to improve staffing, it remains
a problem, with inadequate middle level staff and delays in replacement of
senior staff. Civil works and road construction, although somewhat behind
schedule, are proceeding well. Production estimates for cotton and maize for
1979/80 show a further decrease from 1977/78 and 1978/79 levels, while guar
beans have continued to increase. Apart from maize and guar, the areas
planted to crops decreased, and a severe drought from December 1979 through
March 1980 also affected yields.
Loan No. 1610-MAI         Investment and Development Bank of Malawi Limited;
US$3.0 Million Loan of July 7, 1978; Date of
Effectiveness: November 1, 1978; Closing Date:
July 1, 1983
The project provides foreign exchange for financing medium- to
large-scale industrial and agro-industrial investments, and will help
INDEBANK consolidate its policies and procedures and develop project
promotion. To date, US$1.3 million has been committed for three sub-
projects and US$0.8 million has been disbursed for three sub-projects.
More commitments are expected shortly.
Credit No. 857-MAI       National Rural Development Programme Project
Phase-I; US$22.0 Million Credit of December 21,
1978; Date of Effectiveness: April 5, 1979;
Closind Date: September 30, 1983
The project is assisting the Government in implementing the first
phase of Malawi's National Rural Development Programme. Over a five-year
period it aims to increase output of maize, groundnuts, fire-cured tobacco
and rice, and expand milk and meat production. It will strengthen the
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources' Central Service, four existing
Management Units and establish eight new development areas. It will also
complete the consolidation phase of the Lilongwe Land Development Programme.
The project is cofinanced by CIDA, DEG, EDF, and ODM. It is proceeding
satisfactorily except for staffing and recurrent financing problems which are
being addressed within the context of the Structural Adjustment Loan.

Phase II (Wood Energy); US$13.8 Million Credit of
April 25, 1980; Date of Effectiveness:  June 9, 1980;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project is assisting the Government in its long-term energy
development program aimed at increasing forest resources. It will establish
a national network of 88 nurseries to produce seedlings for sale to small-
holders, who will be encouraged to establish their own woodlots; fuelwood
and pole plantations to help meet increasing demands from the commercial and
industrial sectors, as well as from urban dwellers; and an energy unit in
the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
It will finance preinvestment activities for launching NRDP phase III.
Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
Credit No. 1099-MAI      Fourth Highway Project; US$33.0 million equivalent
(SDR 25.9 million) of February 20, 1981; Date of
Effectiveness: July 22, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984
The project is assisting the Government in developing the economic
potential of the Northern Region by constructing and improving the major
unpaved sections of the principal North-South road. In addition, the project
will promote the maintenance of the main, secondary and district road networks
and provides consultant services and training. The Closing Date was extended
from April 22 to July 22 because no legal opinion has yet been provided by the
Government.  It is expected shortly.  Tendering for the construction of the
major paved road sections plus improvements of the existing road between
Luwawa Turnoff and Mlowe zo a low gravel standard has recently been completed
and contracts will be awarded to the lowest bidder shortly. Implementation is

LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICIES
Mr. Robert S. McNamara
President
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development
1818 "H" Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
Dear Mr. McNamara:
1.        A sharp decline in Malawi's terms of trade has resulted in a
serious deterioration of our economy. The drop in the prices of principal
exports, namely tobacco and tea, after 1977 was accompanied by rapidly
accelerating import prices and greater transport costs. As a result, in 1980,
GDP growth declined to only 0.6 percent and real income fell by 1.5 percent.
2.        The crisis has highlighted a number of structural problems which
call for immediate action. The most serious problems are the relatively
slow growth of smallholder production, heavy reliance on a few primary com-
modities to earn foreign exchange, the modern sector's dependence on imported
oil, financial weaknesses of the statutory corporations, deteriorating Govern-
ment budgetary position, and growing imbalance between Government recurrent
and capital expenditure. However, we believe that the country's large agri-
cultural and forestry resources would provide a basis for sustained future
growth, through expanding exports and efficiently substituting local produc-
tion for imports.
GOVERNMENT'S ACTION PROGRAM
3.        To deal with these problems, the Government has formulated a medium--
term program of structural adjustment covering 1981/82-1985/86. The program
includes measures to (i) improve the country's balance of payments; (ii)
streamline the system of price and wage controls; (iii) improve resource
management and (iv) to strengthen public sector institutions.
4.        Balance of Payments:  Despite the sizeable public investments in
smallholder agriculture over the past ten years, smallholder exports have
stagnated. The structure of producer prices has certainly played an important
role. In 1978, an interministerial price advisory committee was set up to
monitor the impact of producer prices. The committee completed one compre-
hensive price review in 1980. The Government will institutionalize the
practice by annually reviewing crop prices and these will be worked out in a
manner designed to maximize national income. In accordance with its normal
procedures, the Government will announce its price decision for each crop year
before the planting season.



- 53 -
ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 4
5.        The performance of Malawi's tobacco industry will remain critical
to the economy from the standpoint of generating foreign exchange and employ-
ment. The Government proposes to carry out a major study that will define
the current position of the tobacco industry, identify probable trends and
facilitate recommendations for improving the efficiency of estate operations in
the country.
6.        With the intention of promoting agricultural diversification, the
Government plans to carry out a study to consolidate its knowledge of live-
stock products industries, particularly relating to supply and demand as well
as cost structure for production and marketing.
7.        In the area of energy, the Government has limited the consumption of
petroleum through price/tax policies and sought to develop new sources through
investments. The Government intends to carry out a comprehensive energy
sector study in order to assess available resources, project future demand and
supply and examine alternative sources of energy and the possibilities for
intrasectoral substitution.
8.        Price Controls and Wage Policy:  Setting adequate prices is import-
ant for providing incentives for current production as well as providing the
necessary stimulus for capital formation for maintaining and expanding output.
It is the Government's intention to adjust tariffs on a regular basis and to
make smaller and more frequent adjustments to prices. At the same time, it is
recognized that, as with prices, wages and salaries should be reviewed on a
regular basis. Whenever possible, gradual and more frequent adjustment will
be made to wages to reflect the opportunity cost of labor.
9.        Resource Management:  To achieve targets for growth and structural
change in a highly constrained financial environment, it will be necessary
to use private and public resources as efficiently as possible. In the
five-year development program, Government intends to deploy its revenue and
development account resources to maximize its contribution to national objec-
tives. On development account, low priority items will be dropped and
resources reallocated to key sectors such as agriculture, education, health
and transport. Moreover, the Government has given priority to completing
ongoing projects over undertaking of new investments. During the coming
five years, the Government will continue to review the composition of the
investment program as part of its regular budgetary process and keep the
Bank informed about the results of these reviews.
10.       By the end of the 1970s, it had become apparent that the method
used in determining recurrent account allocations needed to be reviewed. In
the future, the Government will intensify its efforts to increase alloca-
tions to recurrent operations to provide adequate support for the develop-
ment program. While financial constraints may inhibit progress at first,
projections suggest that revenue expansion should be adequate to compen-
sate for inflation and provide for real expansion of recurrent services in
key economic and social sectors such as agriculture and education, as implied
by the Government's planned development programs.

ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 4
11.       In addition, as economic recovery leads to rising economic activity
and profits, the Government will take steps to insure that revenues will rise
as fast as possible. To achieve this objective, the Government will review
its tax administration and introduce new taxes as opportunities arise. It
also will make more frequent adjustments in specific rates and departmental
charges to compensate for inflation. The Government has introduced the
following measures in its 1981 budget: (a) an increase of 15 percent in all
specific import and excise duties; (b) an introduction of 10 percent tax on
hotel and restaurant services; and (c) an across the board tariff increase
of three percentage points. Government borrowing from the banking system will
be held to sufficiently low levels to permit credit to the private sector to
increase more rapidly and the country's foreign exchange reserves to build
up.
12.       Since future external capital requirements will expand with economnic
growth, the Government intends to restrict additional borrowing on commercial
terms and to manage the amounts and terms of borrowing so as to maintain
Malawi's external creditworthiness. Toward this objective, the Government in-
tends to strengthen its institutional capability for monitoring, recording,
and managing public and government guaranteed private debt.
13.       Overall, statutory bodies have made a significant contribution to
the economy and have in the aggregate generated enough profits to finance a
substantial part of their own investment. However, in the past two years,
the financial position of most of these public corporations has deteriorated
substantially, as a consequence of sharp increases in costs and debt service
obligations and a levelling off or decline in revenues. In November of 1980,
a Department of Statutory Bodies (DSB) was established in the office of the
President and Cabinet to monitor activities in all public enterprises. The
DSB, in cooperation with the Treasury, has already completed a review of the
recent performance and FY81-82 outlook for these enterprises. The DSB has
also started to provide assistance to various enterprises in their medium-
term financial planning.
14.       Substantial increases in tariffs have recently been put into effect
for several of the statutory bodies, e.g., Air Malawi, Malawi Railways, and
Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM). For all the public utilities the
Government plans in the future to make moderate tariff increases more fre-
quently in line with increased costs. It is also Government's objective
that all statutory bodies prepare medium-term financial plans annually.
15.       Institutional Improvements:  Government intends to strengthen its
institutional capability for planning, monitoring and managing its operations.
The Government has already created an Investment Coordinating Committee which
will monitor investments by private and public investments to ensure that
major project undertakings meet acceptable economic and financial criteria.
Other action being undertaken toward this end includes provision of increased
resources for the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Planning Division and the
National Statistical Office; and a series of studies designed to improve the
operations and finances of key institutions such as ADMARC, MDC and the MA.

16.       While the Governmant intends to pursue the policies outlined above,
we hope that we can count on the continued support of the international
community through project and additional program loans. To help the country
through a difficult period, the Government now specifically requests a
structural adjustment loan from the World Bank.
Sincerely yours,
L. Chakakala Chaziya
