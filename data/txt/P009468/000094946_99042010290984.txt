2. ENVIRONMENTAL INIPACT ASSESSMENT OF PROPOSED PROJECT
2.1 Project Setting
The proposed Fourth Fisheries Project is a follow-up project to the Third Fisheries Project. The project goal is to
directly improve the physical, biological and socioeconomic environments and conditions pertaining to the fisheries
sector. and indirectly benefit related sectors and communities. The principal project objective is to advance toward this
goal through focused infrastructure, environmental, technical, social and economic interventions in the various
fisheries subsectors. Specific project objectives are as follows:
1. Rehabilitate and enhance openwater floodplain fisheries.
2. Funher extend high yielding carp and prawn freshwater pond culture methods.
3. Improve infrastructure, extensive culture methods, and seed supply for brackishwater shrimp farmers,
4. Redefine and strengthen the capacity of government fisheries institutions and NGOs.
The methodology adopted for environmental assessment of the proposed project by the EIA Team consists of an
iterative process of information collection and fact finding (with emphasis on beneficiary group sources) to identify
environmental issues and possible solutions, analysis of potential impacts and identifications of mitigation measures,
reporting of preliminary results to beneficiary and interested groups, and modification of project design. The EIA
Team worked closely with the project component preparers to assess and comment on all aspects of project design
during the formulation phase.
The EIA Team consisted of the following individuals: Garry Bernacsek, International Environmental Specialist
(GLOBAL AQUATIC CORPORATION Pty Ltd. Sydney, Australia) and Yusuf Sharif Ahmed Khan, National
Environmental Specialist (Institute of Marine Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chittagong). The technical assistance
budget for the EIA was $ xxxxxxx, while the operational budget (EIA share out of total project preparation budget) for
fieldwork, meetings and materials was S xxxxxx. Person months allocated for the EIA  were International
Environmental Specialist (2 p/m) and National Environmental Specialist (4 p/m). The EIA was carried out during the
period 12 October 1997 to 28 February 1998, corresponding to the late monsoon and winter dry seasons.
Implementation of the EIA was constrained by inadequate allocation of personpower, budget and time.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Anznex 9: Environmental Assessmentt
2.2 Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework
The MOFL currently lacks a fisheries policy per se. A draft fisheries development policy has been prepared but has
yet to be adopted by the GOB. The Environmental Policy of the GOB was adopted in 1992. Specific policy measures
relevant to fisheries and fisheries environments include: Water Development, Flood Control and Irrigation, Land use,
Forest, Wildlife and Biodiversity protection, Fisheries and Livestock: Coastal and Marine Environment:. Institutional
Arrangements: DOE will make final review and approve all environmental impact assessments (ElAs).
Detailed EIA guidelines have been produced by the Department of Environment (DOE) but not for fisheries
development projects. FPCO guidelines for environmental impact assessment as representative of GOB EIA
requirements. The general environmental assessment guidelines of World Bank are contained in Operational Directive
4.01: Environmental Assessment (including Annexes A to F), dated October 1991. Additional detailed sectoral
guidelines for fisheries development projects are contained in World Bank Technical paper no 140: Environmental
Assessment Sourcebook, Vol 11: Sectoral Guidelines.
Environment-related projects and programs (outside of production activities) within the fisheries sector come under the
mandate of several GOB agencies: DOF, MOL, DOE, DOFr, BWDB, SWMC and WARPO, LGED, The Electricity
Board. The individual mandates of agencies sometimes overlap and conflict (for example MOL and DOF jurisdiction
over fisheries management) resulting in govermnent-induced inefficiency, inequity and conflict within the fisheries
sector.
2.3 Project Alternatives
A reasonable scenario of the future without project interventions is as follows (based on forward projection of existing
trends within the fisheries sector): Continuous decline and possible extinction of native carp stocks in most parts of the
country. Overfishing of fish overwintering areas and spawning areas resulting in heavy mortality of broodstock and
national extinction of some fish species; Continued siltation of rivers and access canals, resulting in reduced migration
of fish; Continued construction of FCDI projects without fishpass facilities resulting in further reduction of fish
migration and massive fish loss inside the project areas; Slow growth in productivity of pond culture; Decline in
vitalitv of fingerlings for pond stocking sourced from hatcheries; Overharvesting of shrimp seed from wild sources,
rcsulting in decline in shrimp stocks and catches, and declines in stocks of fish and other species present in seed by-
catch; Increased social conflict over use of private farm lands inside coastal polders for shrimp grow-out, due to lack
of control over activities of shrimp farmers; Increased insecurity of supply of larvae for shrimp and prawn farming,
resulting in erratic production, and imports of possibly diseased larvae from other countries; Slow growth in
productivity of prawn farming, and increased incidence of disease and mortality due to poor management practices;
Increasing rejection of exported shrimp by importing countries due to poor quality and inadequate hygiene standards at
shrimp depots and at processing plants; Increasingly ineffectual performance of fisheries institutions; Continuing
decline in fish biodiversity and local and national extinction of fish species; Continued degradation of fisheries
environments from deforestation, agrochemicals, dewatering, loop cutting of rivers, industrial effluence and water
hyacinth infestation; Increasing conflict between jalmohal leaseholders/capital investors and genuine fishermen over
access and tenure of openwater fisheries resources; Increasing incidence of disease pandemics in fish and crustacean
stocks, resulting in large economic and nutritional losses. The damage track of each subscenario will vary, but the
cumulative effect of all subscenarios is more likely than not to be quite significant.
An alternative approach to management and conservation of indigenous fish stocks and fisheries environments is to
focus entirely on openwater stocking with indigenous and non-indigenous species (while ignoring natural reproduction
and recruitment), and to meet any shortages in supply which may be develop through importation of cheap frozen food
fish (such as small pelagics from Chile and Peru). At the same time, increased consumption of other sources of protein
(pulses. poultry) could be promoted.
The approximate cost of the alternative proposed above would be as follows: $450,000,000. Not included in this
estimate are the social costs of displaced fishermen and fishing input suppliers, subsistence losses in terms of nutrition,
and costs of creating alternative employment for large numbers of people (1.2 million). This would substantially raise
the true cost of the alternative. The cost of the proposed project is $70,000,000, which is only 16% of the nominal



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
cost of the alternative. The analysis suggests that the alternative is not viable and should be rejected in favour of the
proposed project.
2.4 Project Description
The project is a capital loan project type which will be financed by the IDA. Additional sources of finance for
technical assistance will be sought from other donor agencies. The project is a fisheries development and conservation
project. It contains components which will improve the environment, increase production and increase product value.
A large portion will be in the form of credit and extension. Some infrastructure construction will also take place, for
fishpasses, canal re-excavation, prawn pond water supply and drainage, and prawn and shrimp hatcheries.
The proposed project will consists of the following components:
* Activities in Inland Openwater Capture Fisheries: Floodplain Stocking Component, Fish Sanctuaries
Component, Canal Re-excavation Component, Fishpass Construction Component.
* Activities in Freshwater Finfish Aquaculture: Intensive Pond Culture Demonstration and Credit
Component, Intensive Cage Culture Demonstration and Credit Component, Semi-Intensive Pen Culture
Demonstration and Credit Component, Broodstock and Hatchery Component, Contract Research
Component.
3 Activities in Crustacean and Brackishwater Aguaculture: Sustainable Shrimp Seed Collection Component,
Integrated Coastal Zone Planning Component, Private Hatcheries for Shrimp and Prawns Component,
Improved Freshwater Prawn Culture Component, Improved Shrimp Processing Practices Component.
* Activities in Institutional Development: Vocational School for Aquaculture Component, Fisheries
Management Information System Componenit, Environmental Management System Component, Seafood
Products Quality Control Improvement Component, Evaluation and Restructuring of Fisheries
Development Agencies Component, Evaluation and Restructuring of Fisheries Research Agencies
Component, Human Resources Development Component.
.  Activities in Environmental Manacement: Fish  Biodiversity  Conservation  Subproject, Fisheries
Environments Improvement Subproject, Community-Owned Fisheries Pilot Project, Fish and Shrimp
Disease Control Subproject, Water Quality and Quantity Monitoring Program Subproject.
2.5 Predicted Impacts
lIpacts in Inland Openwater Capture Fisheries
• Floodplain Stocking Component: This component has a potential for negative impact on native chotomach
species due to competition from stocked non-indigenous species. The degree of impact could depend on
stocking density, and possibly the quality of ancillary management efforts. There exists a potential for a
negative impact on the genetic diversity of wild stocks of indigenous carp species (rui, catla, mrigel) due
to stocking of large numbers of fingerlings of these species derived from relatively few hatchery resident
broodstock. The wild stocks of native carp are currently much reduced in abundance due to overfishing
and environmental degradation. Hatchery-produced fingerlings would likely greatly outnumber wild
fingerlings wherever large scale stocking of floodplains is carried out, and very quickly dilute wild genetic
diversity with less diverse hatchery gene pools. There exists a potential for a negative impact on wild fish
stocks by transmission of disease from hatchery stocks. Entry of new disease into Bangladesh through
importation of broodstock could result in new pandemics.
•  Fish Sanctuaries Component: No negative environmental impacts are expected from the establishment of
fish sanctuaries.
*  Canal Re-excavation Component: There exists a potential for a negative impact on the stored volume of
water in beels and baors during the dry season due to improved drainage capacity of the canal. This could
result in reduced area/volume of dry season refuge habitat for fish, increase environmental stress on fish
populations (liklely leading to outbreaks of disease and significant fish mortality) and increase the
probability that dewatering would be used to do a complete fish harvest.
* Fishpass Construction Component: There exists a minor potential for a negative impact on boro and aus
rice production during the premonsoon and early monsoon periods due to entry of water through the



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annze-r 9: Environrmental Assessment
fishpass into the FCDI project area. The magnitude of this potential impact is very variable and difficult to
predict, and in the majority of cases the impact will be nil.
mpacts in Freshwater Finfisi: Aquaculture
*  Intensive Pond Culture Demonstration and Credit Component: There exists a potential for negative
impacts on wild fish stocks in adjacent rivers and floodplains due to escapage of fish from ponds. The
impact can be in the form of disease transmission and/or in the form of establishment of undesirable non-
indigenous species in openwater habitats.
* Intensive Caoe Culture Demonstration and Credit Component: There exist potentials for negative impacts
which are similar to those noted above for the intensive pond culture component. The risk to native fish
stocks and aquatic habitat due to escapaee from cages into surrounding rivers, beels or baors is considered
to be greater than for ponds.
* Semi-Intensive Pen Culture Demonstration and Credit Component: There exist potentials for negative
impacts which are similar to those noted above for the inEensive cage culture component. The risk to
native fish stocks and aquatic habitat due to escapage from pens into seasonally connected rivers, beels or
baors is considered to be marginally greater than for ponds, but less than for cages.
*  Broodstock and lHatcherv Component: There exists a,potential for negative impacts on wild fish stocks as
well as pond stock due to disease transmission, especially new diseases brought in by imported
broodstock.
- Contract Research Component: There exists a moderate potential for negative impacts on wild fish stocks
throueh disease transmission or competition with non-indigenous species resulting from escapage or
deliberate dumping of fish into Ehe natural environment.
mpnacts in Crustacean and Brackishwater Aquaculture
* Sustainable Shrimp Seed Collection Component: No negative environmental impacts are expected from
this component. an increase in stock abundance.
*  lnteprated Coastal Zone Planning Component: No negative environmental impacts are expected from this
component.
* Private Hatcheries for Shrimp and Prawns Component: There exists a potential for a negative impact on
farm and wild shrimp and prawn stocks by transmission of disease from hatchery stocks.
- Improved Freshwater Prawn Culture Component: There exists a potential for negative impacts on water
quantity and quality from increased water supply and drainage of prawn ponds. The pumping of
groundwater through tubewells for pond water supply in areas where insufficient surface water exists
could result in depletion of freshwater and intrusion of saline water into the groundwater aquifer. The
discharge of metabolic waste products during pond drainage could have a negative effect on receiving
waters. There also exists a potential for negative impacts on wild snail populations which are used for
food for prawns. The largest fraction of prawn feed is made up of snail meat. Expansion of prawn
farming has increased the harvesting rate of snails from natural sources. This has resulted in depletion of
some snail populations, and supplies are now augmented with illegal imports from India.

Inmpacts Associated with Natural Plhysical Environment
I.Beel and Baor Hvdrologv: Increased drainage and/or dewatering of beels and baors due to improved
channel flow capacity from canal re-excavation, leading to reduced dry season refuge habitat and increased
mortality of overwintering fish stocks.
2.FCDI Proiect Hvdrologv: Marginal increase of water level inside FCDI projects due to entry of water into
area through fishpass during premonsoon and early monsoon floods, possibly threatening some rice crops
planted around margin of internal beels and lowlying areas.
3.Water Course Eutrophicatin: Variable degree of eutrophication of natural water courses from pen and cage
culture and from prawn farms due to overfeeding and metabolic waste products excretion.
4.Groundwater Extraction: Depletion of freshwater groundwater supply and intrusion of saline water due to
use of tubewells as water supply to prawn farms situated near coastal areas.
Impacts Associated with Natural Biological Environment
5.Submerved Macrophvtes: Decrease in submerged macrophyte abundance in beels and baors due to stocking
of grass carp and common carp, leading to decline in chotomach abundance and catch.
6.Competition for Plankton: Decrease in abundance of indigenous plankton-eating fish in beels, baors and
floodplains due to competition from stocked non-indigenous planktivorous carp (silver, bighead).
7.Genetic DivCrsitv: Loss of genetic diversity in wild major carp stocks (rui, catla, mrigel) on floodplains due
to dilution from stocking with hatchery reared stock of limited genetic diversity.
8.Disease Transmission: Fish and crustacean disease transmission resulting in pandemics of new diseases or
re-infection with existing diseases of wild and cultured fish and crustacean stocks: a) from hatcheries
during stocking of floodplains or aquaculture grow-out facilities with disease animals, b) from hatcheries
due to importation of new broodstock which is diseased, and c) from escapage or deliberate dumping of
diseased animals from hatcheries, aquaculture ponds, floating cages or pens.
9.Snail Stock Depletion. Overharvesting of snail populations used for prawn feed, and transmission of
diseases from illegally imported snails from India.
Impacts Associated with Socio-Economic Environment
1O.Disenfranchisement: Displacement of some fishermen from the areas designated as fish sanctuaries
(including access channels of fishpasses) and the areas used for pen culture.
I I.Navication: Interference with navigation routes in areas used for pen culture.

2.6 Information Deficiencies and Requirements
Comprehensive assessment and quantification of the 11 principal potential project impacts that have been identified is
not readily possible. Reliable quantification is hampered by lack of information.
2.7 Cumulative Impact Assessment
Project Area Impacts
Improved drainage through canal excavation could put stress on dry season beel and baor water volumes, that would
be intensified by further water extraction by farmers for boro rice irrigation. This could increase the likelihood that
dewatering for complete fish harvesting would be carried out because of the low cost of pumping out the small amount
of water remaining.
The water entering into an FCDI project through a fishpass might be sufficient to cause increased crop damage if
accompanied by simultaneous sustained heavy rainfall inside the project area.
Groundwater extraction for aquaculture would be additive to existing groundwater extraction for crop irrigation and
other water supply uses such as for domestic and industrial applications. The effect would be to more rapidly deplete
groundwater aquifers, resulting in possible lowering of water tables, aquifer exhaustion and/or saline water intrusion.
A complex of factors negatively impact native chotomach and planktivorous fish stocks, including FCDI development,
deforestation, agrochemicals, industrial pollution, sedimentation, disease, overfishing and dewatering. This has already
led to heavy pressure on many populations resulting in local stock depletion. Intensified openwater fisheries stocking
could lead to further pressure on these fish stocks and accelerate stock collapse.
Both natural and culture fish and crustacean stocks have suffered severe disease outbreaks during the last decade (ie
EUS. white spot). This has resulted in major economic and nutritional losses in the past. The transmission of new
discases or mutated strains of existing diseases would lead to further economic and nutritional losses in the future.
WVorldwide Climate Change
There is an increasing trend in rainfall in some parts of Bangladesh and the surrounding catchment region over the Iasi
30 years. This is leading to intensified and more prolonged flooding. The cumulative impact of increased flooding with
project impacts is mainly in the greater impact on rice cultivation inside FCDI projects due to greater head differences
across fishpasses (leading to increased discharge through the structure).
Upper Riparian Activities
Increasing deforestation in the catchments (especially in India and Nepal) of the main rivers of Bangladesh will furthez
intensify fish an systemic flooding and sedimentation. An increase in water pollution from human sewage anc
industrial development can also be expected. Cumulative impacts in combination with project externalities will be or
hydrology (as per the previous paragraph), and on water quality (derived from aquaculture discharges).
Lowrer Riparian Pollution Transport
Water course eutrophication from aquaculture would be additive to eutrophication and pollution from other sources
Aquaculture discharge water could contain high biological oxygen demand from uneaten food, nitrogen and ammoni.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
from metabolic wastes, and toxic or otherwise harmful chemicals from biocides, lime and other pond preparation and
treatment measures. The cumulative effect could be to render water courses unfit for aquatic life for some distance
downstream.
Cutmulative Impacts Relevant to Otlher Regions
Large-picture cumulative impacts of the proposed project in association with the major environmental issues of
Bangladesh is related to population growth. Increase in urban population (Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong) - bolstered by
in-migration of increasing number of rural landless people - will lead to greater demand and more intensive mining of
fish resources in the mainly rural project area to provide food for the relatively wealthier urban population. Thus the
principal desirable impact of the project (increased food fish production and better nutrition) could feed back
negatively to the environment in the form of increased fishery resource exploitation pressure.
An increasing population that relies heavily for food on the intensified fish production that the project aims to achieve
would be put at greater risk if production was disrupted by natural disasters such as the cyclones and floods that
Bangladesh is particularly prone to, or by outbreaks of new and highly virulent diseases. Increased risk would appear
to be inherent to some degree in intensification of fish production. Intensification of production is more sustainable if
adequate precautions are taken to minimise risk.

Summarn of Concerns
Praun..fantmrs: Most of the farms are not services by supply and drainage canals and dependent on monsoon rain
water. There is no link canal with river and culture area. Use of snail meat as feed has sharply depressed the natural
population of snails, and consequently the price increase of snails is hampering prawn production. Poor ponc
management practices result in low yields. Farmers do not have technical knowledge about pond construction, ponc
preparation, pond management, stocking and feed management. After harvesting the crop, farmers do not have an)
employment opportunities for about four months, and remain idle. Farmers sell their products to depot owners ant
middleman at low price because they borrow money from them for stocking.
Shrimp farmers: Scarcity of Bagda fry and high prices. Scarcity of low priced protein feeds. Large-area  lant
utilisation but comparatively low productivity. Farmers do not have adequate technical knowledge for bettei
production of shrimp crops. Production has collapsed due to outbreak of white spot disease during the last two years.
Semi-intensive farms of Khulna and Chittagong were badly affected by disease outbreaks and are presently practicini
culture of Thai pangas. In some areas of Khulna region, farmers are allowed to take lease of land for only one or twc
years, and as a result farmers cannot construct permanent embankanents, canals and regulators. In Polder 5 (Khuln;
region), due to constructional defect of the sluice gate, one way flow of water through the sluice gate, and conflic
over the primary water supply canal, farmers are deprived of water intake into culture ponds resulting in lo'
production About 15 sluice gates of Third Fisheries are defective and remain closed due to silting up. Security is;



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annlex 9: Environmental Assessment
major problem. In many areas there are no police stations. At many farms there is no electricity. Farms of remote
areas do not get ice. As a result quality of the product deteriorates during transportation to depots or processing plants.
Instruments, chemicals and fertilisers are not available near farm sites. Skilled manpower is not readily available. In
the Cox's Bazar area, the farmers do not have any employment opportunity for about six months after harvesting the
crop. Polluted water is used by the semi-intensive farms located at the bank of Bankkhali River (Cox's Bazar),
resulting in problems in culturing shrimp. An incentive or prize should be awarded to good farmers. Instructional
booklets should be published on different aspects of shrimp culture. A separate brackishwater division of the DOF
should be set up to deal with shrimp culture and coastal environments. A Fishery Bank should be established. More
cyclone shelters should be constructed. In Paikgacha area, some Bagda farmers cut BWDB embankments and
introduce saline water for farming practice without any permission from the concerned department.
Shrimp fry collectors: The shrimp fry collectors in Khulna region who use push nets destroy other planktonic
organisms in contrast to the fry collectors who use boats. The latter do not destroy other organisms, but rather release
them back to the water). The fry collectors sell their fry to middle at a cheap rate. Many fry collectors do not have
their own nets. They borrow nets from middlemen and are compelled to sell their collected fry to the middlemen at a
very cheap rate. The farmers do not have the facility to store and to keep the fry alive for a considerable to keep the
fry alive for longer time periods. Fry are stored in a pot without any feed or aeration system. Echinoderms, sand
dollar, starfish and other intertidal organisms of the intertidal zone have been destroyed due to collection of shrimp fry
activity.
Fisherv Officers, Research Officers and other personnel. In Golda farming, the farmers use large quantities of snail
meat and as a result natural snail populations have declined, and snails are illegally imported without quarantine.
Golda farmers use their prepare loose feed using rice bran and fish dust which sometimes pollutes the pond water.
Presently there is no relevant policy and legislation for shrimp culture in the country. Conflicts between shrimp culture
and agriculture should not damage social harmony. Shrimp farmers, shrimp fry collectors and fishermen should be
provided with training in their respective fields. Kenduar beel and other beels should be protected from shrimp culture
and paddy production. Shrimp hatcheries should be established both by the GOB and private sector. For shrimp
farming, water supply and drainage systems should be developed. Electricity should be provided to shrimp farms.
Shrimp culture areas for Golda and Bagda should be identified on the basis of site selection criteria, and land size
should be determined and allocated to an actual farmer. Depots should be established with the permission of the
concerned GOB office, and hygiene and sanitation should be inspected periodically. Sufficient numbers of insulated
vans should be provided for rapid transport and marketing of fishery products. Laboratories should be established in
each district head quarter to expand analysis facilities. Some NGOs sell medicine and chemical under different trade
names to illiterate shrimp farmers to solve their problems. GOB should investigate the matter so that poor farmers are
not cheated. Due to brackishwater shrimp culture, paddy production is reduced, trees are destroyed, drinking water is
scarce, and grazing fields for livestock are limited. To conserve the habitat and biodiversity, a 0.5 km wide zone
around St Martin's Island should be declared a sanctuary. The depth of the Bankkhali River has decreased by 50%
since 1984 due to siltation. At Kasturi Ghat of the river, there previously were abundant stocks of oysters, sea
anemone, crabs and other animals, but the habitat has since been destroyed due to pollution, siltation, proliferation of
trawlers, and human disturbance. Previously, fishes (bhetki, mullet, grouper) were abundant, but the fish resources
have now declined due to these causes. Hundreds of fishermen catch coral fish during rough weather with hand lines,
and as a result the coral fish around St Martin's Island have declined. Fishermen catch fishes in rock pools situated
between Cox's Bazar and Teknaff using rotenone. During collection of monodon fry, the average catch composition is
one monodon fry for 38 other shrimp species, 56 zooplankton and 12 fmfish larvae. The composition varies from
place to place. Around 20% undesired species are released back to water and about 20% by-catch are thrown to beach.
Frv mortality is 30%-50% during holding at collection sites and transport to culture sites.
Fishermen and local residents of Dakatia Beel: Paddy does not grow when the water level is high in the beel. Out of 3
sluice gates, only one is in operation and two were closed due to deposition of heavy silt at the bottom of the gate. The
Shalu River should be excavated to reduce water logging in the beel. Local fishermen and paddy cultivators are facing
difficulties to raise their desired crop and would like to cut the embankment so that tidal water flushes the beel. The
embankments of the Bhanad Bhayane and Khukshia beels of Jessore district were cut in different areas just a few days
before the field visit to Dakatia Beel by the local farmers to allow tidal water to enter.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Fishermen of baors: Do not want to establish a fish sanctuary as it would interfere with their fishing method.
Disturbed by miscreants during harvesting. Farmers pump out water from baor for cultivation of boro paddy and
mustered plants. Some baors are partly covered with water hyacinth. Some sluice gates are defective and not in
operation.
FCDI Projects: Before the establishment of Muhuri FCDI project of Feni, the fishermen used to catch more fish and
shrimp than the present day. At the present time, more shrimp and fish are available on the freshwater side than the
brackishwater side of the barrage. Migration of shrimp and fish have been negatively affected due to establishment of
the barrage. Before the establishment of Chandpur FCDI project, lots of shrimp and fish were available, but now
stocks have declined. A massive infestation of water hyacinth blocks the gate area.
River Fishermsen: In the past large numbers of fishes were present but presently the catch has declined. Fish stock
reduction in ihe river is due to the following causes: a) overfishing and no new recruitment, b) use of pesticide in the
agricultural fields, c) discharge of waste by the industries, d) depth of water reduced due to siltation, and e) increased
turbidity in the river water.
St Martin's Island: There is scarcity of ice and cold storage. There is scarcity of drinking water during the fishing
season. There is no fish landing centre and all fish processing and marketing activities are made directly on the sandy
beach in unsanitary conditions. During drying of fish insecticides are applied to combat infestation with mites and
flies. There is a security problem during catching of fish in the sea and during the return journey to the island with
fish. On the east coast, starfish, sea anemones, sand dollars and other animals have become extinct due to human
activities on the shore. Turtles used to come at night to lay eggs in the north-east part of the island but now they do not
come due to human disturbance. Now they lay their eggs at the southern part of the island.
Summary of Response to Concerns and Actions to be Taken
c  Prawn farmers would benefit from link canals from rivers to culture area, low cost protein feeds,
technical assistance, training, employment during the low season and soft-term credit facility.
•  Shrimp farmers would benefit from better availability of fry for stocking, low priced protein feeds, better
management of the ponds, control of diseases, long term lease of GOB land, efficient and functional sluice
gates and regulators for water supply, security measures, electricity, supply of ice in remote areas,
instruments, chemicals, fertilisers, skilled manpower, control of water pollution, incentive to good
farmers, publication of instructional booklets, establishment of a brackishwater division in the DOF, a
fishery bank, cyclone shelters and employment opportunities during the low season.
.  Proper policy and legislation should be adopted for shrimp culture. Shrimp culture area should be
identified. Selling of unknown medicine to the farmers should be controlled and depots should be
registered.
*  A sanctuary should be established around St Martin's Island to halt the decline of coral fish stocks. Illegal
fishing of the rock pools between Cox's Bazar and Teknaf needs to be controlled.
*  Beels should be protected for shrimp and paddy cultivation.
*  Shrimp fry collectors would benefit from low priced country boat, nets,, storing facility with feed and
accretion system and direct supply of fries to culturists.
*  The crab fishery should be provided with logistic support for development.
Specific actions that should be taken are: In prawn farming areas where there are no facilities for water exchange, link
canals should be excavated. Research should be conducted to develop low cost protein feeds for prawns and shrimp.
Farmers should be periodically trained in basic and modern culture methods. DFOs and TFOs should be trained in
culture methods and in the handling of analytical instruments both in the laboratory and in the field. Farmers should be
provided with booklets in Bangla covering different aspects of culture and technical assistance according to their needs
by fisheries officers and NGOs. For the steady supply of shrimp fry, hatcheries should be established in Cox's Bazar
and Khulna. Sanctuaries should be established in different regions of coastal areas and off the coast to protect shrimp
broodstock. To implement control measures for shrimp and fish diseases, a survey should be undertaken to determine
the types of diseases present, and mitigation measures should be undertaken in consultation with disease experts.
Inoperative sluice gates should be repaired, and all sluice gates should capable of providing intake and discharge. The



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmenttal Assessment
actions should be done in consultation with the engineers concerned. The GOB should provide security, electricity,
instruments, chemicals, skilled labour, incentives to productive farmers, a fishery bank, and cyclone shelters in the
coastal area. The GOB should establish a separate Marine Directorate Office for marine fisheries. All industries
discharging solid and liquid waste to the environment should be required to carry out primary treatment at the
minimum. Pesticides should be controlled through policy and proper legislation. Shrimp fry collectors should be
provided with logistic, support and training so that they do not destroy the by-catch. Insulated vans should be provided
to transport shrimp and fish from ponds to processing plants. Laboratories should be established for soil and water
analysis at divisional headquarters. Proper policy should be adopted for shrimp culture. Depots (where shrimp and
prawns are purchased and stored) should be registered and inspected for hygiene and quality of shrimp and prawns.
Afforestation programmes should be undertaken for mangrove vegetation along the coast as soon as possible. The
number of fishermen and fisherwomen catching fish from rocks pools and coral areas along the coast should be
controlled. Logistic support should be provided to the crab fishery. Programmes should be undertaken to clear water
hyacinth frofn haors, baors, beels, barrow pits, FCDI projects and other infested waters. Some small rivers and canals
should be re-excavated. Security at sea should be strengthened. A fish landing centre should be established at St
Martin's Island. Steps should be taken to protect turtles laying eggs on St Martin's Island. Policy and legislation
should be promulgated to protect coral reefs and seaweed beds off St Martin's Island. Research activities should be
distributed among the universities of the country rather than FRI because little substantial research activities are
undertaken at Chandpur, Paiklgaacha and Cox's Bazar FRI stations. MOFL and DOF should have advisory panels of
knowledgeable. fisheries experts to provide suggestions, evaluate research activities and monitor different fishery
programmes.
2.9 Environmental Management Plan
Proposed Mitigation Measures
• Beel and Baor Hydrology: The potential for beel and baor draining due to channel flow capacity
increasing after canal re-excavation will be reduced through the following measures: Bed elevations in the
canal, the adjacent river and the beel/baor will be carefully measured during the feasibility and design
study. The new re-excavation bed level of the canal will be set at an appropriate level to prevent beellbaor
dewatering. A water regulation structure will be installed at the beellbaor outlet to the canal. The
regulator will be closed during the late monsoon drainage period in order to conserve the water level in
the beel or baor at the highest possible level at the start of the dry season. It will be opened at the start of
the premonsoon period to allow river water and/or fish to enter the beel or baor.
* FCDI Project Hvdrologv: The possible threat to rice cultivation due to entry of water inside FCDI projects
through a fishpass will be reduced through the following measures: Study of river hydrology, FCDI
project hydrology and potential fish traffic through structure, and adjustment of pool number and pool,
baffle and slot dimensions to minimise discharge volume through fishpass. The fishpass will be equipped
with gates at either end which will be closed whenever a threat to agriculture materialises. The operator of
the fishpass will remain responsive to the concerns of the farming community, and respond positively if
farmers feel their crops are threatened by closing the fishpass gates, and reopening the gates once the
perceived threat has passed.
* Water Course Eutrophication: The potential for eutrophication of natural water courses from pen and cage
culture and from prawn farms due to overfeeding and metabolic waste excretion will be reduced through
the following measures: Specify the use of pelleted feeds rather than loose feeds, as the former result in
less loss. Develop better methods for estimating feed application rates throughout the grow-out period in
order to eliminate overfeeding. Specify more frequent water exchange and flushing in prawn pond to
discharge metabolic wastes in more diluted form. Protect stocks of chotomach (especially bottom feeders)
in the vicinity of cages and allow them to consume uneaten food which drops out of cages. Specify
controlled growth of submerged macrophytes inside and/or along the outside margins of pens to absorb
dissolved metabolic wastes such as nitrogen.
*  Groundwater Fxtraction: The danger of depletion of freshwater groundwater supply and intrusion of saline
water due to use of tubewells as water supply to prawn farms situated near coastal areas will be reduced
through the following measures: A comprehensive groundwater survey will be carried out in all areas
where tubewells are used (or may potentially be used) for prawn farm water sourcing to determine the size



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
of the aquifer and the recharge rate. Depending on the results of the survey, permits will be issued for
allowable volume quotas of groundwater that may be withdrawn by prawn farms and by other users. The
aggregate quota volume for an area will not exceed the groundwater recharge rate.
Submerged Macrophvtes: The danger of decrease in submerged macrophyte abundance in beels and baors
due to stocking of grass carp and common carp (leading to decline in chotomach abundance and catch)
will be controlled through the following measures: The stocking of grass carp (which are unable to breed
in Bangladesh waters) will be limited to specific areas where excessive macrophyte growth needs to be
reduced to normal levels. The stocking density will be adjusted to moderate level (ie 50 large fingerlings
per ha), and the adult fish will be caught and removed once the macrophyte density has normalised. No
common carp will be stocked by the project. This species has in any case been successfully introduced and
occurs in self-sustaining populations in many areas of Bangladesh.
. Competition for Plankton: No measure is proposed to mitigate the expected decrease in abundance of
indigenous plankton-eating fish in beels, baors and floodplains due to competition from stocked non-
indigenous planktivorous carp (silver, bighead). The objective of the stocking is specifically to channel
available plankton nutrients into these fast growing non-indigenous fish species, as they are considered
capable of producing a larger quantity of harvestable food fish than indigenous planktivorous fish species.
A reduction in stocking density would dampening the impact on indigenous species, but this would partly
defeat the project purpose. It is suggested that consideration be given to stop the stocking of silver and
bighead carp altogether, and that only native species (rui, carla, mrigel) be stocked. Other native carp
species such as k;alibaush, bara, bogo, ghora, angror, nandina, and others should also be considered for
stocking.
•  Qnetc Dier: The following mitigation measures will be used to reduce the loss of genetic diversity
in wild major carp stocks (nmi, catla, mrigel) on floodplains due to massive stocking with hatchery reared
stock of limited genetic diversity: Hatcheries will be specifically licensed to produce fingerlings for
floodplain stocking, and fingerlings will only be purchased from these hatcheries. Only first generation
broodstock sourced from wild stocks will be used to produce fingerlings used in stocking programs.
Inbred and selectively bred lines used in pond culture will not be used. Broodstock used for floodplain
stocking will be renewed each year, and old broodstock will be destroyed. Broodstock at a particular
hatchery will be sourced from local wild stocks and not be transferred from elsewhere in the country.
*  Disease Transmission: The potential for disease transmission and pandemics resulting from  project
activities will be mitigated through the following actions: All fingerlings will be inspected for disease prior
to stocking. If diseased fingerlings are detected, the entire consignment will be destroyed. If no diseased
fingerlings are detected, the entire consignment will be treated with an antibiotic as a precautionary
measure prior to release into natural water bodies. All broodstock imported from outside Bangladesh will
be quarantined and inspected for disease. Diseased fish will be destroyed by incineration. All grow-out
facilities will be regularly inspected for disease. If disease is detected, all stocks at the facility will be
destroyed by incineration, and the facility will be sanitised. It will become illegal to dispose of diseased
animals from hatcheries, aquaculture ponds, floating cages or pens by dumping into natural water bodies.
The offence will be punishable by fines and imprisonment. A code of procedures will be prepared to
reduce the incidence and risk of escapage from aquaculture facilities.
* Snail Stock Depletion. The problem of overharvesting of snail populations used for prawn feed, and
transmission of diseases from illegally imported snails from India, will be mitigated through the following
measures: The harvesting of snail populations occurring in borrow pits, ponds, canals, beels, baors, and
other water bodies will be regulated through licensing of collectors, and allocation of specific areas to
individual collectors. The culture of snails in purpose built facilities (ie snail nurseries) will be promoted,
taking into account the particular reproductive and nutritional needs of snails. The illegal import of snails
from India will be controlled.
* Disenfranchisement: Instances of possible displacement of some fishermen from the areas designated as
fish sanctuaries (including access channels of fishpasses) and the areas used for pen culture will be
mitigated as follows: The nature of claims for fishing rights and tenure will be assessed at each fish
sanctuary and pen culture location, and ranked according to validity. Compensation will be paid to
fishermen or investors with valid leaseholding claims. Other jalmohal will be allocated to fishermen with
valid traditional fishing rights to fish sanctuaries or pen culture locations. Where the project intervention is



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environimerntal Assessment
accompanied by community-based fishery development, disenfranchised genuine fishermen will be
included in large-group fishing rights allocations.
* Navioation: The expected interference with navigation routes in areas used for pen culture will be
mitigated through the following measures: Pen fences will be provided with flexible brush gates that allow
shallow draft boats to pass across the fence but prevent fish from cscaping. The gate design will be
standardised, and constructed from robust materials. Wherever feasible, alternate navigation routes will be
designated.
Participation Programme for Interested Parties
Provision will be made for interested parties to participate in the EMP at local and national levels. At local level,
interest groups (ie Environmental Advisory Group, or EAG) will be formed which wilt act in an advisory capacity to
the project in executing the EMP. At national level, interested environmental groups will be formed into a national
EAG. The views and recommendation of the national EAG will be recorded and taken into account during
implementation and periodic review of the project and the EMP.
Accountability
The project personnel that are responsible for implementation of the EMP will be fully accountable to the project
director in the implementation of project activities and use of project funds. The implementation and effectiveness of
the EMP will be reviewed annually by an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC), a body established jointly by the
MOFL, DOE and other concerned ministries.
Contingency Disaster Managemeent Plan and Residutal Risks
The potential for disasters arising from project activities is in the following areas:
• Disease pandemics of wild fish stocks or cultured fish stocks: This could occur in spite of best efforts to
control disease outbreaks in hatcheries, in grow-out facilities and in natural water bodies. It could result in
massive mortality of stocks and large economic losses.
*  Civil enoineerin. structure failures: This includes breeching of beel and baor embankmnents, washing out
of regulators or fishpasses, and jamming of gates of regulators or fishpasses in the open position during
floods. Failures could occur during the construction phase or during the operational phase. Such disasters
could allow massive flooding to take place within an agricultural area, destroying crops and livestock, and
leading to possible loss of human life.
* Construction site accidents: The greatest danger from construction accidents is associated with RCC
construction methods used for regulators and fishpasses. Manual excavation and earth moving for canal
re-excavation are only minimally hazardous.
* Cyclone or flood damage: This refers mainly to damage to cages and pens over a wide area. This could
result in the release of possibly diseased fish into the environment and massive economic loss from
equipment damage and stock escapage.
Social discord: Clashes may arise during civil engineering works construction (due to competition over
construction materials), due to misunderstanding of project objectives and potentials for impacts, due to
fishpass operation (ie protests from rice farmers inside an FCDI project), and during de-leasing and
transfer of jamohal ownership (due to the previous leaseholder resisting loss of control over jalmohals).
The project activities may directly or indirectly exacerbate existing conflicts within a community, or the
project may simply be used as an innocent and unsuspecting scapegoat by one or another groups locked in
conflict over unrelated issues.
Disaster Prevention
Several steps can be taken to reduce the eventuality of occurrence of disasters:
Civil engineering structure failures: Supervision of construction activities and adherence to maintenance
guidelines is essential for avoiding structure failures. Structures must be check regularly for crack and
signs of fatigue. In the event of sudden failure, sand bags will be used to 'plug' breaches and gates, until
such time as hydrological conditions allow repair of the structure.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* Consituction site accidents: Work-site safety programmes will be the responsibility of contractors.
* Social discord: Pre-construction consultation will tak-e place with affected communities to incorporate their
concerns and views into project design. This will include the alignment of embankments and location of
fishpasses, regulators and fish sanctuaries. Project staff will hold meetings in villages to inform local
people about project objectives, activities, and potentials for impacts, and seek their views and
recommendations for mitigating impacts.
Disaster Control Plan
The impacts of disasters which cannot be predicted or prevented from occurring can be lessen through the following
actions:
*  Disease pandemics of wild fish stocks or cultured fish stocks: The most serious consequence of massive
mortality due to disease is disruption of food supply to the consumers. A contingency plan would include
importation of cheap food fish (ie frozen small pelagics from Peru and Chile) to meet immediate dietary
needs of the population, and rapid re-establishment of domestic production through re-crediting of
producers.
* Cyclone or flood damage: This disaster would be less threatening to the security of the national food
supply than a disease pandemic, and be more localised in impact. A rapid re-establishment of aquaculture
infrastructure and facilities would be implemented through special re-crediting of hatcheries and fish
farmers.
Residual Risks and Plans for Possible Mitigation
The major residual risk that is not adequately mitigated through the EMP is the containment of a disease pandemic. It
would be extremely difficult to prevent the movement of infected aquaculture stock (ie hatchlings, fingerlings or
broodstock) from one part of the country to another. Furthermore, it would appear almost impossible to prevent the
transport of infected wild caught fish from landing points to market points throughout the country, and to neighbouring
countries. Disease may also be transmitted by aquatic birds and other vector organisms, or simply carried in the
downstream direction by water flow. The. magnitude of the potential disease risk might be somewhat increased in
Bangladesh compared to neighbouring countries due to the intensification in aquaculture production that the proposed
project aims to implement. One approach to lessening the risk in aquaculture stock is to develop genetically enhanced
strains of pond fish with greater tolerance of stress and greater disease resistance. Disease risk will however likely still
remain high despite such remedial efforts if new highly virulent strains or pathogens are involved. The only realistic
approach in such an eventuality is to allow the disease to 'run its course'.
EMP Implementation
The EMP will be implemented as an integral part of the project development. Implementation will be carried out by an
EIMP Implementation Group (EIG). This group will be a formal body within the project structure, and be composed of
seconded full-time and part-time staff from the following agencies and organisations: DOF, DOE, BWDB, LGED,
BIWTA. Staff from selected environmental NGOs will also be seconded to the EIG. Implementation of the EMP will
require that the DOF take on new staff with the following areas of expertise: Hydrology (surface water and
groundwater), Water chemistry, Civil engineering (design of water management structures and fishpasses), Limnology
(macrophytes and plankton), Fish genetics, Fish disease, Malacology (gastropods). No special staff development needs
will be required for other agencies in order to carry out the EMP.
Training Plan
Implementation of the EMP would require training to be carried in the following disciplines:
*  Water regulator operators: Standard training offered to BWDB and LGED water regulator operators will
be required. Some 25 operators will need to be trained. Training would take place at BWDB training
facilities, as well as on-the-job training.
• Fishpass orator: Training in operation of fishpass gates and sampling cages will be required. Up to 10
fishpass operators would be trained (depending on the number of structures built). Training would be
carried out at the existing vertical slot fishpass at Kashimpur (Manu River FCDI Project near Moulvi
Bazar).



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* Aquaculture feed control: Training in proper feed preparation and application methods will be required.
Some 200 extension workers will be trained. Training would be carried out at the FRI station in
Mymensingh and/or at the Vocation School for Aquaculture proposed under this project.
* Hatchery operation for floodplain stocking: Training in hatchery methods appropriate for production of
fingerlings for floodplain stocking will be required. About 200 hatchery staff will be trained. Training
would be carried out at a selected GOB hatchery and at several privately owned hatcheries.
* Fish and shrimp disease inspection and quarantine: Training in hatchery hygiene and ftngerling inspection
for disease will be required. Approximately 50 hatchery and DOF staff will be trained Training will take
place at the FRI station in Mymensingh.
* Snail culture methods: Training in methods for snail culture are required. Forty potential snail culturists
will be trained. No training facility currently exists for snail culture in Bangladesh. It is proposed that one
DOF and one NGO staff be trained in snail culture methods at an overseas facility (to be identified), and
ihat these individuals then lead training courses in Bangladesh at the FRI Paikgaccha station.
The total cost for the EMP Training Plan is $108,500.
Techtnical Assistance Needs
No special needs for externally-sourced technical assistance is previewed. The EMP budget would contain a
contingency fund of US50,000 to cover the eventuality of a need developing for external assistance.
FI.P Cost
The total cost of the EMP is S2,368,500.
2.10 Environmental Monitoring Plan
The Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMONP) will provide information on the progress and results of the mitigation
measures implemented under the EMP. It would also allow early detection of impact conditions not predicted during
the EIA that might require additional mitigation measures. Monitoring activities will be divided into two phases: I) the
baseline pre-project period, and 2) the operational with-project period. In most cases, the same parameters (using the
samc methodologies) will be monitored during both periods. Monitoring will address the 11 potential impacts of the
proposed project. The following environmental parameters will be monitored:
* Beel and Baor Hydrolooy: Canal discharge; beel, canal and river water levels; beel/baor surface area;
water extraction by people for various purposes; fish abundance and biodiversity; fish production.
. FCDI Project Hydrology: Riverside and countryside water levels; rainfall inside FCDI project; water
discharge through fishpass; water body surface areas and water levels inside FCDI project; rice cropping
patterns and areas; crop damage due to flooding.
• Water Course Eutrophication: Water quality (02, BOD5, NH3, suspended solids) in grow-out area and in
surrounding/receiving waters; stocking density; feed application rates; stock growth rate; stock mortality.
.  Groundwater Extraction: Groundwater extraction volumes; groundwater recharge rate; pond water
management practices and growth in water demand; groundwater quality (salinity, pH, arsenic).
* Submerged Macrophvtes: Submerged macrophyte density and species composition; macrobenthos
abundance and biodiversity; water quality in macrophyte stands (turbidity, pH, 02); chotomach abundance
and biodiversity; carp stocking rate; carp growth rate.
* Competition for Plankton: Plankton abundance and biodiversity; water quality (turbidity, pH, 02);
abundance and biodiversity of indigenous planktivorous fish; stocking rate of silver and bighead carp;
plank-ton consumption and growth rate of silver and bighead carp.
* Genetic Diversity: Stock abundance and genetic fingerprinting of wild native carp populations (protein
electrophoresis); genetic fingerprinting of hatchery stock.
• Disease Transmission: Disease type and incidence in hatcheries, grow-out facilities and wild populations;
disease incidence in wild stocks in the vicinity of escapage events; disease incidence in imported
broodstock.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
*  Snail Stock Depletion. Wild snail population abundance, food consumption and growth rate; water quality
of natural snail habitat (water temperature, O,, pH, Ca); macrophyte and periphyton abundance of natural
snail habitat; abundance of competitor snail species and other macrobenthos in natural snail habita.;
harvesting rate of snails; snail fecundity and recruitment; disease incidence in snails.
* Disenfranchisement: Abundance and biodiversity of fish (pre-project); catch rates, species composition
and income of fisheries in fish sanctuaries and pen areas (pre-project period); poaching in fish sanctuaries
(with-project period).
* Navigation: Boat traffic patterns.
The EMONP of the proposed project will require a significant technical effort on the part of DOF. It is proposed that
a permanent monitoring unit be established within the DOF or this purpose (ie Project Monitoring Unit, PMU). To
meet the needs of the EMONP it is proposed that the PMU consist of the following specialists: Chief Monitoring
Officer, Hydrologist, Water chemist, Limnologist, Fish geneticist, Fish disease specialist (microbiologist),
Malacologist, Fish stock assessment specialist, and Socioeconomist (with experience in navigation). No particular
staffing needs are required in other agencies as most of the monitoring activities will be carried out by the DOF. It is
proposed that the specialists in the PMU liaise closely with counterpart specialists in relevant agencies (BWDB, DOE,
BIWTA).
The breakdown of costs for the EMONP over five years is $1,072,000.
The findings of the MONP will be reported to the project leadership and the DOF, in the form of a quarterly
Environmental Status Report (ESR). The ESR will present monitoring data in analysed and sumnmarised format, and
make any recommendation to changes in the EMP or project activities which seem warranted by the EMONP results.
3. TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SUBPROJECTS
3.1 Fish Biodiversity Conservation Subproject
The objective of the proposed subproject is to reverse the trend of fish biodiversity loss. The subproject would have
the following components:

results of the study would be used to modify stocking programs, and regulate the use of pond culture
species in order to eliminate adverse impacts.
4. Impact of Shrimp and Prawn Seed Collection on Fish Eiodiversitv Component. This component would
conduct field studies of the impacts of collection of wild shrimp and prawns seed on fish and crustacean
stocks in brackishwater, marine and freshwater environments. It would also monitor the quantity of seed
captured, and the areas of capture. The results of the studies and monitoring would be used to assess the
overall impact and sustainability of this practice. Measures for mitigation of negative impacts would be
implemented as appropriate.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
5. Stocking of Endanoered Fish Species Component. This component would carry out induced breeding of
threatened indigenous species (nandina, angrot, mohasol, sarputi, silond and pangas), involving both FRI
and private hatcheries. The fingerlings would be stocked in selected protected sanctuary areas in order to
re-establish populations in the wild. Active protection measures as well as a public awareness campaign
would be implemented to allow stocked populations sufficient opportunity to build up to self-sustaining
levels.
The cost summary of the individual components of the Fish Biodiversity subproject is as follows:
National Survey                               $1,500,000

Stocking of Endangered Fish                   $400,000
TOTAL =        $2,800,000
3.2 Fisheries Environments Improvement Subproject
The objective of the proposed subproject is to implement environmental improvement measures which are designed
primarily to benefit and enhance the fisheries resources carrying capacity of key aquatic habitat types. The subproject
would have the following components:
1. Wetland and Mangrove Tree Plantation Component. This component would plant a minimum of I million
seedlings of the flood tolerant tree species hizal (Barringtonia acutangula Linn) and mangroves. The
principal planting locations would be the shorelines of beels, baors and canals, and the shoreline terraces
along coastal polders. Seedlings would be planted in parallel rows of 5 or 6 trees, to form a continuous
band along the perimeters of water bodies and polders.
2. Control of Aorochemicals Impacts Component. This component would carry out comprehensive studies of
the patterns of use of agrochemicals (fenilisers and pesticides), their modes of flushing into freshwater,
brackishwater and marine aquatic habitats, their rate of uptake by sediments and aquatic organisms, and
the level of residues in fish tissue. The degree of risk to fish stocks and to human health will be assessed.
The use of pesticides to prevent insect infestation of dry fish will also be studied and the health hazard to
humans assessed. Guidelines will be prepared for the Ministry of Agriculture and for farmers on the
hazards of agrochemicals to fish resources and acceptable practices for utilising agrochemicals so as to
protect fishery resources. A study will be made of the types of agrochemical produced in Bangladesh, and
the types of agrochemical being imported (legally and illegally). Recommendations will be prepared to
assist the GOB in eliminating the manufacture, import and use of agrochemical deemed to be hazardous to
fishery resources and general environmental quality, and specifically to human health.
3. Beel and Baor Fmbankment Component. This component will construct low embankments equipped with
water retention regulators around 30 beels and baors in order to increase their dry-season water storage
capacity. The hizal tree plantation component will be integrated with this component (ie seedlings will be
planted on the embankments wherever possible). Hydrological studies will be undertaken, along with
fisheries and non-fisheries water use patterns for individual water bodies. Water user conmmittees will be
established to regulate the quantities of water that will be used for fisheries and non-fisheries purposes
during the dry season and mediate disputes.
4. Artificial River Duars Pilot Schemes Component. This component will construct several types of
structures (flow deflectors, bottom sills) which are designed to create downstream duars (= scour holes)
in river channels at five pilot locations. Duars are known to be critical overwintering habitat for many
commercially important species, and key spawning habitats for major carp (rui, carla, mrigel). The
construction of artificial duars for fishery enhancement purposes has not been previously attempted in
Bangladesh. The newly created artificial duars will be placed under protected sanctuary management with
the participation of local fisheries associations, and will be monitored for several years to assess their
utility for stock enhancement and protection.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
5. Low Cost Industrial Effluent Treatment Component. This component will prepare the design of low cost
industrial effluent treatment systems for tanning, textile, jute, chemicals & pesticides, pulp and paper,
seafood processing and fertiliser industries. Treatment systems will be designed for 10 plants. The
component will study the plant process system and effluent streams, assist plant managers to reduce the
volume of effluent generated, design appropriate treatment systems, and facilitate construction and
operation of the treatment systems.
6. Water Hvacinth Control Component. This component will study the infestation and growth patterns of
water hyacinth. A national survey of all major beels, baors, rivers, canals and other water bodies will be
undertaken to assess the degree of infestation and allow planning of clearing and control activities. Studies
of infestation of small systems (khals, borrow pits, tanks, ponds) will also be carried out. It will review
available control and utilisation strategies and methods. It will develop an appropriate strategy and
approach and identify optimal methods for controlling the negative impacts of water hyacinth on aquatic
habitat quality and fish production. It will disseminate the selected approach and methods through
demonstration and public awareness programs. Clearing and control activities are expected to be carried
out in at least 10,000 ha of water bodies.
The cost summary of the individual components of the environmental improvement subproject is as follows:

3.3 Community-Owned Fisheries Pilot Project
The objective of the proposed pilot project is to carry out pilot trials of user-ownership type of fisheries management
systems to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation in Bangladesh. The subproject would have the following
components:
1. Fisheries Association Establishment Component. This component would assist all genuine professional and
subsistence fishermen and fisherwomen (as well as women fish processors) of the communities relevant
and/or riparian to a particular waterbody to form a single unified fisheries association. It would assist the
fisheries association to register as legal production entities. It would provide basic training in
organisational skills (ie bookkeeping, accounts, planning) for members.
2. Acquisition of Water Body and Fishery Resource Ownership Component. This component would assist the
fisheries associations to acquire from the Ministry of Land (MOL) legal tenure of their relevant water
body and all fishery resources contained within the water body. It would where necessary cancel existing
leases (with compensation to leaseholders). It would assist to provide resource loans to the fisheries
associations to purchase the water bodies and fishery resources from the GOB. It would ensure the full
legality and protection by law of the perpetual continuing ownership of the water bodies by the fisheries
associations.
3. Financial Manaoement and Loan Repayment Component. This component would assist the fisheries
association to plan their financial accounts in a manner consistent with meeting costs, servicing the
resource loan repayments, and paying income shares to members for fishing activities.
4. Fishery Manaoement Plan Component. This component would assist the fisheries associations to draw up
short term and long term stock management, harvesting and conservation plans. It would train the
fisheries associations to collect and interpret fish catch and biological data in order to assess the state of
the stocks. It would provide assistance in using the data to formulate annual harvesting plans. It would
also assist in the formulation of conservation plans and measures, such as closed seasons, fish sanctuaries,



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environimental Assessment
minimum size limits, broodstock protection, stocking and introduction of rare and/or desirable species, to
ensure the long term vitality and high abundance of the fishery resources.
5. Environmental Manaoement Plan Component. This component would assist the fisheries association to
plan and implement investments in environmental enhancement and improvement. This would include
measures for retaining water during the dry season and prevent dewatering, planting of wetland trees (ie
hizal in freshwater habitats, mangroves in brackishwater habitats), improvement of water quality through
protection against agrochemicals and other pollutants, and conservation of other aquatic lifeforms (plants,
invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) which are crucial to maintaining high biodiversity
and ecologically balanced ecosystems.
The cost summary of the individual components of the environmental improvement subproject is as follows:
Fisheries Association Establishment          $510,000

3.4 Fish and Shrimp Disease Control Subproject
The objective of the proposed sub-project is designed to improve GOB capability to prevent and control fish disease
and to reverse the trend of production decline. The subproject would have the following components:
I. Survey of Fish and Shrimp Diseases and Control Measures. This component would undertake
comprehensive and systematic study of diseases, etiology, epizootiology and control in different fisheries
habitats, and prepare a status report on fish and shrimp diseases and control.
2. Extension Training on Disease Prevention and Management. The objective of the training would be to
improve the technical capabilities of the GOB personnel and farmers at field level. The main emphasis of
the training would be on the following: a) develop working knowledge and skills of the participants, GOB
personnel and farmers for diagnosis and management of disease; b) enhance understanding of prevention
methods under different environmental condition and needs of the beneficiaries; c) greater responsibility
by the GOB agencies; and d) updating the knowledge base.
3. Environmental Hvgiene and Wastewater Recycling. This component would recycle wastewater fouled due
to feed residue and excreta of the reared species in hatcheries and grow-out facilities to avoid
environmental hazards. Due to lack of recycling systems receiving waters are being polluted due to
discharge of waste water.
4. Quarantine Measures to Contain Disease Outbreaks. This component would set up quarantine posts with
laboratories in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong, Barisal, Sylhet and Rajshahi to monitor the hygienic condition
of fish and crustaceans and to analyse feed, soil and water.
The cost summery of the individual components of the fish and shrimp disease control subprojects is as follows

products in computerised form from BWDB, SWMC and WARPO on a regular basis. The data would be
stored in project computers.
2. Acquisition of Water Quality Data Component. This component would purchase selected data sets in
computerised form from DOE on a regular basis. The data would be stored in project computers.
3. Project Water Monitoring Data Collection Component. This component would sample and collect water
quantity and quality data from project activity locations from two perspectives: 1) ambient water quality
for production, and 2) process water discharge impacts.

report on the status of water quantity and quality in Bangladesh from a fisheries perspective. The report
will be widely available through public sale at appropriate cost to all potential users in Bangladesh (private
sector, NGOs, GOB agencies, donor agencies, general public). The component would also produce
specialised reports to meet particular needs of individual clients.
The cost summary of the individual components of the environrmental improvement subproject is as follows:

4.2 Impact on Sustainability of Fisheries
The fisheries and environmental laws of Bangladesh in most respects reflect conventional approaches to protecting the
fisheries resources and the surrounding environment. This approach designates a central authority (ie GOB) as the
agent responsible and capable of managing fisheries and ensuring their sustainability. The widespread overexploitation
of openwater fisheries though improper fishing practices, and decline in stock abundance due to environmental
degradation in Bangladesh are clear symptom of management failure. At least a part of this failure derives from the
nature and intent of fisheries and environmental legislation. Beels are not recognised as water bodies, but treated as
areas of land which (inconveniently) happen to have water on them.
4.3 Provision of Access to Fisheries Sectors
The fisheries laws provide access to fisheries resources for fishermen and for private fisheries investors. The later are
particularly favoured in inland fisheries under the jalmohal leasing system. The laws clearly identify the requirements
for access to public or khas fisheries (payment of lease or license fee) and private fisheries (permission of owner).
Moreover it gives subsistence fishermen and fisherwomen the right to angle in any navigable river. The jalmohal
leasing system however clearly discriminates against genuine fishermen, as the majority are unable to raise sufficient
capital to pay the high lease fees specified by GOB. Jalmohal leases are routinely won be capital investors.
Although fisheries and environmental laws are theoretically equity neutral, in practice they act to support the activities
and intentions of the highest income groups (fisheries capital investors who are colloquially known as jalmohal
leaseholders). The laws are thus regressive in an economic sense.
From an economic perspective, the exploitation of fisheries and other natural resources of Bangladesh would appear to
be in a state of Pareto equilibrium (ie no one can increase their own benefits without having a negative impact on
someone else's status). This may not be entirely correct due to the massive economic distortions that are caused by
improper GOB ownership of natural resources (jalmohals and land) and interference with production and marketing.
Nonetheless, the provisions of the fisheries and environmental laws has resulted in a state of virtual lawlessness in the
fisheries and environmental sectors.
4.4 Existing Enforcement Capacity
Institutional enforcement of fishery laws rests largely with the DOF. The enforcement capacity of the DOF is
minimal, with no cadre of trained and equipped fish guards in existence. The police or the army are rarely active in
enforcing fisheries laws or imervening in conflicts. The recently formed Bangladesh Coast Guard (BCG) will include
in its mandate enforcement of fisheries laws and protection of fishermen from dacoity. Non-institutional enforcement
capacity (in the form of fishguards, paharadar) is contracted by jalmohal leaseholders. There are numerous such
private fish guards throughout Bangladesh.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
4.5 Impact on Sustainability of Fisheries
The impact on sustainability of institutional enforcement is almost non-existent. Fisheries and environment laws are
routinely flouted througbout the country. Few arrests are made by the police for sale or use of current jal, fishing with
poisons or failure to drain polders after shrimp growing leases expire. Non-institutional enforcement reduces fishing
mortality from unauthorised fishing effort in private and leased waters. However, the marginal gain in survival is
usually eroded when the owner or leaseholder carries out jalmohal dewatering and complete harvesting.
4.6 Provision of Access to Fisheries Sectors
Institutional enforcement generally supports the rights of jalmohal leaseholders to exclude unauthorised fishing. In
most cases however, this exclusion is actually enforced by privately-contracted fish guards. This has resulted in some
extremely violent confrontations in the past, and will likely continue in the future until the practice is eradicated.
4.7 Recommendations For Improvements And Additional Regulations
The main deficit of fisheries and environmental laws is that they do not specify, allocate or protect any roles, rights or
responsibilities for genuine fishermen and fishermwomen in the management of fisheries, or in the management of
risheries environments. They also do not recognise the legal status of water bodies such as beel and baors. or
specifically protect them from encroachment. It is recommended that a Community-based Fisheries Manaoement Law
be promulgated. This law should allocate access or ownership of fisheries resources, as well as fisheries environments
as appropriate, to genuine fishing communities, and define management responsibilities. It should also specifically
prevent and outlaw access or ownership by individuals or by capital investors (ie previous jalmohal leaseholders and
moneylenders), but should at the same time guarantee subsistence fishing rights to individuals using low productivity
gears in marginal fishing areas. It is also recommended that a Wetland Conservation Law be promulgated. This law
should protect beels and baors. A new regulations should be promulgated by GOB which specify a complete ban on the
usc of pesticides to treat or preserve fish, especially dry fish.
5. LINKAGES TO OTHER ENVIRONMIENTAL PROJECTS
The proposed project should establish cooperative linkages with the following projects:
* Coastal Wetland Biodiversity Management Project (UNDP)
* Biodiversity Conservation In The Sunderbans Project (ADB)
* Small Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (ADB, IFAD, GON)
* Sunderban World Heritage Site Project (UNESCO)
* Institutional Support To Department Of Environment (CIDA)
* Northeast Regional Water Management Project (CIDA)

I. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
ASSESSMENT OF PROPOSED PROJECT



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
A. PROJECT SETTING
A. 1 Background
The proposed Fourth Fisheries Project is a follow-up project to the Third Fisheries Project (which
was co-financed by the World Bank, UNDP and ODA). Third Fisheries focused on floodplain
stocking and shrimp farming. It was only partly successful in meeting its objectives and failed to
utilise about 70% of its previewed budget. The result was to leave unrealised a significant part of
the fisheries sector development potential of Bangladesh.
The present GOB has committed itself to renewed effort to further develop the fisheries sector,
and is therefore seeking to formulate an improved sector-wide fisheries development project.
A.2 Rationale and Objectives of the Proposed Project
The natural endowments of hydrology, climate and physiography of Bangladesh have given it a
significant development potential in freshwater capture fisheries, freshwater and brackishwater
pond culture, and marine fisheries. The fisheries sector has already realised a portion of this
potential, but further development would yield worthwhile gains in income and nutrition. Targeted
interventions are needed in better management, conservation and enhancement of floodplain and
river capture fisheries, further extension of intensified freshwater carp and prawn pond culture,
and improvement in infrastructure, production, processing and marketing of brackishwater shrimp
farming. Successful project implementation would improve fisheries environrments, conserve fish
biodiversity and protect floodplain broodstock, provide secure access for genuine fishermen,
regulate fishing effort to biologically sustainable levels, give more pond owners access to
improved production technology, improve environmental conditions for shrimp and rice rotation
and increase yields, and ensure that Bangladesh meets product hygiene and quality requirements
for export markets. In socioeconomic terms these results would reduce risk to producers and
consumers, increase income and nutrition, and judicate social conflict.
The project goal is to directly improve the physical, biological and socioeconomic environments
and conditions pertaining to the fisheries sector, and indirectly benefit related sectors and
communities. The principal project objective is to advance toward this goal through focused
infrastructure, environmental, technical, social and economic interventions in the various fisheries
subsectors. Specific project objectives are as follows:



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
1. Rehabilitate and enhance openwater floodplain fisheries through aquatic environment
improvement, protection of broodstock, stocking of threatened species, security of
tenure for genuine fishermen, and regulation of fishing effort.
2. Further extend high yielding carp and prawn freshwater pond culture methods to small
land owners.
3. Improve infrastructure, extensive culture methods, and seed supply for brackishwater
shrimp farmers, while reducing negative externalities to rotation paddy growers.
4. Redefine and strengthen the capacity of government fisheries institutions and NGOs to
provide support services to the private sector.
A.3 Methodology for Environmental Assessment and Review Process
The methodology adopted for environmental assessment of the proposed project by the ELA Team
consists of an iterative process of information collection and fact finding (with emphasis on
beneficiary group sources) to identify environmental issues and possible solutions, analysis of
potential impacts and identifications of mitigation measures, reporting of preliminary results to
beneficiary and interested groups, and modification of project design.
Specific actions to acquire information were as follows:
* Carry out field visits together with the project component preparers in order to discuss
and influence project design.
* Meet with target beneficiary groups to record their opinions, concerns and aspirations
with regard to project objectives and its environmental impacts.
* Meet with other local interested parties to record their opinions on environmental
impacts.
* Meet with government and NGO staff at local, district, divisional and national levels to
record their opinions about environmental impacts.
* Collect and analyse fisheries and environmental data and reports from local field
sources.
* Collect and analyse fisheries and environmental data and reports from national sources.
* Review government and project reports, and other literature sources at national level.
The EIA Team worked closely with the project component preparers to assess and comment on all
aspects of project design during the formulation phase.
The enviromnental assessment will be reviewed by the DOF and the DOE, as well as by the WB.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
A.4 EIA Team
The EIA Team consisted of the following individuals:
* Garry Bemacsek, International Environmental Specialist, GLOBAL AQUATIC
CORPORATION Pty Ltd, Sydney, Australia.
* Yusuf Sharif Ahmed Khan, National Environmental Specialist, Institute of Marine
Sciences, University of Chittagong, Chittagong.
A.5 EIA Budget and Level of Effort
The technical assistance budget for the EIA was $ xxxxxxx, while the operational budget (EIA
share out of total project preparation budget) for fieldwork, meetings and materials was $ xxxxxx.
Person months allocated for the EIA were as follows:
International Environmental Specialist     2 p/m
National Environmental Specialist          4.p/m
Total =     6 p/m
The EIA was carried out during the period 12 October 1997 to 28 February 1998, corresponding
to the late monsoon and winter dry seasons.
A.6 Limitations
Implementation of the EIA was constrained by inadequate allocation of personpower, budget and
time. It was not possible to visit more than a small number of the proposed project sites (and most
project sites had not even been identified during the work period of the international EIA
consultant), nor to assemble and analyse adequate first hand baseline data. This resulted in heavy
reliance on generic and existing databases. Logistic and timetable constraints interfered with the
public consultation and participation process.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
A.7 Relationship to Project Feasibility Study
The EIA is strongly integrated into the project feasibility study in all aspects. The various project
preparers displayed significant concern with environmental issues and strong willingness to adjust
project components to achieve environmental acceptability.
A.8 Scope and Format of Report
The report describes the policy, legal and administrative framework that the project would be
nested into. The project is fully described, as- are the physical, biological and socio-economic
environments in which it will operate and will impact. As the project does not aspire to address all
possible development issues and potentials in the fisheries sector, the EIA is highly focused on
actual project initiatives, rather than being-a sector wide or generic environmental study. The EIA
places special emphasis on the proposed environmental management plan and enviromnental
monitoring plan.
In addition to the formal EIA, the report also assesses the state of environmental legislation and
enforcement related to fisheries and recommends improvements. A series of environmental
subprojects are proposed which are intended to act synergistically with the main proposed project
components, by directly addressing specific environmental issues and concerns. Recommendations
are also made for linkages between the proposed project and other environmental projects in
Bangladesh which would serve to strengthen the impacts of the activities of both projects.
The format of this report follows closely the format for an EIA as recommended by the FPCO. It
has been modified as necessary to incorporate the EIA requirements of the WB.

B. POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
B.1 Fisheries and Environmental Policy Framework
The MOFL currently lacks a fisheries policy per se. A draft fisheries development policy has been
prepared but has yet to be adopted by the GOB (an English translation of the Bangla text was not
available to the international consultant, but a summary will be translated from Bangla by the
national consultant for use in the final report). The current draft has been successively modified
and redrafted over the last seven years (without adoption). GOB fisheries agencies (DOF, FRI,
BFDC) operate within their terms of reference, and have a general focus on increasing production,
promoting exports and raising revenue for government. Policy focus (such as it is) tends to be
interest and opportunity driven, rather than government mandated.
The Environmental Policy of the GOB was adopted in 1992, and has the following general
objectives:
* To maintain natural ecological balance and ensuring sustainable development of the
country through the development and conservation of the environment.
* To protect the country from natural disasters.
* To identify and control of all types of activities that pollute and degrade the
envirornent.
* To ensure environmentally sound development in all sectors.
* To ensure sustainable and environmentally sound use of all natural resources.
* To actively associate, as far as possible, with all international initiatives related to
environment.
Specific policy measures relevant to fisheries and fisheries environments include:
* Water Development. Flood Control and Irrigation: Ensure the mitigatory measures of
adverse environmental impact of completed water resources development and flood
control project; keep the rivers, canals, ponds, lakes, haors, baors and all other water
bodies and water resources free from pollution; conduct environmental impact
assessment before undertaking projects for water resources development and
management.
* Land: Formulate a balanced and environmentally sound national land use policy and
plan; prevent spread of salinity and alkalinity on land.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environimental Assessmenlt
* Forest. Wildlife and Biodiversity: Include tree plantation progranmmes in all relevant
development schemes; conserve wildlife and biodiversity, strengthen related research
and help insemination and exchange of knowledge in the concerned area; conserve and
develop wetlands and protect migratory birds.
* Fisheries and Livestock: Ensure appropriate environment for conservation and
development of fisheries and livestock; prevent activities which diminish the
wetlands/natural habitats of fish and encourage rehabilitative measures in the area;
ensure that development activities in fisheries and livestock do not create any adverse
impact on the mangrove forests and other ecosystems; evaluate existing projects on
water resources development, flood control and irrigation to determine their adverse
impact on fisheries and adopt measures for alternate fish culture upon improvement of
environmental conditions.
* Coastal and Marine Environment: Ensure environmentally sound conservation and
development of coastal and marine ecosystems and resources; prevent all internal and
external activities polluting the coastal and marine areas; strengthen necessary research
to preserve and develop coastal and mfarine environment and resources; limit coastal and
marine fish catch within tolerable regenerative/respawning limits.
* Institutional Arrangements: DOE will make final review and approve all environmentall
impact assessments (ElAs).
B.2 Legal Framework
Environmental impact assessment requirements of GOB are encoded in the Environment Law.
Detailed EIA guidelines have been produced by the Department of Enviromnent (DOE) for four
industrial sectors (cement, fertiliser, textile, pulp and paper), but not for fisheries development
projects. However, detailed guidelines were prepared by the Flood Plan Coordination
Organisation (FPCO) of the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) for water management and
related projects (including a number of fisheries projects) under the Flood Action Plan (FAP). The
FPCO EIA guidelines have been reviewed and approved by the DOE. After discussion with DOF,
it was agreed to use FPCO guidelines for environmental impact assessment as representative of
GOB EIA requirements.
The general environmental assessment guidelines of World Bank are contained in Operational
Directive 4.01: Environmental Assessment (including Annexes A to F), dated October 1991.
Additional detailed sectoral guidelines for fisheries development projects are contained in World
Bank Technical paper no 140: Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Vol II: Sectoral
Guidelines.

B.3 Administrative Framework



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environzmental Assessment
Environment-related projects and programs (outside of production activities) within the fisheries
sector come under the mandate of several GOB agencies:
* DOF has a modest environmental program for fish sanctuaries.
* MOL owns (on behalf of the GOB) all natural inland waters (beels, boars, rivers, khals)
and leases then out to users.
* DOE monitors water quality in rivers and other water bodies.
* DOFr is responsible for management of afforestation of mangroves and wetland forests,
and administers national parks and game reserves.
* BWDB construct, owns and operates large scale water management structures for flood
control, drainage and irrigation, including polders where shrimp culture is practiced,
and the sole fishpass in Bangladesh at Kashimpur (Manu River FCDI Project).
* BWDB collects regular hydrology data from rivers.
* SWMC and WARPO use BWDB hydrology data to model and predict flood levels.
* LGED constructs, owns and operates small scale water management structures for flood
control, drainage and irrigation.
* The Electricity Board has constructed the only large dam in Bangladesh at Kaptai and
manages the Kaptai Reservoir.
The individual mandates of agencies sometimes overlap and conflict (for example MOL and DOF
jurisdiction over fisheries management) resulting in government-induced inefficiency, inequity and
conflict within the fisheries sector.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessunent
C. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
C.1 Future Without Project
A reasonable scenario of the future without project interventions is as follows (based on forward
projection of existing trends within the fisheries sector):
* Continuous decline and possible extinction of native carp stocks in most parts of the
country;
* Overfishing of fish overwintering areas and spawning areas resulting in heavy mortality
of broodstock and national extinction of some fish species;
* Continued siltation of rivers and access canals, resulting in reduced migration of fish;
* Continued construction of FCDI projects without fishpass facilities resulting in further
reduction of fish migration and massive fish loss inside the project areas;
* Slow growth in productivity of pond culture;
• Decline in vitality of fingerlings for pond stocking sourced from hatcheries;
* Overharvesting of shrimp seed from wild sources, resulting in decline in shrimp stocks
and catches, and declines in stocks of fish and other species present in seed by-catch;
* Increased social conflict over use of private farm lands inside coastal polders for shrimp
grow-out, due to lack of control over activities of shrimp farmers;
* Increased insecurity of supply of larvae for shrimp and prawn farming, resulting in
erratic production, and imports of possibly diseased larvae from other countries;
. Slow growth in productivity of prawn farming, and increased incidence of disease and
mortality due to poor management practices;
* Increasing rejection of exported shrimp by importing countries due to poor quality and
inadequate hygiene standards at shrimp depots and at processing plants;
* Increasingly ineffectual performance of fisheries institutions;
* Continuing decline in fish biodiversity and local and national extinction of fish species;
* Continued degradation of fisheries environments from deforestation, agrochemicals,
dewatering, loop cutting of rivers, industrial effluents and water hyacinth infestation;
* Increasing conflict between jalmohal leaseholders/capital investors and genuine
fishermen over access and tenure of openwater fisheries resources;
* Increasing incidence of disease pandemics in fish and crustacean stocks, resulting in
large economic and nutritional losses.
The damage track of each subscenario will vary, but the cumulative effect of all subscenarios is
more likely than not to be quite significant.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Anzzex 9: En vironmnental Assessment
C.2 Alternatives
An alternative approach to management and conservation of indigenous fish stocks and fisheries
environments is to focus entirely on openwater stocking with indigenous and non-indigenous
species (while ignoring natural reproduction and recruitment), and to meet any shortages in supply
which may be develop through importation of cheap frozen food fish (such as small pelagics from
Chile and Peru). At the same time, increased consumption of other sources of protein (pulses,
poultry) could be promoted.
C .3 Selection of Alternative
The approximate cost of the alternative proposed above would be as follows:
* Cost of stocking (4 million ha @ $50/ha)  $200,000,000
* Cost of imports (500,000 t @ 5500/t)     $250,000,000
TOTAL COST OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVE = S450,000,000
Not included in this estimate are the social costs of displaced fishermen and fishing input
suppliers, subsistence losses in terms of nutrition, and costs of creating alternative employment for
large numbers of people (1.2 million). This would substantially raise the true cost of the
alternative.
The cost of the proposed project is $70,000,000, which is only 16% of the nominal cost of the
alternative. Given the substantial collateral benefits to environmental improvement that the it
would brina, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project is judged to be much higher than the
alternative.
The analysis suggests that the alternative is not viable and should be rejected in favour of the
proposed project.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
D.1 Project Overview
General
The project is a capital loan project type which will be financed by the IDA. Additional sources of
finance for technical assistance will be sought from other donor agencies. GOB contribution to the
project will be in kind and in fiscal capital development funds.
Type
The project is a fisheries development and conservation project. It contains components which will
improve the environment, increase production and increase product value. A large portion will be
in the form of credit and extension. Some infrastructure construction will also take place, for
fishpasses, canal re-excavation, prawn pond water supply and drainage, and prawn and shrimp
hatcheries.
Project Components
The proposed project will consists of the following components:
Activities in Inland Openwater Capture Fisheries
(to be completed)
Floodplain Stocking Component
Fish Sanctuaries Component
Canal Re-excavation Component
Fishpass Construction Component
Activities in Freshwater Finfish Aquaculture
Intensive Pond Culture Demonstration and Credit Componen
This component will raise yields in existing semi-intensive (ie management driven rather than
input driven) ponds to the 3,500-4,000 kg/ha level. This will be accomplished using two principal
inputs: 1) the application of inorganic fertilisers to increase the phytoplankton food source, and 2)
the application of high quality pelleted feeds. Demonstration (sic in-pond trials) will be carried out
in 50,000 ponds over a five year period. Demonstrations will focus on 150-200 thanas (50 per
thana per year) and approximately 5,000 ha of ponds (average pond size of 1,600 m2). The cost of



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
demonstration will be US$8 million. A credit component will allow widespread implementation of
the intensive input system, and provide $20 million to pondowners.
Intensive Cage Culture Demonstration and Credit Component
This component will introduce floating cage culture technologies to inland fishing conimunities for
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rivers, beels, baors and ponds. The expected average yield will be 200 kg/m3, from cages ranging
in size from I to 3 m3. This will be accomplished using high quality pelleted feeds, and assumes a
feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 2:1. High value fish will be cultured, including catfish, tilapia and
common carp. Demonstration will be carried out in 1,000 cages (with total volume of 3,000 m 3)
over a five year period. A credit component will allow widespread implementation of the cage
culture system.
Semi-Intensive Pen Culture Demonstration and Credit Component
This component will introduce semi-intensive pen culture techniques to inland fishing communities
for borrow pits (roadside and FCDI), canals, dead river channels and other suitable locations. The
expected yields will be as high as 4,000-5,000 kg/ha, from an average pen size of 2,000 m . This
will be accomplished using supplemental high quality pelleted feeds (rather than fertiliser inputs).
Demonstration will be carried out in 250 pens (total of 50 ha) over a five year period. A credit
component will allow widespread implementation of the cage culture system.
Broodstock and Hatchery Component*
This component will introduce pure lines of culturable species already in-country, in part through
importation on new blood lines. The component will also carry out hatchery registration.
Contract Research Component
This component will finance aquaculture research on a contract basis. It will allow specific
research supportive to proposed project components to be conducted through private
organisations, university or GOB agencies.
Activities in Crustacean and Brackishwater Aquaculture
Sustainable Shrimp Seed Collection Component
This component will mitigation negative impacts of shrimp seed collection pressure on natural
stocks of fish and shrimp. The objectives of this component are to secure a sufficient and
sustainable recruitment of species of fish and crustacean from the coastal and freshwater areas of
Bangladesh. It would: 1) introduce non-destructive catching procedures for Penaeus monodorl
larvae, and 2) develop transportations systems which increase the survival and quality of the
caught shrimp larvae. The component would ban the use of push nets, while simultaneously a
credit scheme for 5,000 poor head of household women will be provided to allow them to become
shrimp larvae collectors through the purchase of wooden boats and nets. Training would be
provided to shrimp larvae collectors in proper handling of larvae and to return by-catch to the
river through financial assistance to NGOs. Training would be provided to shrimp seed traders in
proper handling of seed during transportation. Low cost equipment for transportation and storage
of larvae will be introduced.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annlex 9: Environmental Assessmnent
Integrated Coastal Zone Planning Component
This component is designed to mitigation social conflicts due to land use issues arising from
extensive shrimp farming and ease pressure on land resources including mangroves. The objective
is install a land use planning and management system in the coastal areas of Bangladesh which
uses a holistic approach. This would aim to allocate land for different activities (including shrimp
farming) in each District of the coastal zone. It would develop a management information system
for land use, as well as a legislative framework for land use issues. It would also empower
government at local level to enforce land use regulations. A preparatory team under the DOE as
executive agency will formulate an Integrated Coastal Zone Land Use Project, based on
participatory principles which include all affected interest groups in the private sector, NGOs and
local and national authorities.
Private Hatcheries for Shrimp and Prawns Component
This component aims to develop a viable privately owned crustacean hatchery industry. The long-
term objective of the component is to establish hatcheries for P. monodo and M. rosenbergii in
the private sector with sufficient capacity to meet the total demand for larvae in Bangladesh. It
would offer technical assistance to hatchery and nursery operators throughout Bangladesh and
encourage processing plant owners to invest in hatchery and nursery operations in order to secure
a steady and predictable supply of marketable shrimp and prawns. It would also introduce a
quality assessment system for hatchery produced larvae. It is anticipated that the direct project
output would be the supply of 30% of total demand for shrimp and prawn larvae by privately
owned and- operated hatcheries. Cost-effective larvae production would be facilitated by the
provision of in-hatchery training and trouble-shooting. A Codex for quality assurance of post-
larvae will be developed and hatcheries will be certified.
Improved Freshwater Prawn Culture Component
This component will provide assistance to smallholder pond operators producing freshwater
prawns. The objective is to introduce a sustainable system for production of M. rosenbergii in
rotation with rice among smallholder farmers in rural areas of Bangladesh. It would develop and
demonstrate a number of techniques including monoculture of prawns and polyculture of prawns
with different finfish species. It would train farmers in appropriate prawn farming techniques with
special emphasis on women pond operators and make credit available through NGOs. Training
would also be given to NGO extension workers, fry suppliers and marketable prawn collectors
(forias) in prawn farming techniques. It will demonstrate how prawn farmer groups could
construct, operate and maintain water supply and drainage system installations themselves, and
with the only external input requirements being supervision assistance and access to loans with
low interest rates. The expected component output would be an increase in production of prawns
(and by-product fish) through the combination of better management, improved water supply
(where applicable) and an increase in prawn pond farming area. Men and women prawn farmers
will be trained in management of different types of prawn farming systems. NGO extension
workers, fry suppliers and marketable prawn collectors will be trained and equipped with manuals
made available by the project. Field trials in different pond types will establish procedures for the
most cost effective management systems. Two water supply and drainage systems will be
constructed through the efforts of farmer groups. Men and women prawn farmers with less than

0.2 ha of land will be assisted through additional income generating activities, including
construction, operation and maintenance of water supply and drainage systems.
Improved Shrimp Processin2 Practices Component
This component will train middle management personnel in the shrimp and prawn processing
industry in good manufacturing practices and HACCP.
Activities in Institutioinal Development
Vocational School for Aquaculture Component
This component would establish a vocational school for aquaculture. The objective is to make
available to the private sector aquaculture specialists with comprehensive technical knowledge in
commercial aquaculture procedures. It would train young men and women to a relatively high
level in aquaculture management, techniques and system dynamics. A curriculum would be
developed, an appropriate location for the school selected, and the number of teachers and their
qualifications determined.

D.2 Pre-Implementation Phase
Status of Project During EIA Study
The project was in the design stage during the EIA study.
Design Activities
Project design was carried out by a team of 16 consultants. This involved extensive field visits
throughout Bangladesh (although this was constrained by time for the international consultants)
Possible project intervention sites were identified and preliminary designs for fishpasses,
hatcheries and other structures were prepared. Detailed design would be carried out during project
implementation.
D.3 Implementation Phase
Likely Construction Activities
The project is likely to construct up to 5 fishpasses, 3 hatcheries, 30 water regulators, and re-
excavate some 50 km of canals and drains.
Possible Hazards
Premonsoon and monsoon flood damage presents a hazard for construction of fishpass projects
which are not fully completed during a single winter dry season construction period. Cyclone
damage presents a hazard for brackishwater shrimp construction.
Probable Schedule of Works and Logistics



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
The window of opportunity for construction of fishpasses is short (December to May) and site
preparation and constriction should ideally be completed during one season. Experience during
construction of the Kashimpur fishpass indicates that this should be possible at most sites.
Similar considerations also affect regulator construction and canal re-excavation for shrimp
farming.
D.4 Operation and Maintenance Phase
0 & M Schedule
Periodic inspection and maintenance will be required for all structures.
Likelv Hazards
Possible hazards to structures include flood damage, cyclone damage and earthquake and/or
subsidence damage.
D.5 Overall Project Schedule and Logistics
The project will have a 5 year lifespan. It is anticipated that Year 1 of the project will be occupied
with preparation of the inception report, baseline monitoring and detailed design work. Years 2 to
5 would be occupied by construction, normal operation and impact monitoring.

E. DESCRIPTION OF THE EXISTING ENVIRONMENT
E. 1 Natural Physical Environment
Climate
Bangladesh has a subtropical climate governed by two major weather regimes:
* Wet southwest monsoon from May to end of September (originates over Indian Ocean),
D Dry northeast wind from November to mid-March.
The seasons consist of a dry cool winter season, a hot spring season, a warm wet monsoon
summer, and a hot moist autumn season.
MIaximum air temperatures range from 35°C to 43 °C and occur in April and May. Minimum
temperatures range from 5 °C to 12 °C and occur in December and January.
.lean annual precipitation ranges from 1,200 mm in the west to almost 6,000 mm in the northeast.
The catchment of the Surma River (a tributary of the Meghna) in India includes the wettest place
on earth with annual rainfall of over 13,000 mm. About 85% of the annual rainfall occurs from
June to September.
Tropical cyclones originating over the Indian Ocean occur during the premonsoon and
postmonsoon periods. Cyclones are accompanied by storm surge tidal waves. Tornados,
hailstorms and flash floods are produced by nor'westers during the transition from the winter to
monsoon season, especially in the northeast.
WN'ater Resources
Three major rivers traverse Bangladesh: the Padma (= Ganges), the Jamuna (= Brahmaputra) and
the Meghna. They drain a catchment of 1.72 million kmn in India, Nepal, Bhutan, China and
Bangladesh. About 8% of the catchment lies within Bangladesh.
About 90% of the flow of the three main rivers originates outside of Bangladesh. The combined
discharge of the Jamuna and Padma varies from a minimum of 10,000 cumecs in January to a
peak of 80.000 to 140,000 cumecs in late August and early September. The Farakka Barrage
(situated upstream of the point of entry of the Ganges into Bangladesh) diverts some flow to India,
resulting in increased shortage of water during the dry season in southwestern Bangladesh.
Smaller coastal rivers occur in the southeast (Feni, Karnaphuli, Shankha and Matamuhuri) anc
provide an additional xx mcm of annual discharge.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Enivironmental Assessment
The annual hydrological cycle begins with low water minimal discharge during the cool dry winter
season. Rainfall in the catchment in March and April causes premonsoon flood surges and
temporary bank overspill to occur in some rivers (ie the Kushiyara and the Surma in the Upper
Meghna basin). The onset of the full monsoon rainfall in May and June causes all rivers to rise
and overspill their banks. Peak discharges are attained in August and September. Sustained
flooding in some areas can last throughout the monsoon - typically until October and November.
The level of inundation of the floodplain varies according to location. Postmonsoon drainage of
the floodplain occurs in November and December.
Groundwater resources are ...... (to be completed)
Land Resources
The Bangladesh landscape. is characterised by 20 physiographic units, which can be grouped into
three land forms:
* Hilly areas (12%)
* Terrace areas (8%)
* Floodplain areas (80%)
Most of Bangladesh consists of floodplain and deltaic deposits of the Jamuna, Padna and Mengha
Rivers. Average land elevation above sea level is only a few meters. Highlands occur in the
southwest where mountains rise to almost 3,300 m. About 25% to 30% of the country is flooded
each year from May to September.
The total land area of Bangladesh is 14.8 million ha. Some 9.5 million ha (64.2%) is used for
agriculture. Six million ha are subject to flooding, ranging from 30 cm to over 2 m. Flood period,
depth and duration determine the type and period of crops. Land types based on flood depths and
rice varieties are as follows:

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
The entire coastline of Bangladesh is intercepted by an intricate network of interconnecting
waterways (estuarine ecosystem), some of which varying in width from few meters to several
kilometres. These generally run in a north to south direction. Some of the world's largest rivers
(Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, and also the smaller Karnafully) discharge through estuaries into
the Bay of Bengal.
Although intensive studies on the estuaries have not yet been carried out, several authors have
high lighted some interesting aspects of some of our estuarine system (Mahmood and Ahmed,
1976; Salam, 1976; Quader, 1976; Khair, 1976; Mohi; 1977; Das, 1977; Amin and Mahmood,
1979; Das and Das, 1980; Mahmood and Khan, 1980; Hakim et al., 1981; Paul, 1981; Islam,
1982; Haque, 1983; Hossain, 1983; Mohmood, 1984; and Mahmood et al., 1985). The most
notable feature in hydrology of estuaries is the presence of a yearly prolonged low salinity regime,
mostly during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.
The semidiurnal type of tide is a characteristic feature of Bangladesh coastal waters, with a range
of approximately 3 meters during the time of spring tides. The mean level of tide is not constant
throughout the year as it undergoes changes that vary with attitude and hydrographic (Patullo,
1963). The Bay of Bengal has possibly the largest such variation known on earth. This seasonally
changing, large fluctuation of mean tide level has an important impact on the overall
Iyeomorphology of the coastal area. The average level in March is 94 cm below the average level
in September which is the month with the highest tides (Smith, 1982).
Descriptions of two important estuaries are given below.
Karnafullv estuary: This is the most important river of Chittagong division. It is surrounded by a
region of dense population. high industrialisation and large agricultural land. Chittagong is
commnercially important and also the main port city of Bangladesh, with a permanent population of
about 3 million. The city does not have waste treatment facilities and untreated wastes are
discharged into the river. Most of the industries of Chittagong (tanneries, textile mills, oil
refineries, chemical complex, fertiliser factories, paper and rayon mills, cement factories, steel
mills, soap and detergent factories) are located near the banks of the Karnafully river and
discharge their untreated effluents directly or indirectly into the estuary. The combination of large
population, high industrialisation, heavy shipping activities and shallow depth gives the estuary
substantial pollution problems. Such problems, however, have not been well documented.
Meghna estuarv: The international rivers Ganges and Brahmaputra enter Bangladesh from the west
and north, respectively, join together inside the country, and flow downstream as the Meghna
River to discharge into the Bay of Bengal. This is the main freshwater input into the Bay of
Bengal. The estuary is very important from a geohistorically and is one of the most active areas of
sedimentation in the world. All river going vessels (passenger, cargo, oil tankers, mechanised and
non-mechanised boats) run through the estuary from Chittagong port to upstream districts and to
Dhaka.

through grant of permits over a long period of time. So far, 65,000 ha of USF have
been transferred to DOFr for plantation establishment. The remaining land is now
administered by three district councils on behalf of MOL. In addition, an unknown area
of hilly khas land exists in greater Chittagong and Sylhet districts.
* Private Forest: Private forest is the aggregation of all land with tree cover in villages in
the country and is not a forest in the actual sense of the term. This includes: 1) 724,000)
ha of village forests comprising 477,000 ha of village homestead tree cover, 147,000 ha
of bamboo and 102,000 ha of other trees, and 2) about 49,000 ha of land comprising
derelict and abandoned tea gardens, and areas in tea estates unsuitable for tea plantation
(Mahtab et al, 1991).
The forests under the management of DOFr can be classified into:
* Hill forests, covering an area of 465,000 ha, including 120,000 ha of plantations;
* Mangrove forests consisting of 587,000 ha of natural mangroves (Sunderbans) and
101,000 ha of artificially raised mangrove plantations in the coastal bells and offshore
islands,
* Plain land forests covering about -12,000 ha in Gazipur, Tangail, Sherpur, Mymensingh
i Rajshahi, Rangpur and Dinajpur districts.
Wl'ildlife
At least 18 species of wildlife have become extinct in Bangladesh during the present century. All
of them  still exist in neighbouring   countries, except the pinheaded Duck (Rhodonessa
carrvophyllaca) Which is totally extinct. All these extinctions took place during the period of
colonial rule. At least 40 more species are endangered, and unless drastic measures are taken they
will become extinct in the next few decades. These include tiger and other cats, elephants, hoolock
gibbon, monkeys, deer, gangetic, dolphin, whitewinged wood duck and a number of other birds,
.-harial, estuarine crocodile and monitor lizards. Another 27 or more species are threatened and
these could become endangered within the first half of the next century.
Including the endangered and threatened species referred to above, there exist about 123 species of
mammals (belonging to 33 families), 567 birds, 154 reptiles (belonging to 20 families), and about
23 amphibians. This is a conservative estimate, as there are a few more species whose presence in
Bangladesh awaits confirmation. Exact figures of the past are unknown as no authentic record of
the animals of this part of the world exists. But there is little doubt that a rich wild life fauna
existed in the distant past.
Hunting, shooting and trapping are harmful practices, especially for the larger species, but these
are not the most important causative factors for environmental degradation and population decline.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Aninex 9: Environmental Assessment
The land mass may be divided into several divisions whose vegetation and crops are somewhat
different from each other representing different ecosystems. These are as follows:
* Hilly areas with evergreen and semi-evergreen forest occur in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts, Sylhet, Moulvibazar and Habigonj districts in the East and Netrokona and
Sherpur districts in the North.
* The mangrove forest of the Sunderban in Khulna, Satkhira and Patuakhali districts in
the south-west is the world's largest natural mangrove forest. Small areas of mangrove
also occur in Chakoria and Teknaff of Cox's Bazar district in the south-east.
* Deciduous forest of mixed species occur in the high land (9-18m above mean sea level)
of Madhupur Tracts extending over Tangail, Mymensingh, Gazipur and Narsingdi
districts.
* The uplands of the Brained Tract (20-23m above mean sea level) in the western part are
greatly denuded of tree cover at present and show signs of desertification. They form a
distinct ecosystem different from other parts of the country.
* A small area in the north west in Panchagar, Tetulia shows an undulating terrain with
acid soil and is different from the other plains.
* Coastal islands and a coral reef at St Martin's Island.
* Chars or small islands in the river beds of the major rivers form a distinct ecosystem.
* Recently accreted plodder land in the southern parts of Bangladesh is ecologically
different form the older formed land mass.
At least 5,000 species of flowering plants occur in Bangladesh, many of them are of economic
importance. The main crops are rice, wheat, jute, sugarcane, tea, cotton, mullets, pulses, potato,,
oil seeds, yam and numerous species of vegetables. Among fruits, jack fruit, mango, banana,
coconut, cashew nut, pineapple, guava, lychee, melon, watermelon, borassus palm, lime, papaya
and blackberry are commnon.
The hilly forests are example of tropical rain forest with a tall canopy of trees and an undergrowth
of bamboos, empatorum and other species. Many plants are of medicinal value. Dipterocarps are
the dominant species in these forest. The inland deciduous forests contain mainly jackfruit and
other species. Plantation of teak, rubber, mahogany, eucalyptus, tropical pine, oil palm and other
valuable indigenous exotic species of timber and firewood now form a major part of the managed
forests of Bangladesh. Among timber trees teak, mahogany, koroi, gamari, chapalish, jackfruit,
kathali chapa and mango are important. The mangrove forests provide sundari, goran, gewal,
golpata and firewood from miscellaneous species of trees. Golpata, sungrass and bamboo are
economic plants used for mainly thatched houses of rural areas. Bamboo is also used for
industrial purposes. There are several rattan species and many medicinal plants growing in forests.
Invertebrates are very diverse in Bangladesh. From a partial survey many species of soil
nematodes were recorded. Several leeches and earth worms represent the annelids. Several species
of slugs and snails occur. Spider, centipedes, millipedes and innumerable  insects represent
terrestrial arthropods. Many of them are important pests of various crops and vectors of diseases.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Ens irornental Assessment
However, many of them are useful. In Bangladesh several races of silkworm (Bombyx mori)
occur.
En silk moths also occur but they have not been exploited commercially. The lac insect (Kerya
lacc) occur in Rajshahi-Chapai Nawabganj and is cultured. Honey is harvested commercially. At
least three bee species occur in Bangladesh (Apis indica, A. dorsata and A. florea. Insects also
play a very important role in pollination. Termites, borers, leaf miners, leaf hoppers and plant
hoppers, mosquitoes, sand flies, flies, ticks and mites play important roles in agriculture, health
and animal husbandry sectors. But comprehensive inventories of the invertebrate animals of
Bangladesh has never been prepared.
Among the amphibians, toads, frogs and tree frogs have been recorded. Frogs and toads play
important roles in natural control of agriculture pests. Bull frogs were once exported but this is
now banned. Lizards, geckoes and the Bengal monitor are important land reptiles. There are many
turtles, but the only truly terrestrial tortoise occurring in Bangladesh is the Burmese Brown
Tortoise (Geochelone emvs). One species of skink (Anjani, Mabniva carinata) occurs in
Bangladesh. Many snakes occur in Bangladesh including two species of python (Python molurus
molur-us and P. reticnlatu.s) and two species of blind snakes (Typhina spp), Other well known
snakes are darashz or the ratsnake (Ptas mucorsus), dudfiraj or Copper head trinket snake (Elaphe,
radiata), kalnagini (Chrysopela ornata), common vine snake (Aphaetulla nasutus), common wolf
snake or gharginni (Lyvcdon spp.), king cobra (Ophiopaaus hanna), cobra (Njaa spp.), Banded
krait (Bun,,urus fasciatus), common krait (B  caeru), Dussel's viper (Vipera russelli) and
others.
Of the 579 species of birds recorded from Bangladesh there occurs one species each of a grebe, a
pelican and one little cormorant. Other species include herons, egrets, bitterns, storks, ibis,
spoonbill, ducks,  geese, falcon, eagles, buzzards, kites, harriers, osprey, vultures, fowls,
pheasant, crane, moor hen, jacana, snipes, sandpipers, gulls, pigeon, doves, parrots, cuckoos,
owls, night swift, house swift, king fisher, hornbill and wood peckers, Among the passerine birds
there are larks, swallow, bulbuls, shrikes, fly catchers, crows and drongo. Many of these birds
are migratory while others are residents in the country.
Among mammals there are shrews, fruit bats, pipestrelles (chamchika), pangolin. Among primates
there is a tree strew (Ipaia nicobarica), slow loris (Nvcticebus coucang). Rhesus monkey (Macaca
mulatta), crab eating macaque (ML.irus), lengurs (Presbyvis spp.), Hook gibbon (HyLobates
hoolocl). There are squirrels, rats mouse, porcupines, Indian hare (Lepus cuniculus ruficandatus)
and- the Assam Rabbit or the Hispid hare (Capnologus hispius). Among carnivores the most
famous species in the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigra). Other carnivores include leopards,
civets and other cats, fox, jackal, the Asiatic wild dog or dhole Cuon alpisehs), bears and
mongoose. Domestic horse and ass occur among ungulates. One horned Rhinoceros used to exit
but is now extinct. Among the even toed ungulates wild boar, domestic pig, barking dear, spotted
dear, Sambur, sebu (Bs indirus) and domestic European ox (Bo taurus), and the Asiatic Buffalo
(Buhalus babalis) are common, gaur (Baszgaurus) and goyal (Bos frontalis) are rare. Domestic

2oals and sheep are found but the wild serow (Capricornis sumatraensis) is an endangered
species.
The need for conservative has arisen due to overexploitation of certain resources. Energy demands
are putting great pressure on forest resources. This pressure can be  alleviated  by making
available alternatives for fuel wood. Conditions should be made conducive for saving animal waste
for preparing organic manure rather than burring them as fuel. Plans must be made to allocate
land for fodder crops. Resource allocation shall have to be revised and reallocated to make
development sustainable. It would be important to integrate agricultural crop production with
animal husbandry, poultry management and fish culture. Recognition of this integration at the
highest policy making level would lead to the reorganisation and renovation of the management of
the above sectors ( Mahtab et al. 1991).

F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
F. 1 Predicted Impacts
Impacts in Inland Openwater Capture Fisheries
Floodplairn Stocking Component
This component has a potential for negative impact on native chotomach2 species due to
competition from stocked non-indigenous species. The degree of impact could depend on stocking
density, and possibly the quality of ancillary management efforts. Heavy stocking of grass carp
and common carp can greatly reduce the abundance of submerged macrophytes in beels and baors
wvhich provide essential habitat shelter and food sources for a large number of small fish species.
A reduction in abundance of those chotomach species dependant on submerged macrophyte
habitats would be expected. The tendency of common carp to roil the water by stirring up fine
sediment and clay while feeding reduces water quality and could further affect production of some
of the more sensitive chotomach species. Stocking of silver carp and bighead carp can negatively
impact the production of plank-ton feeding choromach such as chapila, ketchki and some cyprinids
throuoh competition for food. The production trade-off is likely to be less drastic compared to
2rass and comrnon carp stocking.
There exists a potential for a negative impact on the genetic diversity of wild stocks of indigenous
carp species (rui, carla, mrigel) due to stocking of large numbers of fingerlings of these species
derived from relatively few hatchery resident broodstock. The wild stocks of native carp are
currently much reduced in abundance due to overfishing and environmental degradation.
Hatchery-produced fingerlings would likely greatly outnumber wild fingerlings wherever large
scale stocking of floodplains is carried out, and very quickly dilute wild genetic diversity with less
diverse hatchery gene pools. Natural selection could likely eliminate unfit genotypes of hatchery
origin fairly quickly and act to dampen the drain on diversity somewhat. Nonetheless a net loss of
genetic diversity is to be expected. This would increase the long-term risk of survival of wild carp
stocks. The potential negative impact of genetic diversity loss cannot be readily quantified.
There exists a potential for a negative impact on wild fish stocks by transmission of disease from
hatchery stocks. Entry of new disease into Bangladesh through importation of broodstock could
result in new pandemics. Also, reinfection of stocks in areas that have recovered from previous
epidemics could also take place through stocking of hatchery reared fingerlings. High rates of
mortality can arise as a result of disease epidemics in beels and baors.
Positive impacts from floodplain stocking are the increase in abundance of depressed native carp
populations (rii, carla, mnrigel).



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Ainznex 9: Environmental Assessment
Fish Sanictuaries Componienzt
No negative environmental impacts are expected from  the establishment of fish sanctuaries.
Positive impacts are the increased protection of fish biodiversity and maintenance of stock
abundance. Some social impacts may occur due to displacement of some fishermen from sanctuary
areas.
Caanal Re-excavation Component
There exists a potential for a negative impact on the stored volume of water in beels and baors
during the dry season due to improved drainage capacity of the canal. This could result in reduced
area/volume of dry season refuge habitat for fish, increase environmental stress on fish
populations (likely leading to outbreaks of disease and significant fish mortality) and increase the
probability that dewatering would be used to do a complete fish harvest. Loss of reproductive
success and recruitment during the monsoon due to total harvest of broodstock during the previous
dry season could depress monsoon production.
The positive impacts from canal re-excavation are: 1) re-establishmnent of active fish migration
routes between rivers/khals and beels/baors, and 2) replenishment of beel/baor fish biodiversity
and stock abundance.
Fishpass Construction Component
There exists a minor potential for a negative impact on boro and aus rice production during the
premonsoon and early monsoon periods due to entry of water through the fishpass into the FCDI
project area. The magnitude of this potential impact is very variable and difficult to predict, and in
the majority of cases the impact will be nil.
The positive impacts of fishpass construction are the re-establishment of fish and prawn migration
routes across flood control embankmnents, leading to increased fish biodiversity and stock
abundance inside the FCDI project.
Because the access canals/khals on either side of the fishpass need to be declared as sanctuaries,
the potential positive and social impacts associated with sanctuaries noted above are also
applicable to fishpasses.
Impacts in Freshwater Finfish Aquaculture
Initensive Pond Culture Demonstration and Credit Component
There exists a potential for negative impacts on wild fish stocks in adjacent rivers and floodplains
due to escapage of fish from ponds. The impact can be in the form of disease transmission and/or
in the form of establishment of undesirable non-indigenous species in openwater habitats. Many
non-indigenous species now occur in natural water bodies in Bangladesh (tilapia, Thai puti, Thai
pangas, African magur, silver carp and common carp). Some non-indigenous species have
established self-sustaining populations (ie tilapia and common carp). It would be undesirable if
certain other non-indigenous species (Thai puti and African magur) were able to establish self-



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Env ironmrental Assessment
sustaining populations in the wvild. Impacts of non-indigenous species on native species and aquatic
habitat have already been noted above under the floodplain stocking component. In most cases the
number of individual fish escaping ponds will be relatively small, and their impact on natural
populations and habitat would not be as great as under the floodplain stocking component.
However, once established in the wild, an undesirable species is almost impossible to eradicate.
Intensive Cage Culture Demonstration and Credit Component
There exist potentials for negative impacts which are similar to those noted above for the intensive
pond culture component. The risk to native fish stocks and aquatic habitat due to escapage from
cages into surrounding rivers, beels or baors is considered to be greater than for ponds. Additional
potential for negative impact could arise in the form of eutrophication due to the use of un-pelleted
feed or due to overfeeding. The greater fish biomass carrying capacity of cages compared to a
similar volume of uncaged surface water will result in greater release of metabolic waste products
such as ammonia, urea and CO,. Eutrophication impacts might be reduced naturally by rapid re-
assimilation of lost feed and molecular wastes by the surrounding trophic chain if adequate stocks
of chotomach are allowed to congregate around cages, and stands of submerged macrophytes take
root around cages.
Semi-Intensive Pen Culture Demonstration and Credit Component
There exist potentials for negative impacts which are similar to those noted above for the intensive
cage culture component. The risk to native fish stocks and aquatic habitat due to escapage from
pens into seasonally connected rivers, beels or baors is considered to be marginally greater than
for ponds, but less than for cages. The potential for negative impact due to eutrophication from
the use of un-pelleted feed or due to overfeeding is significant. However, the isolated nature of
borrow pits and dead rivers will result in containment of impacts to the grow-out area for three
types of water bodies. Eutrophication impacts might be reduced naturally by rapid re-assimilation
of lost feed and dissolved wastes by the surrounding trophic chain if adequate stocks of chotomach
are allowed to co-habit with stocked fish, and stands of submerged macrophytes allowed to take
root. There are also potentials for interference with navigation routes in canals, and
disenfranchisement of fishermen and fisherwomen who previously fished in the water bodies.
Broodstock azd Hatchery Component
There exists a potential for negative impacts on wild fish stocks as well as pond stock due to
disease transmission, especially new diseases brought in by imported broodstock.
Contract Research Component
There exists a moderate potential for negative impacts on wild fish stocks through disease
transmission or competition with non-indigenous species resulting from escapage or deliberate
dumping of fish into the natural environment.
Impacts in Crustacean and Brackishwater Aquaculture
Sustainable Shrimp Seed Collection Component
No negative environmental impacts are expected from this component. An expected positive
impact is the reduction in mortality of shrimp and fish larvae, and an increase in stock abundance.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annwex 9: Environmental Assessment
Inztegrated Coastal Zone Planning Component
No negative environmental impacts are expected from this component. An expected positive
impact is the limitation of shrimp farming to designated areas which do not threaten existing
mangrove stands or agriculture.
Private Hatcheries for Shrimp and Prawns Component
There exists a potential for a negative impact on farm and wild shrimp and prawn stocks by
transmission of disease from hatchery stocks. The most serious disease currently affecting farm
shrimp stocks is the white spot virus. The cause of the latest outbreak of this disease in
Bangladesh is due to large-scale importation of shrimp seed from Thai hatcheries in 1995.
Hatcheries - whether domestic or foreign - clearly have a significant potential to propagate and
transmit crustacean diseases.
Improved Freshwater Prawn Culture Component
There exists a potential for negative impacts on water quantity and quality from increased water
supply and drainage of prawn ponds. The pumping of groundwater through tubewells for pond
water supply in areas where insufficient surface water exists could result in depletion of
freshwater and intrusion of saline water into the groundwater aquifer. The discharge of metabolic
waste products during pond drainage could have a negative effect on receiving waters. The
general tendency to overfeed prawns with snail meat and loose dry feeds exacerbates the problem
of poor quality of drainage water. In many-areas the baseline quality of receiving waters is already
low due to human sewage, industrial effluents and agricultural chemicals pollution. Additional
nutrient loading from prawn farms will result in further water quality deterioration and additional
stress to living organisms.
There also exists a potential for negative impacts on wild snail populations which are used for
food for prawns. The largest fraction of prawn feed is made up of snail meat. Expansion of prawn
farming has increased the harvesting rate of snails from natural sources. This has resulted in
depletion of some snail populations, and supplies are now augmented with imports from India.
Further expansion of prawn farming could result in the collapse of local snail stocks and increased
reliance on imports from India. Importation carries with it the risk of disease transmission,
including vectors possibly harmful to humans.
Inproved Shrimp Processing Practices Component
No negative environmental impacts are expected from this component.
Impacts in Institutional Development

niolzasol, sarputi, pangas, and silond) and increases in catches of these species.
Fisheries Enz vironments Improvement Subproject
No negative environmental impacts are expected from this component. Expected positive impacts,
of this component are habitat improvement through tree plantation, greater dry season water levels

agrochemicals and industrial pollution. Habitat improvements will lead to increased stock
abundance and increased fish biodiversity.

expected are decreased risk of disease transmission from hatcheries, between ponds, and to natural
waters and fish stocks, as well as less loss of production due to disease.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Anntex 9: Environmental Assessment
F.2 Level and Quantification of Impacts for Various Environments
Impacts Associated with Natural Physical Environment
The following impacts on the natural physical environment could be expected from project
activities:
1.Beel and Baor Hvdrologv: Increased drainage and/or dewatering of beels and baors due
to improved channel flow capacity from canal re-excavation, leading to reduced dry
season refuge habitat and increased mortality of overwintering fish stocks.
2.FCDI ProJect Hvdrology: Marginal increase of water level inside FCDI projects due to
entry of water into area through fishpass during premonsoon and early monsoon floods,
possibly threatening some rice crops planted around margin of internal beels and
lowlying areas.
3.Water Course Eutrophication: Variable degree of eutrophication of natural water courses
from pen and cage culture and from prawn farms due to overfeeding and metabolic waste
products excretion.
4.Groundwater Extraction: Depletion of freshwater groundwater supply and intrusion of
saline water due to use of tubewells as water supply to prawn farms situated near coastal
areas.
Impacts Associated with Natural Biological Environment
The following impacts on the natural biological enviromnent could be expected from project
activities:
5.Submerged Macrophvtes: Decrease in submerged macrophyte abundance in beels and
baors due to stocking of grass carp and common carp, leading to decline in chotomach
abundance and catch.
6.Competition for Plankton: Decrease in abundance of indigenous plankton-eating fish in
beels, baors and floodplains due to competition from stocked non-indigenous
planktivorous carp (silver, bighead).
7.Genetic Diversity: Loss of genetic diversity in wild major carp stocks (rui, catla, mrigel)
on floodplains due to dilution from stocking with hatchery reared stock of limited genetic
diversity.
8.Disease Transmission: Fish and crustacean disease transmission resulting in pandemics
of new diseases or re-infection with existing diseases of wild and cultured fish and
crustacean stocks: a) from hatcheries during stocking of floodplains or aquaculture grow-
out facilities with disease animals, b) from hatcheries due to importation of new
broodstock which is diseased, and c) from escapage or deliberate dumping of diseased
animals from hatcheries, aquaculture ponds, floating cages or pens.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARA TION Annex 9: Envirot)nerntal Assessmenr
9.Snail Stock Depletion. Overharvesting of snail populations used for prawn feed, and
transmission of diseases from illegally imported snails from India.
Impacts Associated with Socio-Economic Environment
The following impacts on the socio-economic environment are expected from project activities:
10.Disenfranchisement: Displacement of some fishermen from the areas designated as fish
sanctuaries (including access channels of fishpasses) and the areas used for pen culture.
11.NaviZation: Interference with navigation routes in areas used for pen culture.
Impacts Affecting the Boundary Regions
Possible impact of the propose project outside of the project boundary area are as follows:
* Downstream water course eutrophication beyond project boundary from pen and cage
culture and from prawn farming.
* Loss of genetic diversity in migratory fish stocks beyond project boundary due to out-
migration and mingling on remote spawning grounds of hatchery-sourced major carp
(rii, catla, mrigel) used in floodplain stocking.
* Disease outbreaks beyond project boundary.
* Out-migration of undesirable introductions beyond project boundary.
* Pressure on Indian snail stocks due to importation to Bangladesh for prawn feed.
Information Deficiencies and Requirements
Comprehensive assessment and quantification of the 11 principal potential project impacts that
have been identified is not readily possible. Reliable quantification is hampered by lack of
information in the following areas:
* Beel and Baor Hvdrologv: Design details on canal re-excavation and hydrology of
canals and affected beels and baors have not yet been prepared. This information is
required before a quantified assessment can be made of the potential risk of stress to
beel and baor dry season water volumes, and the risk to fish stocks.
* FCDI Project Hvdrologv: Analysis of river and FCDI hydrology (without fishpass) and
establishment of fishpass design parameters of each FCDI project selected for fishpass
construction have not yet been carried out. These analyses are required before it would
be possible to estimate the volumes of water entering an FCDI project through a
fishpass. A separate analysis of cropping patterns and topography inside the FCDI
project is required before the potential impact of incoming water on rice crops could be
determined.
* Water Course Eutrophication: Information on the total number of culture units, their
locations, quantity of waste discharged, and receiving water hydrology and quality are
required before the potential impact of eutrophication can be assessed.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* Groundwater Extraction: Information on the total number of prawn ponds, their
locations, quantity of groundwater extracted, the groundwater recharge rates, and the
proximity of saline water are required before the potential impact of groundwater
extraction can be assessed.
* Submerged Macrophvtes: Information on proposed stocking densities of grass carp and
common carp is required, as well as stocking locations, existing submerged macrophyte
densities, and stock abundance of affected chotomach species.
* Competition for Plankton: Information on proposed stocking densities of silver carp and
bighead carp is required, as well as stocking locations, average plankton densities, and
stock abundance of affected planktivorous native species.
* Genetic Divsity: Information on the proposed stocking densities of hatchery-reared
riui, catla and mrigel, and abundance of wild stock in the stocking area is required.
Genetic diversity for both hatchery-reared and wild stocks would need to be determined
(in terms of genetic trait quality and quantity).
* Disease Transmission: Adequate data on the existing incidence of disease at various
sources is not available and would need to be assembled. Data on disease incidence and
risk from potential external sources of broodstock is also not available. A survey and
assessment would also need to be undertaken of existing practices in Bangladesh
hatcheries which might increase the risk of disease propagation. Information on the
activities of fish and prawn farmers, and data on the incidence of escapage due to
various causes (inadequately constructed facilities, cyclone damage, flooding) would
need to be assembled.
* Snail Stock Depletion. Data on snail stock assessment, growth rates and survival rates,
as well as the harvesting rate are needed in order to assess the status of the snail
collection activity. Information on the quantity of snails illegally imported from India,
and the disease status of the imports is also needed.
* Disenfranchisement: The number of fishermen displacement at each proposed fish
sanctuary needs to be determined, as well as their catch rates and earnings.
* Navigation: The locality of each pen needs to be specified, and information on boat
traffic in the area needs to be collected.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Env!ironnmental Assessment
G. CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
G.1 Cumulative Impact Assessment Methodology
Cumulative impacts are effects that result from the addition of two or more impacts. Cumulative
impacts may derive from:
* actions from the past, present and future,
* multiple human activities,
* natural events.
The actions may be repeated or occur in combinations.
For the present EIA, cumulative impacts refers to impacts that might result from various
combinations of project impacts acting in association with extra-project activities and events.
A large but fragmented, incomplete and partly unreliable database exists for past and present
activities takino place within the project area. This database was scrutinised for relevant items.
Field visits were conducted to various proposed project locations and additional data was
collected, as well as clarification of existing databases. Information on snail stocks in India was
not readily available.
Planning pipelines for future project activities such as FCDI works under the BWDB and LGED
were also examined.
G.2 Potential Non-Project Impacts Combined with Project Impacts
Regional Impacts
Several cumulative effects are possible from the externalities of the proposed project.
Improved drainage through canal excavation could put stress on dry season beel and baor water
volumes, that would be intensified by further water extraction by farmers for boro rice irrigation.
This could increase the likelihood that dewatering for complete fish harvesting would be carried
out because of the low cost of pumping out the small amount of water remaining.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARA TION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
The water entering into an FCDI project through a fishpass might be sufficient to cause increased
crop damage if accompanied by simultaneous sustained heavy rainfall inside the project area.
Groundwater extraction for aquaculture would be additive to existing groundwater extraction for
crop irrigation and other water supply uses such as for domestic and industrial applications. The
effect would be to more rapidly deplete groundwater aquifers, resulting in possible lowering of
water tables, aquifer exhaustion and/or saline water intrusion.
A complex of factors negatively impact native chotomach and planktivorous fish stocks, including
FCDI development, deforestation, agrochemicals, industrial pollution, sedimentation, disease,
overfishing and dewatering. This has already led to heavy pressure on many populations resulting
in local stock depletion. Intensified openwater fisheries stocking could lead to further pressure on
these fish stocks and accelerate stock collapse.
Both natural and culture fish and crustacean stocks have suffered severe disease outbreaks during
the last decade (ie EUS, white spot). This has resulted in major economic and nutritional losses in
the past. The transmission of new diseases or mutated strains of existing diseases would lead to
further economic and nutritional losses in the future.
WN'orldwide Climate Change
There is an increasing trend in rainfall in some parts of Bangladesh and the surrounding catchment
region over the last 30 years. This is leading to intensified and more prolonged flooding. The
cumulative impact of increased flooding with project impacts is mainly in the greater impact on
rice cultivation inside FCDI projects due to greater head differences across fishpasses (leading to
increased discharge through the structure).
Upper Riparian Activities
Increasing deforestation in the catchments (especially in India and Nepal) of the main rivers of
Bangladesh will further intensify fish an systemic flooding and sedimentation. An increase in
water pollution from human sewage and industrial development can also be expected. Cumulative
impacts in combination with project externalities will be on hydrology (as per the previous
paragraph), and on water quality (derived from aquaculture discharges).
Low^er Riparian Pollution Transport
Water course eutrophication from aquaculture would be additive to eutrophication and pollution
from other sources. Aquaculture discharge water could contain high biological oxygen demand
from uneaten food, nitrogen and ammonia from metabolic wastes, and toxic or otherwise harmful
chemicals from biocides, lime and other pond preparation and treatment measures. The cumulative
effect could be to render water courses unfit for aquatic life for some distance downstream.
G.3 Cumulative Impacts Relevant to Other Regions



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Large-picture cumulative impacts of the proposed project in association with the major
envirorunental issues of Bancladesh is related to population growth. The proposed project will
lead to greater food fish production. This will in turn result in better nutrition, improved foreign
exchange earnings and greater population growth in areas outside the project. The large and dense
population of Bangladesh has already had severe environmental impacts including massive
deforestation to clear land for rice production, massive solid and liquid waste disposal into the
environment, and fishery resource depletion for food. Increase in urban population (Dhaka,
Khulna, Chittagong) - bolstered by in-migration of increasing number of rural landless people -
will lead to greater demand and more intensive mining of fish resources in the mainly rural project
area to pr6vide food for the relatively wealthier urban population. Thus the principal desirable
impact of the project (increased food fish production and better nutrition) could feed back
neg atively to the envirorunent in the form of increased fishery resource exploitation pressure.
In a related vein, an increasing population that relies heavily for food on the intensified fish
production that the project aims to achieve would be put at greater risk if production was
disrupted by natural disasters such as the cyclones and floods that Bangladesh is particularly prone
to, or by outbreaks of new and highly virulent- diseases. Steadily greater deterioration of water
quality from sewage and pollution could also lead to sudden reproductive or recruitment failures
in some fish stocks followed by population extinction. Increased risk would appear to be inherent
to some degree in intensification of fish production. Intensification of production is more
sustainable if adequate precautions are taken to minimise risk.

Media Releases
(To be completed)
H.2 Integration of the Concerns of Interested Parties into Assessment
Summarv of Concerns by Category
Meetings were held with local residents and agency staff. The following are the main
environmental concerns (grouped by categories) expressed during the meetings:
Prawn farmers
* Most of the farms are not services by supply and drainage canals and dependent on
monsoon rain water. There is no link canal with river and culture area.
* Use of snail meat as feed has sharply depressed the natural population of snails, and
consequently the price increase of snails is hampering prawn production.
* Poor pond management practices result in low yields.
^ Farmers do not have technical knowledge about pond construction, pond preparation,
pond management, stocking and feed management.
* After harvesting the crop, farmers do not have any employment opportunities for about
four months, and remain idle.
* Farmers sell their products to depot owners and middleman at low price because they
borrow money from them for stocking.
Shrimp farmers



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* Scarcity of Bagda fry and high prices.
* Scarcity of low priced protein feeds.
* Large-area land utilisation but comparatively low productivity.
* Farmers do not have adequate technical knowledge for better production of shrimp
crops.
* Production has collapsed due to outbreak of white spot disease during the last two years.
Semi-intensive farms of Khulna and Chittagong were badly affected by disease
outbreaks and are presently practicing culture of Thai pangas.
* -In some areas of Khulna region, farmers are allowed to take lease of land for only one
or two years, and as a result farmers cannot construct permanent embanknents, canals
and regulators.
* In Polder 5 (Khulna region), due to constructional defect of the sluice gate, one way
flow of water through the sluice gate, and conflict over the primary water supply canal,
farmers are deprived of water intake into culture ponds resulting in low production
- About 15 sluice gates of Third Fisheries are defective and remain closed due to silting
up.
* Security is a major problem. In many areas there are no police stations.
* At many farms there is no electricity.
* Farms of remote areas do not get ice. As a result quality of the product deteriorates
during transportation to depots or processing plants.
* Instruments, chemicals and fertilisers are not available near farm sites.
* Skilled manpower is not readily available.
* In the Cox's Bazar area, the farmers do not have any employment opportunity for about
six months after harvesting the crop.
* Polluted water is used by the semi-intensive farms located at the bank of Bankkhali
River (Cox's Bazar), resulting in problems in culturing shrimp.
* An incentive or prize should be awarded to good farmers.
* Instructional booklets should be published on different aspects of shrimp culture.
* A separate brackishwater division of the DOF should be set up to deal with shrimp
culture and coastal environments.
* A Fishery Bank should be established.
* More cyclone shelters should be constructed.
* In Paikgacha area, some Bagda farmers cut BWDB embankments and introduce saline
water for farming practice without any permission from the concerned department.
Shrimp fry collectors
* The shrimp fry collectors in Khulna region who use push nets destroy other planktonic
organisms in contrast to the fry collectors who use boats. The latter do not destroy other
organisms, but rather release them back to the water).
* The fry collectors sell their fry to middle at a cheap rate.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Entvironmental Assessment
* Many fry collectors do not have their own nets. They borrow nets from middlemen and
are compelled to sell their collected fry to the middlemen at a very cheap rate.
* The farmers do not have the facility to store and to keep the fry alive for a considerable
to keep the fry alive for longer time periods. Fry are stored in a pot without any feed or
aeration system.
* Echinoderms, sand dollar, starfish and other intertidal organisms of the intertidal zone
have been destroyed due to collection of shrimp fry activity.
Fishery Officers. Research Officers and other personnel
* In Golda farming, the farmers use large quantities of snail meat and as a result natural
snail populations have declined, and snails are illegally imported without quarantine.
* Golda farmers use their prepare loose feed using rice bran and fish dust which
sometimes pollutes the pond water.
* Presently there is no relevant policy and legislation for shrimp culture in the country.
- Conflicts between shrimp culture and agriculture should not damage social harmony.
- Shrimp farmers, shrimp fry collectors and fishermen should be provided with training in
their respective fields.
* Kenduar beel and other beels should be protected from shrimp culture and paddy
production.
- Shrimp hatcheries should be established both by the GOB and private sector.
X For shrimp farming, water supply and drainage systems should be developed.
- Electricity should be provided to shrimp farms.
* Shrimp culture areas for Golda and Bagda should be identified on the basis of site
selection criteria, and land size should be determined and allocated to an actual farmer.
* Depots should be established with the permission of the concerned GOB office, and
hygiene and sanitation should be inspected periodically.
* Sufficient numbers of insulated vans should be provided for rapid transport and
marketing of fishery products.
* Laboratories should be established in each district head quarter to expand analysis
facilities.
* Some NGOs sell medicine and chemical under different trade names to illiterate shrimp
farmers to solve their problems. GOB should investigate the matter so that poor farmers
are not cheated.
* Due to brackishwater shrimp culture, paddy production is reduced, trees are destroyed,
drinking water is scarce, and grazing fields for livestock are limited.
* To conserve the habitat and biodiversity, a 0.5 km wide zone around St Martin's Island
should be declared a sanctuary.
* The depth of the Bankkhali River has decreased by 50% since 1984 due to siltation. At
Kasturi Ghat of the river, there previously were abundant stocks of oysters, sea
anemone, crabs and other animals, but the habitat has since been destroyed due to
pollution, siltation, proliferation of trawlers, and human disturbance. Previously, fishes



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
(bhetki. mullet, grouper) were abundant, but the fish resources have now declined due
to these causes.
* Hundreds of fishermen catch coral fish during rough weather with hand lines, and as a
result the coral fish around St Martin's Island have declined.
* Fishermen catch fishes in rock pools situated between Cox's Bazar and Teknaff using
rotenone
* During collection of monodon fry, the average catch composition is one monodon fry
for 38 other shrimp species, 56 zooplankton and 12 finfish larvae. The composition
varies from place to place. Around 20% undesired species are released back to water
and about 20% by-catch are thrown to beach. Fry mortality is 30%-50% during holding
at collection sites and transport to culture sites.
Fishermen and local residents of Dakatia Beel
* Paddy does not grow when the water level is high in the beel.
* Out of 3 sluice gates, only one is in operation and two were closed due to deposition of
heavy silt at the bottom of the gate.
* The Shalu River should be excavated to reduce water logging in the beel. Local
fishermen and paddy cultivators are facing difficulties to raise their desired crop and
would like to cut the embankment so that tidal water flushes the beel.
• The embankmnents of the Bhanad Bhayane and Khukshia beels of Jessore district were
cut in different areas just a few days before the field visit to Dakatia Beel by the local
farmers to allow tidal water to enter.
Fishermen of baors
* Do not want to establish a fish sanctuary as it would interfere with their fishing method.
* Disturbed by miscreants during harvesting.
* Farmers pump out water from baor for cultivation of boro paddy and mustered plants.
* Some baors are partly covered with water hyacinth.
* Some sluice gates are defective and not in operation.
FCDI ProQjects
* Before the establishment of Muhuri FCDI project of Feni, the fishermen used to catch
more fish and shrimp than the present day. At the present time, more shrimp and fish
are available on the freshwater side than the brackishwater side of the barrage.
Migration of shrimp and fish have been negatively affected due to establishment of the
barrage.
• Before the establishment of Chandpur FCDI project, lots of shrimp and fish were
available, but now stocks have declined. A massive infestation of water hyacinth blocks
the gate area.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annzex 9: Environmental Assessment
River Fishermen
* In the past large numbers of fishes were present but presently the catch has declined.
* Fish stock reduction in the river is due to the following causes: a) overfishing and no
new recruitment, b) use of pesticide in the agricultural fields, c) discharge of waste by
the industries, d) depth of water reduced due to siltation, and e) increased turbidity in
the river water.
St Martin's Island
* There is scarcity of ice and cold storage.
* There is scarcity of drinking water during the fishing season.
* There is no fish landing centre and all fish processing and marketing activities are made
directly on the sandy beach in unsanitary conditions.
* During drying of fish insecticides are applied to combat infestation with mites and flies.
* There is a security problem during catching of fish in the sea and during the return
journey to the island with fish.
* On the east coast, starfish, sea anemones, sand dollars and other animals have become
extinct due to human activities on the shore.
* Turtles used to come at night to lay eggs in the north-east part of the island but now
they do not come due to human disturbance. Now they lay their eggs at the southern
part of the island.
Summary of Response to Concerns
The following measures would alleviate many of the concerns expressed during the consultations:
* Prawn farmers would benefit from link canals from rivers to culture area, low cost
protein feeds, technical assistance, training, employment during the low season and soft-
term credit facility.
* Shrimp farners would benefit from better availability of fry for stocking, low priced
protein feeds, better management of the ponds, control of diseases, long term lease of
GOB land, efficient and functional sluice gates and regulators for water supply, security
measures, electricity, supply of ice in remote areas, instruments, chemicals, fertilisers,
skilled manpower, control of water pollution, incentive to good farmers, publication of
instructional booklets, establishment of a brackishwater division in the DOF, a fishery
bank, cyclone shelters and employment opportunities during the low season.
* Proper policy and legislation should be adopted for shrimp culture. Shrimp culture area
should be identified. Selling of unknown medicine to the farmers should be controlled
and depots should be registered.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Enivironmental Assessment
* A sanctuary should be establish_d around St Martin's Island to -halt the decline of coral
fish stocks. Illegal fishing of the rock pools between Cox's Bazar and Teknaf needs to
be controlled.
* Beels should be protected for shrimp and paddy cultivation.
* Shrimp fry collectors would benefit from low priced country boat, nets, storing facility
with feed and accretion system and direct supply of fries to culturists.
* The crab fishery should be provided with logistic support for development.
Actions to be Tak-en
The following are priority actions suggested by the consultations which would lead to increases iin
production:
- In prawn farming areas where there are no facilities for water exchange, link canalls
should be excavated.
- Research should be conducted to develop low cost protein feeds for prawns and shrimp.
* Farmers should be periodically trained in basic and modern culture methods.
* DFOs and TFOs should be trained in culture methods and in the handling of analytical
instruments both in the laboratory and in the field.
- Farmers should be provided with booklets in Bangla covering different aspects of
culture and technical assistance according to their needs by fisheries officers and NGOs.
* For the steady supply of shrimp fry, hatcheries should be established in Cox's Bazar
and Khulna. Sanctuaries should be established in different regions of coastal areas and
off the coast to protect shrimp broodstock.
* To implement control measures for shrimp and fish diseases, a survey should be
undertaken to determine the types of diseases present, and mitigation measures should
be undertaken in consultation with disease experts.
* Inoperative sluice gates should be repaired, and all sluice gates should capable of
providing intake and discharge. The actions should be done in consultation with the
enaineers concerned.
* The GOB should provide security, electricity, instruments, chemicals, skilled labour,
incentives to productive farmers, a fishery bank and cyclone shelters in the coastal area.
* The GOB should establish a separate Marine Directorate Office for marine fisheries.
* All industries discharging solid and liquid waste to the environment should be required
to carry out primary treatment at the minimum.
* Pesticides should be controlled through policy and proper legislation.
* Shrimp fry collectors should be provided with logistic support and training so that they
do not destroy the by-catch.
* Insulated vans should be provided to transport shrimp and fish from ponds to processing
plants.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environtmental Assessment
* Laboratories should be established for soil and water analysis at divisional headquarters.
* Proper policy should be adopted for shrimp culture.
* Depots (where shrimp and prawns are purchased and stored) should be registered and
inspected for hygiene and quality of shrimp and prawns.
* Afforestation programmes should be undertaken for mangrove vegetation along the
coast as soon as possible.
* The number of fishermen and fisherwomen catching fish from rocks pools and coral
areas along the coast should be controlled.
* Logistic support should be provided to the crab fishery.
* Programmnes should be undertaken to clear water hyacinth from haors, baors, beels,
barrow pits, FCDI projects and other infested waters.
* Some small rivers and canals should be re-excavated.
* Security at sea should be strengthened.
* A fish landing centre should be established at St Martin's Island.
- Steps should be taken to protect turtles laying eggs on St Martin's Island.
- Policy and legislation should be promulgated to protect coral reefs and seaweed beds off
St Martin's Island.
- Research activities should be distributed among the universities of the country rather
than FRI because little substantial research activities are undertaken at Chandpur,
Paikgaacha and Cox's Bazar FRI stations.
- MOFL and DOF should have advisory panels of knowledgeable fisheries experts to
provide suggestions, evaluate research activities and monitor different fishery
programmes.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
I. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
1.1 Environmental Protection Plan
Anticipated Negative Environmental Impacts
Eleven potential impacts are predicted from the proposed project.
• Beet and Baor Hvdrologv: Increased drainage and/or dewatering of beels and baors due to
improved channel flow capacity from canal re-excavation, leading to reduced dry season
refuge habitat and increased mortality of overwintering fish stocks.
- FCDI Project Hvdrolo2v: Marginal increase of water level inside FCDI projects due to
entry of water into area through fishpass during premonsoon and early monsoon floods,
possibly threatening some rice crops planted around margin of internal beels and lowlying
areas.
* Water Course Eutrophication: Variable degree of eutrophication of natural water courses
from pen and cage culture and from prawn farms due to overfeeding and metabolic waste
excretion.
* Groundwater Extraction: Depletion of freshwater groundwater supply and intrusion of
saline water due to use of tubewells as water supply to prawn farms situated near coastal
areas.
* Submerged Macrophvtes: Decrease in submerged macrophyte abundance in beels and baors
due to stocking of grass carp and common carp, leading to decline in chotomach abundance
and catch.
* Competition for Plankton: Decrease in abundance of indigenous plankton-eating fish in
beels, baors and floodplains due to competition from stocked non-indigenous planktivorous
carp (silver, bighead).
* Genetic Diversity: Loss of genetic diversity in wild major carp stocks (rui, catla, mrigel)
on floodplains due to massive stocking with hatchery reared stock of limited genetic
diversity.
* Disease Transmission: Fish and crustacean disease transmission resulting in pandemics of
new diseases or re-infection with existing diseases of wild and cultured fish and crustacean
stocks: a) from hatcheries during stocking of floodplains or aquaculture grow-out facilities



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
with diseased animals, b) from hatcheries due to importation of new broodstock which is
diseased, and c) from escapage or deliberate dumping of diseased animals from hatcheries,
aquaculture ponds, floating cages or pens.
* Snail Stock Depletion. Overharvesting of snail populations used for prawn feed, and
transmission of diseases from imported snails from India.
* Disenfranchisement: Displacement of some fishermen from the areas designated as fish
sanctuaries (including access channels of fishpasses) and from areas used for pen culture.
* Navication: Interference with navigation routes in areas used for pen culture.
Proposed Mitigation Measures
Mitigation of the anticipated negative environmental impacts of the project is described below.
Beel and Baor HvdroloDv: The potential for beel and baor draining due to channel flow capacity
increasing after canal re-excavation will be reduced through the following measures:
* Bed elevations in the canal, the adjacent river and the beel/baor will be carefully
measured during the feasibility and design study.
* The new re-excavation bed level of the canal will be set at an appropriate level to
prevent beel/baor dewatering.
* A water regulation structure will be installed at the beel/baor outlet to the canal. The
regulator will be closed during the late monsoon drainage period in order to conserve
the water level in the beel or baor at the highest possible level at the start of the dry
season. It will be opened at the start of the premonsoon period to allow river water
and/or fish to enter the beel or baor.
This mitigation measure will require monitoring of water levels in the river and beel/baor, and
operation of the regulator according to guidelines which will be established by the project.
FCDI Project HvdroloZv: The possible threat to rice cultivation due to entry of water inside FCDI
projects through a fishpass will be reduced through the following measures:
* Study of river hydrology, FCDI project hydrology and potential fish traffic through
structure, and adjustment 6f pool number and pool, baffle and slot dimensions to
minimise discharge volume through fishpass.
* The fishpass will be equipped with gates at either end which will be closed whenever a
threat to agriculture materialises. The operator of the fishpass will remain responsive to
the concerns of the farming community, and respond positively if farmers feel their
crops are threatened by closing the fishpass gates, and reopening the gates once the
perceived threat has passed.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Antnex 9: Environmental Assessment
This mitigation measure will require monitoring of water levels in the river and FCDI project, and
operation of the fishpass gates according to guidelines which will be established by the project.
Water Course Eutrophication: The potential for eutrophication of natural water courses from pen
and cage culture and from prawn farms due to overfeeding and metabolic waste excretion will be
reduced through the following measures:
* Specify the use of pelleted feeds rather than loose feeds, as the former result in less
loss.
* Develop better methods for estimating feed application rates throughout the grow-out
period in order to eliminate overfeeding.
* Specify more frequent water exchange and flushing in prawn pond to discharge
metabolic wastes in more diluted form.
* Protect stocks of chotomach (especially bottom feeders) in the vicinity of cages and
allow them to consume uneaten food which drops out of cages.
* Specify controlled growth of submerged macrophytes inside and/or along the outside
margins of pens to absorb dissolved metabolic wastes such as nitrogen.
Better feed application is in the farmer's best interest as it lowers cost. Greater use of water may
entail higher costs, while use of chotomach and macrophytes to control feed loss and metabolites
entails foregoing a possible benefit in the form of sale or consumption of chotomach, and some
labour to remove macrophytes when their growth becomes excessive.
Groundwater Extraction: The danger of depletion of freshwater groundwater supply and intrusion
of saline water due to use of tubewells as water supply to prawn farms situated near coastal areas
will be reduced through the following measures:
* A comprehensive groundwater survey will be carried out in all areas where tubewells
are used (or may potentially be used) for prawn farm water sourcing to determine the
size of the aquifer and the recharge rate.
* Depending on the results of the survey, permits will be issued for allowable volume
quotas of groundwater that may be withdrawn by prawn farms and by other users. The
aggregate quota volume for an area will not exceed the groundwater recharge rate.
Submerged Macrophvtes: The danger of decrease in submerged macrophyte abundance in beels
and baors due to stocking of grass carp and common carp (leading to decline in chotomach
abundance and catch) will be controlled through the following measures:
* The stocking of grass carp (which are unable to breed in Bangladesh waters) will be
limited to specific areas where excessive macrophyte growth needs to be reduced to
normal levels. The stocking density will be adjusted to moderate level (ie 50 large
fingerlings per ha), and the adult fish will be caught and removed once the macrophyte
density has normalised.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* No commnon carp will be stocked by the project. This species has in any case been
successfully introduced and occurs in self-sustaining populations in many areas of
Bangladesh.
Competition for Plankton: No measure is proposed to mitigate the expected decrease in abundance
of indigenous plankton-eating fish in beels, baors and floodplains due to competition from stocked
non-indigenous planktivorous carp (silver, bighead). The objective of the stocking is specifically
to channel available plankton nutrients into these fast growing non-indigenous fish species, as they
are considered capable of producing a larger quantity of harvestable food fish than indigenous
planktivorous fish species. A reduction in stocking density would dampening the impact on
indigenous species, but this would partly defeat the project purpose. It is suggested that
consideration be given to stop the stocking of silver and bighead carp altogether, and that only
native species (rui, catla, mrigel) be stocked. Other native carp species such as kalibaush, bata,
boga, ghora, angrot, nandina, and others should also be considered for stocking.
Genetic Diversitv: The following mitigation measures will be used to reduce the loss of genetic
diversity in wild major carp stocks (rui, catla, mrigel) on floodplains due to massive stocking with
hatchery reared stock of limited genetic diversity:
* Hatcheries will be specifically licensed to produce fingerlings for floodplain stocking,
and fingerlings will only be purchased from these hatcheries.
* Only first generation broodstock sourced from  wild stocks will be used to produce
fingerlings used in stocking programs. Inbred and selectively bred lines used in pond
culture will not be used.
* Broodstock used for floodplain stocking will be renewed each year, and old broodstock
will be destroyed.
* Broodstock at a particular hatchery will be sourced from local wild stocks and not be
transferred from elsewhere in the country.
The objective of the mitigation measures is to ensure that the vigour and natural diversity of wild
genotypes is maintained by minimising any direct human interference with, or manipulation of,
genetic traits.
Disease Transmission: The potential for disease transmission and pandemics resulting from project
activities will be mitigated through the following actions:
* All fingerlings will be inspected for disease prior to stocking. If diseased fingerlings are
detected, the entire consignment will be destroyed. If no diseased fingerlings are
detected, the entire consignment will be treated with an antibiotic as a precautionary
measure prior to release into natural water bodies.
* All broodstock imported from outside Bangladesh will be quarantined and inspected for
disease. Diseased fish will be destroyed by incineration.
* All grow-out facilities will be regularly inspected for disease. If disease is detected, all
stocks at the facility will be destroyed by incineration, and the facility will be sanitised.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* It will become illegal to dispose of diseased animals from hatcheries, aquaculture ponds,
floating cages or pens by dumping into natural water bodies. The offence will be
punishable by fines and imprisonment.
* A code of procedures will be prepared to reduce the incidence and risk of escapage from
aquaculture facilities.
Snail Stock Depletion. The problem of overharvesting of snail populations used for prawn feed,
and transmission of diseases from illegally imported snails from India, will be mitigated through
the following measures:
* The harvesting of snail populations occurring in borrow pits, ponds, canals, beels,
baors, and other water bodies will be regulated through licensing of collectors, and
allocation of specific areas to individual collectors.
* The culture of snails in purpose built facilities (ie snail nurseries) will be promoted,
taking into account the particular reproductive and nutritional needs of snails.
* The illegal import of snails from India will be controlled.
Disenfranchisement: Instances of possible displacement of some fishermen from the areas
designated as fish sanctuaries (including access channels of fishpasses) and the areas used for pert
culture will be miEigated as follows:
T The nature of claims for fishino rights and tenure will be assessed at each fish sanctuary
and pen culture location, and ranked according to validity.
- Compensation will be paid to fishermen or investors with valid leaseholding claims.
- Other jalmohal will be allocated to fishermen with valid traditional fishing rights to fish
sanctuaries or pen culture locations.
* Where the project intervention is accompanied by community-based fishery
development, disenfranchised genuine fishermen will be included in large-group fishing
rights allocations.
Navi2ation: The expected interference with navigation routes in areas used for pen culture will be
mitigated through the following measures:
* Pen fences will be provided with flexible brush gates that allow shallow draft boats to
pass across the fence but prevent fish from escaping. The gate design will be
standardised, and constructed from robust materials.
* Wherever feasible, alternate navigation routes will be designated.
Monitoring Plans
Monitoring of the environmental impact of proposed project components, and assessment of the
effectiveness and performance of mitigation measures, will be carried out in a comprehensive
manner by the project. Details of the environmental monitoring plan (EMONP) are presented
below in Section I.J. Environmental Monitoring Plan.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Compensation Plans
Once-only compensation for lease payments already made will be paid to disenfranchised
fishermen displaced from fish sanctuaries and from pen culture locations, assuming their claim to
compensation is valid.
Environmental Enhancement
A wide range of environmental enhancement measures is proposed as a discrete subproject.
Details of the proposed subproject are presented below in Section II.B Fisheries Environments
Improvement Subproject.
Participation Programme for Interested Parties
Provision will be made for interested parties to participate in the EMP at local and national levels.
At local level, interest groups (ie Environmental Advisory Group, or EAG) will be formed which
will act in an advisory capacity to the project in executing the EMP. Local EAGs will be provided
with frequently updated status reports on enviroranental impacts and implementation of the EMP
in their area. The views and recommendation of the local EAG will be recorded and taken into
account during implementation and periodic review of the project and the EMP.
At national level, interested environmental groups will be formed into a national EAG. This body
would be provided with frequently updated status reports on environrnental impacts and
implementation of the EMP throughout the country (including local advisory group
recommendations). The views and recommendation of the national EAG will be recorded and
taken into account during implementation and periodic review of the project and the EMP.
Both local and national EAGs will be provided with modest resources and facilities to carry out
activities.
Accountability
The project personnel that are responsible for implementation of the EMP will be fully
accountable to the project director in the implementation of project activities and use of project
funds.
The implementation and effectiveness of the EMP will be reviewed annually by an Enviromnental
Steering Conmmittee (ESC), a body established jointly by the MOFL, DOE and other concerned
ministries. The ESC will be provided with all project reports pertaining to the EMP and
environmental issues, as well as recommendations of the local and national EAGs. The ESC will
review and analyse the reports, and forward reconmmendations for improvement of project
activities to the project leadership.
I.2 Contingency Disaster Management Plan and Residual Risks



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Disaster Assessment
The potential for disasters arising from project activities is in the following areas:
* Disease pandemics of wild fish stocks or cultured fish stocks: This could occur in spite
of best efforts to control disease outbreaks in hatcheries, in grow-out facilities and in
natural water bodies. It could result in massive mortality of stocks and large economic
losses.
* Civil engineering, structure failures: This includes breeching of beel and baor
embankments, washing out of regulators or fishpasses, and jamming of gates of
regulators or fishpasses in the open position during floods. Failures could occur during
the construction phase or during the operational phase. Such disasters could allowf
massive flooding to take place within an agricultural area, destroying crops and
livestock, and leading to possible loss of human life.
* Construction site accidents: The greatest danger from construction accidents is
associated with RCC construction methods used for regulators and fishpasses. Manuail
excavation and earth moving for canal re-excavation are only minimally hazardous.
* Cyclone or flood damage: This refers mainly to damage to cages and pens over a wide
area. This could result in the release of possibly diseased fish into the environment and
massive economic loss from equipment damage and stock escapage.
* Social discord: Clashes may arise during civil engineering works construction (due to
competition over construction materials), due to misunderstanding of project objectives
and potentials for impacts, due to fishpass operation (ie protests from rice farmers inside
an FCDI project), and during de-leasing and transfer of jamohal ownership (due to the
previous leaseholder resisting loss of control over jalmohals). The project activities may
directly or indirectly exacerbate existing conflicts within a community, or the project
may simply be used as an innocent and unsuspecting scapegoat by one or another groups
locked in conflict over unrelated issues (a conmmon feature of Bangladesh politics).
Disaster Prevention
Several steps can be taken to reduce the eventuality of occurrence of disasters:
* Civil engineering structure failures: Supervision of construction activities and adherence
to maintenance guidelines is essential for avoiding structure failures. Structures must be
check regularly for crack and signs of fatigue. In the event of sudden failure, sand bags
will be used to 'plug' breaches and gates, until such time as hydrological conditions
allow repair of the structure.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environzmental Assessment
* Construction site accidents: Work-site safety programmes will be the responsibility of
contractors.
* Social discord: Pre-construction consultation will take place with affected communities
to incorporate their concerns and views into project design. This will include the
alignment of embankments and location of fishpasses, regulators and fish sanctuaries.
Project staff will hold meetings in villages to inform local people about project
objectives, activities, and potentials for impacts, and seek their views and
recommendations for mitigating impacts. Fishpass operation committees will be formed
that include representatives from the farming community to ensure that gates are closed
whenever a possibly disastrous threat to crops due to water entry materialises.
Compensation will be paid to disenfranchised leaseholders during deleasing and transfer
of jamohal ownership, and police and military enforcement will be used in the event that
the previous leaseholder attempt to illegally retain control over jalmohals through force.
The project will retain social planners who will study beneficiary communities during
the project design and planning phase in order to identify existing conflicts within a
community which may be exacerbated by project activities, and appropriate measures
will be adopted (including compensation payments) to minimise potential involvement of
the project in such conflicts. Project leadership and implementing staff would be
required to remain fully aware of community sentiment concerning project activities,
and act in an astute manner to forestall the possibility of victimisation through naivety
or lack of information about the actions of conflicting interest groups. The project will
retain the right of access to the highest level of GOB to assist in the resolution of
intransient situations.
Disaster Control Plan
The impacts of disasters which cannot be predicted or prevented from occurring can be lessen
through the following actions:
* Disease pandemics of wild fish stocks or cultured fish stocks: The most serious
consequence of massive mortality due to disease is disruption of food supply to the
consumers. A contingency plan would include importation of cheap food fish (ie frozen
small pelagics from Peru and Chile) to meet immediate dietary needs of the population,
and rapid re-establishment of domestic production through re-crediting of producers.
* Cyclone or flood damage: This disaster would be less threatening to the security of the
national food supply than a disease pandemic, and be more localised in impact. A rapid
re-establishment of aquaculture infrastructure and facilities would be implemented
through special re-crediting of hatcheries and fish farmers.
Residual Risks and Plans for Possible Mitigation
In the opinion of the EIA Team, the major residual risk that is not adequately mitigated through
the EMP is the containment of a disease pandemic. It would be extremely difficult to prevent the
movement of infected aquaculture stock (ie hatchlings, fingerlings or broodstock) from one part of



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
the country to another. Furthermore, it would appear almost impossible to prevent the transport of
infected wild caught fish from landing points to market points throughout the country, and to
neighbouring countries. Disease may also be transmitted by aquatic birds and other vector
organisms, or simply carried in the downstream direction by water flow.
The magnitude of the potential disease risk might be somewhat increased in Bangladesh compared
to neighbouring countries due to the intensification in aquaculture production that the proposed
project aims to implement. This is due to the increased stress on fish that intensification usually
produces - leading to greater possibility of disease outbreak. One approach to lessening the risk in
aquaculture stock is to develop genetically enhanced strains of pond fish with greater tolerance of
stress and greater disease resistance. Environmental improvement might also lessen stress andi
increase disease resistance in wild fish stocks.
Disease risk will however likely still remain high despite such remedial efforts if new highly
virulent strains or pathogens are involved. The only realistic approach in such an eventuality is to
allow the disease to 'run its course'. The spread of the disease should be monitored closely, and
fish farmers should be dissuaded from further investment until there are clear indications that the
epidemic is on the decline.
I.3 Implementation of Environmental Management Plan
Institutional Arrangements
The EMP will be implemented as an integral part of the project development. Implementation will
be carried out by an EMP Implementation Group (EIG). This group will be a formal body within
the project structure, and be composed of seconded full-time and part-timne staff from the
following agencies and organisations: DOF, DOE, BWDB, LGED, BIWTA. Staff from selected
environrnental NGOs will also be seconded to the EIG.
The responsibilities for various institutions and organisations for carrying out the various
components the EMP are indicated in the following table:

Institutional Strengthening
Staff Development Needs of DOF
Implementation of the EMP will require that the DOF take on new staff with the following areas
of expertise:
* Hydrology (surface water and groundwater)
* Water chemistry
* Civil engineering (design of water management structures and fishpasses)
* Limnology (macrophytes and plankton)
* Fish genetics
Fish disease
*  Malacology (gastropods)



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Staff Development Needs of Other Agencies
No special staff development needs will be required for other agencies in order to carry out the
EMP.
Procurement of Equipment and Supplies
The EIG would require access to transport in order to carry out its work.
Equipment needed for EMP implementation is as follows:
* lHydrological measurement instruments
* Water chemistry analysis field kits
* Fish disease laboratories
• Navigation brush gates
Organisational Changes
No organisational changes are required for implementation of the EMP.
Training Plan
Implementation of the EMP would require training to be carried in the following disciplines:
* Water regulator operation
* Fishpass operation
* Aquaculture feed control
• Hatchery operation for floodplain stocking
* Fish and shrimp disease inspection and quarantine
* Snail culture methods
The purpose of the training plan is to ensure that a sufficient cadre of well trained and
knowledgable specialists is available to carry out the various component activities of the EMP.
Details of each training component are as follows:
* Water regulator operators: Standard training offered to BWDB and LGED  water
regulator operators will be required. Some 25 operators will need to be trained.
Training would take place at BWDB training facilities, as well as on-the-job training.
* Fishpass Operator: Training in operation of fishpass gates and sampling cages will be
required. Up to 10 fishpass operators would be trained (depending on the number of
structures built). Training would be carried out at the existing vertical slot fishpass at
Kashimpur (Manu River FCDI Project near Moulvi Bazar).



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Enzv ironmental Assessment
* Aquaculture feed control: Training in proper feed preparation and application methods
will be required. Some 200 extension workers will be trained. Training would be
carried out at the FRI station in Mymensingh and/or at the Vocation School for
Aquaculture proposed under this project.
* Hatchery operation for floodplain stocking: Training in hatchery methods appropriate
for production of fingerlings for floodplain stocking will be required. About 200
hatchery staff will be trained. Training would be carried out at a selected GOB hatchery
and at several privately owned hatcheries.
* Fish and shrimp disease inspection and quarantine: Training in hatchery hygiene and
fingerling inspection for disease will be required. Approximately 50 hatchery and DOF
staff will be trained Training will take place at the FRI station in Mymensingh.
* Snail culture methods: Training in methods for snail culture are required. Forty
potential snail culturists will be trained. No training facility currently exists for snail
culture in Bangladesh. It is proposed that one DOF and one NGO staff be trained in
snail culture methods at an overseas facility (to be identified), and that these individuals
then lead training courses in Bangladesh at the FRI Paikgaccha station.

Technical Assistance Needs



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PEPARATION Annlex 9: Environmental Assessment
The activities of the EMP will be carried out by the EIG in collaboration with competent GOB
institutions. No special needs for externally-sourced technical assistance is previewed. The EMP
budget would contain a contingency fund of US50,000 to cover the eventuality of a need
developing for external assistance. This is most likely to develop in the area of fish disease
control.
Implementation Schedule
The EMP would be implemented over the entire five year lifespan of the proposed project. Annual
EMP activities as presented in the following chart:

TOTAL COST OF EMP = $2,368,500
1.5 Linkage wvith the Project Assessment Process
The EMP is linked to the project assessment process primarily through the environmental
monitoring plan (described below in Section I.J Environmental Monitoring Plan). The degree to
which potential negative impacts are mitigated by the EMP will be assessed by comparison of
with-project impacts to pre-project baseline conditions:
* If the comparison indicates little or no change, the mitigation measures will be assessed
as successful.
* If the comparison indicates a large (negative) change, the mitigation measures will be
assessed as not successful.
In the event of the second result, the inefficient component(s) of the EMP will be identified and
redesigned to improve its performance.
During the course of project implementation, EMP components which are judged to be redundant
will be eliminated.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
J. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING PLAN
J.1 Purpose and Implementation of Environmental Monitoring Plan
The Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMONP) will provide information on the progress and
results of the mitigation measures implemented under the EMP. It would also allow early
detection -of impact conditions not predicted during the EIA that might require additional
mitigation measures.
J.2 Environmental Monitoring Activities
Monitoring activities will be divided into two phases: 1) the baseline pre-project period, and 2) the
operational with-project period. In most cases, the same parameters (using the same
methodologies) will be monitored during both periods. This will ensure consistency, and allow
comparison to be made and detection of any changes due to project impacts. Ideally, no change
(or a beneficial change) should be detected if the impact mitigation measures of the EMP are
successfiul in their intended effect. A negative change indicates a need for reassessing and
modifying the EMP.
Monitoring will address the 11 potential impacts of the proposed project. The following
environmental parameters will be monitored:
* Beel and Baor Hvdrologv: Canal discharge; beel, canal and river water levels; beel/baor
surface area; water extraction by people for various purposes; fish abundance and
biodiversity; fish production.
* FCDI Project Hvdrolo!v: Riverside and countryside water levels; rainfall inside FCDI
project; water discharge through fishpass; water body surface areas and water levels inside
FCDI project; rice cropping patterns and areas; crop damage due to flooding.
* Water Course Eutrophication: Water quality (02. BOD5, NH3, suspended solids) in grow-
out area and in surrounding/receiving waters; stocking density; feed application rates;
stock growth rate; stock mortality.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
* Groundwater Extraction: Groundwater extraction volumes; groundwater recharge rate;
pond water management practices and growth in water demand; groundwater quality
(salinity, pH, arsenic).
* Submerged Macrophvtes: Submerged macrophyte density and species composition;
macrobenthos abundance and biodiversity; water quality in macrophyte stands (turbidity,
pH, 02); chotomach abundance and biodiversity; carp stocking rate; carp growth rate.
* Competition for Plankton: Plankton abundance and biodiversity; water quality (turbidity,
p, 02); abundance and biodiversity of indigenous planktivorous fish; stocking rate of
silver and bighead carp; plankton consumption and growth rate of silver and bighead carp.
* Genetic Diversity: Stock abundance and genetic fingerprinting of wild native carp
populations (protein electrophoresis); genetic fingerprinting of hatchery stock.
* Disease Transmission: Disease type and incidence in hatcheries, grow-out facilities and
wild populations; disease incidence in wild stocks in the vicinity of escapage events;
disease incidence in imported broodstock.
v Snail Stock Depletion. Wild snail population abundance, food consumption and growth
rate; water quality of natural snail habitat (water temperature, 0,, pH, Ca); macrophyte
and periphyton abundance of natural snail habitat; abundance of competitor snail species
and other macrobenthos in natural snail habitat; harvesting rate of snails; snail fecundity
and recruitment; disease incidence in snails.
* Disenfranchisement: Abundance and biodiversity of fish (pre-project); catch rates, species
composition and income of fisheries in fish sanctuaries and pen areas (pre-project period);
poaching in fish sanctuaries (with-project period).
* Navication: Boat traffic patterns.
J.3 Institutional Strengthening for Environmental Monitoring
Staff Needs of DOF
The EMONP of the proposed project will require a significant technical effort on the part of DOF.
It is proposed that a permanent monitoring unit be established within the DOF or this purpose (ie
Project Monitoring Unit, PMU). The PMU would also be responsible for monitoring tasks in
other fisheries development projects as well as collaborate with general national monitoring



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
programmes such as BFRSS and the water quantity and quality programme proposed below
(Section II.E Water Quality and Quantity Monitoring Program Subproject).
To meet the needs of the EMONP it is proposed that the PMU consist of the following specialists:
* Chief Monitoring Officer
* Hydrologist
* Water chemist
* Limnologist
* Fish geneticist
* Fish disease specialist (microbiologist)
• Malacologist
* Fish stock assessment specialist
- Socioeconomist (with experience in navigation)
Staff Needs of Other Agencies
No particular staffing needs are required in other agencies as most of the monitoring activities will
be carried out by the DOF. It is proposed that the specialists in the PMU liaise closely with
counterpart specialists in relevant agencies (BWDB, DOE, BIWTA).
Equipment Needs
The following equipment will be needed to carry out the EMONP:
* Hydrological measurement instruments
* Water analysis kits
* Limnological sampling gear and laboratory supplies
* Protein electrophoresis equipment and laboratory supplies
* Bacteriological laboratory equipment
* Fish sampling gear and measuring equipment
* Small work boats and outboard motors
J.4 Cost of Environmental Monitoring Plan
The breakdown of costs for the EMONP over five years is as follows:

ENVIRONMENTAL SUBPROJECTS



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessmert
A. FISH BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION SUBPROJECT
A.1 Background and Subproject Objective
Previous studies and projects (for example, BCAS/MPO study at Chandpur FCDI, FAP-6, FAP-
16, FAP-17) have indicated that Bangladesh is losing valuable fish biodiversity at local, regional
and national level. The causes of this biodiversity loss are several, including FCDI impacts, water
pollution, excessive selective fishing mortality and sedimentation arising from watershed
deforestation. In some cases the immediate cause of biodiversity loss is not clear (for example, the
disappearance in the northeast region of the once widespread carp nandina).
The problem of fish biodiversity loss has not yet been addressed in a focused and comprehensive
manner by the GOB.
The objective of the proposed subproject is to reverse the trend of fish biodiversity loss.
A.2 Rationale
Recruitment failure is endangering some fish stock in Bangladesh, The causes leading to
recruitment failure and biodiversity loss are several - partly due to environmental degradation and
partly due to overexploitation of broodstock. The proposed project will address these causes
through an environmental improvement subproject, and by installing fish sanctuaries, canal re-
excavation and fishpasses.
The above measures may however not be sufficient to re-establish threatened fish species whose
population density has fallen below the critical level necessary to maintain a self-sustaining
population. Such species include the baromnach species nandina, angrot, mohasol, sarputi, silond
and pangas. It is necessary therefore to carry out a program of stocking of these threatened
species in order to re-establish them in rivers and floodplains.
Moreover, new threats to fish biodiversity are likely to arise in the future. Research into the
effects of various types of development projects on fish biodiversity, as well as regular monitoring
of the status of the fish biodiversity resources of Bangladesh are needed in order to early-detect
potential losses of biodiversity and to implement timely measures to mitigate threats.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessmentz
Implementing an effective research, monitoring, artificial breeding and stocking program for fish
biodiversity would result in the reversal of the current trend of loss of fish biodiversity and allow
continued maintenance of a high level of biodiversity.
A.3 Project Components
The subproject would have the following components:
1. National Fish Biodiversity Survey Programme Component. This component would train
two ichthyologists to MSc level. It would establish a national fish biodiversity
repository collection and national aquarium. It would also establish a long term research
programmne to study the life history of Bangladesh fish species. It would implement a
continuing national fish biodiversity monitoring system.
2. Impact of Embankments on Fish Biodiversitv Component. This component would study
and assess the impacts of FCDI prcijects and road embankments on floodplain fish
biodiversity. It would use the results of the study to draw up a set of guidelines for
relevant govermment agencies (BWDB, LGED, DORH) on best practices and mitigation
measures (fishpasses, culverts) to reduce the impact of embankments and associated
water management and road transport infrastructure on fish biodiversity.
3. Impact of Stockinc and Pond Escapage on Fish Biodiversity Component. This
component would carry out a study and assessment of impacts of stocking and pond
escapage of non-indigenous and indigenous carp and other species on fish biodiversity
in floodplains, haors, beels, baors and other water bodies. The results of the study
would be used to modify stocking programs, and regulate the use of pond culture
species in order to eliminate adverse impacts.
4. Impact of Shrimp and Prawn Seed Collection on Fish Biodiversity Component. This
component would conduct field studies of the impacts of collection of wild shrimp and
prawns seed on fish and crustacean stocks in brackishwater, marine and freshwater
environments. It would also monitor the quantity of seed captured, and the areas of
capture. The results of the studies and monitoring would be used to assess the overall
impact and sustainability of this practice. Measures for mitigation of negative impacts
would be implemented as appropriate.
5. Stocking of Endanoered Fish Species Component. This component would carry out
induced breeding of threatened indigenous species (nandina, angrot, mohasol, sarputi,
silond and pangas), involving both FRI and private hatcheries. The fingerlings would be
stocked in selected protected sanctuary areas in order to re-establish populations in the
wild. Active protection measures as well as a public awareness campaign would be
implemented to allow stocked populations sufficient opportunity to build up to self-
sustaining levels.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
B. FISHERIES ENVIRONMENTS IMPROVEMENT SUBPROJECT.
B.1 Background and Subproject Objective
Over the last four decades both the terrestrial and the aquatic environments of Bangladesh have
suffered substantial disruption and degradation. The aquatic environment has been particularly
hard hit because it is vulnerable to direct negativities such as industrial effluent discharge, as well
as terrestrial environment-originating indirect externalities such as sedimentation resulting from
deforestation and agrochemical runoff resulting from agricultural development. The latter in
particular has generated the most extensive direct and indirect impacts due to landclearing for rice
cultivation and widespread construction of flood control, drainage, and irrigation schemes.
A number of feasibility studies have been undertaken on aquatic habitat improvement (particularly
under FAP) and several projects are being implemented. However there is no project currently
being implemented which focuses on the particular requirements of fisheries in aquatic
environments.
The objective of the proposed subproject is to implement environmental improvement measures
which are designed primarily to benefit and enhance the fisheries resources carrying capacity of
key aquatic habitat types.
B.2 Rationale
Part of the decline in openwater capture fisheries is due to widespread degradation of aquatic
habitat quality. The causes of this degradation are due to negative externalities of other
development sectors (especially agriculture and industry which together result in decreased water
quantity and water pollution).
Various measures (including strategic) are being implemented to ameliorate and dampen the
magnitude of water-impacting externalities of the agriculture and industrial sectors. These may in
future reduce the level of impact, but in themselves will not restore habitats in affected locations.
A more direct approach to aquatic habitat rehabilitation is required in order to more rapidly
reverse the existing trends and re-establish the fundamentals of habitat quality and health upon
which openwater fish productivity is based.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Implementing a multi-dimensioned and innovative aquatic habitat restoration program would in
both the short and long term result in higher levels of openwater fish production and reduced risk
of stock failure due to environmental degradation. Integration of this subproject into on-going
community-based fisheries resource management initiatives (such as the Oxbow Lakes Project II
and the Community-based Fisheries Management Programme of the DOF) is necessary to realise
the full benefits of the subproject and ensure long term sustainability.
B.3 Project Components
The subproject would have the following components:
1. Wetland and Mangrove Tree Plantation Component. This component would plant a
minimum of 1 million seedlings of the flood tolerant tree species hizal (Barrin2tonia
acutangula Linn) and mangroves. -The principal planting locations would be the
shorelines of beels, baors and canals, and the shoreline terraces along coastal polders.
Seedlings would be planted in parallel rows of 5 or 6 trees, to form a continuous band
along the perimeters of water bodies and polders.
2. Control of Agrochemicals Impacts Component. This component would carry out
comprehensive studies of the patterns of use of agrochemicals (fertilisers and
pesticides), their modes of flushing into freshwater, brackishwater and marine aquatic
habitats, their rate of uptake by sediments and aquatic organisms, and the level of
residues in fish tissue. The degree of risk to fish stocks and to human health will be
assessed. The use of pesticides to prevent insect infestation of dry fish will also be
studied and the health hazard to humans assessed. Guidelines will be prepared for the
Ministry of Agriculture and for farmers on the hazards of agrochemicals to fish
resources and acceptable practices for utilising agrochemicals so as to protect fishery
resources. A study will be made of the types of agrochemical produced in Bangladesh,
and the types of agrochemical being imported (legally and illegally). Recommnendations
will be prepared to assist the GOB in eliminating the manufacture, import and use of
agrochemical deemed to be hazardous to fishery resources and general enviromnental
quality, and specifically to human health.
3. Beel and Baor Embankment Component. This component will construct low
embankments equipped with water retention regulators around 30 beels and baors in
order to increase their dry-season water storage capacity. The hizal tree plantation
component will be integrated with this component (ie seedlings will be planted on the
embankments wherever possible). Hydrological studies will be undertaken, along with
fisheries and non-fisheries water use patterns for individual water bodies. Water user
committees will be established to regulate the quantities of water that will be used for
fisheries and non-fisheries purposes during the dry season and mediate disputes.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
4. Artificial River Duars Pilot Schemes Component. This component will construct several
types of structures (flow deflectors, bottom sills) which are designed to create
downstream duars (= scour holes) in river channels at five pilot locations. Duars are
known to be critical overwintering habitat for many commercially important species,
and key spawning habitats for major carp (rui, catla, mrigel). The construction of
artificial duars for fishery enhancement purposes has not been previously attempted in
Bangladesh. The newly created artificial duars will be placed under protected sanctuary
management with the participation of local fisheries associations, and will be monitored
for several years to assess their utility for stock enhancement and protection.
5. Low Cost Industrial Effluent Treatment Component. This component will prepare the
design of low cost industrial effluent treatment systems for tanning, textile, jute,
chemicals & pesticides, pulp and paper, seafood processing and fertiliser industries.
Treatment systems will be designed for 10 plants. The component will study the plant
process system and effluent streams, assist plant managers to reduce the volume of
effluent generated, design appropriate treatment systems, and facilitate construction and
operation of the treatment systems.
6. Water Hvacinth Control Component. This component will study the infestation and
growth patterns of water hyacinth. A national survey of all major beels, baors, rivers,
canals and other water bodies will be undertaken to assess the degree of infestation and
allow planning of clearing and control activities. Studies of infestation of small systems
(khals, borrow pits, tanks, ponds) will also be carried out. It will review available
control and utilisation strategies and methods. It will develop an appropriate strategy
and approach and identify optimal methods for controlling the negative impacts of water
hyacinth on aquatic habitat quality and fish production. It will disseminate the selected
approach and methods through demonstration and public awareness programs. Clearing
and control activities are expected to be carried out in at least 10,000 ha of water
bodies.
B.4 Expected Outputs
The following general outputs are expected from the subproject:
* One million hizal and mangrove trees planted around water bodies and polders
* Improved application of agrochemicals by farmers
* Reduction in use of hazardous pesticides by fish processors/traders
* Curtailment of manufacture and import of hazardous pesticides
* Reduction in damage to fish stocks and human health from hazardous pesticides
* Low embankments and water retention regulators around 30 beels and baors
* Water user committees in 30 beels and baors

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
C. COMMUNITY-OWNED FISHERIES PILOT PROJECT.
C.1 Background and Pilot Project Objective
Several projects during the last decade have addressed the problem of management of the
openwater fisheries of Bangladesh through user-management approach. These include the New
Fisheries JManagement Policy, the ICLARM/Ford Foundation supported Conmmunity-based
Maniagement Project and the DANIDA/IFAD financed Oxbow Lakes Project. The projects have
been only partly successful in meeting their objectives. Sustainability of initiatives after project
termination has been problematic.
The problem of effective openwater fisheries resource management has evidently not been solved
bv previous projects. A new approach needs to be formulated and tested.
The objective of the proposed pilot project is to carry out pilot trials of user-ownership type of
fisheries management systems to assess the feasibility of widespread implementation in
Bangladesh.
C .2 Rationale
Overexploitation is a serious threat to sustainability of production in openwater fisheries. The
most widely practiced fisheries management systems implemented by GOB to date (ie jalmohal
leasing) has contributed directly to overexploitation, as well as economic marginalisation of
genuine fishermen. Various trials of community-based type systems have lacked durability due to
continuation of government-rent seeking through taxation (official and unofficial) and extortion by
previously vested interests.
The fundamental feature common to both jalmohal leasing and community-based systems (as
previously implemented in Bangladesh) is ownership of the water body and fishery resources by
the state. This creates an irresolvable conflict of interest between the owner of the resource (ie the
state in the form of the GOB) and the user of the resource (ie the genuine fishermen) which
invariably and probably inevitably defeats attempts to achieve sustainable production and
economic equity for fishermen. Lack of resource ownership on the part of the user results in
short-term planning horizons and promotes resource mining practices such as annual katha
harvesting, current jal use and beel dewatering.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
In sharp contrast to the evident stock depletion and unsustainability of openwater fisheries, high
levels of production sustainability and resource management are evident in the agriculture sector
and in pond aquaculture, and this derives directly from the resource ownership regimes which
exist in these production sectors (ie rice farmers own their fields and paddy crops; fish farmers
own their own ponds and fish crops). The absence of kinds of conflict which exist when the
resource owner and the resource user are two different entities is likely a precondition for
sustainable production and income equity in renewable natural resource sectors.
Outright ownership of water bodies and fish stocks by fishermen would remove (or at least
minimise) the risk of loss of access to resources and livelihood due to shifts in government policy
or manipulation by vested interests. It would also allow long term planning for stock conservation
and regulation of harvesting rates to sustainable levels. Moreover, investment in environmental
enhancement and stock improvement will also become feasible under conditions of security of
long term ownership.
Implementing pilot projects in various types of water bodies to test the utility of ownership-based
fisheries management systems would allow careful assessment and evaluation to be made of the
benefits and costs of such systems. The feasibility for widespread implementation of such systems
could also be assessed with a degree of confidence.
C.3 Project Components
Thc subproject would have the following components:
1. Fisheries Association Establishment Component. This component would assist all
genuine professional and subsistence fishermen and fisherwomen (as well as women fish
processors) of the conmmunities relevant and/or riparian to a particular waterbody to
form a single unified fisheries association. It would assist the fisheries association to
register as legal production entities. It would provide basic training in organisational
skills (ie bookkeeping, accounts, planning) for members.
2. Acquisition of Water Body and Fishery Resource Ownership Component. This
component would assist the fisheries associations to acquire from the Ministry of Land
(MOL) legal tenure of their relevant water body and all fishery resources contained
within the water body. It would where necessary cancel existing leases (with
compensation to leaseholders). It would assist to provide resource loans to the fisheries
associations to purchase the water bodies and fishery resources from the GOB. It would
ensure the full legality and protection by law of the perpetual continuing ownership of
the water bodies by the fisheries associations.
3. Financial Management and Loan Repayment Component. This component would assist
the fisheries association to plan their financial accounts in a manner consistent with



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARA TION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
meeting costs, servicing the resource loan repayments, and paying income shares to
members for fishing activities.
4. Fisherv Management Plan Component. This component would assist the fisheries
associations to draw up short term and long term stock management, harvesting and
conservation plans. It would train the fisheries associations to collect and interpret fish
catch and biological data in order to assess the state of the stocks. It would provide
assistance in using the data to formulate annual harvesting plans. It would also assist in
the formulation of conservation plans and measures, such as closed seasons, fish
sanctuaries, minimum size limits, broodstock protection, stocking and introduction of
rare and/or desirable species, to ensure the long term vitality and high abundance of the
fishery resources.
5. Environmental Management Plan Component. This component would assist the fisheries
association to plan and implement investments in environmental enhancement and
improvement. This would include measures for retaining water during the dry season
and prevent dewatering, planting of wetland trees (ie hizal in freshwater habitats,
mangroves in brackishwater habitats), improvement of water quality through protection
against agrochemicals and other pollutants, and conservation of other aquatic lifeforms
(plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals) which are crucial to
maintaining high biodiversity and ecologically balanced ecosystems.
C.4 Expected Outputs
The following general outputs are expected from the subproject:
* Thirty .waterbody-based functional fisheries associations
* Legal deeds providing for full ownership of 30 waterbodies and fishery resources by
fisheries associations
* Resource loans granted to fisheries associations to purchase waterbodies and fishery
resources
* Thirty fisheries association financial management plans
* Annual fisheries management plans (a total of 120 for 30 association over 4 years).
* Thirty long term fishery management plans
* Thirty long term environmental management plans.

collapse very easily primarily due to enviromnental stress.
Fish and shrimp health management is an important component of aquaculture as it influences the
production in many ways. Health problems may increase or decrease the production by reducing
or causing morbidity and mortality and may even cause total loss by outbreak of epizootics.
The problem of fish and shrimp diseases has yet not been addressed in a systematic and
comprehensive manner by the GOB.
The objective of the proposed sub-project is designed to improve GOB capability to prevent and
control fish disease and to reverse the trend of production decline.
D.2 Rationale
A number of measures have so far been taken by the fish and shrimp farmers to control diseases
but there has been little success.
Moreover, new outbreaks of disease (EUS, white spot) in fish and shrimp are continuing. Early
detection is required to take preventive measure and to mitigate the threat.
The outbreak of diseases particularly in fish has also been detected within FCDI projects,
indicating the impact of development project on disease outbreak. Research into the effects of
development projects on fish diseases, as well as regular monitoring of disease status in various
fisheries habitat are needed in order to detect and diagnose diseases, and implement timely
measures to mitigate threats.
Implementation of effective research, monitoring of environmental parameters, creation of
awareness and extension service through training and media by GOB personnel to farmers would
result in the control of fish and shrimp mortality and hence increase the productivity.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Aninex 9: Environmental Assessment
D.3 Project Components
The subproject would have the following components:
1. Survey of Fish and Shrimp Diseases and Control Measures. This component would
undertake comprehensive and systematic study of diseases, etiology, epizootiology anid
control in different fisheries habitats, and prepare a status report on fish and shrimp
diseases and control.
2. Extension Training on Disease Prevention and Management. The objective of the
training would be to improve the technical capabilities of the GOB personnel and
farmers at field level. The main emphasis of the training would be on the following: a)
develop working knowledge and skills of the participants, GOB personnel and farmers
for diagnosis and management of disease; b) enhance understanding of prevention
methods under different environmental condition and needs of the beneficiaries; c:)
greater responsibility by the GOB agencies; and d) updating the knowledge base.
3. Environmentai Hvgiene and Wastewater Recycling. This component would recycle
wastewater fouled due to feed residue and excreta of the reared species in hatcheries and
grow-out facilities to avoid environmental hazards. Due to lack of recycling systems
receiving waters are being polluted due to discharge of waste water.
4. Ouarantine Measures to Contain Disease Outbreaks. This component would set up
quarantine posts with laboratories in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong, Barisal, Sylhet and
Rajshahi to monitor the hygienic condition of fish and crustaceans and to analyse feed,
soil and water.
D.4 Expected Outputs
The following general outputs are expected from the subproject:
* National fish and shrimp dieses data base
* Data analysis and report production
* Trained GOB staff and farmers
* Improved management of diseases
* Reduced loss of production due to disease

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
E. WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY MONITORING PROGRAM
SUBPROJECT
E.1 Background and Subproject Objective
In recent years, the 26 component projects of the Flood Action Plan have collated, collected and
analysed a massive water quantity database covering the whole of Bangladesh. Many of the FAP
projects also studied water quality parameters.
Routine monitoring of hydrology is carried out by the BWDB at 317 water level stations. The raw
data is analysed by SWMC and WARPO, and used to generate flood status and flood prediction
reports. The DOE maintains 53 water quality sampling stations in 30 rivers, where 15 parameters
are monitored. Oceanographic data is collected routinely by the DOF at several stations.
Despite the availability of routinely collected comprehensive water quantity and quality data over
most of the country, little use of this data is made to monitor the status of fisheries environments
of Bangladesh, or to plan fisheries management or development activities.
The objective of the proposed subproject is to acquire selected water quantity and quality data
from the above institutional sources on a routine basis, and reformat and analyse the data in order
to provide regular status reports of fisheries environments in Bangladesh.
E.2 Rationale
Over the last few decades fisheries environments in Bangladesh have been undergoing major
changes in both water quantity and water quality. The general trend is towards deterioration in
hydrological flows and lowering of water quality. Causes of these negative changes are
deforestation, FCDI and agricultural development, industrialisation and increase in sewage
discharg,e. Various studies have linked declining openwater fish production to one or more of
these factors (apart from overfishing impacts).
Given the substantial socio-economic importance of fish production from inland and marine
environments, it is important that continuous monitoring of ambient aquatic environmental quality
be carried out. This would have two purposes:



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
1. To identify, predict and control threats to fish stocks arising from environmental
deterioration.
2. To enable timely and accurate planning of contingency measures for food security and
other fishery-related programs which may arise due to short-term or long-term
environmental deterioration or fluctuations.
Although relevant water quantity and quality data is being routinely collected in Bangladesh, the
information is not general accessed by fisheries agencies, and therefore not being effectively used
for fisheries management and development. Implementing a water quantity and quality monitoring
program that would acquire data and prepare regular environmental status reports for distribution
within the fisheries sector would provide a valuable analytic and planning data tool to fisheries
managers and developers.
E.3 Project Components
The subproject would have the following components:
1. Acquisition of Hvdrologv Data Component. This component would purchase selected
data sets and model products in computerised form from BWDB, SWMC and WARPO
on a regular basis. The data would be stored in project computers.
2. Acquisition of Water Oualitv Data Component. This component would purchase
selected data sets in computerised form from DOE on a regular basis. The data would
be stored in project computers.
3. Project Water Monitoring Data Collection Component. This component would sample
and collect water quantity and quality data from project activity locations from two
perspectives: 1) ambient water quality for production, and 2) process water discharge
impacts.
4. Analysis of Water Data Component. This component would carry out regular analysis
of the water quantity and water quality databases from the perspective of fisheries
management and development. The component would train a hydrologist to carry out
the analysis.
5. Fisheries Environments Data Service Component. This component would produce a
regular quarterly report on the status of water quantity and quality in Bangladesh from a
fisheries perspective. The report will be widely available through public sale at
appropriate cost to all potential users in Bangladesh (private sector, NGOs, GOB
agencies, donor agencies, general public). The component would also produce
specialised reports to meet particular needs of individual clients.
Locations of Water Sampling Stations



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
It is proposed that only key BWDB water level monitoring stations be used for the proposed
subproject. This would include the following rivers (mainly channels which carry active
discharge, rather than distributaries):
Jamuna
Padma
Meghna
Upper Meghna
Kushiyara
Surma
Manu
Khowai
Kangsha
Old Brahmaputra
Tista
Jamuneswari
Atrai
Feni
Karnaphuli
Shank-ha
Matamuhuri
Water level in key beels/haors, baors and reservoirs will be monitored. These would include:
Tangua Haor
Hakaluki Haor
Kawadighi Haor
Hail Haor
Dakatia Beel
Baluhar Baor
Nasti Baor
Shachta Baor
Kaptai Reservoir
Foy's Lake
Key DOE water quality monitoring stations would be used for the proposed subproject. These will
be selected from the 53 stations in 30 rivers currently being monitored. Additional data for coastal
and estuarine water quality will accessed from DOF sources.
Final selection of water quantity and quality monitoring stations will be done during subproject
implementation.
Frequency of Water Sampling and Analysis



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
BWDB water staff gauge readings are taken several times per day. This exceeds the requirement
for the proposed subproject. Only a subsample of the available BWDB database would be brought
into the subproject database.
DOE water quality sampling frequency varies by station: monthly, bimonthly and trimonthly. For
purpose of the subproject, monthly sampling would be preferable. The DOE is willing to adjust its
sampling schedule to suit client needs.
E.4 Expected Outputs
The following general outputs are expected from the subproject:
* National water quantity (hydrology) database
* National water quality database
* Water quantity and quality data from project sites
* One trained DOF staff hydrologist
* Data analysis and report production office

This act confers comprehensive powers to the GOB to manage, conservation and regulate
exploitation of forests.
The Private Forests Ordinance, 1959
(Ordinance No. XXXIV of 1959
This act provides for conservation of private forests and for afforestation of waste lands.
Banoladesh Wild Life (Preservation) Order. 1973
(P.O. No.93 of 1973)
This order refers to wildlife but specifically excludes fish. It includes lists of:
e Crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals of Bangladesh which are open to
shooting and may be hunted on an ordinary game hunting permit (First Schedule, Part
1), including the crab Brachyura, three species of frog, and four species of turtle.
- Wild animals, trophies or meat for the possession, transfer or import of which a
certificate of lawful possession is required (Second Schedule), including skins of otter
and crocodile..
* Protected animals ie animals which shall not be hunted, killed or captured (Third
Schedule), including common dolphin, little Indian porpoise, gangetic dolphin, garial,
estuarine crocodile and marsh crocodile. A large number of aquatic birds are listed
including raptors.
A.2 Impact on Sustainability of Fisheries
The fisheries and environmental laws of Bangladesh in most respects reflect conventional
approaches to protecting the fisheries resources and the surrounding environment. This approach
desicnates a central authority (ie GOB) as the agent responsible and capable of managing fisheries
and ensuring their sustainability. Thus, the various acts and ordinances confer policing and
enforcement functions on the GOB, particularly how, where and when fish may be caught.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Envirortmental Assessment
The widespread overexploitation of openwater fisheries though improper fishing practices, and
decline in stock abundance due to environmental degradation in Bangladesh are clear symptom of
management failure. At least a part of this failure derives from the nature and intent of fisheries
and environmnental legislation.
Beels are not recognised as water bodies, but treated as areas of land which (inconveniently)
happen to have water on them. Thus they have no legal status and are not protected by law. As a
result beels can be drained without restriction. Baors are similarly disadvantaged.
A.3 Provision of Access to Fisheries Sectors
The fisheries laws provide access to fisheries resources for fishermen and for private fisheries
investors. The latter are particularly favoured in inland fisheries under the jalmohal leasing
system. The laws clearly identify the requirements for access to public or khas fisheries (payment
of lease or license fee) and private fisheries (permission of owner). Moreover it gives subsistence
fishermen and fisherwomen the right to angle in any navigable river.
The jalmohal leasing system however clearly discriminates against genuine fishermen, as the
majority are unable to raise sufficient capital to pay the high lease fees specified by GOB.
Jalmohal leases are routinely won be capital investors.
Because of the increasingly intense pressure on fisheries and other natural resources from all
sections of the rapidly expanding population of Bangladesh, competition and conflict between
different income groups and interest groups is escalating. Although fisheries and enviromnental
laws are theoretically equity neutral, in practice they act to support the activities and intentions of
the highest income groups (fisheries capital investors who are colloquially known as jalmohal
leaseholders). The laws are thus regressive in an economic sense.
The failure of fisheries and environmental laws to protect low income groups has led to the
adoption of an unfortunate political position among many NGOs that may be summarised as
follows:
* Poor people are fully justified to take whatever steps necessary to derive a living from
fish and other natural resources, even if it results in resource overexploitation and
extinction, and even if it is in contravention of existing laws.
* Fisheries is to be regarded as a welfare sector that anyone who becomes poor enough
has an automatic right to enter and eke out a living. Security of tenure and
professionalism in the fisheries sector is in conflict with a philosophy of open access and
therefore must be resisted. [Similar thinking is however not applied to rice farming, as
it would no doubt by violently resisted by farmers.]



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Aninex 9: Environmental Assessmenlt
* GOB should continue to retain ownership and continue to extract tax from fisheries
resources, as it is naively hoped that a future GOB would be more amenable to
implementing the activities that NGOs would like. If fisheries resources are sold to
fishermen (ie the private sector), NGOs would lose the possibility of exerting power
over these resources. [State ownership is consistent with socialist philosophies that have
been discredited the world over but curiously continue to survive among Bangladesh
NGOs.]
* Most development projects (such as FCDI embankments, shrimp farms, floodplain
stocking, fishpasses, fish processing for export) are not in the interests of low income
groups and therefore are to be resisted at all costs.
The above approach will inevitably result in more resource depletion, more poverty and blockage
of potentially effective mitigation interventions and development progress. Moreover a lack of
technical and scientific expertise and knowledge is particularly rampant among many NGOs, who
are in the habit of acquiring highly destructive "overnight expertise' in virtually any field. Lacking
real content, arguments descend to the level of debate and clever machination - ultimately to the
detriment of the low income groups that NGOs purport to represent or show concern for.
From an economic perspective, the exploitation of fisheries and other natural resources of
Bangladesh would appear to be in a state of Pareto equilibrium (ie no one can increase their own
benefits without having a negative impact on someone else's status). This may not be entirely
correct due to the massive economic distortions that are caused by improper GOB ownership of
natural resources (jalmohals and land) and interference with production and marketing.
Nonetheless, the provisions of the fisheries and environmental laws has resulted in a state of
virtual lawlessness in the fisheries and environmental sectors.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
B. EXISTING ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY
(to be completed)
B.1 Institutional and Non-Institutional Enforcement Capacity
Institutional enforcement of fishery laws rests largely with the DOF. The enforcement capacity of
the DOF is minimal, with no cadre of trained and equipped fish guards in existence.
The police or the army are rarely active in enforcing fisheries laws or intervening in conflicts.
The recently formed Bangladesh Coast Guard (BCG) will include in its mandate enforcement of
fisheries laws and protection of fishermen from dacoity. BCG currently has two large patrol
vessels, and will add another five in the next few years.
Non-institutional enforcement capacity (in the form of fishguards, paharadar) is contracted by
jalmohal leaseholders. There are numerous such private fish guards throughout Bangladesh. Most
are thugs, thieves and mercenaries who routinely threaten and abuse fishermen. Few are properly
trained.
B.2 Impact on Sustainability of Fisheries
The impact on sustainability of institutional enforcement is almost non-existent. Fisheries and
environment laws are routinely flouted throughout the country. Few arrests are made by the police
for sale or use of current jal, fishing with poisons or failure to drain polders after shrimp growing
leases expire.
Non-institutional enforcement reduces fishing mortality from unauthorised fishing effort in private
and leased waters. However, the marginal gain in survival is usually eroded when the owner or
leaseholder carries out jalmohal dewatering and complete harvesting.
B.3 Provision of Access to Fisheries Sectors



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
Institutional enforcement generally supports the rights of jalmohal leaseholders to exclude
unauthorised fishing. In most cases however, this exclusion is actually enforced by privately-
contracted fish guards. This has resulted in some extremely violent confrontations in the past, and
will likely continue in the future until the practice is eradicated.



FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
C. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONAL
REGULATIONS
(to be completed)
C.1 Main Deficiencies of Existing Laws and Regulations
The main deficit of fisheries and environmental laws is that they do not specify, allocate or protect
any roles, rights or responsibilities for genuine fishermen and fishermwomen in the management
of fisheries, or in the management of fisheries environments. They also do not recognise the legal[
status of water bodies such as beel and baors, or specifically protect them from encroachment.
C.2 Recommended New Legal Instruments
It is recommended that a Community-based Fisheries Management Law be promulgated. This law
should allocate access or ownership of fisheries resources, as well as fisheries environments as
appropriate, to genuine fishing communities, and define management responsibilities. It should
also specifically prevent and outlaw access or ownership by individuals or by capital investors (ie
previous jalmohal leaseholders and moneylenders), but should at the same time guarantee
subsistence fishing rights to individuals using low productivity gears in marginal fishing areas.
It is also recommnended that a Wetland Conservation Law be promulgated. This law should protect
beels and baors.
A new regulations should be promulgated by GOB which specify a complete ban on the use of
pesticides to treat or preserve fish, especially dry fish.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Environmental Assessment
C. SMALL SCALE WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT SECTOR
PROJECT (ADB, IFAD, GON)
C.1 Project Objectives and Components
This project is executed by LGED and aims to construct various small scale civil engineering
works some of which could benefit fisheries. These include canal re-excavation, rubber dams (to
create dry season water reservoirs in rivers), refuge duars, and small fishpasses.
C.2 Possible Complementary Activities
This project could undertake some of the canal re-excavation works proposed. LGED is
responsible for about 80% of all canal re-excavations carried out in Bangladesh. Moreover LGED
is active in promoting community-implemented O&M through Water Management Cooperative
Associations (which have legal status). There are also opportunities for collaboration in fish
sanctuary establishment and fishpass construction.

FOURTH FISHERIES PROJECT PREPARATION Annex 9: Enivironrmental Assessment
F. NORTHEAST REGIONAL WATER MANAGMIENT PROJECT (CIDA)
F.1 Project Objectives and Components
This project has prepared a regional water management plan as a component of the Flood Action
Plan. It has also constructed a pilot vertical slot fishpass at the Manu River FCDI project.
F.2 Possible Complementary Activities
The main area for collaboration are in termination of the jalmohal leases inside the Kawadighi
Haor/Manu River FCDI project area, and implementation of the proposed pilot community-owned
fisheries component. The CIDA fishpass project was intended to test the vertical slot fishpass as a
mitigation measure for fish migration. This has been successful, but full realisation of benefits to
the genuine fishing communities will require a major change in the fisheries management system
(access and tenure)

Although canal re-excavation re-establishes a connection between river
and beel, it also results in faster drainage of the beel during the
monsoon, and can negatively impact beel production.

Tall mangrove trees in the Sunderban, near Buri Goalini.
Protection of this important mangrove forest is a high priority.
Despite the importance that the mangrove area has for fish production, little is
known about the fish resources of the Sunderban. The EIA Team was not even
able to locate a checklist of fish species.
Mgst of the mangroves near Cox's Bazar have been severely depleted to make
.room for shrimp ponds. However, this stand on the river terrace between the
polder embankment and the shoreline near the Niribili Shrimp farm is still
relatively healthy, and illustrates good mangrove management practices. A
dense band of mangroves should be left to grow undisturbed on the river
terrace, to prevent erosion and provide a substrate for invertebrates.
A small species of mangrove (keora) near Cox's Bazar is suffering from leaf
die-off.

This species of acacia tree (koi babla) is planted along bunds and

It provides valuable habitat for birds, and yields a marketable product much
in demand - branches used for fish production (katha).
Fencing keeps stocked carp fingerlings inside Baluhar Baor near Jessore,
but could also prevent broodstock of large non-carp species from migrating
into the baor to breed.
This fish fence across the Surma River near Kanairghat, presents a problem
for navigation as it extends across the entire channel. Widespread introduction
of fish pens could create similar problems for navigation.

Water hyacinth infestation in a large tank- near Bagerhat.
Kacihiuri pana is a nuisance plant from South America which infests many
water bodies in Bangladesh. It causes severe loss of water quality due to
deoxygenation. Only air breathing fish can survive under such conditions.
Water hyacinth also interferes with navigation,
as in the Dakatia River near Chandpur.
Operation of most fishing gears is hampered by water hyacinth infestation.
This fisherman had to laboriously clear a small area in order to deploy a lift
net. Even so, he catches few fish due to the poor water quality. under the

The benefits of community-based fisheries management are clearly visible at
Nasti Baor. This group of fishermen own their own fish auctioning hall and
office. They regularly stock the baor with carp fry.
Fish traders come to the landing center at a pre-arranged time. One hour
before, paired teams of fishermen and boats go out to catch the fish using
boat seines. This is an active method of fishing, and fishermen do not want a
fish sanetuary in the baor, as the fish would become more difficult to catch
at the appointed time.
In 1996, the fishermen of the baor produced an impressive yield of 1,820 kg
per ha. As they have only a lease and do not own the baor or the fishery,
they are now afraid that outsiders will try to take the fishery away from them
as it has shown a high profit.

The jalmohal leasing system of GOB appears to create endless problems for
the fisheries sector.
Here at a Third Fisheries Project shrimp polder, the water supply canal (to
the right of the bund) has been leased for 99 years to a non-shrimp farmer.
This individual now extorts large amounts of money from the hapless shrimp
farmers in return for supplying water to their ponds.
Serious environmental degradation-and indiscriminate overharvesting have
affected other aquatic biota in Bangladesh. Few crocodiles are left in the wild.
Crocodiles perform an essential ecological role in eliminating diseased fish
and other animals. This semi-tamed crocodile survives in a tank near
Bagerhat.
