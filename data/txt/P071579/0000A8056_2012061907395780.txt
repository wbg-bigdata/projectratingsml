                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The task team conducted an implementation and supervision mission in Benin from May 13 to 19 and is of the opinion that execution of project activities are on track as evidenced by
                         the progress towards achieving the two PDO-level indicators, i.e.: (i) Number of communal marine and coastal biodiversity sites, including wetlands areas demarcated and protected;
                         and (ii) Number of the inter-communal management councils participating in the conservation of marine and coastal resources, including mangrove conservation.

                         (i) for indicator one, out of the three communal marine and coastal biodiversity sites to be demarcated and protected by project end on May 15 2014, two have legally been created by
                         communal arrete in line with the national legislation: (i) Vodounto in the Commune of Ouidah; and (ii) Bamezoun in the Commune of Agugus. The legal creation of the third one
                         (Togbin-Adounko in the Commune of Abomey-calavi) is expected for July 2012 when the communal arrete is signed. The demarcation of these 3 conservation areas was done in a
                         participatory manner involving communities living around the conservation areas, who will ensure long term protection of these areas along with sites management units being set up

                         (ii) the second PDO-level indicator measured by two inter-communal management councils held on a yearly basis to identify issues and agree on actions to ensure long-term
                         management of the sites is also on track although, only one meeting has been held so far this year. The project team will work closely with the mayors to ensure that the second
                         meeting is held before end December 2012 and its outcomes circulated to the project team.
