REPUBLIC OF HUNGARY
SECOND STIUBZZRAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN {SAL 2 
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:               The National Bank of Hungary
Guarantor:              The Government of the Republic of Hungary
Amounts                 USS250 million equivalent
Termst                  15 years, including 5 years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate
Description:            The proposed SAL 2 would support the Government's
medium-term economic reform program, which represents
an acceleration and deepening of reforms implemented
successfully since the beginning of 1990 and supported
by SAL 1. The objectl.ve of the reforms is to
establish a competitive market economy in Hungary, and
to preserve Hungary's external creditworthiness. The
program has four main components:
(i) reduction of the role of the state -- regarding
ownership of productive assets, the extent of
administrative intervention in resource allocation,
and the amount of resources redistributed through
taxes and transfers:
(ii) intensification of competition, by way of further
import and domestic price liberalization, the
promotion of new private ventures, implementation of
effective anti-trust action against enterprises
engaged in unfair and restrictive practices, and
tightening of financial discipline through the
financial system and strengthened bankruptcy
proceduresl
(iiiL) financial sector reform, through further
liberalization, implementation of improved prudential
regulation and tighter supervision, and restructuring
of insolvent banks; and
(iv) establishment of financially viable, well-
targeted, and o'ficient programs of social assistance
to alleviate t;,e social costs of adjustment in the
short-term and to provide an adequate social safety
net that will protect the poor.
Benefits and Risks:     The main benefitt of the reforms are the improved
prospects for sustained economic growth and rising
living standards in the medium-term. This growth is
expected as a result of increased productivity
stimulated by competition, and better access to
external capital, modern technology and management
skills facilitated by improvements in external



ii
creditworthiness and macroeconomic stability.
The main risks are policy slippages and/or adverse
external developments. Lack of financial discipline,
with continued lending to insolvent enterprises
resulting from lagging financial sector reform, is the
main policy risk. However, the proposed SAL 2 would
support the implementation of needed financial sector
reforms, which are critical to ensuring that
enterprises face a hard budget constraint. A second
policy risk is that rising unemployment from
industrial restructuring would create pressures to
slow the implementation of difficult reforms. To
reduce this risk, the Government, supported by SAL 2
and the recently approved Human Resources Project,
aims to improve unemployment insurance and social
assistance, promote new business ventures, and enhance
the functioning of the labor market, including the
development of flexible market-oriented retraining
schemes.
The external environment also poses risks. First,
trade with the Soviet Union may contract more than
projected, which would depress economic activity and
possibly lead to pressures to relax demand management
policies. Negotiations are currently underway between
the Hungarian and Soviet authorities to minimize this
risk. Slower than projected economic activity could
also endanger the fiscal deficit target (and the
objective cf controlling inflation) unless revenue
shortfalls are compensated by implementing additional
measures. In 1990, under similar circumstances, the
Government implemented additional measures at mid-
year to meet the annual target for the fiscal deficit.
A second risk is that shortfalls in the planned levels
of gross disbursements from private/commercial
creditors, mainly due to uncertainties in the entire
region, could jeopardize the external financing plan
and slow down the planned liberalization of the
economy. To maintain the confidence of Hungary's
external creditors, the Government has repeatedly and
strongly reiterated its commitment to honoring all its
debt obligations on schedule, and its determination to
resolutely implement stabilization measures and
structural reforms that enhance its creditworthiness.
Thus far, the financing plan for 1991 is on track.
The third source of external risk is fluctuations in
international prices and interest rates. A Si/barrel
increase in the price of petroleum is estimated to
cost Hungary $70 million per year through the direct
effect of higher oil prices as well as through the
indirect effect higher oil prices have in raising the
price of natural gas. The composition of Hungary's



iI
foreign debt and orientation of trade also make it
vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. It is
eatimated that a 10 percent depreciation of the U.S.
dollar against major currencies would result in an
annual increase in interest payments measured in U.S.
dollars of $119 million. In addition to the effect on
interest payments, a further loss of $228 million to
the trade balance would occur, mainly due to Germany's
larger share in Hungary's Imports than in its exports
(42 percent compared with 0 percent). Finally, a one
percentage point increase in LIBOR is estimated to
cost Hungary $100 million in 1991. Hungary cannot
influence world prices or interest rates, and can only
minimize the risks posed by fluctuations in these
variables by forcefully implementing its economic
reform program.
Estimated
Disbursements:           The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in three
tranches: US$100 million upon loan effectiveness,
which is expected in July 1991; US$75 million after
the implementation of a number of key actions,
expected in the first quarter of calendar 1992; and
the remaining US$75 million upon initiation of
additional measures, expected in the third quarter of
calendar year 1992.

I submit the following report and recCmmedation on a proposed
second structural adjustment loan to the National Dank of Hungary (NBH) with
the guarantee of the Republic of Hungary for the equivalent of $250 million.
it supports the acceleration and deepening of the Governments medium-term
economic reform program which seeks to establish a competitive market economy.
The loan would have a term of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate, and would be disbursed in three tranches.
Cofinancing by the Export-Import Dank of Japan is also expected.
PART  - THE ECONOMN
A.   Stature of theR conomy
1.          Hungary is a relatively small, upper middle-income country with a
population of 10.6 million. In 1989, average per capita GNP was $2580 (Atlas
mothodology). In spite of good progress in economic reforms, the economic
system remains dominated by the stats and cooperative sectors, which account
for more than 90 percent of GDP; however, the private sector, while mall in
relation to GDP, has been the most dynamic element of the economy in recent
years. The economy is highly dependent on developments in the international
environmentu taken together, exports and imports are equivalent to about 60
percent of GDP.
2.          Industry, most of which is in the socialist sector (state-owned
enterprises and cooperatives), accounts for 32 percent of GDP and 30 percent
of employment. The manufacturing subsectors -- machinery and engineering
products, building materials, chemicals, light industry and food
processing -- comprise nearly 80 percent of production. The demise of the
CMZA market and depressed domestic demand have forced many industrial
enterprises to re-orient sales to the West, which has been an importazt
impetus for industrial restructuring.
3.          Agriculture and forestry account for 17 percent of GDP and 18
percent of employment. Livestock and crops comprise approximately equal
shares of the gross value of production. The major products are pork, wheat,
corn, poultry, milk, beef, fruits and vegetables. About two-thirds of
employment in agricultural enterprises is dedicated to primary agriculture
while the remainder is employed in ancillary non-agricultural activities such



2
as food-processing, manufacturing, construction and services. small farme
account for about 14 percent of cultivated area but 50 percent of agricultural
value added.
3. Reent Reforms
4.          since 1968, wher central planning was abolished, Hungary has been
experimenting with economic reforme to establish a market-based economy. In
the process, important parts of the institutional and legal infrastructure for
a market economy were put in place, including most notably: a modern tax
system, comprising Personal Income Tax (PXTs- Value Added Tax (VAT) and
Bntrepreneurial Profit Tax (EPT); a two-tier banking system including the
National Dank of Hungary (MBH) and full service commercial banks; and
legislation permLtting limited liability associatLons, includLng joint stock
companles and limLted liabllity companies, and permitting private companies to
employ up to S00 employees. These reforms were supported by the Bank through
the Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan (ISAL) in FY88.
S.          However, fundamental issues of ownership and financial discipline
were not addressed, which thwarted efforts to sustain tight fiscal and
monetary policies. During 1989, large domestic and external imbalances
emerged (the current account deficit ln convertible currencies rose sharply
from 2.9 percent of GrP in 1988 to 5.2 percent in 1989), which, in an
uncertaLn political climate, seriously undermined Hungary's access to
international financlal markets. In response, the Government took measures in
late 1989 to tighten fiscal and monetary policies to restore macroeconomic
stability. A wlde-ranglng program of structural reforms was initiated in mid-
1990 to address the fundamental microeconomic and sector issues underlying the
macroeconomic imbalances. The stabilization program was supported by an IMF
Standby Arrangement (BRA), and the World Bank approved its first structural
adjustment loan (SAL 1) for $200 million in June 1990 in support of the reform
program, with associated co-financing of $200 million from the Export-Import
Dank of Japan (JUXIM). The European Community (EC) also provided a $1 billion
adjustment loan to support the Government's program.
6.          As in other countries in the region, pressures for fundamental
polltical reforms gained strength in 1989, which culminated in Hungary's first
free multi-party elections in April 1990, and the coming to power of a new
non-communist coalition government in mid-1990. The pace of economic reforms
has since accelerated.
C.    The 1990 Reform Initiative
7.          The structural reforms begun in mid-1990 and lmplemented by the
new Government marked a significant breakthrough from earlier efforts. The
Government committed itself to promoting privatizatLon of state enterprises
(sEs) and the growth of new private ventures, including foreign direct
investment. Strong emphasis was placed on tightening financial discipline.
An ambitious program to reduce subsidies, by the equivalent to 4 percent of
GDP in the firat year, was adopted. T.ae Government aiso accelerated the



3
restructuring and liquidation of Lnsolvent enterprisesi and commercial banks,
and the Social Security Fund and tax authorities were encouraged to take
actLon agaLnst enterprLses Ln arrears. To intensLfy competltLon, the
Goverument slgnifLcantly increased the exposure of domeitLc industry to Lmport
competition, decontrolled prices (LncludLng those for agriculture products),
and ellmlnated formal entry barrLers to new private and  mJ Ul and medLum
enterprise. Finally, anothor novel feature of the program oas its social
component, including the establishment of unemployment insurance.
8.          The main macroeconomic objective of the 1990 program was to reduce
the convertible currency current account defieLt from $1.4 bllion ln 1989 to
$550 llion (revised to $400 million at mid-year) through monetary and fiscal
restraint. Other objectives lncluded eliminating the current account surplus
ln non-convertible currencies (equivalent to $0.8 billion ln 1989), curbing
inflation, which had reached 18 percent, and arresting the decline in GDP
which fell by 2 percent in 1989.
D.   Assessment of Recent Reform ImDlementation and Economic Performance
9.          The implementation of macroeconomic policy was good, ind a wide
array of structural reforms were also implemented during 1990. Program
targets agreed with the IMF were met by comfortable margins, an( All purchases
under the BSA throughl November 1990 were made. The second tranche of SAL 1
was released in February 1991, after all but one -- a slight slippage in
meeting the subsidy reductlon target -- of the specified conditions were met.
in several areas (trade and price liberalization, financial sector
liberalization), the reforms went faster and farther than anticipated earlier.
10.         The structural reforms increased competition from imports and from
domestic suppliers, including private businesses. Reduction in budget
subsidies to enterprises, combined with tight monetary policy, strengthened
financial discipline, increasing pressures to restructure inefficient
activities. These pressures intensified with the contraction of CMEA trade.
These policies also permitted more resources for the development of the
private sector, which continued to grow rapidly in response to deregulation
and the progressive withdrawal of the state from the economy. The initiation
of an ambitious privatization program was an important landmark in Hungary's
reform efforts.
11.         There is already evidence that structural reforms are beginning to
show positive results. The strong growth of exports to the convertible
currency area in 1990 (9.5 percent volume growth) is an indication that
economic restructuring is underway, reflecting the successful reorientation of
production capacities previously geared to exporting to the CMEA countries.
The biggest increase in exports to the convertible currency area was in
machinery, transport equipment and other capital goods (19 percent volume
growth), which were among the sectors most adversely affected oy the
contraction in CMEA trade. A large part of the increase in exports derived
from production in small and medium enterprises, whose number more than
doubled in the last 18 months. Another positive indicator is the strong
growth in direct foreign investment (DFI). There has been a significant



4
increase in the number of joint ventures with foreign partneres from ahout 800
at the end of 1989 to 2,300 by November 1990. The inflow of DFI in 1990 ($337
mlliton) nearly dcubled that in 1989.
12.         StabllisatLon policLes were strictly implemented.  The target for
the consolidated fiscal balance was achieved, which reflected an improvement
equlvalent to 2 percent of GDP over 1989. The growth of domestic credit was
limited to about 10 percent, which was below the expected (and actual) rate of
inflation. A flexible intereat rate policy was adopted. The basic and
liquidLty reflnancing ratet of the NBH were raLsed by 9-11 percenta,ie polnts
to 22 percent and 28 percent respectively between end-1989 and end-l990. All
short-term refinancing interest rates of the N8H, with the exception of those
for export refinance, were raised to 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990.
Znterest rates on T-bille sold to households were raised in November 1990 by
2-3 percentage polnts to 2*-31 percent.
13.         Adherence to the stabilization policies led to a significant
improvement in the current account balance in convertible currencies. Despite
unfavorable external shocks -- including the worst drought experienced in
Hungary this century, the unexpected shortfall ln Soviet oil imports, and
higher energy prices in world markets -- compared with the initial target of a
deficit of $S550 millIlon, che current account registered a surplus of $127
million in 1990, an improvement over 1989 equivalent to more than 5 percent of
CDP. The sources of this improvement included a $699 million turnaround in
the travel account, partly due to the restrictions on foreign travel imposed
in November 1989s a $601 million Lncrease in unrequited transfers, which
partly reflects Lncreased commercial transactions, but was mainly due to the
growth of foreign exchange deposits, previously held outside the banking
system by residents, following the liberalization of regulations on holdings
of foreign currency deposits in 1989; and the stronger than expected
performance of exports to the convertible currency area. The strong growth of
exports was due to several factors includings the larger than planned
reduction in exports to the CMEA area (26 percent compared to the planned 20
percent), which forced enterprises to reorient thelr sales to the West; the
somewhat easler access to Western markets following the granting of
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) treatment to Hungarian exports by the
RC and other OECD countries; the removal of quantitative restrictions on trade
and the liberalization of trading rights; and the active exchange rate policy.
14.         Despite these positive results, there were a number of
unsatisfactory developments. First, early forecasts of a quLck restructuring
of capacity toward convertible currency markets ln response to the contraction
of sales to the CMEA area proved overly optimistLc and real GDP fell by 5
percent. The decline also reflected the impact of the severe drought on
agrLcultural production and food processing. Second, inflation was higher
than programmed (29 percent increase in the average consumer price index (CPI)
compared with the initial target of 18-19 percent). The higher rate of
inflation reflected prlmarily further adjustments of auministered prices (milk
and dairy products, gasoline, electricity, water and sewerage) and increased
excise taxes (alcohol and tobacco) implemented at mid-year to correct emerging
fiscal slippages, and further increases in the price of gasoline in October in
response to higher world energy prices. The drought also had an impact on



5
food prices. Third, despite the strong improvement in the current account,
Hungary's reserve position remained unsatisfactory, and access to commercial
capital markets remained tenuous. Despite successful bond issues in several
markets, including the Eurodollar issue launched under the Bank's enhanced
cofinancing operat on (ECO) program, and substantial financial support from
official creditors, net medium-and long-term inflows declined from $1.4
billion in 1989 to only $0.3 billion in 1'^90, and there was a considerable net
outflow of short-term liabilities. As of end-1990, international reserves
were only $1.2 billion, equivalent to about one-and-a-half months of projected
1991 imports. Hungary's external debt remains very high (total debt was 67
percent of GDP in 1990) and debt servicing imposes a heavy burden on the
economy (the debt-service ratio was 66 percent in 1990).
PE       II,- THE GOVERNNRNT' S   EDIUH-TEM EOOMIC PR
A.    Overview
is.         overall, the initial results of the adjustment program initiated
in early 1990 were satisfactory, and the Govarnment has stayed the course
under difficult circumstances. However, as a result of external shocks,
mainly related to the demise of the CMEA, F-ngary again faces serious balance
of payments difficulties in 1991. In res, nse, the Government has accelerated
its reform program. A medium-term economic program, described in the
"Memorandum of Economic Transformation and Medium-Term Policies"
("Memorandum"), was drawn up with the cupport of the bank and the INF.' This
program represents a considerable deepening and acceleration of reforms
initiated under SAL 1. The proposed SAL 2 would support this effort. A
three-year Extended Arrangement (EA) for SDR 1,148 million was already
approved by the IMF f February 1991 in support of the Government's program.
16.         The fundamental aim of the program is to create appropriate
conditions for sustained economic growth and higher living standards of the
population through the transformation of Hungary into a market economy.
Essential to this transformation is the progressive reduction in the role of
the state, and correspondingly, enlargement of the role of the private sector.
The program includes:
(i)   fostering the growth of private ownership, by privatization, and
by providing an overall policy environment conducive to new
private ventures;
(ii) reducing the scope of state intervention (and increasing the role
of markets), by shrinking the size of government and liberalizing
foreign trade and pricing; and
'The Memorandum was distributed to the Board on January 7, 1991.



6
(iii) reducing resource transfers effected through the budget, by
reducing public sector expenditures and lowering taxes.
17.         Equally important, the program includes reforms for improving the
efficiency of activities that remain within the public sector. In addition to
measures to improve overall macroeconomic management, these include, most
importantly, measures tos (a) strengthen financiel discipline and competition
in state enterprisesl (b) improve public utility (e.g., energy) pricing by
incorporating economic efficiency considerations; and (c) provide an adequate
and efficient social safety net.
8.    Macroeconomic Framework
18.         The main objectives of the 1991-93 macroeconomic framework are to
successfully surmount the immediate crisis resulting from the large external
shock (para. 19), generate economic growth, reduce inflation to a single
digit, and establish convertibility of the forint for current transactions.
Curbing inflation requires the reduction in the fiscal deficit and the
maintenance of tight monetary policy. The Government intends to eliminate the
fiscal deficit by 1993. Implementation of the structural reforms, and
adherence to sound macroeconomic policies would provide the basis for a
resumption of sustainable GDP growth of 3-5 percent by the end of the period.
The medium-term macroeconomic framework, including principal macroeconomic
targets, and the instruments for achieving the targets, has been discussed
among governmant officials and thte staffs of the Bank and the IMF.  The main
features of the program are summarized In Tabie 1 and the financing plan is
shown in Table 2.
i. The Real Economy
19.         The pressures of economic restructuring, accelerated by the
collapse of the ex-CMEA market, and the need to service the large external
debt aia the main determinants of real economic developments during 1991-93.
The recession, which started in 1990 when ruble exports declined by 26
percent, is expected to deepen in 1991 because of tne projected 45 percent
contraction in exports to the ex-CMEA area. As a result, industrial value
added is projected to fall by 9.5 percent, and real GDP by 7.3 percent. The
contraction of real GDP will stop in 1992, though growth is projected to
remain negligible. The restructuring of industry along product lines that can
compete internationally is expected to result in an acceleration of industrial
growth. The service sector would continue to expand rapidly. After 1992, the
steady progress in reducing the current account deficit, and the build-up of
an adequate level of international reserves, would perm.. a relaxation of the
external constraint and a larger increase in domestic demand may be
accommodated. During 1993-9S, real GDP growth is expected to average 3-5
percent. Industry is the fastest growing sector, followed by services, then
agriculture.

20.         The strong growth of exports to the West and to other developing
countries partly compensateu for the decline in exports to the ex-CMEA
countries and provides the main demand side source of growth in the modium-
term. The shift ln external balance projected during 1991-93 requires
policies that restrain domestic demand and promote savings. Private
consumption is expected to fall by a cumulative 9 percent in 1990-91 and
stagnate in 1992 before growth begins to accelerate. Declining real economic
activity is also projected to depress investment demand. A shift in the
source of investment demand toward the enterprise sector is projected to
result from the need for restructuring investments and investments in new
ventures. The withdrawal of the Government from financing investments in the
productive sectors (para. 46) should reinforce this shift. Although part of
the increase in enterprise investment demand is likely to originate from state
enterprises, the continued rapid growth of new private ventures and progress
in privatization will mean that an increasing share of enterprise investment
demand originates from the private sector. Increased financial intermediation
of household savings should also shift the composition of investment away from
housing. These changes in the composition and destination of investment are
expected to lead, in the medium-term, to a significant improvement in its
productivity, and as a result, acceleration in the rate of growth of real GDP.
Li.  4onetarv. Fiscal, and Exchange Rate Policies
21.         In 1991, the goal of stabilization policy is to contain the budget
and external current account deficits. The program includes limits on total
domestic credit, credit to the consolidated state budget, net foreign
liabilities in convertible currencies, short-term liabilities in convertible
currencies, and a targeted increase in net international reserves. A
substantial share of the increase in domestic credit will be available for
small private entrepreneurs.
22.         The projected reduction in public sector absorption during 1991-
93 is an important element of the Government's program. The 1991 budget,
approved by Parliament, contains a consolidated state budget deficit
equivalent to 1.5 percent of GDP. Cuts are programmed in a broad range of
expenditures in real terms, including consumer and producer subsidies,
enterprise investment subsidies, subsidies for housing, and public
administration. Savings are also projected from schemes to limit health care
expenditures and from reforms in the pension system. In 1991, the
transformation of trade with the ex-CHEA area to world prices has an adverse
effect on the budget because of the loss of revenues obtained earlier by
taxing users of cheap oil imports from the Soviet Union. However, the
position of the consolidated state budget (on a GFS basis) would improve
steadily to achieve rough balance by 1993.
23.         To achieve the targeted improvement of the balance of payments
(para. 25), an appropriate structure of relative prices must be maintained.
Effective January 7, 1991, the forint was devalued by 15 percent against the
basket of currencies to which it is pegged. The Government remains committed
to pursuing an active exchange rate policy with timely and appropriate
adjustments of the exchange rate.

LLL. ZAUA
24.         Inflation Ls projected to accelerate ln 1991 to 33-35 percent
(annual average), despLte the maintenance of tlght monetary pollcy that would
keep the rate of growth of monetary and credlt aggregates to well below
expected inflation. Pollcy measures, including devaluation, exclse tax
lncreases, decreases in consumer prlce subsLdies, and higher domestic prlces
for imports from the ex-CMEA area, are responsible for much of the increase in
Laflation. By acceleratLag the implementation of these reforms Ln the fLrat
year of the program, lt is expected that their maln impact on the level of the
CPI will be felt in 1991, which would enable reducLng the rate of lnflatLors,
easured on an end-year basis, to a sLngle dLqit by 1993. AchlevLng this
target, however, also depends on contalning lnflatLonary expectations, so that
wage Lncreases do not begln to lead price increaes. In 1991, the Government
abandoned the practlce, introduced in 1989, of tryLng to influence nominal
wage growth through its participation ln the tripartlte (labor, employers and
government) interest reconciliation councll. In its place, the government li
implementLng an explicit incomes policys increases in the wage blll of less
than 18 percent are deductlble as costs in computing taxable income; increases
of 18 to 28 percent are taxed at the ordinary EPT rate; and the entire
lncrease in the wage bill is taxed at the EPT rate if the wage increase
exceeds 28 percent. The success in meetLng annual inflation targets
consiLtent wlth the goal of achieving single digit lnflatlon measured on an
end-year basli will be used to assess macroeconomic performance during the
program period (para. 32).
iv. The Balance of Paim=entm and External rinangLno -Reoirements
2s.         The projected 45 percent decline in exports to the ex-CMEA area in
1991 translates into a loss of $2.5 blllion in export revenue.2 Although the
resultant decline in output wlll lower import demand (Table 1), and policy
measures should further encourage soae re-dLrection of exports from the ex-
cxA area to other convertible currency markets, the $mmediate impact of the
sharp decline in ex-CQEA exports is a large deterioratlon in the trade
balance. An increase in net current transfers is projected, though it is less
than the large lncrease in 1990 which reflected a one-time portfollo
reallocation of resident foreign exchange holdings (para. 13). Similarly,
although there is a further lncrease in net receipts from travel, the large
lncrease that occurred in 1990 Ls not projected to recur because it was due
partly to the imposition of adminiatrative restrictions on foreign travel
(para. 13). Thus, a current account deficit of $0.9 billion Lg projected for
1991. After 1991, the deficit would not exceed the level of DPI.
26.         Despite the strong performance of the current account ln
convertible currencLes in 1990, Hungary's external reserves were under
continuous pressure as access to short and medium-term capital from financial
markets was lower than antLcLpated. The medium-term program assumes that
these difficulties wlll continue in 1991-93. Gross MLT disbursements of $3.7
2seginning in 1991, all trade is expected to be in convertible
currencies.



11
billion are required In 1991 (Table 2). in addition to financing the current
account deficit and repayment obligations, this level permits a modest build-
up of reserves to $1.7 billion, or the equivalent of 2 months of imports.
gross disbursements are projected to decline to $3.2 billion in 1992, and $3
billion in 1993. All indicators of creditworthiness improve. After an
initial increase from S percent in 1990 to 61 percent in 1991, the ratio of
medium- and long-term debt to CDP declines to 55 percent in 1993. The debt-
service ratio declines from 66 percent in 1990 to 33 percent in 1993.
International reserves increase steadily and stabilize at 2.3 months of
imports by 1993. DFX is expected to play a key role in the restructuring of
Hungarian economy and economic policies have been designed to stimulate a more
intensive lnflow. Inflows of DF1 are projected at $570 million in 1991 and
$600 million per year thereafter.  In light of the Government's receptivity to
foreign investment, seen in the hospitable tax and administrative system, and
the increases recorded in the past two years (from an insignificant inflow
before 1989 to $337 million in 1990) including several large deals (General
Electric, General Motors, Suzuki), the projected inflows of DFI are probably
conservative.
27.         The financing plan shows a temporary shift in the composition of
capital flows toward official creditors (the Bank, the IMF, the EC and the
G-24). The share of private commercial debt in total debt is projected to
fall from 73 percent in 1990 to 52 percent in 1993 as access to international
capital markets is projected to continue to be difficult. In response to the
acceleration and deepening of the adjustment program, official creditors are
expected to assist in meeting Hungary's medium-term external financing needs.
Hungary's good current account performance should eventually permit its former
access to commercial sources of finance to be restored, and commercial and
private creditors' share of total debt is projected to increase to 70 percent
by 2000, nearly ths same share as in 1990.
28.         The Bank's share of total debt would increase from 7.2 percent in
1990 to 9.9 percent in 1995, then decrease to 7.4 percent by 2000. The debt
service to the Bank would decrease from 3.6 percent of export earnings in 1990
to 2.4 percent in 1995 and 1.7 percent in 2000. Measured as a share of
medium- and long-term debt service, debt service to the Bank increases from
5.4 percent in 1990 to 7.4 percent in 1995, then declines to 7.2 percent in
2000. These indicators of Bank exposure remain comfortably within the Bank's
guidelines.
v. Risks to the Macroeconomic Framework
29.         The good record of implementation of structural reforms in 1990,
and the acceleration of reforms announced in early 1991, provide confidence
that these reforms will continue to be implemented resolutely in the future.
However, there are risks to the scenario, which can arise from policy slippage
or from adverse external developments. One policy risk is failure to maintain
tight financial discipline. In particular, delays in financial sector reform
have somewhat undermined financial discipline by allowing banks to continue to
lend to insolvent enterprises. As discussed later on (paras. 63-67), the
proposed SAL 2 supports the implementation of needed financial sector reforms,
which are critical to ensuring that enterprises face a hard budget constraint.



12
A second polliy rlsk is rlsing unemployment from industrial restructuring,
which could create preosures to slow the implementation of dlfflcult and
palnful reforms. To reduce thli rLsk, the Government, supported by the Bank
through the proposd SAL 2 and the recently approved Human Resources Project,
aims to create an lntegrated labor market by developing flexible market-
orlented labor retraining schemes and a sustaLnable unemployment insurance
system (paras. 76-77). The growth of new private ventures, which the
Government's program will facliltate, will also increase labor absorption in
the economy.
30.         The external environment also poses rliks.  Trade with the Sovlet
Union may contract even more than projected, wblch would further depress
economic activlty and possibly lead to pressures to relax demand management
polLcies. The Government is seeking to avoid thLs poseibility through ongoing
negotiations with the Soviet Union. Slower than projected economic activity
could also endanger the fiscal deflcit target (and the objective of
controlling LnflatLon) unless revenue shortfalls are compensated by
implementlng additional measures. In 1990, under similar circumstances the
Government implemented additional measures at mid-year to meet the annual
target for the fiscal defLcit. Another external source of risk is that gross
disbursements from commercial/private external credltors may fall short of
planned levels. To sustain the confidence of external creditors, the
Government is firmly implementlng its reform program to maintain macroeconomic
stability and enhance its creditworthlness. The Government has also
repeatedly and strongly reiterated its commitment to meet all its debt
obllgations as scheduled. However, the risk remains, due largely to the
continuing uncertainties in the region.   The presence of the multilateral
creditors can help reduce this risk by establiahing the credibility of
Hungary's adjustment program. As Hungary implements its economic reform
program and is seen to meet the targets set out in its agreements with the
Bank and the IMF, and builds up a more adequate level of international
rserves, commercial creditors are expected to resume their role as Hungary's
main source of external finance (para. 27).
31.         Fluctuations in international prices and interest rates pose other
risks, and the composition of Hungary's foreign trade and debt also make it
vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. A $1/barrel increase in the
price of petroleum is estimated to cost Hungary $70 million through the direct
effect of higher oil prices as well as through the indirect effect higher oil
prices have in raising the price of natural gas. It is estimated that a 10
percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies would result
in an increase in interest payments, measured in U.S. dollars, of $119
million. In addition to the effect on interest payments, a further loss of
$228 million to the trade balance would occur, mainly due to Germany,s larger
share in Hungary's imports than in its exports (42 percent compared wlth 30
percent). Finally, a one percentage point increase in LIBOR is estimated to
cost Hungary $100 million in 1991. Hungary has little scope for influencing
world prices or interest rates, and can only minlmize such external risks by
forcefully implementing its economic reform program.

vi. Monitorina Macroeconomic Performance
32.         Macroeconomic performance in 1991 will be assessed vis-a-vis
tarzets for the current account and the consolidated state budget balances in
1991. In addition, performance will be evaluated using the following set of
indicators, which reflect the objectives of improving creditworthiness and
accelerating structural change: the rate of growth of GDP and exports; the
rate of inflation; the level of subsidies in relation to GDP; and the level of
outstanding debt in relation to GDP. The expected ranges for these indicators
are shown in Table 3.

C.    Structural Reforms
33.         Consistent with the vision of establishing a market economy,
economic reforms emphasize four main structural components:
(i)   reduction of role of the state, through private sector development
and prlvatization of existlng firms, as well as other measures to
reduce the role of the state budget in redistributing resources
through taxes and tranefers;
(Li) intensification of competition, through further import and price
liberalization, promotion of entry of small and medium enterprises



14
and foreign investors, and effective anti-trust action against
concentrated market structures and non-competitive behavior;
(iiI) reform of the financial sector, through further liberalization,
improved prudential regulation and tighter supervision, and
increased competition; and
(iv)  development of an efficient and financially viable social safety
net.
1.  Reduction in the Role of the State
34.         Private Sector Devjloment.  The private sector will be promoted
by encouraging the growth of new private ventures and small businesses, and by
accelerating privatization. New private ventures and small businesses will be
promoted mainly by creating a stable macroeconomic environment and by
implementing structural reforms, described in detail below, that significantly
reduce the state's intervention in economic activity and enhance the role of
competitive markets in resource allocation. In addition to restrictive fiscal
and monetary policies, which reduce the access of large state enterprises to
budgetary resources and credit, and thereby increase the access of the private
sector and small businesses, structural reforms such as the liberalization of
foreign trade, domestic pricing, and the financial system would enable the
private sector to compete wLth the large state sector on a more equal footing.
The lowering of taxes on economic activity, one of the aims of the reform of
the budget, would provide an important impetus to the growth of the private
sector.
35.         The Government recognizes that, in view of the past discrimination
against private sector activity, some additional incentives for private sector
development may be necessary for a limited tim. Several tax incentives are
provided to the private sector (use of accelerated deprzeciation for investment
in machinery and equipment, 50 percent enterprise tax preference for three
years). To help new ventures capitalize their expansion in the first years of
their operation, from 1992 the Government will extend the carry forward period
for net operating losses. It will continue to support the private sector by
improving its access to credit and other necessary infrastructure (office
sites, telecomuwnications) and by further streamlining the regulatory
environment. These actions are expected to further accelerate the growth of
the private sector, which was dynamic last year (para. 11).
36.         The entry of new businesses will also be facilitated by effective
anti-trust policies that send a strong signal to business that competitive,
efficiency enhancing behavior is acceptable and that conversely, monopolizing,
rent-sseking behavior is not. An Office for Competition was established in
early 1991 to implement the now Law Prohibiting Unfair Market Practices, to
investigate complaints of monopolistic and non-competitive behavior, and to
monitor mergers and acquisitions. The Government will continue to break up
highly concentrated market structures. In the highly concentrated food
sector, the Government will continue the process initiated two years ago with
the break-up of the meat trust, and the dismantling of the milk trust last
year. Prior to the release of th third tranche of SAL 2. oxivatizatign of

will be initiated. and domestic trade in vegetable oil nroducto will be
liberalized. To ensure effective comoetition, after reviewina the structure
of-the industry. iointlv with the Bank. and if wtarranted by the results and
recommendations of the review. the Government will eliminate all restrictions
og  external trade in veoetable oil oroducts.
37.         EX4vatization.  The development of new private sector enterprises
will be accompanied by the acceleration-of the privatization process initiated
in 1990. According to the Government's medium-term strategy, privatization is
to be accelerated with the primary objective of improving the efficiency of
productive assets while ensuring a transparent process. The target is to
privatize 35-40 percent of business assets by 1993. This is an ambitious
target. Specific measures to implement the Government's medium-term strategy
in 1992 will be elaborated in the .992 Asset Policy Guidelines, which will be
reviewed with the Bank prior to presenting it to Parliament by end of 1991.
38.         Privatization will be accomplished through three main channels.
First, retail shops and restaurants will be auctioned to private owners
through the Pre-Privatization program which was approved by Parliament in
September 1990. About 5,000-6,000 units are expected to be sold in the first
two years and the remaining ones will be auctioned when their current lease
expires. Second, the State Property Agency (SPA) will continue to launch
"active" privatization programs for sale of larger enterprises. Two "active"
programs, each involving about 20 enterprises, were launched in September and
December of 1990. Subsequent privatization programs will be launched every
third or fourth month. Finally, and most importantly, privatization initiated
by the enterprise itself or by a potential buyer will be encouraged and the
SPA's role will be limited to ensuring transparency of the transaction.
39.         Instead of facilitating privatization through the free
distribution of shares, the NDH will refinance credits extended by commercial
banks to private Hungarian citizens, or associations of private citizens, for
purchasing either state assets sold by the SPA, or shares in privatized
companies. Since Government debt will be retired by the full amount of the
newly refinanced credit, no expansion of net domestic credit will result.
Notwithstanding the Government's general policy of non-subsidization of credit
and positive real interest rates, the privatization credits are currently made
at a preferential interest rate.3 Despite this preferential treatment, the
subsidy is less than on outstanding long-term government debt. As a result,
the cash-flow position of the consolidated public sector, including the NBR,
improves from the operation of this facility. The preferential credit scheme
is limited to the support of the privatization process and will eventually be
phased out. sales financed from domestic holdings of residents or from DPI
would be largely used (85 percent) to reduce Government debt, and partly (15
percent) to offset expenses in the privatization process. To encourage
Acurrently, the interest rate on these loans is 75 percent of the NBH's
basic refinancing rate of 22 percent, plus bank margins of 4 percentage
points. In order to qualify for the loan the borrower would have to satisfy a
criterion set in terms of a graduated downpayment relative to the value of the
asset to be purchased. The size of the loan cannot exceed Ft. 50 million.



16
greater employee participation in privatization, the Government is also
considering providing limited preferences, including a lower price, and
payment by installments.
40.         The participation of foreign capital in privatization will be
welcomed for the bulk of the competitive sphere of the economy. Hungary has a
liberal legal framework and generous incentives for foreign investors,
allowing unrestricted repatriation of profits and invested capital in
convertible currency. Total foreign ownership and control is permitted.
There was a strong increase in DFI in Hungary in 1990 (para. 11). This trend
is expected to continue and ioreign capital is expected to play an important
role in the Hungarian economy.
41.         The present ambiguity of ownership of state assets, including
land, could slow the speed of privatization. The Government is elaborating a
comprehensive reform in the ownership of state enterprises, to be finalized in
June 1991, which the Bank is supporting through the proposed Enterprise
Restructuring and Privatization Project (ERPP; FY92). To resolve the issue of
ownership of property expropriated by the previous regime _.n 1949, a new
Compensation Law was adopted by Parliament in April 1991. This law defines
the criteria and extent of financial compensation to be provided to persons
whose property was expropriated. While in general the law only provides for
financial compensation (in the form of bonds to buy state assets being
privatized) to those whose property was expropriated, in the case of land,
original owners could reclaim their property. With the adoption of the Law,
the uncertainty about ownership has lessened, though considerable uncertainty
remains about the implementation of the law.
42.         The success of the Government's privatization program also depends
on the capacity of Government institutions (e.g., SPA) and supporting
infrastructure (e.g., accounting and auditing) to implement the process, as
well as on the buoyancy of the economy. Through the proposed ERPP, the Bank
is assisting the Government in developing the policy and institutional
framework to support its privatisation objectives. The pace of privatization
may also be constrained in the short-run by depressed domestic demand
conditions.
43.         Reduced Role of the Budaet in Redistribution of Resources.  The
development of a market economy is not possible without a significant
reduction in the role of the state budget in redistributing resources within
the economy through taxes and subsidies. Expenditures of the Consolidated
State Budget (CSB) constituted more than half of GDP in 1990.4 The
Government'e aim is to reduce these expenditures by the equivalent of six
percent of GDP by 1993 and more significantly over the medium-term. This
objective will be achieved by privatizing certain activities, transferring
others to local governments, and increasing the cost-effectiveness of
activities that it will continue to finance and administer. The reduction in
4The Consolidated State Budget includes the State Budget, the Social
Security Fund, and the Housing Fund, and excludes other Extrabudgetary Funds
and Local Governments.



17
exponditures will permit taxes. including those on private businesses, to be
reduced, thus generating faster economic growth.
44.         Social security expenditures including pensions, health care and
pharmaceuticals, sick pay, and maternity and child care benefits, comprise
almost 33 percent of C8B expenditures. Theae expenditureo are financed by
high contrSbution rates (43 percent of the wage bill for employers, 10 percent
of wages for employees), which increase the coat of hiring labor and weakens
Eungary's international competitiveness. Significant reforms in many of these
important social security programs, described in detail below (para. 68-71),
will be introduced beginning in 1992, which will permit some reduction in the
rate of social security contribution in the medium-term, and more substantial
reduction in the longer-term.
4S.         Subsidies, including those for consumers, producers, enterprise
investments and housing, account for another 18 percent of CSB expenditures,
or 9 percent of GDP. Under SAL 1, based on detailed analysis of the structure
of subsidies and their incidence, the Government embarked on an ambitious
multi-year program to reduce these subsidies, which were cut from 13 percent
of GDP in 1989 to 9 percent in 1990. T*ie level of subsidies is to be reduced
to no more than 7 percent of GDP in 1991, and to no more than 5 percent in
1992 and 4 percent by 1993. These cuts will be associated with important
changes in the structure of subsidies.
46.         In addition to improving financial discipline, the Government's
subsidy reduction program promotes important structural reforms. In early
1991, the reduction of interest rate subsidies for housing purchase lessened
the adverse impact of interest rate increases on the state budget, thus making
it possible to remove most ceilings on household deposit interest rates, an
essential step in fully integrating the financial system. Also in 1991,
budgetary subsidies for household energy were reduced substantially, and these
are to be entirely eliminated by the end of the 1991-92 heating season in
April 1992. This will encourage efficient energy consumption and contribute
to improving the environment (para. 78). Further phasing out of subsidies for
enterprise investments in the competitive sectors of the economy will improve
investment project selection and productivity. Production subsidies for coal
and other mining, and interest rate subsidies for agr4cultural producers will
be eliminated in 1991. In 1992, the reduction in the level of subsidies to 5
percent of GDP (from 7 percent of GDP in 1991) will be associated with further
real cuts in housing subsidies and enterprise investment subsidies in the
competitive sector, and the elimination of household energy subsidies after
the 1991-92 heating season.
47.         Prior to the release of the second tranche of SAL 2. the level of
subsidies would be reduced by an additional Ft. 20 billion (measured in 1981
lriceso. or by 2 percent of GDP comg ared to the 1990 olanned level. to no more
than 7 nercent of GDP. Furthermore. the Government would reaffirm its
commitment to further cuts in subsidies in 1992-93. limitina their level to no
MnrM  thal 5 percent of GDP in 1992 (includina a maximum of Ft. 3 billion for

92 would involve the elimination of production subsidies for coal and mining,



is
beef, fertiliter, household energy subsidies after the 1991-92 heating season,
and interest rate subsidies for agriculture, and further real cuto in housing
subsidies and enterprise lnvestment subsLdies in the competitive sectors.
48.         Transfers to Central Budgetary Znstitutions (CBIs) represented 18
percent of 1990 CAB expenditures. Most of the transfer is allocated for
family allowances (43 percent), education (16 percent), adminlstration and law
and order (9 percent), cultural services (5 percent), and business services,
medical servlces, scientific research, and other community services (4 percent
each). The Government's aim is to reduce State Budget transfers to CDIs
through efficiency improvements brought about by privatization, by increasing
the role of the private sector in the provison of goods and services now
provided by the state through the CBIs, and by the wlder application of user
fees. Already in 1991, the Government expects to privatize some applied
research actlvitles, and permit the formatlon of muttual health insurance
organliations, and in 1992, to increase the use of user fees in the provision
of health care. A real reductlon in State Budget transfers to the CBIs is
expected to be achieved in 1992 through the greater application of such
measures. In cooperation with the World Bank, a study of the reform and
decentralizatLon of state expenditures will be completed and used to identify
concrete actions to achieve this target.  Prior to the release of the second
tranche. an action nlan. _ncl"dina orivatization of certain activities

imolementatLon of the action 2lan will be a condition for, release of the thi_rd
tranche of SAL 2.
49.         Transfers to local governments represented 11 percent of 1990 CSB
expenditures. Through the process of decentralization, the Government intends
to transfer greater autonomy and responsibllity from thb level of state
govrnment to the local governments. The 1990 Act on Local Governments
transferred ownership rights to some property to the local governments and
empowered them to introduce various taxes. In 1991, the Government will
present to Parliament an Act on Property of Local Government in order to
regulate the transfer of state property from the state government to the local
governments. Measures to encourage prudent management of the assets of local
governments, lncluding appropriate pricing of locally supplied public goods,
will be adopted. Some pricing authority, notably for local transport tariffs
and houslng rents, was transferred to the local governments in 1990. In 1992,
the local governments' price-setting authority will be increased further to
cover all locally produced public utility goods and services (including water
and sewerage fees and district heating tariffs).
SO.         Transfers to Extrabudgetary Funds (iFs) represented 6 percent of
1990 CSB expenditures. There are 29 EFe. As part of the Government's
budgetary reform, starting in 1992, BFs performing vital tasks will be
integrated into the State Budget or regulated by separate laws, or their tasks
transferred to local governments or privatized. All other EFe will be
eliminated, and, if financed by a tax or a contribution, the tax or
contribution will also be eliminated. From 1992, no new EFs will be created
except by separate law. Based on the study referred to above (para. 48),
concrete action. will be identified and implemented to reduce State Budget
transfers to EFs in real terms in 1992. Prior to the release of the sec0on

51.         The reduct.4on in expenditures of the CS8 would permit lowering
taxes, which would improve the business environment. The tax burden on
enterprises will be reduced with the introduction of a modern system of
depreciation of capital assets in 1992, when the new Accounting Law takes
effect. The cost of capital to enterprises will also be reduced by increasing
the rebate of value added tax on capital goods to 100 percent from January
1992. The Government will continue its efforts to make the EPT more neutral
by reducing tax preferences. Also from 1992, changes will be introduced in
the personal income tax PIT that will restructure the tax burden on Hlungarian
citizens. The top rate of tax will be lowered and the progressivity will be
reduced by widening tax brackets. The tax base will be expanded by including
some "wage-like* income (e.g., fringe benefits, family allowances, pensions)
currently not taxed. Important reforms to improve the structure of indirect
taxation will also be implemented in 1992. The zero rate of the VAT will be
eliminated (except for a very small number of services) and the top rate will
be reduced to at most 20 percent. These reforms, along with some
complimentary revisions in excises, will bring the VAT in conformity with the
recommendations made by the EC. Tax refgrm lggislation includina these
measures will be yresented to Parliament orior to the release of the second
tranche of SAL 2.
2. Intensification of Competition
52.         Trade Liberalgation.  Liberalization of foreign trade is an
important means for creating competition for domestic producers, which also
helps contain inflationary pressures. The Government's reform program calls
for a significant acceleration of trade liberalization. Starting January 1,
1991, a large part of Hungary's foreign trade, which was previously conducted
with CMEA countries under Government control, was liberalized. This trade now
takes place at world prices and in convertible currency without state
intervention. This liberalization is a major impetus to industrial
restructuring and enhanced competitiveness.   Also in 1991, licensing of
imports from the convertible currency markets was eliminated for almos;; 72
percent of domestic industrial production. In 1990, the corresponding figure
was 32 percent5. The acceleration of imnort libe_alization is accompanied by
another noteworthy change in the administration of the remaining import
licensest only products listed on a relatively small negative list (other than
5Under SAL 1, the Government was committed to eliminating import licenses
for about 60 percent of non-energy industrial production in 1991, and no less
than 70 percent in 1992.



20
armments, drugs, and precious metals, the main product groups in the list
include textiles, leather, certain chemicals, telecommunication equipment, and
agricultural products) will require licenses and all other products would be
free from import licenses.
53.         The Government is committed to further import liberalization.
Prior to gecod traAIhe release, imaort licensing would be eliminated for at
leajt 80G ercent of industrial oroduction 11988 gtoduction weiahts . The
remaining products, corresponding to 20 percent of industrial production, that
would require import licenses after 1992 consist mainly of processed food and
textile products, which are the subject of multilateral negotiations under the
auspices of the GATT. Subject to the conclusion of multilateral trade
negotiations with GATT partners, and EC-association negotiations, expected by
the end of 1991, the Government will gradually extend trade liberalization to
agriculture and food processing. In cooperation with the Bank, by November
1991, the Government will complete a study on effective protection as a basis
for deciding on whether to replace licenses with tariffs.
S4.         Licensing requirements for engaging in foreign trade were
eliminated in 1991 except for products licensed for health and safety reasons
(e.g., drugs, weapons). However, licenses are required for exporting products
on a negative list which account for 30 percent of total exports. This list
would be progressively reduced and products accounting for at least an
additional 5 percent of exports, and 3 percent of gross industrial and
agricultural production, would be taken off the list by January 1992. Other
than for health and safety reasons, licensing would remain largely for exports
of goods covered by international agreements (steel, textiles, food and
agricultural products) and certain energy products (petroleum, natural gas,
and mineral fuels).
55.         A global quota is maintained on consumer goods imports.  The value
of the quota was increased from $200 million in 1990 to $630 million in 1991,
and the coverage was reduced to a subset of products (primarily processed
foods and ready-to-wear apparel) for which import licensing is required.
About half of consumer goods imports are still subject to the quota. In line
with it. objective of eliminating the quota, the Government intends to
progressively relax the quota on imports of consumer goods.   Prior to the
release of the second tranche of SAL 2. the share in 1988 aross industrial
groduction of consumer aoods that are subiect to import agotas would be
reduced from 15 cercent to no more than 10 percent. and the value of the auota
would be raised to at least S750 million.
56.         Hungary acceded to the GATT in 1973.  Eighty-three percent of its
tarlff lines are bound and cannot be increased unilaterally without offering
compensation to GATT-member trading partners. Following the tariff reductions
resulting from the Tokyo Round negotiations, Hungary's average tariff
decreased from 36 percent in 1973 to 16 percent. In the context of the
Uruguay Round, tariff rates were unilaterally reduced by Hungary in 1991
which resulted in lowering the average nominal tariff to 13 percent. The
Government expects that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
negotiations will lead to a further decrease in overall tariff protection, and
in the dispersion of protection.



21
57.          rice Liberalization.  To ensure that relative prices reflect
scarcities and allocate resources efficiently, administrative controls on
prices must be eliminated. With the majority of domestic producers subject to
competition from imports in 1991, most prices have been liberalized.
Effective January 1991, almost 90 percent of consumer goods prices was free.
Central control on prices remain only for textbooks, one type of milk, one
type of white bread, railway tariffs, basic postal and telephone charges,
drinking water and sewerage, electricity, coal and coal products, natural gas,
firewood, and district heating; local governments set local transport tariffs
and housing rents on government, and some privately owned flats. The Price
Office, which was responsible for controlling prices, ceased to exist since
January 1991.
58.         Energy consumption in Hungary is high and inefficient, encouraged
by historically low energy prices relative to economic costs. In the context
of the Energy Development Project, an agreement was reached with the Bank that
household prices would be raised to the level of economic costs by 1991 for
several important energy carriers, and no later than 1993 for the remainder.
Household energy prices were raised by varying amounts up to more than 90
percent in 1990 and regional variations in household electricity prices were
removed. In early 1991, the Government eliminated controls on retail prices
of all petroleum products except LPG (diesel, gasoline, fuel oil), and further
increased the price of household electricity by 50 percent in February 1991.
In June 1991, the consumer prices of coal, firewood, natural gas and district
heating were raised by 176 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent, and 70 percent
respectively. Prices of firewrood, coal, and LPG and imports of these
products, will be liberalized in 1991. With the most recent price increase
for district heating, the consumer subsidy was cut by about half. Prior to
release of the third tranche of SL4 2. all remaininat subsidies will bew
comolete&v eliminated by devolvino pric=e-sttiVS authoritv for dsrc
heatina to local aovernments. Thus. the 1992 State Budoet would include an
allocation not exceedino Ft. 3 billion exclusively for district heatina for
the early months of 1992. Also. Drior to release of the third tranche. the
Government will implement the aareed new tariff structures for electricity and
natural aas. and formulae for maintainina central aovernment administered
sneray prce. telectricitv. natural aas) at economic cost level.
59.         Financial Discioline and Exit of Enter2rises.  To intensify
domestic competition, a credible threat of takeover or liquidation is
necessary to force insolvent enterprises to restructure and become efficient.
During 1990, the Government took various measures to tighten financial
discipline and to facilitate restructuring or closure of insolvent
enterprises. These included adherence to a tight monetary policy, reduction
of fiscal expenditures, including production and investment subsidies to
enterprises, increased competition from imports, and the sharp reduction in
licenses granted for exports to the CMEA market. To further speed up the
process, the Government encouraged three of the major commercial banks to
initiate liquidation procedures against client enterprises in arrears.
Liquidation procedures were initiated against 453 enterprises between January
and December 1990. These enterprises employed more than 141,000 employees in
1989 and had assets worth Ft 165 billion (about $2.5 billion). However, the



22
slow pace of reforms in the financial sector continued to undermine financial
discipline.
60.         The acceleration of reforms, including further cuts in subsidies
to state enterprises, increased competition from imports and the growth of the
private sector, and the projected further contraction in regional export
markets and domestic demand, are expected to put considerable pressure on
state enterprises to restructure. In addition, further measures are envisaged
to speed up restructuring and liquidation of insolvent enterprises. First, in
1991 bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated against any enterprise with tax
or social security contribution arrears of more than three months. Second, a
new Bankruptcy Law, which will become effective January 1, 1992, will
accelerate bankruptcy proceedings by permitting, and in certain cases,
requiring, self-liquidation of insolvent enterprises and by encouraging the
commercial banks to be more aggressive in initiating court action against
enterprises in arrears. Third, the number of courts competent to handle the
increasing number of bankruptcy cases will be increased.
61.         Restructuring plans for the coal mining and ferrous metallurgy
sectors, which were developed in cooperation with the Bank, are being adhered
to. Nine coal mines have been closed in the last two years, and another 11
will be closed by 1995, most of them in 1991-92. An equal number of mines are
being rehabilitated. The Government has also begun implementing an action
plan for improving the efficiency of the construction sector, including the
privatization of large state construction enterprises and support for private
companies. In addition, accelerated programs for privatization and
restructuring will be implemented for companies particularly hard hit by the
contraction of trade with the CMEA countries.
62.         Reform of the financial system is necessary to strengthen
financial discipline. Thus far, commercial banks have been reluctant to
initiate liquidation procedures against enterprises in arrears because of the
adverse impact this would have on their balance sheets, a fact which also
undersecres the inadequacies in the regulations governing provisioning for
doubtful debts. As discussed below (para. 66), improved prudential regulation
and banking supervision, and increased competition in retail banking from
foreign banks, should discourage banks from making loans to insolvent
enterprises. The new Accounting Law, which will become effective January 1,
1992, will introduce internationally accepted accounting standards and
procedures. The resulting transparency in financial conditions in enterprises
and banks should lead to greater accountability.
3. rinanclal sector Reform
63.         Until recently, the financial system remained fragmented,
preventing the flow of resources from households to enterprises. The main
reason for this fragmentation lay in the system of housing finance, whereby
any increase in interest rates on deposits of households led automatically to
higher budgetary expenditures on subsidized housing loans. To control these
expenditures, ceilings were maintained on interest rates of household
deposits. These ceilings discouraged savings mobilization and constrained the



23
ability of the National Savings Bank (NSB), which catered to the household
sector, from competing with other commercial banks.
64.         Interest rates on pre-1989 housing loans were raised in 1991, and
ceilings on interest rates on household deposits of longer than six months
maturity were eliminated in January 1991. Except for ceilings on interest
rates on sight deposits and time deposits of up to six months maturity, all
other interest rates are now freely determined.
65.         To promote competition in commercial and retail banking, in 1990,
the Government granted licenses for retail banking to two foreign banks, and
intends to continue this policy in the future. There will also be further
decentralization of foreign exchange transactions.
66.         To strengthen the efficiency of the financial system and to
prevent banks from allocating new credits to insolvent clients, further
changes are necessary in the prudential regulatory framework for commercial
banks. In the context of the Financial Systems Modernization Project (FSMP,
FY91), the Bank provided technical assistance to the authorities in
elaborating a new Banking Law which was presented to Parliament in June 1991,
and will become effective on January 1, 1992 when the new Accounting Law also
becomes effective. This law introduces internationally accepted prudential
regulations including in particular regulations on interlocking ownership,
capital adequacy, loan classification criteria, and creation of pre-tax loss
reserves. The law also requires banks to build up adequate risk reserve
provisioning within a maximum period of three years. A supplementary
provision to the Accounting Law will prohibit recognition of interest income
from no:--performing loans. Until such time as the new regulations take
effect, the Government, as a major shareholder, encourages commercial banks to
build up their risk reserves out of their 1990 profits, and to keep dividend
payments within limits.
67.         The results of the recently completed audits of the three largest
wholesale banks revealed problems that require urgent attention in at least
some of these banks. The Government is elaborating a strategy and action
plan to correct the problems identified by the audits. Based on this action
plan, which will ensure that banks are placed on a sound position, with
transparent accounting, to be agreed with the Bank before end of June 1991,
the Government will take measures before the end of 1991 to correct the
weaknesses identified in the audits so that deviations in individual banks
from capital adequacy guidelines contained in the new Banking Law are
corrected as quickly as possible.
4. Develownent of Social Safety Net
68.         Hungary is a middle-income country, and poverty is limited to
about 10 percent of the population.  The living standards of the population
have been steadily declining in the last two years, and this trend is likely
to continue in the next two years as industrial restructuring results in
significantly larger unemployment. However, the resolute implementation of
the reforms initiated by the Government will generate sustainable economic



24
growth in the medium-term and allow living standards, including those of the
poor, to improve. The restructuring of the public finances, especially the
reduction of payroll taxes and contributions (for social security as well as
those earmarked for EFs) is expected to increase labor absorption and
stimulate job creation. The reduction of inflation, for which sound demand
management and policies to increase competitive pressures in the economy are
indispensable, will benefit the entire population. The Government recognizes,
nevertheless, that there will be social costs during the transition and social
needs over the longer term that will have to be provided for. In general,
spending on social programs has been relatively high but inefficient.
Considerable efforts are needed to improve these programs and to target them
to those most in need, thus increasing their effectiveness within the overall
goal of reducing the size of State Budget expenditures by six percentage
points of GDP by 1993 and by more thereafter (para. 43).
69.         Spending on social programs, including social security, education,
housing, family allowances, and social benefits in cash and kind, represented
one-third of GDP, one-half of household income, and two-thirds of CSB
expenditures in 1990. Despite the high level of spending, the existing
programs of unemployment assistance, old age and disability pensions, family
allowances, and health, education and housing services are inadequate,
especially for the poor. In addition, expenditures are financed by a very
high rate of employer contribution (43 percent of payroll), which discourages
hiring of labor and reduces international competitiveness. The high
proportion of social transfers in household Income also blunts the incentive
to work. The growing need for basic social services and protection for the
poor, and the continued pressure on public finances, require a fundamental
restructuring of the major social welfare programs.
70.         Pensions accounted for 30 percent of total social expenditures in
1990. The existing pension scheme is actuarially unsound, encourages early
retirement, and does not guarantee adequate pensions to maintain a minimum
standard of living for the elderly. These deficiencies will be addressed in a
comprehensive way when a new pension system is introduced from the beginning
of 1992. Conditions for eligibility will be tightened by raising the minimum
retirement age of women to equal that of men by the year 2000, raising the
standard retirement age (when full pensi.on benefits are granted) for both
sexes, and changing the pension formula to provide incentives for later
retirement. The reforms will entail a reduction in the level of initial
pensions, but they will be indexed to preserve their real value relative to
wage income. Along with the limit on the maximum value of pension for future
retirees, private supplementary pension schemes will be encouraged. Despite
the effects of demographic and other factors that create a pressure to
increase the pension contribution rate, these reforms are expected to permit a
reduction in the rate over the medium-term, thus enhancing Hungary's
competitiveness.  Draft leaislation containina these orovosals would be
presented to Parliament grior to second tranche release and the changes in the
pension system are expected to be effective starting from January 1, 1992.
71.         Major reforms will also be implemented in the financing of
sickness benefits, which represent 4 percent of total social expenditures.
Hungary has one of the highest number of compensated sick days in the



25
ildustrialised world. Partly this is the result of the financing system --
employers pay only the first three days of sick leave and the remaining leave
(up to a maxlmum of one year) is financed by the Social Security Fund. In
1992, the employers' share in financing sick leave will be increased to at
least the first 3 weeks. This change will result in further lowering the
social security contribution rate. Pregentation to Parllament of draft
egisrlation to increase the emolovers hare in linancina sick leave to at
leasnt the first 3 weeks is a condition for releaee of th thlird tranche of SAL
72.         Health care and pharmaceuticals, which are also financed
predominantly by the Social Security fund, account for 14 percent of total
social expenditures. There are few incentives for consumers to use health
care resources efficiently, or for health care providers to make services more
cost-effective. In 1991, steps were taken to introduce cost-consciousness
among consumers and providers of health care and other measures will be
introduced in 1992. The health and pharmaceutical expenditures of the social
security fund will be separated into a National Health Insurance Fund (NHIP)
in January 1992. A bill containing these proposals will be presented to
Parliament in the third quarter of 1991 and the reforms will be effective from
January 1, 1992.
73.         Family assistance comprises another 9 percent of social
expenditures, and maternity and child care benefits in cash equal another 3
percent. The system of cash benefits, which are paid by the state to
families, is one of the most generous in Europe. Since a considerable
proportion of these expenditures goes to families with higher incomes, an
important direction of reform is to improve the targeting of support on those
families with lower incomes. Measures to reform family-related benefits will
be presented to Parliament during 1991 and implemented on January 1, 1992.
74.         Following the decentralization of government in 1990, many
programs of social assistance and social services are administered and
partially financed by local governments. In 1991, the Government will submit
to Parliament a Social Assistance Program, which will establish transparent,
publicized, and well-targeted eligibility criteria for provision of minimum
social assistance benefits, and establish a cost-sharing arrangement between
the state and the local governments. Social assistance benefits will continue
to be administered by local governments, which are best equipped to administer
them efficiently.
75.         The provision and maintenance of adequate housing is primarily a
matter for the private sector and the Government's role in this sector is
expected to diminish. Nevertheless, as local governments raise rents on
state-owned flats to market levels, some individuals may not be able to afford
the high rates. By 1992, the Government will either introduce a nation-wide
housing allowance program, or it will encourage local self-government bodies
to develop their own housing allowance programs to provide a safety net for
the poor.
76.         As industrial restructuring intensified during 1990, the number of
unemployed rose sharply, from about 30,000 at the beginning of the year to



26
80,000 (1.6 percent of labor force) by end of the year. The number of
unemployed in projected to rise to 250,000 (5 percent of labor force) by end
of 1991. To cope with these problems, and to be better able to finance the
growing need for unemployment compnsation, an unemployment insurance scheme
(Solidarity Fund), financed by the State Budget and employer and employee
contributions, was established ln 1991. The Fund also finances the operation
and development of the network of labor market services, and certain elements
of employment policy (retraining schemes, unemployment benefits for school-
leavers, and early retirement benefLts). Workers that contribute to the Fund
are eligible for benefits for a maximum of two years. The amount of
compensation is 70 percent of the previous wage Lncome in the first year, and
50 percent in the following year. Workers who are not eligible for
unemployment insurance will be covered by retraining schemes, public works, or
other social assistance. in 1991, the Government will review the functLoning
of the unemployment insurance system and the adequacy of its financing. The
review will concentrate on the length of the eligibility period, the
condLtions of elLgibilLty, the size of the unemployment contribution, the
modification of the early retirement system, and the Lntroduction of
unemployment benefits for part-time workers. Based on the results of the
revlew, as well as on continuous monitoring of the system, beginning Ln 1992
the Government will implement needed modiflcations to insure that the
unemployment insurance scheme is financially vlable and effective.
77.         To address long-term structural unemployment, the Government will
rely principally on measures to improve the operatlon of the labor market, and
upgrade labor retraining programs. To facilitate the re-entry of workers into
the work force, the Government intends to improve adult retraining and
education services to create a work force better suited to a market economy.
a National Training Council was established in 1991 to promote occupational
mobility and employment by defining policy for the provision of regional adult
training programs. In the area of labor retraining, the Government recognizes
that private enterprises ln growth sectors should play a leading role. In
1991, some training services were contracted out to the private sector. To
improve occupational training for adults, regional labor development centers
will be established with effective linkages to the regional economy and labor
market. Vocational training schools are also being reformed to provide the
youth a broader training in clusters of occupational skills. To promote the
development of an integrated labor market, the system of labor exchanges are
being upgrade, which will improve the collection, analysis and diffusion of
labor market information -- efforts supported by the recently approved Bank
financed Human Resources Project.
78.         The Government considers it essential that environmental
deterioration be stopped in the interest of sustainable economic development
and to improve the quallty of life. To thie end, it will encourage efficient
energy consumption through appropriate pricing, and control pollution through
fees, fines, and other methods for encouraging the use of environmentally
sound products. In this spirit, in 1991 lower customs duties were imposed on
imported automobiles fitted with catalytic converters, on converters
themselves, and on other goods that improve or protect the environment.

PAR  I! -        PROPOSER LOAN
A.   Lan Fetueg and Imolentation
79.         The Lending Instruments The Government's medium-term economic
reform program represents an acceleration and deepening of the wide-ranging
program of structural reforms that the Government initiated last year and the
Bank supported through SAL 1 (para. 81). This acceleration was necessary to
respond to the adverse impact of external shocks, notably the transformation
of CKEA trade ln the beginning of 1991, on Hungary's balance of payments.
Dqpite a significant domestic adjustment, additional quick disbursing
financlal assistance from the Bank and other sources is necessary to bridge
the financing gap and permit the momentum of reforms to be sustained. The
proposed SAL 2 would be an appropriate instrument to provide the needed
contlnued support. Subsequent reform actions in privatization and industrial
restructuring would be supported through the proposed FY92 Enterprise
Restructuring and Privatization Project.
S0.         Loan Design and ComMonents: The proposed SAL 2 would support the
accelerated implementation of reforms to establish a competitive market
ecnomy in Hungary. Within a sound macro-economic framework, the four main
components of the Government's program supported by the proposed SAL 2 are:
(i)   reduction of the role of the state in the economy -- as an owner
of productive assets, in its capacity to intervene
administratively in resource allocation, and in the size of
redistribution of resources affected by the government through
taxes and transfers;
(li) intensification of competition through further import and domestic
price liberallzation, promotion of entry of small and medium
enterprises, implementation of effective anti-trust action against
enterprlses exercising non-competitive practices, and tightening
of financial discipline;
(LiL) financial sector reform, through further liberalization,
implementation of improved prudential regulation and tlghter
supervison, and restructuring of insolvent banks; and
(iv) establishing financially viable, well-targeted, and efficient
programs of soclal assistance to alleviate the social costs of
adjustment in the short-term and to meet social needs over the
longer term.
81.          The Government's reform program which the proposed SAL 2 would
support, represents a considerable deepening and acceleration of reforms
lnitiated under SAL 1 in the following areas:
(i)   an ambitious privatization program has been developed.
This program which was initiated under SAL 1 aime at
prlvatizing 35-40 percent of buslness assets by 1993.



28
(U.)  foreign trade liberalization was furtner acceleratedg
by 1992, at least 80 percent of industrial production
would be free of import licenslng and liberalization
would be initiated in the agriculture sector by the
end of 1991. Under SAL 1, the target was to eliminate
import licensing for 70 percent of non-energy
industrial production by 1992* The Government is also
committed to further liberalization of the global
quota on consumer goods quota with a view to its
eventual elimination. Combined with the immediate
transformation of ex-CMEA trade to international
prices and convertible currencies in 1991 - as opposed
to an initial 3 year transition period - this implies
a quantum leap in overall trade liberalization and
opening up of the economy to external competition.
(iii) almost 90 percent of consumer prices were liberalized
at the beginning of 1991. Under SAL 1 there was a
general commitment to further liberalize prices in
1991-92. The Government has also agreed under the
proposed SAL 2 to set remaining centrally administered
prices for energy carriers (electricity, natural gas)
to reflect economic efficiency criteria.
(iv) consistent with reforms to reduce the role of the
state budget in allocating resources, the Government
has set an explicit target of reducing the ratio of
the consolidated state budget expenditures to GDP by 6
percentage points by 1993. This is to be achieved by
further cuts in subsidies under SAL 2, the subsidy
reduction program agreed under SAL 1 was extended to
1993) and by rationalizing transfers to C8Is and EFs.
Specific actions to achieve these objectives, which
were not covered in SAL 1, will be agreed upon under
SAL 2.
(v)   the proposed SAL 2 also includes specific reforms of
direct and indirect taxes, which were not explicitly
included in SAL 1.
(vi) finally, the proposed SAL 2 supports the comprehensive
reform of the pension, and health care and sick pay
financing system. Under SAL 1, interim measures were
introduced in preparation for the initiation of the
comprehensive reform package in 1992.
82.          Loan Amount and Borrgwer:  The 1991-92 balance of payments
financing requirement, estimated at $8.2 billion, would justify a SAL of $250
million (and cofinancing by JEXIM).  Despite the good implementation of
economic reforms last year, and the significant improvements achieved in the
current account balance in convertible currencies, the virtual collapse of
CNEA trade in the beginning of 1991 imposes a severe burden on Hungary's



29
balance of payments (para. 25). Hungary responded by accelerating and
deepening its reform program, and domestic adjustment requiring a cumulative 9
percent decline in private consumption in 1990-91, is being effected through
policy changes. Since, in these circumstances, further domestic adjustment
would be socially very difficult and politically unsustainable, additional
external support li also needed. Despite Hungary's good performance thus far,
commercial banks still appear reluctant to maintain their (high) level of
exposure, due partly to the uncertainties in the entire region. Therefore,
additional financial assistance from official sources, including the Bank and
the IMF, is needed to bridge the financing gap. Based on plausible
assumptions of external financing from other sources (Table 4), a Bank loan of
$250 million would be needed to close the likely remaining gap. Together with
the already approved Telecommunication Project ($150 million) and the Human
Resources Project ($150 million), the level of Dank commitments in FY91 would
reach $550 million, and disbursements in CY91 would be around $450 million
($337 million net). The loan would be made to the NBH and will be guaranteed
by the Government of the Republic of Hangary. The proceeds of the loan will
be administered and disbursed by the NBH.

foreign exchange cost of general imports, except those goods financed from
other sources and a specific list of excluded goods such as military and para-
military items, luxury goods, nuclear reactors and parts, and uranium. The
foreign exchange made available through the loan would be used by enterprises.
84.         PcuMents Procurement under SAL 2 would be carried out as
follows:
(a)   for large value contracts (exceeding $5 million) of the
public and private sectors, simplified International
Competitive Bidding (ICD) procedures will be followed.



30
(b)   public sector procurement valued below the ICU threshold may
be carried out following the standard procedures of the
purchasing institutions, which have been examined and found
acceptable to the Bank.
(c)   private sector purchases valued below the ICB threshold may
follow established commercial practice. Wherever possible,
quotations from eligible suppliers from at least two
countries would be sought (except where direct contracting
is appropriate).
(d)   special procedureo applicable to the respective commodity
markets would be followed for procurement of commodities
traded in international commodity markets. However, these
procedures would not exclude other channels of competitive
procurement that may offer better delivered prices and be
acceptable to the Bank, such as ICB, locally advertised
bidding, or international shopping linking the delivered
prices offered to those quoted in the relevant commodity
markets at the time of delivery.
a5.         As the Bank has approved standard bidding documents to be used in
Hungary, there would be no further reviews by Bank staff of particular bidding
documents or procurement decisions prior to contact awards, to avoid delaying
transactions.
86.         Disbursements: The proceeds of the loan would be administered and
disbursed by the NBH. Disbursements from the loan account would be made
against 100 percent of the cost of eligible imports. Withdrawal applications
for disbursements on contracts of goods procured under ICB would be fully
documented. In .11 other cases, disbursements will be made on the basis of
Statement of E3 ;enditures (SOE) from NBB detailing individual transactions in
a given period, and certification of payment and of eligibility of the
transactions for loan financing. Supporting documentation for disbursements
under S0Es will be retained by NBH until at least 12 months after the closing
of the loan account. To facilitate disbursements, a special account will be
established at NBH; the initial deposit will be $20 million. Retroactive
financing of $S50 million (20 percent of the total loan) for expenditures
incurred after March 1, 1991, is proposed. This retroactive financing will
(a) help finance imports of goods and services urgently needed; and (b) is
justified by the up-front actions already taken by the Government on key
elements of the structural adjustment program. The loan closing date will be
December 31, 1992.
87.         The loan would be disbursed in three tranches.  The first tranche
of $100 million will be available upon effectiveness, expected in July 1991,
and the second and third tranches, each of $75 million, will be released
upon fulfillment of the conditions indicated in para. 91 below, expected by
about January 1992 and August 1992 respectively.
88.         Accounts and Audits: NBH would maintain records of all
transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices.



31
All accounts (includLng the special account) would be audited within six
months of the end of the fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the
Dank. Audit reports would include a separate opinion on clalme submitted to
the Bank on the basls of SOEs and would state whether the claims were made in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement.
89.         M2onitogin and Imolementation: The NBH and the Ministry of Finance
would be responsible for monitoring implementation of the reform program. The
World Bank would monitor the implementation of the reform program in general,
and the specific actions agreed upon under the SAL, through semi-annual
reviews as well as ln the context of preparation and supervision of other
projects. For monitoring, appropriate indLcators have been identified and
precise targets established wherever possible. The impact of reforms on the
economy would also be monitored and this information utllized to take
corrective measures if warranted. Information on these lndicators would be
made avallable to the Bank perlodically.
B.    Conditions for Nflectiveness. and Second and Third Tranche Release
90.         Several important policy reforms have already been implement-d
since the beginning of 1991, during the course of preparation of the proposed
loan. These include:
(i) acceleration of import competition in 1991 by eliminating
import licensing for 72 percent of industrial production
compared to earlier target of 60 percentt
(iL) elimination of price control for almost 90 percent of
consumer prices, compared to about 77 percent in 1990a
(iiL) elimination of ceilings on interest rates on household
deposits of maturities longer than six months;
(iv) increase in natural gas prices by 50 percent, district
heating rates by 70 percent, and firewood pricees by 25
percent; and commitment by Government to liberalize coal,
firewood and LPG prices in 19911 and
(v) presentation to Parliament of satisfactory Banking Law.
In view of these actions, no special conditions of effectiveness are
proposed.
91.         The release of the second and third tranche of the loan will be
based on the following actions and results:
Conditions for second Tranchee Reease (expected January 1992 
1.    satisfactory macroeconomic performance based on agreed indicators and
targets for 1991 (Attachment 1 of LDP); and agreement on 1992 budget and

2.    Elimination of import licensing for at least 80 percent of industrial
production (1988 production weights).
3.    Further relaxation of the global quota on consumer goods imports by
increasing the value of the quota to at least $750 million, and reducing
the share of consumer goods outside the global quota from 15 percent of
1988 gross industrial production in 1991 to no more than 10 percent.
4.    Reduction in CSB subsidies in 1991 by at least 2 percentage points of
GDP over 1990 planned level, or Ft. 20 billion at 1981 prices, and
commitment, reflected in 1992 CSB, to: (i) reduce subsidies by a further
2 percentage points of GDP over 1991 planned levell and (ii) reduce
household energy subsidies to a maximum of Ft. 3 billion.
5.    Commitment, reflected in 1992 CSB, to reduce transfers to CRIs in real

charges (e.g., in health and education).
6.    Commitment, reflected in 1992 CSB, to reduce transfers to EFs in real
terms and to reduce the number of unregulated ZFs; agrement with the
Bank on concrete actions to achieve these objectives, including
eliminating some IFs (together with earmarked taxes or contributions
financing ZFs that are eliminated), privatizing some of their tasks, or
transferring tasks to local governments; and either in'.egrating other
SF. with the State Budget, or regulating them by separate Laws.
7.    Presentation to Parliament of draft legislation on new pension system
including, among other changes, tightened eligibility by raising the
minimum retirement. age of women to equal that of men by year 2000;
raising the standard retirement age (when full pensions are granted);
and changing the pension formula to induce later retirement by
individuals.
8.    Presentation to Parliament of tax reform legislation including:

cost levels.
6.   Presentation to Parliament of draft legislation on reform of
health care and sick pay financing, including shifting
responsibility for at least the first 3 weeks of employee sick pay
to the employer.
C.    Benefits and Risks
92.         The main benefit of the reforms is the improved prospects for
sustained economic growth and rising living standards in the medium-term.
This growth will occur because of increased productivity that a competitive
market economy will generate, and also because of the increased access to
external capital, modern technology and management skills that improvements in
external creditworthiness and macroeconomic stability will facilitate.
93.         The risks to the program have been discussed above (paras. 29-
31). To summarize, there are external risks and risks from policy slippage.
Hungary can do little to influence developments in the Soviet Union, the world
prices of major commodities, or interest rates, and can only minimize their
impact by adhering to LJund demand management policies and by accelerating
structural reforms. This is also the only sure way Hungary can retain the
confidence of private/commercial sources of external financing on whom it
heavily relies.  Hungary's good debt servicing record of the past and its
continued commitment to meet all its debt service obligations on time should
also strengthen the confidence of external creditors. The strong
implementation of stabilization policies and structural reforms in 1990, and



34
the positive rosults that were achieved, enabled Hungary to access commercial
souroe of financing even in an unfavorable regional climate. Good policy
implementation in 1990 also gives grounds for optLmism that correct policies
will contlnue to be lmplemented and that polLcy slippages will be minimal.
The Government appears to have maintained the confidence of the population as
seen by the wage restraLnt exercised so far by flrms. Further, the case for
economic reform has been bolstered by some of the positive effects the reform
has had on the population, including the greater cholce of goods in shops
resulting from import liberalization, and the fact that some prices, notably
the price of meat, declined in early 1991 as a result of the reforms.
D.   SgiSLa  Imat gf Adiustment
94.         The intensificatLon of structural reforms will in the short-term
adversely effect the living conditions of some segments of the population. As
already mentioned, industrial restructuring is projected to result in a
substantial Lncrease in unemployment, from less than 2 percent of the labor
force at the end of 1990 to about 5 percent by the end of 1991. Unemployment
among women, who constltute a large part of the labor force, may rise even
faster. The recent increases Ln admlnistered energy prices, and the proposed
elimination of household energy subsidies in 1992 will also cause hardship,
since expenditure on energy constitutes a large portLon of the household's
total consumption. The same is true of expenditures on housing, whlch are
expected to increase as rents for public housing are raised to market rates.
95.         The Government recognizes that the best way to provide for a
sustained improvement in living standards Ln the medLum-term is through
economlc growth, led by a dynamic prLvate sector, ln a climate of low
inflation. However, an adequate social safety net is necesary to protect the
poor and amelLorate the short-term costs of structural reforms. Several
masures have already been taken in this respect and a more comprehensive
reform of the social programs will be implemnted from the beginning of 1992
(paras. 68-77).
96.         The growth of new prlvate ventures that provlde employment
opportunlties is being encouraged (paras. 34-36). Flexible market-oriented
labor retrainlng schemes are belng introduced. The network of employment
exchanges are being strengthened to facilitate labor mobllity and absorption.
For those unable to find employment, unemployment insurance benefits are
available for a maximum of two years. Famlly assistance beneflts will be
better targeted to poorer families, and programs of socLal assistance and
social services administered by local governments will ensure a minimum level
of socLal assLstance beneflts for those ln greatest need. The Government will
also promote housing allowance programs to provide a safety net for the poor
who cannot afford market rents on publLc housing.

PAR? IV - COUNTA? ASS IBTANCR STRTGA   AND WORLD BANE GROUP OPERATIONS
A.A  &altanc 8tratay
97.         Since lending to Hungary began in 1983, the Bank's country
assistance strategy has focussed on supporting Hungarys efforts at creating a
market-oriented and competitive economy more conducive to private sector
development. This strategy was implemented mainly through a series of hybrid
loans for industrial restructuring, combining quick-disbursing funds to
support institutional and policy reform, and investment funds to support
restructuring at the enterprise and sub-sector levels. Investment loans in
other sectors, such as agriculture and transport, supported implementation of
sectoral economic reforms as well as improvements in efficiency at the
enterprise level. In 1987, the Bank stepped up its support of economic
reforms through an industrial sector adjustment loan. With the emergence of a
new Government after multi-party elections in April 1990, the momentum for
economic reforms accelerated. In June 1990, the Bank approved the first
structural adjustment loan (SAL 1) to Hungary in support of the Government's
comprehensive economic reform program. This support from the Bsank was crucial
in alleviating the critiQal foj6sign exchange shortage that threatened Hungary
in the first half of 1990. Implementation of the reform measures in 1990 was
satisfactory, and the Government has renewed its commitment to accelerating
these reforms further.
98.         The transformation and collapse of CMEA trading relations from the
beginning of 1991, combined with the lingering effects of the 1990 drought,
imposed a substantial additional burden on Hungary's balance of payments.
Hungary responded to this external shock by accelerating its reform program.
in view of the additional external resources necessary to sustain the momentum
of reform, the Bank has joined other official creditors in supporting Hungary
with the proposed second SAL.
99.         The Bank will continue to support private sector development.  In
the past, this support was provided in three principal ways. First, by
promoting reforms that ensure a neutral economic policy environment which does
not discriminate against private sector activity (e.g., foreign trade
liberalization, decontrol of prices, establishment of a transparent tax
system, elimination of restrictions on entry of new firms, elimination of
budgetary support for state enterprises, etc.). Second, by supporting the
development of institutions (banking system, securities market, a more
flexible labor market) and services (e.g., accounting and auditing) that
facilitate private sector growth. Finally, to complement the polliy and
institutional reform., in certain cases the Bank has supported the private
sector by targeting assistance to small and medium enterprises and farme (e.g,
in the Third Industrial Restructuring Project, Agricultural Export Development
Project). The IFC has played a more direct role in promoting joint ventures
with foreign partners, most recently through its participation in the first
foreign investment fund in Hungary (First Hungary Fund) and in the Suzuki
joint venture agreement finalized recently.



36
100.         The proposed SAL 2 supports reforms that further reduce the role
of the State in the economy, and increase the role of markets and the private
sector. The proposed FY92 Enterprise Restructuring and Privatization project
will support the privatization efforts of the Government.  In addition, other
future lending operations would deepen the implementation of structural
reforms, and promote the private sector in different sub-sectors of the
economy. The proposed FY92 Financial Systems Modernization project will
further strengthen the institutional and operational capabilities of the
financial sector (including banks, insurance industry, securities market) and
support the implementation of policy reforms necessary to increase its
efficiency in mobilizing and allocating resources. The proposed FY93
Transport sector operation would develop the transport infrastructure and
support policies that increase competition, including deregulation and
privatization of the trucking lndustry. The Bank's ongoing support to the
development of an efficient telecommunications network, which is vital for
business, will continue in the FY93 Telecom project. The proposed FY93
agriculture sector project would promote the introduction of modern business
practices in agriculture, and the development of the private sector, including
foreign joLnt ventures. Energy conservation measures, and environmental
protection policies, currently being identified in Bank sector work, will be
promoted through the proposed FY93 Energy and Environment project. The
proposed FY94 operations are expected to provide support for policy reforms
that may be necessary in the industrial sector and for the further development
of the health sector and human resources.
101.        In addition to its direct lending, the Bank will help Hungary
mobilize resources through officlal and commercial cofinancing. The JEXIM
cofinanced SAL 1 and has agreed in principle to cofinance the proposed SAL 2.
The Buropean Investmeut Bank (BIB) coflnanced the recently approved second
Telecommunieation project (FY 91). It ia also expected to cofinance proposed
projects in Energy/Environment and in Transportation. Opportunities for
cofinancing with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
will also be pursued. The Bank also approved the fLrst ECO in August 1990
which enabled Hungary to access a new market (the Eurodollar market) and
extend the maturity of its new borrowing. The BOO was a guarantee of 100
percent of the principal of a $200 million bond issue, which provided critical
support to the Government at a time when market access was llmited by investor
caution after Bulgaria's announcement of a moratorium on external debt
service.
102.        Besldes the lending operations, the Bank's assistance strategy
will be implemented through intenslve economlc and sector work and policy
dialogue on macroeconomic and sectoral pollcy issues. Recent economlc work on
the impact of the demise of the CMEA market was useful in elaborating the
macroeconomic framework for the proposed SAL 2. Economlc and sector work on
the social policy framework and in housing and human resources development
were instrumental in designing policy recommendations. The proposed economic
work on reforming the budget will inform our policy advise in that important
area. Economic and sector work wlll be supplemented by technlcal assistance
in external debt management, including risk and liabilitles management, and in
developing the institutional capacity to implement the systemic reforms,
especially in the areas of enterprise restructuring, development of the



37
private sector and privatization of enterprises, improvement of public sector
management, strengthening financial intermediation, development of human
resources and social dimensions of adjustment. Full coordination will be
maintained with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) on the development of foreign investment,
development of capital markets, and privatization.
B.    Summary of Bank Group Operations
103.        Hungary received its first loan in June 1983.  It joined the
International Development Association and the IFC in April 1985, and the MIGA
in 1988. It participated in the IDA VIII replenishment.
104.        The Bank, as of April 30, 1991, has provided 31 loans for a total
of $2,843.5 for 24 projects, six B-loans for $136.1 million and one ECO
operation for $200 million. of total commitments, 40 percent was in the
industrial sector, 20 percent in the agricultural sector, 11 percent in the
energy sector, 21 percent in the transport and telecommunications, and the
rest (8 percent) for general balance of payments oupport.
105.        The Bank was a successful catalyst in mobilizing six commercial
cofinancing syndications for Bank-assisted operatione from FY83 to FY85.
They helped to mobilize nearly $1.2 billion, including the Bank's contribution
of $136 million. In all these cofinancing operations, the Bank was able to
improve the terms on Hungarian borrowings and to introduce the country to
commercial banks from which it had not previously borrowed. The Bank's
participation in the B-loans was discontinued in 1985, when Hungary had
regained access to financial markets on reasonable terms. In 1990 at the
Government's request, the Bank assisted Hungary in entering a new financial
market (the Eurodollar bond market) and in increasing the final maturity of
the issue (to ten years) through the guarantee of principal for a $200 million
bond.
106.        Project implementation in general has been satisfactory, though
delays in disbursements occurred in 1990 because of the depressed domestic
economic situation and high nominal interest rates. Total disbursements as of
March 31, 1991 amounted to $1,694.5 million. The disbursement ratio (total
disbursements in a fiscal year divided by the undisbursed amount at the end of
the prevlous year) was about 45 percent in 1989, 20 percent in 1990, but is
expected to increase to 35 percent in 1991.
107.        IFC has investes  about $143.46 million in twelve projects in
Hungary.  A resident representative was recently appointed, and IFC is looking
actively for other investments in Hungary.
C.    Creditworthiness and Bank Exposure
108.        At the end of 1990, the Bank's share of Hungary's medium and long-
term (ILT) public and publicly-guaranteed debt disbursed and outstanding
amounted to 8.3 percent. Debt service payments on Bank debt amounted to 5.4



38
percent of the country's MLT debt service. Net disbursements and net
transfers from the Bank are expected to remain positive until 1993. The
Bank's share of MLT debt is expected to increase to 11 percent by 1995, then
decline to 8.4 percent by 2000. The share of MLT debt service to the Bank
will increase to 7.4 percent in 1995, then decline to 7.2 percent in 2000.
These indicators of Bank exposure remain comfortably within the Bank's
guidelines.
D.    Collaboration with Other Acencies
109.        The Bank and the IMF have maintained close cooperation during
pieparation of SAL 2. Parallel with the preparation of SAL 2, the IMF
negotiated an EA with the Hungarian Government. In preparation of the EA and
SAL 2, the Government, with the joint support of IMF and Bank staff,
formulated a medium-term reform program, summarized in the "Memorandum", which
was distributed to the Board on January 7, 1991.
110.        The JEXIM provided cofinancing of $200 million linked with SAL 1,
and has expressed its interest in similarly cofinancing SAL 2. Two JEXIM
staff members participated in the SAL 2 pre- appraisal mission in February
1991, and in the appraisal mission in April 1991.
111.        Close contact is maintained with the ES, wh:.c  provlded Hungary
with a $1 billion bridge loan to be used in 1990-92, thi   Xj countries, which
authorized up to $S500 million credit in 1991, and the 1,j which provided
cofinancing for the Second Telecommunications Project, approved by the Board
in September 1990, and has expressed interest in cofinancing arrangements with
other Bank projects. In addition, Bank staff maintain contact with
representatives of the AEBR, which also has expressed interest in the
cofinancing of Bank projects.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
112.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed loan.

Budapest .... May30  1991
Mr. Barber B. Conable
President
The World Bank
Washington D.C.
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Conable,
1.          I am writing this letter to request the World Bank for a second
structural adjustment loan (SAL 2) in support of our medium term economic
reform program, which was presented in our "Memorandum of Economic
Transformation and Medium Term Policies". This program, whose aim remains the
establishment of a modern European market economy, represents an acceleration
and further elaboration of the economic reforms the first SAL supported. The
program emphasizes private sector development, including privatization, a
reduced role of the state in the economy, and a strengthening of market
mechanisms. The development of physical and human infrastructure is also a
priority. The program seeks to moderate the rate of inflation to single
digits by 1993 and to maintain Hungary's traditional access to capital markets
by halting the growth of external debt within 3 years, while fully meeting its
debt obligations.
2.          This loan would come at a critical time for Hungary. The near
total collapse of exports to the Soviet Union in 1991, brought about by
developments over which we have little influence, is a great strain on our
external finances. Fortunately, world petroleum prices are lower than we had
earlier projected, or the risk to our solvency would have been greater. The
fragility of the situation is heightened by the fact that part of our external
financing program related to the utilization of accumulated surpluses with the
Soviet Union is unlikely to materialize. Thus, the SAL 2 would not only
support the acceleration of our economic reform program, but also is critical
to our financing plan, not least through the catalytic effect it would have on
improving our access to commercial sources of finance.
I. Rackarculnd ad Recent Zconomic Dev laoments
3.          In response to the growing macroeconomic instability, reflect.ed in
the accelerating rate of inflation and deteriorating external balance, and the
continuing economic stagnation, towards the end of 1989 and in early 1990, the
Government adopted policies to restore macroeconomic stability. These
polici$e were complemented by a wide-ranging program of structural reforms in
mid-1990. The stabilization program was supported by a Standby Arrangement
with the IMF and the World Bank provided a Structural Adjustment Loan in
support of the referm program.



ANNEX 2
46                           Page 2 of 25
4.          The stabilization and structural reform measures in 1990 resulted
in some important achievements, of which the most important was the
significant improvement in the current account balance in convertible
currencies. Despite unfavorable external shocks - including the worst drought
experienced in Hungary this century, the unexpected shortfall in Soviet oil
imports, and the higher oil prices on world markets - compared with the
initial target of $550 million, the current account deficit was eliminated.
This represents an improvement over 1989 of close to 5 percent of GDP.
5.          The successful turnaround in the current account balance was
achieved by adhering to tight fiscal and monetary policies. The target for
the Consolidated State Budget balance was achieved, which reflected an
improvement equivalent to almost 2 percent of GDP over 1989. The growth of
domestic credit was limited to about 10 percent, which was below the expected
(and actual) rate of inflation. A flexible interest rate policy was adopted.
The basic and liquidity refinancing rates of the NBH were raised by 9-11
percentage points to 22 percent and 28 percent respectively between end-1989
and end-1990. All short-term refinancing interest rates of the National Bank
of Hungary (NBH), with the exception of those for export refinance, were
raised to 28 percent in the fourth quarter of 1990, and further to 30 percent
in February 1991. Interest rates on T-bills sold to households were raised in
November 1990 by 2-3 percentage points to 28-31 percent, and in February 1991
to 31-34 percent.
6.          Important structural reforms were implemented. A program of
privatization of state enterprises (s8z) was successfully launched.
Competition from imports was increased with the elimination of import
licensing for more than 32 percent of domestic industrial production and 70
percent of convertible currency imports. Price controls were removed for more
than 77 percent of consumer prices. Partly due to the shortfall in deliveries
from CMEA partners, exports to those countries were sharply restricted,
forcing enterprises to restructure their production for sale in the more
competitive Western markets. These measures, together with further cuts in
subsidies (the level of subsidies fell by almost 4 percent of GDP in 1990)
increased the pressure on insolvent enterprises to restructure or face
closure. At the same time, the Government also took steps to prevent an
excessive deterioration in the living standards of those most adversely
affected by the structural adjustment underway.
7.          There is already evidenie that structural reforms are beginning to
show positive effects. Stronger-than-expected growth of exports to the
convertible currency area (9.5 percent compared with 8.5 percent) is an
indication that economic restructuring is underway, reflecting the successful
re-orientation of production capacities previously directed to exporting to
the CMEA markets. The biggest increase in exports to the convertible currency
area was in machinery, transport equipment and other capital goods, which were
among the sectors most adversely affected by the contraction in CMEA trade. A
large part of the increase in exports derived from production in small and
medium enterprises, which are growing rapidly in number. The number of small
businesses grew strongly in 1990, more than doubling in the last 18 months.
Borrowing by private and small businesses more than doubled in the last year,
and the increare was mostly long term loans. Another positive indicator is



47                            ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 25
the strong growth in direct foreign investment (DFI). There has been a
significant increase in the number of joint ventures with foreign partners:
from about 800 at the end of 1989 to 2300 by November 1990. The inflow of DFI
in 1990 ($337 million) was more than double the inflow in 1989.
8.          Economic growth, however, was weaker than expected, in part due to
the steeper than projected decline in ruble exports (27 percent compared to 20
percent), and the drought. Real GDP fell by about S percent in 1990. The
level of unemployment doubled in 1990, reaching about 2 percent of the labor
force. The rate of inflation was also higher than programmed (28 percent
compared with 23 percent). The continuing pressure on prices is partly
attributable to the still-limited degree of competition in the economy, which
the Government's medium term reform program will intensify. The acceleration
of Import liberalization and increased DFI will increase competition from
foreign producers, while the emphasis on private sector development, and the
Implementation of effective antitrust actions will increase domestic
competition.
It. The Government's Reform Program
9.          As described in our "MLnorandum",  the basic thrust of our
structural reforms is to complete the transition to a competitive market
economy in Hungary. The role of the state, directly as owner of productive
assets, and indirectly through policy interventions in economic activity, is
to be substantially reduced. The four main components of the Government's
structural reforms, summarized in the attached policy matrix (attachment 2),
are: (i) reduction of the role of the state through private sector development
and measures to reduce the role of the State Budget in redistributing
resources through taxes and subsidies; (ii) intensification of competition,
through strong reliance on further import and domestic price liberalization,
promotion of small and medium sized enterprises, and an effective anti-trust
policy including the break-up of highly concentrated market structures that
limit competition; (iii) financial system reform, including further
liberalization and improved prudential regulations and supervision, and
increased competition; and (iv) the further development of an adequate social
safety net. We aim to implement these reforms in the context of a sound
macroeconomic frumework that promotes economic growth while preserving and
enhancing our creditworthiness.
A. Structural Reforms
Reduction in the Role of the State
10.         Private Sector Developmnt. The private sector will be promoted
by encouraging the growth of new private ventures and small businesses and by
accelerating privatization. New orivate ventures and small businesses will be
promoted mainly by creating a stable macroeconomic environment and by
implementing structural reforms, described in detail below, that significantly
reduce the state's intervention in economic activity and enhance the role of
competitive markets in resource allocation. Apart from restrictive fiscal and
monetary policy, which reduce the access of large state enterprises to scarce



48                            ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 25
budgetary resources and credit, and thereby improve the access of the private
sector and small businesses to these resources, structural reforms such as the
liberalization of foreign trade, domestic pricing, and the financial system
would enable the private sector to compete with the large state sector on an
equal footing. The lowering of taxes on economic activity, one of the aims of
the reform of the budget, would be an important impetus to the growth of the
private sector.
11.         The Government recognizes that in view of the past discrimination
against private sector activity, some additional incentives for a limited time
for private sector development may be necessary. Several tax incentives are
provided to the private sector (use of accelerated depreciation for investment
in machinery and equipment, 50 percent enteiprise tax preference for three
years). To help new ventures capitalize their expansion in the first years of
their operation, from 1992 we will extend the carry forward period for net
operating losses. we will continue to support the private sector by improving
access to credit and necessary infrastructure (office sites,
telecommunications) and by further streamlining the regulatory environment.
We nope that these reforms will further accelerate the growth of the private
sector, which was dynamic last year (para. 7).
12.         The entry of new businesses will also be facilitated by effective
anti-trust policies that send a strong signal to business that competitive
efficiency enhancing behavior is acceptable and that conversely, monopolistic,
rent seeking behavior is not. An Office for Competition has been established
to implement the new Law Prohibiting Unfair Market Practices, investigate
complaints of monopolistic and non-competitive behavior, and to monitor
mergers and acquisitions. The Government will continue to break-up highly
concentrated market structures. The privatization of the last remaining trust
in the food industry (Hungarian Vegetable Oil Co.) will be initiated before
the end of 1991. All restrictions on domestic trade in vegetable oil products
will be removed. In order to ensure the existence of effective competition in
the domestic market for vegetable oiL products, jointly with the Bank, in 1992
we will review the structure of the industry expected to result after the
privatization and, if warranted, eliminate the restrictions on external trade
in vegetable oil products.
13.         The development of new private sector enterprises will be
accompanied by the acceleration of the 'rivatigation process initiated in
1990. According to the Government's medium-term strategy, privatization is to
be accelerated with the primary objective of improving the efficiency of
productive assets while ensuring that the process is transparent. The target
is to privatize 35-40 percent of business assets by 1993. This is a feasible
but ambitious target.  Specific measures to implement the Government's medium-
term strategy in 1992 will be elaborated in the 1992 Asset Policy Guidelines,
which we will review with the Bank prior to presenting it to Parliament by end
of 1991.
14.         Privatization will be accomplished through four main channels.
First, retail shops and restaurants will be auctioned to private owners
through the Pre-Privatization program which was approved by Parliament in
September 1990. About 5000-6000 units are expected to be sold ln the first



ANNEX 2
49                        Page 5 of 25
two years and the remaining ones will be auctioned when their current lease
expires. second, the State Property Agency (SPA) will continue to launch
"active" privatization programs for sale of larger enterprises. Two "active"
programs, each involving about 20 enterprises were launched in September and
December of 1990 and are proceeding satisfactorily. Subsequent privatization
programs will be undertaken every third or fourth month. Finally, and most
importantly, privatization initiated by the enterprise itself, or by a
potontial buyer, will be encouraged and the SPA's role will be limited to
ensuring transparency of the transaction.
1S.         To facilitate and accelerate privatization, the National Bank of
Hungary will refinance credits extended by commercial banks to private
Hungarian citizens, or associations of private persons, for purchasing either
state assets sold by the SPA, or shares in privatized companies. As
Government debt will be retired in the process of privatization (in the case
of credit financing, by the full amount of the newly refinanced credit), no
expansion of net domestic credit will result. Notwithstandinq our general
policy of non-subsidization of credit and positive real interest rates, the
privatization credits are currently made at a preferential interest rate equal
to 75 percent of NBH's refinancing rate. Despite this preferential treatment,
the subsidy is less than on outstanding long-term government debt. As a
result, the cash-flow position of the consolidated public sector, including
the MHM, improves from the operatlon of this facility. In any event, the
preferential credit scheme is limited to the support of the privatization
process and will eventually be phased out. To encourage greater employee
participation in privatization, we are also considering providing limited
preferences including a lower price, and payment by installments.
I6.         The participation of foreign capital in privatization will be
welcomed for the bulk of the competitive sphere of the economy. Hungary has a
liberal legal framework and special incentives for foreign investors, allowing
unrestricted repatriation of profits and invested capital in convertible
currency. Total foreign ownership and control is permitted. There was a
strong increase in foreign direct investment in Hungary in 1990 (para. 7). We
expect this trend to continue, and foreign capital to play an important role
in the Hungarian economy.
17.         Reduced Role of the Budaet in Redistribution of Resources.   The
development of a market economy is not possible without a significant
reduction in the role of the State Budget in redistributing resources within
the economy through taxes and subsidies. Expenditures of the Consolidated
State Budget constituted more than half of GDP in 1990. The Government's aim
is to reduce these expenditures by six percentage points by 1993 and more
significantly over the longer term. We expect to achieve this objective by
privatizing certain activities, transferring others to local governments, and
by increasing the cost effectiveness of activities that it will continue to
finance and administer. The reduction in expenditures will permit taxes,
including those on private businesses, to be reduced, thus generating faster
economic growth.
16.          Social security expenditures including pensions, health care and
pharmaceuticals, sick pay, and maternity and child care benefits comprise



ANNEX 2
50                          Page b of 25
almost 33 percent of Consolidated State Budget expenditures. These
expenditures are financed by high rates of employer contribution (43 percent
of the wage bill), which increase the cost of hiring labor and weaken
Hungary's international competitiveness. Significant reforms in many of these
important social security programs, described in detail below, will be
introduced beginning in 1992, which will permit some reduction in the
employer's social security contribution in the medium term, and more
substantial reduction In the longer term.
19.         Subsidies, including consumer, producer, investment and housing
subsidies account for another 18 percent of Consolidated State Budget
expenditures. In the context of our subsidy reduction program, we reduced
subsidies from 13 percent of GOP in 1989 to 9 percent in 1990. We intend to
further reduce subsidies by Ft 20 billion (measured in 1981 prices) in 1991,
to no more than 7 percent of GOP, and to no more than 5 percent in 1992 and 4
percent in 1993.  In addition to improving financial discipline, the subsidy
reduction program promotes important structural economic reforms. For
example, in early 1991 we cut interest rate subsidies for housing purchases,
which reduces the adverse impact of interest rate increases on the State
Budget. This made it possible to remove most ceilings on household deposit
interest rates, an essential step for integrating the financial system (para.
35). In 1991, budgetary subsidies for household energy will also be reduced
substantially and we will eliminate them totally by the end of the 1991-1992
heating season in April 1992. This will encourage efficient energy
consumption and contribute to improving our environment (para. 30). Further
phasing out of subsidies for enterprise investments in the competitive sectors
of the economy will improve investment project selection and productivity.
Also in 1991, we will eliminate production subsidies for coal and other
mlning, and interest rate subsidies for agricultural producers. We will
continue to cut subsidies in 1992 by the equivalent of 2 percent of GDP from
the 1991 level, eliminating household energy subsidies and implementing
further real cuts in housing subsidies and enterprise investment subsidies in
the competitive sectors of the economy.
20.         Transfers to Central Budgetary Institutions (C8Is) represented 18
percent of 1990 Consolidated state Budget expenditures. Most of the transfer
is allocated for family allowances (43 percent), education (16 percent),
administration and law and order (9 percent), cultural services (5 percent),
and business services, medical services, scientific research, and other
community services (4 percent each). We think State Budget transfers to C8Is
can be reduced through efficiency improvements brought about by privatization,
by increasing the role of the private sector in the provision of goods and
services now provided by the state through the C81s, and by the wider
application of user fees. We expect, already in 1991, to privatize some
applied research activities, and permit the formation of mutual health
insurance organizations, and in 1992, to increase the use of user fees in
health care provision. In 1992, we expect to achieve a real reduction in
State Budget transfers to the CBIs through the greater application of such
measures. In cooperation with the World Bank, a study of the reform and
decentralization of state expenditures will be completed and used to identify
concrete actions to achieve this target.



51                           ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 25
21.         Transfers to local governments represented 11 percent of 1990
Consolidated State Budget expenditures. Through the process of
decentralization, we intend to transfer greater autonomy and responsibility
from the level of state government to the local governments. The 1990 Act on
Local Governments transferred ownership rights to some property to the local
governments and empowered them to introduce various taxes. In 1991, we intend
to present to Parliament an Act on Property of Local Government in order to
regulate the transfer of state property from the state government to the local
goveraments. Measuroe to encourage prudent management of the assets of local
governments, including appropriate pricing of locally supplied public goods,
will be adopted. Som pricing authority, notably for local transport tariffs
and housing rents, was transferred to the local governments in 1990. In 1992,
we will increase further local government price-setting authority to cover all
locally produced public utility goods and services (including water and
sewerage fees and district heating tariffs).
22.         Transfers to Extrabudgetary Funds (El') represented 6 percent of
1990 Consolidated State Budget expenditures. There are 29 Els. As part of
our budgetary reform, starting in 1992, EFs performing vital tasks will be
integrated into the State Budget or regulated by separate laws, or their tasks
transferred to local governments or privatized. All other Els will be
eliminated, and, if financed by a tax or a contribution, the tax or
contribution will also be eliminated. From 1992, no new Els will be created
except by separate law. Based on the study referred to above (para. 20),
concrete actions will be identified and implemented to reduce State Budget
transfers to EFs in real terms in 1992.
23.         The tax burden on enterprises will be reduced with the
introduction of a modern system of depreciation of capital assets in 1992,
when the new Accounting Law takes effect. The cost of capital to enterprises
will be reduced by increasing the rebate of value added tax on capital goods
to 100 percent from January 1992. We will continue our efforts to make the
enterprise income tax more neutral by reducing tax preferences. Also from
1992, we will introduce changes to the personal income tax that will
restructure the tax burden on Hungarian citizens. The top rate of tax will be
lowered and the progressivity will be reduced by widening tax brackets. The
tax base will be expanded by including some "wage-like" income currently not
taxed. Important reforms to improve the structure of indirect taxation will
also be introduced in 1992. The zero rate of the value added tax will be
eliminated (except for a very small number of services) and the top rate will
be reduced to at most 20 percent.  These reforms, along with some
complii-ntary revisions in excises, will bring our value added tax in
conformity with the recommendations made by the European Community.
Intensiflcation of Competition
24.         Trade Liberalization.  Liberalization of foreign trade is an
important means for creating competition for domestic producers, which also
helps contain inflationary pressure, and for achieving convertibility of the
forint. The Government's reform program calls for a significant acceleration
in trade liberalization. Starting January 1, 1991 a large part of Hungary's
foreign trade, which was previously conducted with CMEA countries under



ANNEX 2
52                            Page 8 of 25
government control, was liberalized. This trade now takes place at world
prices and in convertible currency without state intervention. This
liberalization is a major impetus to industrial restructuring and enhanced
competitiveness.   Also in 1991, licensing of imports from the convertible
currency markets was eliminated for almost 72 percent of domestic industrial
production (1988 production weights). In 1990, the corresponding figure was
32 percent. The acceleration of import liberalization is accompanied by
another noteworthy change in the adminiotration of the remaining import
licenses. Only products listed on a relatively small negative lLst (other
than armaments, drugs, and precious metals, the main product groups in the
list include textiles, leather, certain chemicals, telecommunication
equipment, and agricultural products) will require licenses and all other
products would be free from import licenses.
25.         The Government Is committed to further import liberalization.  By
January 1, 1992, import licensing will be eliminated for at least 80 percent
of industrial production (1988 production weights). The remaining 20 percent
of industrial production that require import licenses after 1992 consist
mainly of processed food and textile products, which are the subject of
multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the GATT. Subject to the
conclusion of multilateral trade negotiations with GATT partners and EC-
association negotiations, the Government will extend gradually trade
liberalization to agriculture and food processing. In cooperation with the
Bank, by November 1991 we will complete a study on effective protection, which
will be a useful input for replacing licenses with tariffs, if warranted.
26.         Licensing requirements for engaging in foreign trade were
eliminated in 1991 except for products licensed for health and safety reasons
(e.g., drugs, weapons). However, licenses are required for exporting products
on a negative list, which account for 30 percent of total exports. This list
will be progressively reduced and products accounting for about an additional
5 percent of exports and 3 percent of gross agricultural and industrial
production will be taken off the list by January 1, 1992. Other than for
health and safety reasons, licensing will remain largely for exports of goods
covered by International agreements (steel, textiles, food and agricultural
products) and certain energy products (petroleum, natural gas, and mineral
fuels).
27.         A global quota is maintained on consumer goods imports.  The value
of the quota was increased from $200 million in 1990 to $630 million in 1991,
and the coverage was reduced to a subset of products (primarily processed
foods and ready-to-wear apparel) for which import licensing is required.
About 15 percent of gross industrial production (1988 production weights) is
still subject to the quota on imports of consumer goods. In line with our
objective of eliminating the quota, we intend to progressively relax the quota
on imports of consumer goods. We intend to reduce the share of consumer goods
that are subject to the quota to no more than 10 percent of gross industrial
production (1988 production weights) in 1992, and raise the value of the quota
to $7SO million.
28.         Hungary acceded to the GATT in 1973 on the basis of tariff
concessions. 83 percent of the Hungarian tariff lines are bound and cannot be



ANNEX 2
53                           Page 9 of 25
increased unilaterally without offering compensation to our trading partners.
Following the tariff reductions resulting from the Tokyo Round, Hungary's
average tariff decreased to 16 percent. As an advance contribution to the
results of the Uruguay Round, tariff rates were reduced unilaterally in 1989
and in 1991. As a result, the nominal average tariff decreased to 13 percent.
We expect that a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations will
lead to a further decrease in overall tariff protection, and in the dispersion
of protection.
29.         Price Liberalization.  To ensure that relative prices reflect
scarcities and allocate resources efficiently, administrative controls on
prices must be eliminated. With the majority of domestic producers subject to
competition from imports in 1991, most prices have been liberalized.
Effective January 1991, slightly less than 90 percent of consumer goods prices
were free and the coverage of administered prices was reduced to a little more
than 10 pe_cent of consumer prices. Central control on prices remain only for
textbooks, one type of milk, one type of white bread, railway tariffs, basic
postal and telephone charges, drinking water and sewerage, electricity, coal
and coal products, natural gas, firewood, and district heating; local
governments set local transport tariffs and housing rents on government, and
some privately-owned flats. The Price Office, which was responsible for
controlling prices, ceased to exist from January 1991.
30.         Energy consumption in Hungary is high and inefficient, encouraged
by historically low energy prices relative to economic costs. In the context
of the Energy Development Project, an agreement was reached with the Bank that
household prices would be raised to the level of economic costs by 1991 for
several important energy carriers, and no later than 1993 for the remainder.
Household energy prices were raised by varying amounts up to more than 90
percent in 1990 and regional variations in household electricity prices were
removed. In early 1991, the Government liberalized retail prices of all
petroleum products except LPG (diesel, gasoline, fuel oil) and further
increased the price of household electricity by 50 percent in February 1991.
In June 1991, the consumer prices of coal, firewood, natural gas and district
heating will be raised by 176 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent, and 70 percent
respectively. In 1991, prices of firewood, coal and coal products and LPG,
and imports of these products, will be liberalized. With the most recent
price in^rease for district heat, the consumer subsidy was cut by about half.
By the end of the 1991-92 heating season (April 1992), the remAining subsidies
will be completely eliminated by devolving price-setting authority to local
governments. Thus, the 1992 State Budget would include an allocation not
exceeding Ft. 3 billion exclusively for district heating for the early months
of 1992. Also, by April 1992 we will implement the agreed new tariff
structures for electricity and natural gas and agreed formulae for maintaining
central government administered prices for energy (electricity and natural
gas) at economic cost levels.
31.         Financial Dscinoline and Exit of Enterprises.  For domestic
competition to intensify, it is necessary that there be a credible threat of
takeover or liquidation to force insolvent enterprises to restructure and be
efficient.   During 1990, the Government took various measures to tighten
financial discipline and to facilitate restructuring or closure of insolvent



ANNEX 2
54                             Page 10 of 25
enterprises. These included adherence to a tight monetary policy, reduction
of fiscal expenditures, including production and investment subsidies to
enterprises, increased competition from imports, and the sharp reduction in
licenses granted for exports to the CMEA market. To further speed up the
process, the Government encouraged three of the major commercial banks to
initiate liquidation procedures against client enterprises in arrears.
Liquidation procedures were initiated against 453 enterprises between January-
December 1990. These enterprises employed more than 141,000 employees in 1989
and had assets worth Ft 165 billion (about $2.5 billion).
32.         Restructuring plans for the coal mining and ferrous metallurgy
sectors, which were developed in cooperation with the Bank, are being adhered
to. Nine coal mines have been closed in the last two years, and another 11
will be closed by 1995, most of them in 1991-92. An equal number of mines are
being rehabilitated.
33.         The acceleration of reforms, including further cuts in subsidies
to state enterprises, increased competition from imports and the growth of the
private sector, and the projected further contraction in regional export
markets and domestic demand are expected to put considerable pressure on state
enterprises to restructure. In addition, further measures are envisaged to
speed up restructuring and liquidation of insolvent enterprises. First, in
1991 bankruptcy proceedings will be initiated against any enterprise with tax
or social security contribution arrears of more than 3 months. Second, a new
Bankruptcy Law, which will become effective January 1, 1992, will accelerate
bankruptcy proceedings and encourage the commercial banks to be more
aggressive in initiating court action against enterprises in arrears. The
number of courts competent to handle the increasing number of bankruptcy cases
will also be increased. The Government has also begun implementing an action
plan for improving the efficiency of the construction sector, including the
privatization of large state construction enterprises and support for private
companies. In addition, accelerated programs for privatization and
restructuring will be implemented for companies particularly hard hit by the
contraction of trade with the CMEA countries.
34.         Financial discipline will also be tightened through the financial
system. As discussed below (paras. 37-38), improved prudential regulations
and banking supervision, and increased competition in retail banking from
foreign banks should discouragL banks from making loans to insolvent
enterprises. A new Accounting Law, which will introduce modernized and
internationally acceptable accounting standdrds and procedures in Hungary,
will also be effective beginning 1992.
Financial Sector Reform
35.         A sound financial system is needed to promote the effective
mobilization of resources and their allocation to efficient users. It also
serves as an instrument for enforcing financial discipline in and competition
among enterprises. Until recently, the financial system remained fragmented,
preventing the flow of resources from the household sector to the enterprises.
The main reason for this fragmentation lay in the system of housing finance,
whereby any increase in interest rates on deposits of households led



ANNEX 2
Page 11 of 25
automatically to higher budgetary expenditures on subsidized housing loans.
To control these expenditures, ceilings were maintained on interest rates on
household deposits. This discouraged savings mobilization and constrained the
ability of the National Savings Bank (NSB), which catered to the household
sector, from competing with other commercial banks.
36.         Interest rates on pre-1989 housing loans were raised in 1991.
Ceilings on interest rates on household deposits of longer than six months
maturity were eliminated in January 1991. Except for ceilings on interest
rates on sight deposits and time deposits of up to six months maturity, all
other interest rates are freely determined.
37.         Competition in commercial and retail banking is to be promoted.
In 1990 the Government granted licenses for retail banking to two foreign
banks, and this policy will be maintained. There will be further
decentralization of foreign exchange transactions.
38.         To strengthen the efficiency of the financial system and to
prevent banks from allocating new credits to insolvent clients, changes are
necessary in the prudential regulatory framework. A new draft Banking Law,
which will be presented to Parliament in June 1991, will become effective on
January 1, 1992 when the new Accounting Law also becomes effective. This law
introduces internationally accepted prudential regulations, including in
particular regulations on interlocking ownership and creation of pre-tax loss
reserves.  In addition, the Law requires immediate compliance with the Basle
guidelines on capital adequacy, except on a case-by-case basis, and permits no
relaxation of loan classification criteria. The law also requires the
creation of adequate risk reserve provisioning within a maximum of 3 years. A
supplementary provision to the Accounting Law will be issued specifying non-
recognition of interest on non-performing loans. Till such time as the new
regulations take effect, we encourage commercial banks to build up their risk
reserves out of their 1990 profits.
39.         The results of the recently completed audits of the three largest
wholesale banks revealed problems that require urgent attention in at least
one of these banks. We are elaborating a strategy and action plan to correct
the problems identified by the audits. Based on this action plan, which will
ensure that banks are placed on a sound positLon, with transparent accounting,
to be agreed with the World Bank before the end of June 1991, the Government
will take measures before the end of 1991 to correct the weaknesses identified
in the audits so that deviations in individual banks from capital adequacy
guidelines contained in the Banking Law are corrected as quickly as possible.
Develotment of Social Safety Net
40.         The government believes that the most effective means of improving
the living standards of Hungarians in the medium-term is the development of a
modern market economy capable of sustained economic growth. We expect that
the resolute implementation of the reforms we have initiated will generate
sustainable economic growth in the medium-term and allow living standards,
including those of the poor, to improve. The restructuring of the public
finances, especially the reduction of payroll taxes and contributions (for



ANNEX 2
56                           Page 12 of 25
social security as well as those earmarked for Extrabudgetary Funds), will
increase labor absorption and stimulate job creation. All Hungarian citizens
will benefit from the reduction of inflation, for which sound demand
managemen: and pe icies to increase competitive pressures in the economy are
indispensable. We recognize, nevertheless, that there will be social costs
during the transition and social needs over the longer term that we will have
to provide for. Although in general spending on social programs has been high
in Hungary, it has been inefficient.   Considerable efforts are needed to
Improve these programs and to target them to those most in need, thus
increasing their effectiveness.
41.         Spending on social programs, including social security, education,
housing, family allowances, and social benefits in cash and kind, represented
one third of GDP, one half of household income, and two-thirds of Consolidated
State Budget expenditures in 1990. Despite the high level of spending, the
existing programs of unemployment assistance, old age and disability pensions,
family allowances, and health, education and housing services are inadequate,
especially for the poor. In addition, expenditures are largely financed by a
very high rate of employer contribution (43 percent of payroll), which
discourages hiring of labor and reduces international competitiveness. The
hiqh proportion of social transfers in household income also blunts the
incentive to work. The growing need for basic social services and protection
for the poor, and the continued pressure on public finances require a
fundamental restructuring of the major social welfare programs.
42.         Pensions accounted for 30 percent of total social expenditures in
1990. The existing pension scheme is actuarially unsound, encourages early
retirement, and does not guarantee adequate pensions to maintain a minimum
standard of living for the elderly. These deficiencies will be addressed in a
comprehensive way when a new pension system is introduced from the beginning
of 1992. Conditions for eligibility will be tightened by raising the minimum
retirement age of women to equal that of men by the year 2000, raising the
standard retirement age (when full pension benefits are granted) for both
sexes, and changing the penslon formula to provide incentives for later
retirement. The reforms will entail a reduction in the level of initial
pensions, but they will be indexed to preserve their real value relative to
wage income. Along with the limit on the maximum value of pension for future
retirees, private supplementary pension schemes will be encouraged. Despite
the effects of demographic and other factors that create a pressure to
increase the pension contribution rate, we expect these reforms will permit a
reduction in the rate over the medium term, thus enhancing our
competitiveness. A bill containing these proposals will be presented to
Parliament in the third quarter of 1991 and we expect these reforms to be
effective starting from January 1, 1992.
43.         Major reforms will also be implemented in the financing of
sickness benefits, which represent 4 percent of total social expenditures.
Hungary has one of the highest number of compensated sick days in the
industrialized world. Partly this is the result of the financing system -
employers pay only the first three days of sick leave and the remaining leave
(up to a maximum of one year) is financed by the social security fund.
Starting January 1992, the employers, share in financing sick leave will be



ANNEX 2
57                          Page 13 of 25
increased to at least the first 3 weeks. This transfer of sick leave
expenditures from the social security fund to the employer will result in
further lowering the social security contribution rate.
44.         Health care and pharmaceuticals, which are also financed
predominantly by the social security fund, account for 14 percent of total
social expenditures. Incentives have been inadequate for consumers to use
health care resources efficiently, or for health care providers to make
services more cost-effective. In 1991, steps were taken to introduce cost-
consciousnese among consumers and providers of health care, and other measures
will be introduced in 1992. The health and pharmaceutical expenditures of the
social security fund will be separated into a National Healt.. Insurance Fund
(WHIP) in January 1992. A bill containing these proposals will be presented
to Parliament in the third quarter of 1991 and the reforms will be effective
from January 1, 1992.
4S.         Family assistance comprise another 9 percent of social
expenditures, and maternity and child care benefits in cash equal another 3
percent. The system of cash benefits, which are paid by the state to
families, is one of the most generous in Europe. Since a considerable
proportion of these expenditures goes to families with relatively high
Incomes, an important direction of reform is to improve the targeting of
support on those families with lower per capita incomes. Measures to reform
family related benefits will be presented to Parliament during 1991 and
implemented on January 1, 1992.
46.         Following the decentralization of government in 1990, many
programs of social assistance and social services are administered and
partially financed by local governments. In 1991 we will submit to Parliament
a Social Assistance Program which will establish transparent, publicized, and
well-targeted eligibility criteria for provision of minimum social assistance
benefits and establish a cost sharing arrangement between the state and the
local governments. Social assistance benefits will continue to be
administered by local governments, which are best equipped to administer them
efficiently.
47.         The provision and maintenance of adequate housing is primarily a
matter for the private sector and we expect the Government's role to diminish
in this sector. Nevertheless, as local governments raise rents on state-
owned flats to market levels, aome individuals may not be able to afford the
high rents. By 1992, the Government will either introduce a nation-wide
housing allowance program, or it will encourage local self-government bodies
to develop their own housing allowance programs.
48.         An unemployment insurance scheme (the Solidarity Fund), financed
by employer and employee contributions and a transfer from the State Budget,
was established in 1991. The Fund also finances the operation and development
of the network of labor market services, and certain elements of employment
policy (retraining schemes, unemployment benefits for school-leaver., and
early retirement benefits). Workers that contribute to the Fund are eligible
for benefits for a maximum of two years. The amount of compensation is 70
percent of the previous wage income in the first year, and 50 percent in the



ANNEX 2
58                          Page 14 of 25
following year. Workers who are not eligible for unemployment insurance will
be covered by retraining schemes, public works, or other social assistance.
In 1991, we will review the functioning of the unemployment insurance system
and the adequacy of its financing. In the review, we will concentrate on the
length of the eligibility period, the conditions of eligibility, the size of
the unemployment contribution, the modification of the early retirement
system, and the introduction of unemployment benefits for part-time workers.
Based on the results of the review, as well as on our continuous monitoring of
the system, beginning in 1992 we will implement needed modifications to insure
that the unemployment insurance saceme is financially viable and effective.
49.         To address long-term structural unemployment, we will rely
principally on measures to improve the operation of the labor market, and
upgrade our labor retraining proqrams. To facilitate the re-entry of workers
into the work force, the Government intends to improve adult retraining and
education services to create a work force better suited to a market economy.
A National Training Council was established in 1991 to promote occupational
mobility and employment by defining policy for the provision of regional adult
training programs. In the area of labor retraining, we recognize that private
enterprises in growth sectors should play a leading role. In 1991, we began
contracting out training services to the private sector. To improve
occupational training for adults we will establish regional labor development
centers with effective linkages to the regional economy and labor market. We
are also reforming our vocational training schools to provide our youth a
broader training in clusters of occupational skills. To promote the
development of an integrated labor market, we will upgrade the system of labor
exchanges, which will improve the collection, analysis and diffusion of labor
market information--efforts supported by the Bank financed Human Resources
Project.
50.         We consider it essential that environmental deterioration be
stopped in the interast of sustainable economic development. To this end, the
Government will encourage efficient energy consumption through appropriate
pricing, and control pollution through fees, fines and other methods for
encouraging the use of envirt mentally sound products. In this spirit, in
1991 lower customs duties were imposed on imported automobiles fitted with
catalytic converters, on converters themselves, and on other goods that
improve or protect the environment.
S. Macroeconomic Framework
51.         The 1991 program was formulated against the background of an
external shock expected to be roughly 7% of GDP mainly from the terms of trade
lose following the switch to world prices for CHEA trade, and also the
lingering effects of the 1990 drought. Macroeconomic policy was set to adjust
to half of the external shock in 1991, implying a deterioration in the current
account of $1.2 billion. Developments in the first quarter of 1991 have
deviated from our expectations. First, lower world petroleum prices have
reduced the terms of trade loss from shifting C? tA trade to convertible
currencies. However, trade with the ex-CHMA cou.tries, and particularly
exports, was negligible in the first quarter and we now expect the decline in
that trade to be double what was earlier projected. As a result of these



59                          ANNEX 2
Page 15 of 25
unforeseen developments, we now anticipate that the recession that began in
1990 will deepen in 1991, and that real CDP will shrink by 6-8 percent. we
also have revised the 1991 current account deficit to $0.9 billion.
Thereafter, the current account deficit would not exceed the level of DFI.
529         The shift in external balance projected during 1991-93 requires
policies that restrain domestic demand and promote saving. Private
consumptLon, which is projected to fall by almost 10 percent in 1990-91, is
expected to bear much of the decline in domestic demand. The magnitude of
this adjustment is unprecedented in Hungary and certainly poses a severe
strain on our population. The acceleration of the implementation of
structural reforms will set the stage for sustainable growth in the medium-
term, which will help make the temporary drop in living standards more
bearable. The public sector is also projected to reduce its absorption. In
1991, significant cuts have been planned in a broad range of expenditures in
real terms, including consumer and producer subsidies, enterprise investment
subsidies, subsidies for housing, and public administration. Savings are also
projected from schemes to limit health care expenditures and from reforms in
the pension system. As a result of these measures, the deficit of the
Consolidated State Budget would be held to Ft. 38 billion (1.5 percent of
GDP), even though the direct impact of external shocks on the budget
(primarily the loss in revenues obtained earlier by taxing users of cheap oil
imports from the Soviet Union) is estimated to exceed Ft. SO billion (2% of
GDP). The fiscal deficit (GFS basis) would be roughly balanced by 1993.
53.         Fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies have been designed to
meet the balance-of-payments target to stimulate a more intensive inflow of
foreign capital, which will foster technological and managerial improvement as
well as the performance of exports. The restrictive 1991 budget, and the
devaluation, effective January 7, 1991, of the forint by 1S percent against
the basket of currencies to which it is pegged demonstrate the Government's
commitment to implement measures needed to meet its policy objectives. We are
committed to an active exchange rate policy to maintain the competitiveness of
the forint.
S4.         Credit and monetary policy have also been set to meet the external
balance target and improve the allocation of resources. The projected
increase in domestic credit is well below the programmed rate of inflation.
However, we will continue the 1990 prttern of making most of the increase
available to enterprises, especially small entrepreneurs. We believe this
policy is necessary to support the restructuring of the economy and the
development of the private sector. Planned broad money growth also is below
the programmed rate of inflation. Despite tight credit and monetary policy,
we project an acceleration of the annual average rate of inflation in 1991 to
at most 33-35 percent. Policy measures (devaluation, excise tax increases,
decreases in consumer price subsidies, higher domestic prices for imports from
the former CMEA area) are responsible for much of the increase.  Success in
meeting the inflation target, however, depends in large part on containing
inflationary expectations so that wage increases do not begin to lead price
increases. In 1991, we introduced an incomes policy in which wage bill
increases of 18 to 28 percent may not be deducted as costs for the
Zntrepreneurial Profit Tax (EPT), and increases exceeding 28 percent result in



ANNEX 2
60                           Page 16 of 25
taxation under the EPT of the entire increase in the wage bill. Although many
of the structural reforms - subsidy reductions, price liberalization, CMEA
trade reform - have an immediate, one-time impact on the level of prices, we
expect that by accelerating the implementation of these policies in the first
year of our program, we will be able to reduce the rate of inflation, measured
on an end-year basis, to a single digit by the end of 1993.
55.         Exports are projected to continue to be the main demand side
source of growth over the medium-term. Private consumption, following the
expected contraction in 1991, is projected to stagnate in 1992, before growth
accelerates. Investment demand, reflecting declining real GDP, is projected
to be very weak in the near-term before accelerating because of the need for
restructuring investments, and investments in new ventures. The withdrawal of
the Government from financing investments in the productive sectors, and the
increased financial intermediation of household savings toward non-housing
uses, is projected to shift the composition of investment toward the
enterprise sector. Although part of the projected increase in enterprise
investment demand is likely to originate from state enterprises, continued
rapid growth of new private ventures and progress in privatization will mean
that an increasing share of enterprise investment demand originates from the
private sector.
56.         Supply side developments in the near term are projected to be
dominated by the continued contraction of trade previously conducted in
rubles, the lingering effects of the 1990 drought, and the effects of economic
restructuring. A further decline in real GDP of 6-8 percent is projected in
1991 and growth is projected to be only 1-3 percent in 1992. Thereafter, the
reduction in the current account deficit and the build-up of an adequate level
of international reserves would permit a loosening of the externaw constraint
and larger increase in domestic demand may be accommodated. The restructuring
of industry along lines that can compete internationally is projected to
result in an acceleration of growth in that sector. The service sector would
continue to expand rapidly. During 1993-95, real GDP growth is expected to
average 3-S percent. Industry is the fastest growing sector, followed by
services, then agriculture.
57.         The macroeconomic program, including principa  macroeconomic
targets and the instruments for achieving the targets has been discussed among
government officials and the staffs of the Bank a.ad the IMF. We will review
macroeconomic performance in 1991 in terms of progress in achieving the 1991
targets for the current account and the Consolidated State Budget balance.
Progress in achieving our economic goals will also be assessed using the
following set of indicators, which reflect the objectives of improving our
creditworthiness and accelerating structural changet the rate of growth of
GDP and exports; the level of subsidies in relation to GDPI the level of
outstanding debt in relation to GDP; and the rate of inflation. The expected
ranges for these indicators are shown in Attachment 1 of this letter.

1II. Conclusion
58.         We believe we have a strong reform program and we have
demonstrated our firm commitment to implementing the difficult actions that
are necessary to enhance our economy's competitiveness and maintain its
international creditworthiness. The support of the Bank through the SAL would
greatly facilitate the adjustment process by providing urgent balance of
payments assistance especially necessary as Hungary modernizes its industrial
base to integrate more fully in the international economy. We will continue
to monitor the implementation of the reforms and the impact these have on the
economy, both at the macro level and at the micro level. If necessary, and
after consultation with the Bank, we will implement further measures to
accelerate the adjustment process. The Government appreciates the support the
Bank has provided us in our adjustment efforts in the past, not only in the
form of financial assistance but also through its collaboration in important
