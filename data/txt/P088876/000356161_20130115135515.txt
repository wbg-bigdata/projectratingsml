                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

1.    This Restructuring Paper proposes a level-two restructuring of the Djibouti Urban Poverty
Reduction Project (DUPREP) (Grant No. H356-DJ (P088876) and Grant No. H582-DJ
(P088876). The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to basic economic
and social infrastructure and to community development opportunities within Quartier 7 in the
city of Djibouti. The project has three components: (i) Improvement of Infrastructure; (ii)
Community Development; and (iii) Technical Assistance (TA).

2.    As requested by the Borrower in their letter dated July 7, 2012, the proposed restructuring
consists of the following:

    (i)     Extension of the project closing date: A ten-month extension of the project’s
            closing date, from May 31, 2013, until March 31, 2014, to address previous
            implementation delays under a sub-component of Component 3, the Djibouti Ville
            Master Plan, which cannot be absorbed under the current time line. This will be the
            first extension of the project’s closing date since approval of the additional financing.

    (ii)    Revision of project components: Component 1 – Improvement of Infrastructure:
            under the street rehabilitation sub-component, a reduction of the total length of streets
            to be rehabilitated from 3 km to 2.2 km, while preserving east-west and north-south
            links; Component 2 – Community Development: under the sanitation sub-component,
            a new focus on technical assistance complementary to investments by other donors in
            the solid waste management sector in lieu of establishing a community scheme for
            garbage collection.

    (iii)   Update of the results monitoring framework: updating project indicators to more
            candidly reflect project impacts, including adding a missing core sector indicator, and
            adapting specific targets corresponding to the changes at the sub-component level
            mentioned above.

    (iv)    Reallocation between disbursement categories: reallocation of SDR 520,000
            (US$800,000 equivalent) in grant proceeds, from the “unallocated? expenditure
            category under each grant, to the various components in order to reflect the increased
            knowledge at the Mid-Term Review (MTR) of actual costs of key sub-components,
            and alignment of eligible expenditure definitions between the initial and additional
            grants.

3.    The proposed changes are necessary in order to allow the project to achieve its current
development objective within the available funding. The proposed restructuring would not
modify the PDO. The detailed content, rationale and implications of these changes, and their
apportionment to each of the two grants, are provided below.

    B.         PROJECT STATUS

    4.    The DUPREP was approved by the Board of Directors on April 29, 2008, for a total IDA
    Grant amount of SDR 1.9 million (US$3.0 million equivalent). The project became effective on
    January 29, 2009, and in June 2010, the Board approved an additional financing for the project in
    the amount of SDR 2.0 million (US$2.9 million equivalent). The project development objective
    (PDO) is to increase access to basic economic and social infrastructure and to community
    development within Quartier 7 in the city of Djibouti.

    5.     The project consists of three components: (i) Improvement of infrastructure, including
    street rehabilitation and drainage; (ii) Community Development; and (iii) Technical Assistance.
    The Project’s estimated costs at appraisal are presented in Table 1 below.

       Total funding                                                         5,900,000

    6.     Substantial Results to date and outlook. Substantial progress in implementing project
    activities has already been achieved, including the following:

               Component 1 (Improvement of Infrastructure): (a) completion of the Community
                Development Center; (b) signing of both street rehabilitation contracts and near-
                completion of one; (c) near-completion of other social infrastructure such as a multi-
                purpose playground; (d) finalization of the design and bidding documents for the
                Community Health Center; and (e) completion of a technical options analysis for the
                installation of street lighting.

               Component 2 (Community Development): (a) completion of the first round of literacy
                campaigns and the vocational training program, and launch of a second round for both
                capacity building initiatives; (b) completion of a “willingness to pay survey? and launch
                of a study on cost reduction options for equipping neighborhood households with
                individual latrines; (c) completion of the first phase of a TA to identify a suitable and
                replicable model for solid waste collection within the neighborhood using local micro-
                enterprises; and (d) launch of a capacity building program for neighborhood Civil Society
                Organizations (CSOs).

     Costs for the project portion appraised under the initial Grant were not revised during the appraisal of the
    Additional Financing (AF). AF costs were appraised on the basis of the same unit costs as those at appraisal
    of the initial project.
                                                        -5-
         Component 3 (Technical Assistance): (a) implementation of a new Management
          Information System (MIS) for the Djibouti Social Development Agency (Agence
          Djiboutienne de Développement Social, ADDS) accompanied by staff training
          workshops; (b) launch of design work on the new Djibouti-Ville Master Plan; and (c)
          pursuit of ongoing mapping and cartography work, closely coordinated with other donors
          and development agencies funding similar activities in the city.

7.    As of the last supervision mission, the most substantial results observed in terms of
outcomes are as follows: (a) at least 200 residents using the CDC as of June 2012, but this figure
has likely increased significantly since; (b) 1,326 residents benefitting from community
development activities; and (c) 9,570 person-days of employment created. As for implementation
progress indicators, all mid-term targets were met on time, except for road resurfacing, which has
now been met as well.

8.    Issues during project implementation and corrective measures. Following the Mid-
Term Review of November 2011, the PDO on the likelihood of achieving the PDO by the
project’s closing date and implementation progress (IP) ratings were both downgraded to
moderately unsatisfactory (MU), requiring implementation of a corrective action plan. This
downgrade was essentially due to the following:
     (i) The disbursement level (in November 2011, 34.5% for the initial IDA grant, and 17% for
         both grants) stood significantly below initial estimates, mostly as a result of the delay in
         implementing the largest infrastructure sub-component: road resurfacing;
     (ii) there was a substantial procurement delay for the largest portion of the Technical
          Assistance Component (Urban Planning) making it impossible to complete that sub-
          component by the closing date; and
     (iii) concerns were raised regarding sustainability of the largest project investment completed
           at that point, the Community Development Center (CDC). The CDC had been completed
           in October 2010, but had been very little used and not properly maintained for lack of
           adequate management. By November 2011, the facilities had already showed signs of
           deterioration.
9.       The above action plan implemented to address these issues included the following:

     (i) A new Project Manager was appointed in October 2011 following low proactivity in
         project management during FY11. As a result, by February 2012, all road resurfacing
         contracts were signed (representing commitments for an additional 27% of total project
         funds), as well as the contract for the urban planning sub-component; and

     (ii) the Government addressed nationwide CDC management issues through a decree
          establishing professional managers in each CDC to be hired by the State Secretariat for
          Youth and Sports. In Quartier 7, a CDC manager was appointed in January 2012; by
          March 2012, facility usage had drastically increased and repairs were underway to ensure
          better maintenance.

10. By June 2012, the agreed-upon Action Plan was fully implemented, all mid-term
intermediate indicators had been achieved, commitments stood at 83%, disbursements had
steadily resumed (17% in November 2011, 33% in June 2012, and 48% today) and subsequently,
project ratings were upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. This reflected strong commitment on
the part of government to carry this project forward and to achieve the PDO.
11. Implementation ratings for Procurement, Financial Management, and Environmental
Safeguards are all rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS) or Satisfactory (S). While OP 4.12 was not

                                                 -6-
triggered under the project, one case of economic activity relocation has arisen, for which an
action plan through amicable resolution was designed in consultation with the Regional
Safeguards Advisor. Its implementation has been closely monitored by the task team.. –An
amicable settlement has been reached and documented between the relevant State
counterpart and the affected person. The team will seek LEGEN views on the
adequacy of this settlement and will keep monitoring the situation.


C.    PROPOSED CHANGES

12. Despite very substantial progress achieved under the project, changes are required in the
components and indicators, funds should be reallocated, and an extension of the closing date is
required so that the project can achieve its current development objective within the available
funding.

13. Components: The three project components will be maintained. However, some changes
are needed to sub-components beyond normal adjustments made in the course of project
supervision, as follows:

     (i) Component 1 (Improvement of Infrastructure): the total length of streets to be
     rehabilitated would be reduced from 3 km to 2.2 km. The original Grant (NoH365-DJ)
     included the rehabilitation of 1.5 km of streets (paving and drainage), and an additional 1.5
     km were added in the additional Grant (No. H582-DJ). However, at the time of contract
     award, it appeared that the lowest evaluated price for these works was 47% higher than the
     costs estimated at appraisal of the original project (the same unit costs were also used to
     appraise the Additional Financing). This increase was due to: (a) an optimistic initial
     estimate, based on outdated unit costs; (b) substantial price increases in Djibouti between
     appraisal and actual tendering; and (c) the limited competition for such works on the
     Djibouti market.

     Since this increase could not be entirely absorbed by the project’s unallocated funds, it was
     decided to remove one of the streets from the project scope (Avenue 39), keeping however
     basic access functionality with the rehabilitation of two north-south streets, and one east-
     west, to be funded as follows: about 1 km from Grant No. H365-DJ (P08876), and about 1.2
     km from Grant No. H582-DJ (P120190). In addition to reducing the required, this also
     reduces some technical risks (due to modifications needed to a sewage collector). ADDS is
     seeking to identify further multilateral funding to execute the rehabilitation of Avenue 39 at
     a later date.

     (ii) Component 2 (Community Development): the project will no longer establish a
     community scheme for garbage collection, but will focus instead on technical assistance
     complementary to investments by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the
     European Union (EU) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in this sub-
     sector. Project funds will be partly used for technical assistance to the public operator
     (Office de la Voirie de Djibouti, OVD) which was identified in a Public-Private
     Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) financed study as a critical roadblock for any
     improvement in solid waste collection in Quartier 7, including through community systems.
     This will carried out in coordination with AFD which is launching a large, community-based
     solid waste management project, and with JICA which will be funding equipment for OVD,
     and thus contribute to the integration of donor initiatives.



                                               -7-
14. Regarding individual household sanitation, the willingness to pay survey and latrine
prototypes have shown that unless a dedicated funding scheme is created and costs are further
reduced, it is unlikely that households would invest in individual latrines at this stage. The project
will thus continue to fund a campaign that promotes individual sanitation and a techno-economic
study to explore possible cost-reducing technical alternatives, in coordination with the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), without expecting direct household investments by the
grant closing date.

15. Results/indicators: The proposed restructuring does not change the overall PDO. The
Results Framework, however, would be revised to reflect the impact of changes in the sub-
components described above, and to adjust various definitions or targets for greater candor, based
on information collected since Appraisal. These changes, together with their rationale, are
detailed in Table 2 below, and a complete revised Results and Monitoring Framework is included
in Annex 1.

    16. Reallocation. Since all but one of the larger infrastructure sub-components have been
    committed (construction of the health center is under procurement), and procurement of the
    largest technical assistance sub-component (the Djibouti-Ville Master Plan) has also been
    completed, there is sufficient cost certainty to allocate the unallocated amounts under each Grant.
    In comparison to the initial allocation3, there have been cost increases in all components and the
    total unallocated amount, SDR 520,000, will thus be reallocated as follows: SDR 188,000 under
    Component 1: Improvement of Infrastructure; SDR 97,000 under Component 2: Community
    Development; SDR 211,000 under Component 3: Technical Assistance; and SDR 24,000 under
    Component 3: Project Management.

    17. While eligible expenditures under the original IDA Grant (Grant No.365-DJ) excluded
    taxes, they include taxes under the additional IDA Grant (Grant No.582–DJ). The change was
    made for the additional financing following the introduction of a value added tax in Djibouti.
    Under the proposed restructuring, eligible expenditures would be aligned between the original
    and additional grants, to include taxes which would simplify the financial management of the
    project. A detailed revision of the reallocation of grant proceeds is presented in Annex 2.

    18. Closing date: A ten-month extension of the project’s closing date is proposed, from May
    31, 2013, until March 31, 2014, for both Grant No. 365-DJ and Grant No. 582–DJ. This would be

the first extension of the project’s closing date since the approval of the Additional Financing4.
The closing date extension is necessary in order to allow sufficient time for completion of the
Djibouti-Ville Master Plan (expected duration: 18 months) under Component 3 (Technical
Assistance). The corresponding consultancy services in October 2012 and their delivery schedule
have now been confirmed and this would be the last project activity to complete. Although the
ongoing infrastructure works are scheduled to be completed before June 30, 2013, the previous
project delays and the shift to more time-intensive technology (cut stones instead of asphalt), the
current closing date does not allow for additional time in case of unforeseen delays during
construction. The proposed extension would thus provide a contingency buffer for unexpected
delays.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

19. Economic, financial and technical analysis. The original (2009) economic rate of return
estimate for the entire project was 12%, obtained through a forecast in the increase of property
values due to project investments. This increase was calculated with a hedonic regression
methodology, using another area of Djibouti (PK12) as a control. Since the length of roadway to
be paved is the only change in investments under the proposed restructuring – namely, reducing
the output for that component by 27% for the same monetary investment (itself representing 27%
of the project investment), the economic rate of return (ERR) would empirically be expected to
decrease with this restructuring. However, the very small data sample available for the 2009
analysis entails a wide margin of uncertainty. In particular, the property valuation coefficient
calculated for ‘proximity to a paved road’ was close to zero, resulting in a calculated non -
significant change in the estimated ERR for this restructuring under the existing model.

20. Social and Environment: The proposed restructuring would not result in any changes to
the appraised social and environmental aspects. In particular, all roads to be resurfaced had
already been included in the environmental impact assessment.

21. The proposed changes do not affect any other activities appraised under the original and the
additional financing grants, in terms of procurement, fiduciary, implementation arrangements, or
risks.

22.   The proposed changes do not trigger any exception to Bank Policy.

  When the Additional Financing was approved, the closing date of Grant No.365-DJ was extended by one
year to align it with the closing date of the Additional Financing Grant No.582-DJ. Although
Implementation Progress at the time was rated Fully Satisfactory, the alignment of completion dates
allowed for optimizing the allocation of expenditures between the two grants.
