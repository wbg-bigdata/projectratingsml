ON A PROPOSED LOAN 20 23  ISLANZC R3w=LZC OF PAKISTN
FOR A DOMESTI EN         RESOURC  DEEmENT a ROcET
1.     atroduetion.  I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for US$180
million equivalent to help finance a project for the deva_opment of domestic energy
resources. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with
a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace.
2.    Macoeconomic sott.  In spite of impressive growth performance for most
of the 1980s, Pakistan, in recent years, has developed a large fiscal deficit, and
more  recently,  serious  balance  of  payments  problems.    Progress  in  the
implementation of the Government's structural reform program covering FY88-91,
which was aimed at correcting these imbalances, had been less than satisfactory,
particularly regarding efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit. Cognizant of this
problem, the Government which took office in November 1990 renewed and extended the
adjustment effort for the FY92-FY94 period. The adjustment program is supported
through a third-year arrangement under the Structural Adjustment Facility of the
IMF. While the implementation of the privatization and deregulation measures are
proceeding well under the adjustment program, serious problems have developed in
FY92 in the fiscal area, which are also contributing to slippages in the balance
of payments area.  Continuation of a strong adjustment effort is required to
improve domestic resource mobilization and increase development outlays, while
reducing the budget deficit. As part of this effort, the Government of Pakistan
(GOP) assigns high priority to the proposed Project, which will contribute to
reducing fiscal imbalances over the medium-term by enhancing corporate
profitability and self-financing thus reducing public sector borrowings, mobilizing
resources to GOP's budget through corporate income taxes and surcharges, and
enhancing the role of the private sector in financing investments in the petroleum
subsector. it will also reduce the country's vulnerability to external shocks by:
increasing the output of domeatic gas and oil, thus reducing the relatively high
burden of energy imports in the balance of payments, and continuing a policy of
pricing petroleum products which moves in accordance with movements in
international prices.
3.    Background.  Pakistan's commercially exploitable energy resources consist
of hydropower, natural gas, oil and coal. The hydropower potential is estimated
at about 30,000 HW. Proven reserves of natural gas are estimated at about 30 TCF.
Oil reserves, both probable and proven, are estimated at about 30 million tons.
Coal and lignite deposits are estimated at about 900 million tons, of which 175
million tons are proven. The exploitation of domestic energy resources has not
been at a level that the country's hydrocarbon potential warrants. The private
sector's inte-sst in investing in energy development in Pakistan has in e.ecent
years been enhanced as a result of:  (a) availability of the transmission and
distribution infrastructure for natural gas, together with the Government's
commitment to expand it; (b) linking the producer price of gas with the
international price of fuel oil which improves the prospects for higher returns;
and (c) the active promotion undertaken by GOP and its agencies to stimulate
private sector interest. With a vlew towards further enhancing the incentives for
private sector participation in the development of the country's hydrocarbon
resources, the Government announced, in November 1991, a new Petroleum Policy with
the encouragement of the Bank, other donors and the private sector.
4.    Presently, exploration and development of oil and gas is primarily carried
out through joint ventures between international oil companies and the Oil and Gas



-2-
Development Corporation (OGDC), and 37 joint ventures have been formed to date.
Three of these joint ventures have discovered significant amounts of hydrocarbons,
mainly gas, and the proposed Project intends, among other things, to develop these
three successful concessions. Many international oil companies are willing to
ope.- .a under joint ventures with GOP/OGDC, in view of the comfort such an
arrangement provides, particularly in the case of discoveries of gas and marginal
oil fields which do not allow exports. However, OGDC's effectiveness in attracting
foreign investors has been impaired because of institutional and financial
weaknesses. Actions to improve OGDC's financial viability were agreed under the
Second Energy Sector Loan (Ln. 3107-PAR) and as a consequence, OGDC generated a
profit for the first time in FY90. OGDC's financial position, however, needs
further strengthening and the Corporation needs to be restructured along functional
lines. The proposed Project is intended to support these efforts to which GOP and
OGDC are committed.
5.    8ank's Experience with Past Lending Ogerations. Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) on projects that have OGDC and Bui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL)
as beneficiaries record that although the physical implementation was successful,
the sales of respective products (oil and gas in the case of OGDC, gas in the case
of SNGPL) have not been realized at levels forecast at appraisal. This was due to
the weakness in the reservoir engineering capability of OGDC, and the delay in gas
pipeline construction by SNGPL. The PCRe also indicate that implementation of
institutional development components were not fully successful primarily because
of substantial delays in contracting technical assistance.
6.    ESL II, which provides the policy umbrella for the energy sector, includes
agreements regarding energy prices. Su:,h agreements have been complied with and
the second tranche has been released. Electricity prices have been increased by
an average of 29.3% from FY89 to the present as a consequence of three tariff
increases in September 1989, July 1990 and April 1991. In the petroleum subsector,
producer prices for domestically produced crude continue to be pegged to
international prices of crude. For natural gas, the producer price which was
pegged to two-thirds of the border price of fuel oil (less negotiated discounts)
has now been increased to 75% in order to attract risk capital for exploration,
while consumer prices of petroleum products (except for kerosene) are being
maintained above the corresponding import prices. Consumer prices of natural gas
were increased in April 1991 as a result of which gas prices for industrial
consumers (except fertilizer producers) and the power sector are at parity with the
domestic price of fuel oil; those for commercial consumers are at 112% of fuel oil
parity, and those for raw gas supplied to the Water and Power Development Authority
are at 40% of the domestic fuel oil price enroute to achieving full parity by
FY95. For residential consumers, the price of gas is about 72% of the equivalent
border price of fuel oil enroute to achieving full parity by FY93.
7.    Prolect Oblegtives.  The objectives of tLe proposed Project are tot  (a)
accelerate the dorealopment of indigenous hydrocarbons, utilizing private sector
resources to the maximum extent possible; (b) ensure that such indigenously
developed hydrocarbons reach the end consumers in an efficient manner; (c) enhance
the commercial orientation and operational autonomy of the public sector entities
in the gubsector to pave the way for a larger private sector role; and (d)
strengthen the regulatory and policy making functions of governmental agencies in
the subsector to facilitate larger private investments.
8.    Prgiggt Descriotion.  The proposed Project would include the following
components: (a) development of oil and gas fields under joint ventures with the
private sector, namely (i) Qadirpur Gas Field (OGDC - Premier Joint Venture); (ii)
Radanwari Gas Field (OGDC - LASMO Joint Venture); and (iii) Badin Block Concession



-3-
(Union Texas (UTP) - GOP Joint Venture); (b) construction of the Dhodak condensate
plant (OGDC); pipelines and compressors to utilize Qadirpur and Dhodak gas (SNGPL),
and installation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system
(SNGPL); (c) implementation of measures to mitigate the environmental impact of (a)
and (b) abovel (d) corporate restructuring of OGDC; (e) institutional strengthenirg
of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) including measures to
implement the new Petroleum Policy; and (f) technical assistance for (a) through
(e) above.
9.    The Bank loan of US$180 million would be made to GOP which will utilize
US$38.5 million to finance its share in the Badin Joint Venture with UTP and
technical assistance to MPNR.   The balance would be onlent to OGDC (US$85.0
million) and to SNGPL (US$S6.5 million) on similar repayment terms as the Bank loan
to GOP. The onlending interest rate would have a mark-up of one-tenth of the
Bank's standard variable interest rate to GOP. The foreign exchange and interest
rate risks would be borne by the beneficiaries. OGDC will utilize the funds for
implementing the Qadirpur field development, Dhodak condensate plant and corporat-.
restructuring components, and for financing its share of the foreign costs of thn
Kadanwari field development. SNGPL will implement the pipeline components as well
as the SCADA system, and HPNR will be responsible for its institutional
strengthening component. A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.  A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report is being distributed separately.
10.   Environmental asuects.  An environmental screening was conducted for the
proposed Project in which the physical components were assessed for their impact
on the environment. Two fields, Badin Block and Kadanwari, were found to have no
adverse environmental impact. The other two fields, Qadirpur and Dhodak, required
further environmental analyses and an Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out
by OGDC and SNGPL for these fields. In accordance with Operational Directive 4.00,
the EA report has been released to the Bank's Executive Directors with GOP and
OGDC's written consent. The EA has identified the following environmental issues:
land use during and after the drilling operations, pipeline routing, impact on
flora and fauna, and water use and marine life given that one of the fields is
around the Indus River. The mitigating measures recommended by the EA which have
been incorporated in the Project design includes: (a) land use: implement a mud
management plan, proper disposal of solid waste, 100-meter buffer zone, and
fencing; (b) 2i2eline routing: aerial and ground survey to avoid villagea and
habitation, and follow international standards for pipeline construction; (c)
imoact on flora and fauna: construct a 100-meter buffer zone and coordinate
wildlife protection with local non-governmental organizations; (d) water uLse and
marine lifts construct 9-ft pads for drill sites, construct well heads above flood
crests, bury gas gathering facilities below plow depth, no dams to be constructed
on the Indus River, and maintain a 100-meter buffer zone of f the river and all
active channels.
11.   /no*afts             GOP and the beneficiaries have agreed to take necessary
actions to achieve the objectives set out in the Project. On policy issues, the
Government has agreed to implement the new Petroleum Policy and to review with the
Bank annually, the progress in the implementation of the Policy.  On Proiect
4mlem entation, GOP and OGDC have agreed that for the Kadanwari Gas Field
component, no withdrawal from the loan can be made until the Bank has been
furnished with plane for the utilization of the gas expectqd to be produced from
the field, and a confirmation of reserves prepared by an international reservoir
firm.  With regard to instftut&2nal develomnt, the Government has agreed to



-4-
review with the Bank the sttayj being currently undertaken of the capacity and
organization of MPNR's secretariat and its technical directorates, and to implement
its recommandations. On the corpcrate restructuring of OGDC, GOP and OGDC have
agreed to carry out and implement the recommendations of a study of options with
respect to the future role of OGDC's technical service, including the option of
privatizing these services; ensure the recruitment of qualified professional staff
for OGDC' s Finance Department and Internal Audit Department; and for OGODC to
achieve for each financLal year beginning FY92 a rate ok return at least equivalent
to the higher of 15% of its average capital employed o,r weighted-average cost of
its capitalt a ratio of current assets to current liab'lities of not less than 1:1;
and a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times. Furthermore, OGDC has
agreed to furnish to the Bank annually, a Corporate Plan, covering OGDC*s physical,
financial and institutional targets for the fI Ulowing five-year period.   On
elnvironment, OGDC has agreed to formulate guidelines for environmental assessment
and safety for petroleum exploration and development activities and to ensure the
e2stablishment and operation of an Environmental Management Unit. Furthermore, OGDC
and SNGPL have agreed to ensure that the construction of facilities for the
development of gas and oil fields and pipelines will be undertaken in compliance
with the measures recommended by the NA report.
12.   As conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loans  (a) OGDC has agreed
to furnish to the Bank a report by an international reservoir engineering firm on
the estimated level of recoverable reserves at the Qadirpur Gas Field; (b) GOP has
agreed to approve the Project Concept document (PC-1) for the pipelines and
compressors to utilize Qadirpur gas; (c) OGDC and SNGPL have agreed to enter into
contracts regarding the guaranteed purchase by SNGPL (on a take-or-pay basis) (i)
of about 45 MMCFD of gas for a period of 15 years commencing in 1993 from the
Dhodak Gas Field; and (ii)  100 MMCFD of gas in 1993, to be increased to 200 MNCFD
in 1994 for a period of 20 years from the Qadirpur Gas Field; (d) OGDC has agreed
to select consultants to design a modern accounting system and establish a
comprehensive Management Information System, and appoint a director for its
technical services with suitable qualifications and experience; and (e) to promote
the gradual privatization of SNGPL, GOP has agreed to offer its existing equity
shares in SNGPL for sale to the general public so as to reduce its direct and
indirect shareholding to 40%.
13.   Rationale for Bank Involveaent.  The Bank's involvement in the proposed
Project provides an opportunity to support GOP's reform of Petroleum Policy and the
restructuring of the institutions in the petroleum subsector, particularly OGDC,
to enable Pakistan to attract larger private sector investments. It will also
support GOP and OGDC's initial steps to pave the way for privatization of OGDC's
technical services units.  Bank support for the proposed Project represents a
continuation of the assistance provided for the rationalization of energy
investments, restructuring the revenue earning entities in the sector in order to
reduce their reliance on the budget, and mobilizing additional external and
domestic resources for energy development, both from other donors and from the
private sector. Furthermore, the Bank's involvement in the proposed Project also
ensures that Project design and implementation include measures to mitigate any
adverse impact on the environment.
14.   Benefits.  The internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the proposed
Project, estimated at 56% is significantly higher than the opportunity cost of
capital of about 15%, primarily because, in oil and gas projects, the time elapsed
between investments and the accrual of revenues is relatively short, and because
the existing level of international prices for oil and gas is substantially higher
than the cost of expanding domestic supplies (including recurrent costs). This
difference presently accrues to GOP as a rent through the development surcharge on



-5-
oil and gas sales, and represents a significant contribution of resources by the
petroleum subsector towards the Government' s budget. As a result of implementing
the proposed Project, after-tax profits of OGDC would rise from about Re 2.4
billion in FY91 to about Re 3.6 billion by FY96. OGDC's expected payment of income
taxes from FY92 would generate additional revenues of about Rs 0.7 billicn p.a. on
average for the Government.   It is estimated that the proposed Project would
increase development surcharge receipts from SNGPL by about Rs 1.5 billion p.a.
primarily through an increase in the development surcharge on the sale of natural
gas, while an additional Rs 350 million p.a. would be contributed through the
surcharge on petroleum products beginning FY94.
15.   Pro±eBt Risks. In view of the sensitivity of the Project's returns to delays
in the realixation of Project benefits (IERR drops to 36% for a two-year delay),
measures have been taken, such as the contractual arrangements for gas supply
between OGDC and SNGPL to be on a take-or-pay basis, to minimize the delays. One
of the other risks of the Project is that its institutional reform objectives may
be jeopardized by the natural reluctance of a public sector agency (OGDC) to
implement radical changes in its modus operandl and organizational structure. The
Government and OGDC have participated directly in the design of OGDC's corporate
restructuring program and are fully committed to it. Their commitment is shown by
the fact that the reorganization of OGDC is underway and that the technical
assistance required for the corporate restructuring is under bidding. The other
risks of the proposed Project are those usually associated with oil and gas
development, such as the possibility of lower than anticipated production and
adverse impact on the environment. However, reservoir engineering studies to be
carried out by the operators, and independently confirmed by international firms
of repute, will reduce the production risks considerably. The EA carried out in
accordance with the Bank's requirements, together with the commitment of the
implementing agencies to implement the recommended measures, are designed to
mitigate any adverse impact on the environment.
16.   Other Risks.   The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan has recently given a
ruling that the Shariah does not permit the paynent or award of interest and thus,
has instructed the Government to modify a number of existing laws that currently
provide for payment of interest. The Government has filed an appeal with the
Supreme Court against the Shariah ruling, which has been stayed pending the outcome
of the appeal. If this Shariat Court ruling would stand, it might have serious
implications for the onlending arrangements under this Project, which include the
payment of interest on the proceeds by OGDC and SNGPL, and future Bank projects
with similar onlending arrangements. Depending on the ruling of the Supreme Court,
the onlending arrangements may need to be modified and the legal agreements
amended. As far as Pakistan's obligations under loan and credit agreements with
the Dank/IDA are concerned, these obligations are valid and enforceable under
international law, in accordance with the terms of those agreements and the General
Conditions of the Bank/IDA, notwithstanding any local law or judicial decision
regarding the payment of interest and other charges.
17.   Reccdtio*. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
