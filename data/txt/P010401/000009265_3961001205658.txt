SW Northen Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL)

Amct                         US$180 miflion equivalent
12M                    Twenty years, incluting a five-year grace period, at the Bank's stndad variable
intera trat.
Relendine rmw.               The inte    rate on onlent fun  to OGDC (US$85.0 m ion) and SNGPL
(US$S6.5 million) would have a mak-up of one-enth of the Dank's stdad
variable interest rat to GOP. Repayment wms would be the sam as those of
the Bank loan to GOP. Foreign exchange and interes rat risk would be bomr
by the beneficiaries.
}jocl Obiectivos:           The objectives of the proposed Project are to: (a) accelert the dovelopmet of
indigenous hydrcaos, utilizing privat sector resources to the mmum
extent possible; (b) ensure that such indigenously developed hydrocarbons each
the end consumers in an efficient manner; (c) enhance the commerci
orientation and operinal autonomy of the public sector entities in the subsector
to pave the way for a larger private sector role; and (d) strengthen the egulatowy
and policy-makdng functions of govermental agencies in the subsector to
facilitate larger private investments.
ProEdig 2DescrintioI:The proposed Project would include the following components: (a) developmnt
of oil and gas fields under joint ventures with the private sector (b) constrction
of gas pipelines and installation of compp,sson, and a Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) system (c) measres to mitigate the envizonmunta
impact of (a) and (b) above; (d) corporate restructuring of OGDC;
(e) institutional strengthening of MPNR including measures to implement the
GOP's new Petroleum Policy; and (t) technical assistance.
Bnfit:                       The interal economic rate of retum (IERR) of the proposed Project at 56% is
significantly higher than the opportmity cost of capital of about 15 %, primarily
because, in oil and gas projects the time elapsed between investmets and the
accral of revenues is relatively short. Furtemore, by rapidly incasing its
production of oil and gas, through the implentation of this project, OGDC
would be able to benefit from the curent high level of petroleum pnces and
hence increa  its revenue, of which aomal to the Govemment through taxes
would amount to about Rs 0.7 billion per annum (p.a.). In addition, the
proposed Project would inrease development sucharge receipts firom SNGPL
by about Rs 1.5 billion p.a. prmarily through an incra  in the sale of natural
gas, while an additional Rs 350 million p.a. would be contributed through the
surharge on petroleum pmducts beginning FY94.



In view of the sensitivity of the Project's reur  to delays in the realization of
project benefits (IERR drops to 36% for a two-year delay), messu  have been
taken, such as the contractual anangements for gas supply between OGDC and
SNGPL to be on a take or pay basis, which are designed to minimie the delays.
Another risk of the project is that its institutional reform objectives may be
jeopardized by the natural reluctance of a public sector agency (OGDC) to
implement ~e radical change in its modus gm- =di and organizational structure.
The Government and OGDC have participated directly in the design of OGDC's
corporate restructuring ptogram  and are fully committed to it.  Their
commitment is shown by the fact that the reorganizadon of OGDC is underway
and that the technical assistance required for the corporate restructurng is under
bidding.  This minimi   the risk of unsuccessful implementation of the
corporate restructuing of OGDC. Other risks are those usually associated with
oil and gas development, such as the possibility of lower than anticipated
production and adverse impact. on the environment. However, reservoir
engineerng studies are to be carried out by the operators, and independently
confirmed by intemational firms of repute, which would reduce the production
risks considerably. In addition, the Enviro  ri- Thct Assessment (EA)
carried out in accordance with the Bank's requirements, together with the
commitment of the implementing agencies to implement the recommended
measures, would mitigate the adverse impact on the environment. Other Risks.
The Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan has recently given a ruling that the
Sharia does not permit the payment or award of interest in any form. This
would have serious implications for the onlencing arrangements under this
project, which include the payment of interest on the proceeds by OGDC and
SNGPL, and future Bank projects with similar onlending arrangements. The
Government has filed an appeal against the Shariah ruling which has been stayed
fcr the moment. Depending on the rling of the Supreme Court, the onlending
arangements under the Project may be modified and the legal agreements
amended. Another rsk is that the Shariah Court may extend its rling on
inerest to existing intemational financial obligations. As far as Pakistan's
obligations under loan and credit agreements with the Bank/IDA are concemed,
these obligations are valid and enforceable under international law, in
accordance with the terms of those agreements and the General Conditions of
the Bank/MDA notwithstanding any local law or judicial decision rega[ding the
payment of intrest and other charges.

DOMESTIC ENERGY RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PRQTECT
Proid Description
A. Development of the OadirMur Gas Field (OGDC)
1.        The Qadirpur Gas Field is located in the Jacobad District of Sindh Province of Pakistan, between two
major producing fields, namely, Kandhkot to the north and Mari to the southeast. The field, which is in excess of
117 square kilometers in size, was discovered in 1990 as a result of drilling exploratory weUl Qx-I by the Qadirpur
Joint Venture. The working interest for the parties during the exploration phase was 10% for OGDC and 90% for
the other partners, whereas ownership during the development and production stage will be 75% for OGDC, and
the other partners, 9.5 % for Premier, 8.5 % for Burmah Oil, and 7% for PPL.
2.        In-house analysis by OGDC's reservoir engineering group of the data from production testing of the
discovery well Qx-1 and of delineation wel Qd-2 (which was driled some five kilometers north of the discovery
well) indicated that the field is a large gas field with reserves possibly in excess of 1.2 TCF. A second exploratory
well, Qx-2, located some three kilometers southeast of the discovery weUl was also drilled to evaluate a structurl
high observed on seismic maps, within the same area. The results from the driling of this wel raised the
confidence level of the discovery, thus encouraging OGDC and the Joint Venture Partners to submit to GOP a
3Declaration of Commerciality for the Qadirpur Gas Field'.
3.        However, at the insistence of the Bank and DGPC, and in order to furfther delineate the size of the
field, the Joint Venture was requested to driUl two additional delineation wells, Qd-3 and Qd-4 strategically situated
along the flanks of the structure. Both of these two delineation wells were drilled and found to be also productive,
thereby raising the volume of gas reserve estimates for the field to about 4 TCF.
4.        With the 'Declamtion of Commerciality', a two-phase development plan for the Qadirpur Gas Field
wa submitted to GOP. The Bank has reviewed this plan and found it satisfactory. The first phase comprises
drilling of two additional wells on the structure and for the installation of surface production facilities, to permit
production of some 100 MMCFD by June 1993. The second phase calls for drilling of three to four additional wells
which will make available an additional 100 MMCFD for a combined total of some 200 MMCFD by June 1994.
5.         Although OGDC has carried out an in-house reservoir engineering study of the Qadiipur Gas Field,
OGDC has recruited, as per Bank request, and in accordance with the Bank procedures and guidelines, Gaffney,
Cline and Associates (GCA), an international reservoir engineering firm, to confirm the in-place and recoverable
gas reserves of the Qadirpur Gas Field. The draft final report is under review by OGDC and the Bank. It is
expected that this study will be finalized by January 1992.
6.         OGDC's share of the cost for drilling the two delineation wells as well as the cost for the reservoir
engineering study would be met through retroactive financing arrangements under the proposed Project.
7.        Regarding the gas allocation, GOP is filly committed to utilize the gas from the Qadirpur Field through
the SNGPL system in accordance with the production schedule approved for the field, i.e. 100 MMCFD by
December 1992, and 200 MMCFD by December 1993. Accordingly, GOP has allocated the gas from this field
to the SNGPL system.

B. Development of the Kadanwari Gas Field (OGDC)
8.        The Kadanwari Gas Field is located in the rocky desert in the vicinity of Khairpur in Sindh P.ovince.
The field was discovered by the OGDC-LASMO Joint Venture, for which LASMO is the designated operator.
The ownership of the field during the exploration/appraisal phase is LASMO 35%, Kuwait Foreign Petroleum
Exploration (KUFPCO) 30%, IDEMITSU 30% and OGDC 5%. An application for declaring the Kadanwari Gas
Field as a commercial discovery was submitted by the Joint Venture Partners in February 1991 to DGPC on the
basis of the data obtained from the drilling of the discovery well Kd-1 and of the drilling of Gowar-1 delineation
well. The original documents in 'The Declaration of Commerciality' submitted by the Joint Venture partnership
to the GOP, indicate that the recoverable reserves of gas amounted to some 573 BCF, and that the field could
produce 100 MMCFD of gas for 10 years. However, on the basis of the data provided (seismic maps, well logs
and tests) of Kd-I and Gw-i, it was considered that the level of reserves quoted in the 'Declaration of
Commerciality" appeared optimistic. Nonetheless, development and delineation drilling continued, in an effort to
increase the confidence level of the reserves quoted and to continue to add proven reserves to those already
discovered.
9.        To this effect, Well Kd-3 was drilled near the discovery well, Kd-1, and it's success raised the
confidence level of the reserves volumes in the northern part of the Kadanwari Structure. Well Kd-4 was drilled
in the same geological unit of Kd-l but some 10 kilometers to the southeast. This well was also successful. On the
basis of the results from the delineation wells, DGPC, informed the Joint Venture Partnership that it was prepared
to accept 'The Declaration of Commerciality' of the Kadanwari Field, and has requested the joint venture to submit
a development plan for the project. However, Bank assistance for financing the development of the Kadanwari Gas
Field is dependent upon the outcome of a reservoir engineering study to be conducted by an independent
international reservoir engineering firm confirming the resuts and quantities of gas quoted by the Joint Venture
partnership.
10.       The gas expected to be produced from Kadanwari Gas Field has been allocated by GOP to Sui Southern
Gas Company (SSGC), and the Asian Development Bank has indicated its willingness to finance the pipelines
required to link the field with SSGC's main system.
C. Operation of the Badin Concession (GOP)
11.       The Badin Block Concession Agreement which dates to March 20, 1977, currently includes the
Government of Pakistan as one of the working interest partners with 40% of the Joint Venture. Union Texas -
Pakdstan (UTP), is designated as the Operator by the Joint Venture Partners, and Occidental Petroleum the other
partner with the remaining 30%. This joint venture was formed to develop and produce the oil and gas from the
Badin Concession. The concession covers a surface area of 3500 sq.mi. and is located in southern Pakistan, East
of the Indus River Valley in Badin, Hyderabad, Tharparker and Thatta districts.
12.       This concession is producing and delivering oil and gas from some 26 relatively small oil fields (with
one or two wells). By the end of 1990, the cumulative production from the fields was some 38 million barrels of
oil. The total capital investments and operating expenses over this time, amounts to slightly less than US$500
million. The reservoir engineering estimates of the remaining oil and gas reserves which are expected to be
produced from the existing fields and structures by the end of the concession period (Year 2008), will be some 106
million barrels of oil and some 600 BCF of gas. The gas produced will be sold to SSGC through a pipeline
connecting the Badin Field area with the SSGC pipeline which is located on the left bank of the Indus River.
13.       It is estimated that in order to achieve the production goals mentioned above, it will be necessary for
the Joint Venture to continue and invest an additional $307 million in capital goods and services and $360 million
for operating expenses over the concession.

14.       Currently, the Govemment of Pakistan's (GOP) interest is monitored through the Directorate General
of Petroleum Concession (OGDC) who in turn relies heavily on the assistance of the technical staff of OGDC. As
OGDC is also responsible for regulating the activities of all oil and gas exploration companies, its involvement in
the Badin Block constitutes a conflict of interest. Therefore, GOP is now considering transferring its assets in the
Badin Block Joint Venture to OGDC and has requested Bank's assistance in developing a formula for achieving this.
15.       The five-year investment program which has been developed to achieve the production goals mentioned
above, includes; (i) $12.2 million for drilling nine new wells and for the acquisition of additional geological
information, (ii) $41.5 million for equipping and work-over of old wells as required, buying oil production and
treatment equipment, flow lines, enhance oil recovery technology and other related services, and (iii) $52.7 million
in operating expenses.
D. Dhodak Gas Field Develonment (OGDC)
16.       Geologically, the Dhodak anticline (Dome) is a gentle asymmetrical anticline with the major axis in
the N NW by S SE direction. The anticline has been defined with the drilling of six wells, and is bound by major
reverse faults to the east and to the west, and reverse transversal faults to the south and north of the structure. The
overall thickness of gas reservoir is some 431 meters and extends through two distinct geological formations, the
Lower Ranikot and the Pab. The cap-rock for the system is a blanket shale which extends throughout the region.
17.       Within the unfaulted and relatively undisturbed central block of the Dhodak anticline, four wells have
already been drilled and these wells have defined the upper and lower limits of the reservoir:
a.    Well Dk-1, the discovery well, was suspended and abandoned at 2133 meters depth, after
drilling some 50 meters into the Pab Formation, when the rig went into a 'blowout' condition.
b.    Well Dk-2 was located about 500 meters to the north of Dk-1. The well was drilled as a
replacement well for Dk-1, and drilled down to 3004 meters. The well proved with nine
separate production tests, that the overall thickness of hydrocarbon bearing formation in excess
of 400 meters. The gas is found in all of the Lower Ranikot Formation and extending
downward, partially into the Pab Formation.
c.    Well Dk-3 was located some three kilometers south of Dk-1, and drilled down to 3060 meters.
The hydrocarbon system is only 132 meters thick in this well. But geophysical and geological
information subsequently indicated that the well was located across a major reverse fault
separating the smaller block in which Dk-3 was drilled, from the main body of the reservoir.
The probability that these two blocks are hydrodynamically connected has not been proven.
d.    Well Dk-4 was located some two kilometers NW of Dk-1 and drilled to 2489 meters. This
well was proven dry and abandoned.
e.    Well Dk-5 located about two kilometers S SE of Dk-1, drilled down to 2443 meters and found
the cap-rock to the gas reservoir at around -1525 meters and the gas/water level at -1807
meters sub-sea. The overall thickness of the hydrocarbon-bearing rock in this well is some
317 meters.
f.    Well Dk-6 is located at the highest point of the structure. In this well the cap-rock to the
system was logged at -1375 meters and the gas/water contact at -1807 meters sub-sea. The
overall thickness of hydrocarbon bearing rock in this well is some 432 meters.

18.       OGDC, with consultancy assistance, had completed a comprehensive computer simulation study of the
Dhodak field production characteristics. The study was financed by the Bank. Based on the result of the analysis
done in the study, the proven gas reserves of the Dhodak Gas Field are found within an undisturbed parallelogram,
which is about three kilometers wide by some five kilometers long. The area within this parallelogram is some 4000
acres. The maximum hydrocarbon thickness witiin this area is 430 meters (1400 feet). The average porosity of
the rocks which contain the gas is estimated to be some 13% to 15%. The irreducible water saturation of the rock
is estimated to be as low as 35%. The reservoir pressure that has been measured with bottom hole pressure gauges
and RFT's at -1660 meters sub-sea is 3225 psi. The estimated gas reserves is in excess of 600 BCF.
19.       Regarding the quality of the gas which is found in Dhodak, it is believed that the gas is not verticaly
homogeneous throughout the field. There appears to be a vertical gradation in the composition of the gas (ie. the
lower most gas appears to be richer with heavier hydrocarbon molecules than the gas at the top of the reservoir
which appears to be much leaner). In view of the fact that the reservoir consists of an extremely long hydrocarbon
column, the limiting factor for producing the field is the well design, therefore, future wells should be designed with
larger diameter tubing in order to reduce not only the friction losses in the tubing, but also to increase the
production capacity of each well.
20.        The production scheme which will ultimately be used to exploit the reservoir will depend on how the
fluid behavior evolves in the reservoir with production and time, and the priority OGDC will give for hydrocarbon
fluids in the future. Re-cycling of the Dhodak Gas, at this time, should not be a discarded option.
E. Dhodak Gas/Condensate Plant (OGDC)
21.        The gas/condensate processing plant will be designed to process 54 MMCFD reservoir fluid, producing
approximately 45-47 MMCFD of export gas, 180-190 tons/day of LPG and approximately 2500 BPD of condensate
fractionated into regular gasoline, 600 BPD of kerosene, 185 BPD of high speed diesel (HSD) and 125 BPD of
diesel fuel oil (DFO). The main elements of the processing and support facilities are:
a.    gathering system with 6" flow lines, manifold and test separators located adjacent to the field;
b.    a 24 km, 12" trunkline to transport the fluid to the processing plant on the river plain;
c.   feed inlet facilities at the processing plant (slug catcher, gas/liquid separators);
d.    gas dehydration;
e.    gas chilling, expansion and liquid recovery;
f.    condensate stabiliztion and LPG production;
g.    condensate fractionation into gasoline, kerosene and diesel, etc.;
h.    product storage and road tanker loading;
i.    all utilities and support system;
j.    permanent camp for 350 staff; and
k.    upgading access roads to the processing plant and field.

22.       Surface gathering facilities for seven wells will be installed in order to colect production from wells
and combine it into single production stream. The facilities include mains from wells, gathering manifolds and
metering instmumentation. A combined single stream of condensate gas would be transported via a 12-inch diameter,
24-km. pipeline to the processing plant. At the plant, the single fluid stream would enter into separation/slug
catcher facilities to be separated into raw gas, condensate and water.
23.       LPG Recovery Unit. An LPG recovery system wiUl be installed to extract LPG from the gas. The
dehydrated gas, after the removal of heavier hydrocarbons, will then be transmitted through the SNGPL spur-line
to Kot Addu. The composition of the pipeline quality gas at delivery point is shown in the table below. The liquids
recovered in the dew-point reduction section are then fed to de-ethanizer and de-butanizer columns from where LPG
and condensate oil (NGL) are recovered.
Component                          Mol Percent
Methane                                84.57
Ethane                                  7.89
Propane                                 1.03
Iso-Butane                              0.12
N-Butane                                0.07
Pentane                                 0.05

24.       Condensate Stabilization Unit and Storage. The unstabilized condensate from the separator is fed to
the condensate stabilizer unt where lighter hydrocarbons (gas) are removed. The stabilized condensate recovered
is then sent to the debutanizer. From the debutanizer the fluids are either sent to the topping unit for fractionation
or to the condensate storage tanks.
25.       Tom,ing Unit. The condensate fractionator splits the stabilized condensate into gasoline, kerosene,
diesel plus a residue which will be marketable as DFO. The feed stock to the topping unit will be provided from
storage hot condensate from the debutanizer. The feed stock is heated to achieve the required Feed Inlet
Temperature to the fractionator and flashed into the column. The unvaporized heavy portion of the condensate, is
then stripped to meet the DFO specifications.
26.       The processing facility at Dhodak will be designed and constructed to meet accepted engineering and
environmental standards. Design and construction specifications will include provision for monitoring of air and
effluent emission as well as disposal of solid waste. OGDC staff would be provided adequate training in use and
maintenance of pollution control and monitoring equipment.
F. Dhodak-Kot Addu Gas Pipeline (SNGPL)
27.       Construction of the 16-inch diameter Dhodak spur-line of 84 kms. in length to link Dhodak field with
the Kot Addu power plant, currently undergoing conversion to utilize domestic gas, would be under force account,
using SNGPL's own Project Department. The capacity of this pipeline would be 45 MMCFD of gas and would
be commissioned by January 1993. The standards for equipment and installation processes would conform to
international codes. The foreign exchange component at about US$2.0 million (16% of the total cost of US$13
million) is low, since SNGPL has decided to order the steel linepipe from local manufactuTers rather than from

abroad for this small size diameter pipeline. In addition, consultants would be hired to assist SNGPL on the design
of the Indus River crossing. Moreover, since the pipeline as proposed will be adjacent to the oil pipeline already
existing on the southern pillars of the Taunsa Barrage, no environmental problems are foreseen.
G. Pipelines and Compressors to Utilize Oadirpur Gas (SNGPL)
28.       OGDC, the Operator of the Qadirpur Gas Field, plans to supply SNGPL 100 MMCFD of pipeline
quality gas for transmission to Kot Addu power plant along the existing 18-inch diameter pipeline (less than 1.5%
carbon dioxide and less than 15 parts per million of hydrogen sulfide and about 890 BTU) by June 1993 to be
increased to 200 MMCFD by June 1994. In designing the system, SNGPL evaluated three pipeline diameters,
namely 18-inch, 20-inch, and 24-inch for eventually evacuating 200 MMCFD of Qadirpur gas. Ultimately, a 24-
unch pipeline was selected in order to minimize the pressure losses, enhance economics of operation and to
eventually increase gas deliveries. A 60-km., 24-inch diameter pipeline linking the Qadirpur Gas Field to the
existing 18-inch diameter pipeline (at the Guddu barrage) would be initially laid. The next phase would involve
replacement of two 24-km. sections of the existing 18-inch pipeline between the towns of Rahimyar Khan and Uch
by heavier gauge pipeline to mitigate stress corrosion downstream of AC-4 and AC-2 compressor stations. Both
phases would be constructed by a contractor selected on a competitive basis. The selected contractor would instal
the pipelines in accordance with international standards for pipeline equipment and installation including burial,
cathodic protection, routine patrol and maintenance, automatic monitoring, and remote controlled shut-off valves.
SNGPL plans to instal nine compressors at three sites, six of which wiU be procured under the proposed Project
and three will be relocated from existing compressor stations, where they are no longer required. The total instaled
compressor capacity of 36000 BHP (9 x 4000 BHP), would raise the 750 pounds per square inch (psig) field
delivery pressure to 1000 psig, the pipeline operating pressure.
H. Development of Sunervisorv Control and Data Acauisition (SCADAM
29.        SCADA systems are widely used by the gas industry to gather information from a number of
geographically dispersed sites/nodes to a central point. SNGPL has had data acquisition facilities instaUed under
previous Bank loans on portions of the main transmission line only to gather information on system operations, e.g.
flow rates and pressures, to facilitate load dispatching and remote control. If a SCADA system for SNGPL, which
has one of the more developed gas infastructures in the developing world, is to remotely control gas flow rates,
the installation of more complex and expensive remote-control valve operators and other equipment to cover the
remaining system as well as the proposed spur lines is necessary. It is envisaged that initially, equipment to monitor
gas flow rates would be installed for only large industrial consumers.
30.        Currently, SNGPL's master control station to remotely control parts of transmission system particularly
main valves and gas supply off-takes to power stations, through telemetry and telecontrol based on a VHF multi-
channel radio relay system, is located at Faisalabad. The SNGPL system stretches from Sui in Baluchistan to
Peshawar in the NWFP. It consists of about 2800 km of main/loop pipeline ranging from 6 to 24-inch diameter
and a total of 99000 BHP compression facilities installed at 10 different compressor stations. Tie present system
capacity is about 450 MMCFD, while under a recently approved Bank financed project, it would be increased to
about 800 MMCFD by construction of 215 km, 30-inch diameter pipeline and installation of 6x4000 BHP
compressors. The Bank under the recently completed (1990) SNGPL V Project (Loan 2324-PAK) had financed
telemetry and telecontrol system along the high pressure transmission line from Multan to Faisalabad. Additional,
telemetry/telecontrol facilities will be financed on the proposed spur line from Multan to Lahore, under the ongoing
Corporate Restructuning and System Expansion Project (Loan 3252-PAK). The proposed Project would financed
extension of this facility and its integration with the existing system, and as such is an important aspect of the
utilities future development.

31.        The proposed amount allocated for expanding SCADA facilities for the trsnsmission system (approx.
US$10 million) is based on an appraisal of a possible system design, equipment specification and cost estimates
undertaken by the Borrower to improve the operational efficiency of the system, which is affected by significant
gas load fluctuations and load shedding prevailing in the colder northern regions of Pakistan. In view of the
technically complex nature of the SCADA equipment to be procured and installed under this project, financing for
consultancy sevices to design and assist SNGPL in the installation of SCADA system are being provided. The
consultants are expected to design the computerized SCADA system in order to continuously receive and analyze
data from all major sources including underground storage. The SCADA system would be developed in four phases
as follows: (i) system design; (ii) development of technical specifications; (iii) project management and
supervision; and (iv) institutional development aspects for efficient operation of the installed SCADA system.

DOM C            ENERGY RESOURCES DEVELOPPMENT PRO.lECT
Environmental hnpact Assessment Stmrmara
A. Introduction
1.            An envirokmental screening for the Badin Block, Kadanwari, Qadirpur and Dhodak fields was
conducted during pre-appraisal to identify the environmental impacts that are likely to result from the projected
development activity in each of the areas. Such environmental screening indicated that the development of Badin
Block and Kadanwari fields do not have adverse environmental impacts as explained below. However, Qadirpur and
the Dhodak development required that an environmental impact assessment be prepared in order to address the
possible adverse impact on the environment identified during the environmental screening. Accordingly, the Project
falls under the environmental screening category 'A consistent with Operational Directive 4.00, Annex A. The
limited environmental impact assessments for the Qadirpur and Dhodak Gas fields were prepared by OGDC and for
the trnsmission pipelines were prepared by SNGPL with the assistance of qualified and experienced Pakistani
consultants in accordance with terms of reference approved by the Bank. The mitigating measures for the two
components (gas development and pipeline transmission) were reviewed and approved by the Government of Palistan.
The environmental consequences, impacts and mitigating measures for both fields including gas transmission are
explained in the EA report. Extensive local consultation was performed with 12 settlement villages in Dhodak and
21 villages and settlement in Qadirpur. Copies of all environmental documents including Government approval to
release the EA reports to the Executive Directors, are available in the Project File.
B. Environmental Screening
2.            The Badin Block concession is situated in a deltaic plain close to the sea level; 50% of the land
lies in desertic to semi-arid areas, while the other 50% of the land is cultivated. The devtlopment of oil and gas
fields funded under the project are situlated in the desert area. UTP as the main operator, has been exploring for
oil and gas since 1977 and is applying its corporate environmental guidelines which meet United States
Environmental Protection Agency standards. A review of UTP's gas facilities and gas development plan indicates
that good operting practices and safety are being followed. Field inspection, including testing safety equipment,
is made on a regular basis and an emergency response program is established. UTP has appointed Pakistani
engineers to monitor all environmental effects of its operations. A review of llTP's past performance, as well as
its environmental guidelines, indicates that UTP has been and will continue to be very conscious about protecting
the enviromnent.
3.            The Kadanwari Gas Field is located in a rocky semi-arid plain surrounded by sand dunes. The
three exploration wells have been drilled in the desert far from human and wildlife habitat. The operator LASMO
and its drilling contractor (Sedco Forex) abide by comprehensive environmental standards and procedures which
are set by their Corporate office in London. The appraisal mission which visited the field was satisfied with
LASMO's drilling and work practice. All wastes were disposed of in envirommentally sound landfills; drilling sites
using accepted reclamation practices were restored to their original conditions after drilling was completed. All field
staff and technicians were trained on safety and emergency operations.
4.            The Qadirpur gas field lies in a floodplain area between the Indus river and a flood control levee.
The projected flood level in Qadirpur was estimated to be at approximately 235 ft. elevation between the months
of July and September. The principal environmental concerns are: (a) protecting the well heads and gas production
facilities during flooding since damage to these could affect surface and groundwater with concomitant effect on
- 46 -



Annex 2.2
Page 2 of 3
population, vegetation, wildlife and land uses; (b) avoiding adverse impact on wildlife which includes a rare species
of fresh-water blind dolphins called the Indus dolphin, Hog deer and migratory waterfowls; and (c) land acquisition.
S.             The Dhodak condensate field is situated in an uninhabited mountain range and the proposed
processing plant would be situated near Kot Qaisarini village graveyard. While the condensate processing plant and
its auxiliary facilities were found to have no significant adverse environmental impact, the Qaisarini burial area is
of religious imporance to the local villagers. In addition, issues of land acquisition need to be addressed.
6.             As regards the gas transmission pipelines, the Qadirpur Spur line will be 60 kms. long and will
be parallel to an existing feeder canal for about 56 kms., then cut across the floodplain to connect with the Sui main
trunkline at the Guddu barrage across Indus river. The Dhodak-Kot Addu pipeline, will be 84 kms. long and will
be crossing the Indus River at the Taunsa barrage. The principal environmental concerns in the construction and
operation of the proposed gas transmission lines are the routing of the lines in relation to settlements, safety features
and additionally for the Dhodak-Kot Addu line, crossing of the Indus River at the Taunsa barrage.
C. Mitigation Measures
Oadirpur Field
7.     Flood Protetion: In order to protect the well heads from floods, OGDC has constructed 9-foot high pads
protected with cement and riprap for the recently drilled sites. OGDC plans to continue this practice as necessary,
maing appropriate height adjustments to reflect differences in local topography. This provides 1 to 2 feet of
freeboard at the projected floods. Examination of one completed wellsite confirmed the integrity of the design and
cnstruction of the field structures. The proposed gas gathering facilities will be buried below plow depth and gas
production facilities will be located outside the flooding area.
S.     Wildlife Protection. In order to avoid any impact on the Indus dolphins, OGDC will maintain at least a
100-meter buffer zone off the river aad al active channels. OGDC will also coordinate its development activities
with the Sindh Wildlife Board in order to preserve free passage of the Hog deer and curtail illegal hunting of the
migratory waterfowl.
9.     Land Aqisition. Land for the well sites (4 acres each) and for the processing area (40-80 acres), will
be acquired through negotiations with owners and payment of fair market value. GGDC has already initiated the
process through GOP's Land Revenue Office which is responsible for all state compensations. Consultations with
local officials and villagers indicated a very favorable attitude toward the proposed development. Ninety-nine
percent of those inteaviewed felt that the overal effect of the project on the local community world be positive and
they will be wiLlng to sell or lease their lands.
Dhodak Condensate Prosing Plant.,
10.    gavEyd. In reference to the religious beliefs of the Qaisarini villagers, OGDC will leave a 100-meter
budfer zone between the plant site and the burinl area. Extensive consultations with the local community indicate
that the new location of the Dhodak faciity as sited would not be considered to have an adverse impact on the burial
area, which will be fenced by OGDC to safeguard the buffer zone as requested by the villagers.
11.    Iand c&Maisio. Land for the Dhodak plant site and colony (300 acres of desertic lands) will be acquired
through negotiations with owners by the Land Revenue Office and fair market value vvill be paid by OGDC. This
land is not cultivated but left as a potential investment by landowners. However, the majority of the population
works on fanming in agricultual lnds adjacent to the project site. Consultations with !ocal officials and villagers
idicated a very favorable attitude toward the proposed development. Vilagers are wilng to sell their lands,
- 47 -



Annex 2.2
Page 3 of 3
though O&DC now plans to buy only a portion of the am originally identified for purchase. OGO)C has also
agreed to hire villagers as semi-skilled laborers in the new gas processing plant.
Gas TransMission Pipelines
12.    With a view to minimizing the impact on population, the route survey carried out by aerial and ground
survey for the two pipelines indicates that five villages and habitations have been avoided to a large extent with a
distance of 2-4 kms from the village. Construction and operation will follow international standards for pipeline
practices, with burial, cathodic protection, routine patrol and maintenance, automatic monitoring, remote-controlled
shut-off valves, and an emergency rsponse capability. Site investigations indicated that crossing the Indus River
at the Taunsa barrage as proposed presents no environmental problems since the pipeline will be constructed under
the bridge, on the pilars extended to the northern side and away from an oil pipeline already existing on the
southern pillars of the bridge.
Environmental Management and Safety
13     The EA report recommended that OGDC strengthen its environmental management capabilities to ensure
that OGDC's activities are environmentally sound and sustainable. OGDC has, therefore, agreed to establish an
environmental management unit within OGDC reorganization. The Environmental Management Unit will be
responsible for all the envirommental functions related to oil and gas activities. In order to specifically address the
mitigating measures identified in the EA, which indicated that no safety manuals currently exist for oil drilling
operations in OGDC. OGDC should agree to submit to the Bank by September 1992 the following safety manuals
which will be prepared with the assistance of international consultants:
*      General safety guidelines for exploration and protection;
*      employee safety manual;
*      work authorization safety procedures;
o      disaster recovery plan; and
o      opeating guidelines for good oil field practices and for restoration procedures for all OGDC
concessions.

DOMESTIC ENERGY -RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL RESOURCES
ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF TECHNICAL DIRECTQRATES
1.            Directorate General Petroleum Concessions (DGPC). DGPC functions as a regulatory body for
the implementation of the Pakistan Petroleum (Exploration and Production) Rules 1986. These rles provide the
overall framework under which any (domestic or foreign) company can apply for a Reconnaissance Permit (RP),
an Exploration Licence (EL) or a Development and Production Lse  (DPL) for exploration and production of oil
and gas in Pakistan. DGPC's main areas of operation include:
(a)    Review of applications received from oil companies for granting RP, EL or DPL, negotiation and
finalization of concession agreements;
(b)    Review of proposed work programmes, (including survey activities, drilling, production and
development plans), approval and monitoring of the implementation of these programmes
(including well commencement, work-over, testing, plugging and abandonment);
(c)    Compilation of information regarding drilling, exploration and production activities, teceipts of
rents, royalties, etc;
(d)    Administration of GOP's interest in joint ventures; and
(e)    Provision of policy advice to the Govermment.
2.            DGPC has an allocated staff strength of 20 officers, along with the required support staff. These
are organized into three sections dealing with Exploration, Production and Data Management activities respectively.
Of this allocated strength, 11 positions were filled and 9 were vacant as of June 1990. While the fact that almost
half the total staff positions are vacant is by itself a cause for concern, a more serious issue is the fact that two of
the three aenior positions-that of Director (Production) and Director (Data Management)-are also vacant at present.
To complement its existing resources DGPC presently obtains specialist/technical advice and facilities (e.g. in the
interpretation of seismic and geological data, economic modelling, storage of data and digital tapes, etc.) ftom other
organizations, particularly OGDC. These issues have been brought to the attention of GOP as they were highlighted
in the recently completed study by USAID. GOP assured the mission that these vacancies would be filled as soon
as possible and in particular that consuttants would be provided to complement the activities of DGPC during the
implementation of the recommendations of the USAID study.
3.            Directorate General Oil (DGO). The Directorate General Oil (DGO) is assigned the responsibility
of implementing GOP policies regarding the import, refining and distribution of petroleum products. Its
responsibilities include:
(a)    Contracting for import of crude oil and deficit petroleum products;
(b)    Supervision of local refinery operations, including the determination of ex-refinery prices;
(c)    Allocation and distribution of petroleum products among various regions, and supervision and
monitoring of retail operations; and
(d)    Preparation of recommendations regarding the retail pricing of petroleum products for approval
by the Cabinet.

4.             DGO presently has an allocated staff strength of 27 officers, of which 18 are filled at present.
These are organized into 5 sections", each headed by a Director, dealing with refining, oil movement, marketing
operations, systems, and computer data management respectively. For the new Sections (i.e. systems and computer
data management) only one position each - that of Director -has been created, while the necessary supporting
positions have not been created as yet. The staffing position further indicates that while at the senior level (Deputy
Directors and Directors) the positions have generally been filledM, at the worldng level (i.e. Assistant Directors
and Research Officers) 5 out of the 14 positions are vacant.
5.             DGO's most important functions are the contracting of imports of deficit petroleum products, the
allocation of imported crude to local refineries and finished products to various regions. For this purpose DGO
coordinates the operations of two distribution companies, one in the public sector (Pakistan State Oil), and the other
in the private sector (Pakistan Burmah Shell) and a number of private trucking companies that are engaged in the
tnmsportation of crude oil and petroleum products.
6.             Directorate General Gas (DGG). DOG  is the Govermment's regulatory body for the gas sub-
sector, and its major functions in that capacity include:
(a)    Supervision of the operations of gas transmission and distribution companies, including review of
their financial performance, investment programs and resource requirements;
(b)    Developing rules and procedures for gas allocation to various regions and consumer categories,
in accordance with the priorities fixed by the ECC;
(c)    Preparing proposals for adjustments in the level and structure of consumer gas prices, for
consideration and approval by the ECC/Cabinet Committee on Energy; and
(d)    Regulating the operations of a number of private companies that are involved in the marketing and
distribution of LPG.
7.             DGG presently has an allocated strength of 23 professional staff, along with the required support
staff. Tnese staff have been assigned to two technical sections (dealing with gas and LPG operations respectively)
and one section which handles administrative matters. While at present only one position in DGG is vacan', the
Directorate has acquired the services of three professionals from DGNRER and Sui Southem Gas Company on
deputation. Under the Corporate Restructuring and System Expansion Project, the Government has agreed to carry
out a study to develop proposals for upgrading DGG's regulatory capabilities. This review would develop a work
program for DGG to efficiently carry out its regulatory responsibilities, upgrading the technical capabilities of staff
through training programmes, provision of equipment (computer hardware and software) to develop a data base for
the gas sub-sector, and consultancy services for specialized studies.
8.             Pirectorate General New and Renewable Ena  Resouarce (DGNRER). DGNRER is expected
to develop and implement policies and programs in the areas of biomass, fuelwood, solar, wind, mini-hydroelectric
I/ Two of these sections (relating to Systems and Computer Data Management) have been newly created, in order to cater to the
requiremets for seting up and operati a efinery simulation model, as agreed under ESLII.
2/ With the exception of the new positions, i.e., Director Systems and Director Computer Data Management.
I/ In this regard the staffing position of DOG is mucb better tham that of a!l the other Ditectoat, where between onquasr to one-
third of the exdsting positions are vacant.

and other renewable forms of energy. In addition, DGNRER is required to compile and publish annualy, in the
form of the Energy Yearbook, a data-base on the energy sector. However, to date DGNRER has continued to exist
in a sort of vacuum, and its operations have never been filly integrated with the work program of the Ministry of
Petroleum and Natural Resources. The major reason for this state of affairs is that adequate staff has not been
assigned to DGNRER for it to be able to develop and implement a long term work program. At present DGNRER
has an allocated staff strength of 10 officers; however, only one position is presently filled!/. GOP is currently
reviewing the options of transferring DGNRER or its responsibilities to the Energy Wing of Planning Division or
to the Ministry of Science and Technology, but there has been no definite decision on these matters as yet.
9.             DGNRER's past activities have included setting up (with bilateral donor assistance) a number of
demonstration projects using photo-voltaic (PV) power systems for the electrification of remote villages. However,
as DGNRER has been unable to effectively coordinate its operations with WAPDA e.g. to identify areas where
extension of the national grid is not feasible, investigating consumer acceptance of PV technology as a viable option
for vilage electrification, improving its own managerial and advisory capabilities, these activities have not resulted
in the sustained development of PV as a means for viUlage electrification. Similarly DGNRER has attempted to
popularize through demonstrations the viability of village level bio-gas plants as a source of household fuel (as a
substitute for kerosene); the large scale acceptance of such plants, however, has been limited, as inadequate attention
being devoted to their acceptability among the beneficiaries.
10.            Hydrocarbon Develogment hIstitute of Pakistan (HDIP1. HDIP was set up in 1975 as an
autonomous organization under MPNR to serve as the n-tional institution responsible for research and development
(R&D) in the petroleum subsector. HDIP's main areas of activity include:
(a)    Carrying out basin studies - including field surveys, source rock geochemistry, geological and
geophysical services - to support petroleum exploration and development;
(b)    Providing analytical and laboratory facilities for testing, evaluation and quality control of cnude
oil and petroleum products, developing specifications for these products as wen as for oil and gas
industry equipment; and
(c)    Undertaking research in the areas of interfuel substitution, enhanced oil recovery, combustion
engineering, petroleum conservation, and the development of indigenous technologies for
processing oil and gas.
11.            HDIP presently has an overal staff strength of about 300, of which around 70 are professionals,
located at the head office, and at HDIP's laboratories in Islamabad and the four provincial capitals. The available
laboratory facilities alow HDIP to (i) carry out geological and geochemical analyses on source rock/core samples,
and chemical analyses of crude oil and petroleum products in accordance with internationally accepted standards;
(ii) evaluate cmdes/lube oils to ascertain their yields and lubricant characteristics, and carry out pilot plant studies
for process development and training, to assist the refineries; and (iii) conduct research in various fields - e.g.,
developing alternate and additional energy sources and bio-detergents for oil spill clean-up, evaluating the
combustion efficiency of burners, etc. HDIP also publishes a six-monthly Journal, the Pakistan Journal of
Hydrocarbon Research, and arranges periodic seminars on areas of interest in the petroleum subsector.
It lhis is the Director General's positon which, incidentally, is filled as an additional charge at present.

Apfgions,
1.     Capia Costs.
-      All project costs are calculated in 1991 prices; trnusfer paymnts (including taxes and duties)
and price contingencies have been excluded. Locd costs ae expressed in their equivalent
border prices by using a conversion factor of 0.77 of the domestic wage rate, sad 0.80 of the
domestic price for capital goods.
-      All coss incurred prior to 1991 (i.e. sunk costs) have been excluded.
2.     Econmic Benefit Estimates.
-       qMinimum benefits are taken into account because environmental, training and technical
assistance benefits are excluded.
-      A;l benefit estimates are based on the Bank's forecast of oil prices, expressed in constant 1990
dollars.
All gas volumes are converd to their calorific value equivalent using the thermal value of
each gas.
3.     Opemtin Costs
-      Field operating costs include pipeline mainteance and operating costs, and exclude tanusfer
payments.
- -    Operating costs consist of 75% local costs and 2S% foreign costs; loca costs comprise labor
(95%) and materials (5%).
Production, cost and benefit streams under the proposed project and the Internal Economic Rate of
Retun (IERR) calculation for the base case are listed separaly. The bas cm  IERR is 55%.
Sienslitiit Analvzs.s
The Project's rate of retn can be negatively affectd by:
(i)        Capital cost overrun (by 20%)                                     45.6%
(ii)       Shortfall in projected revenues (of 20%)                          37.5%
(iii)      Delay in Project implementation (by 2 years)                      35.0%
Even under the worst case scenario i.e. a delay of 2 years in project implementation the IMR remains higher
tha 35%.
