MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$28 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate,
and would help finance a Second Technical Assistance Project for Public and Private Provision of
Infrastructure.
2.          Background.  After a quarter century of steadily rising incomes, Indonesia's
economy has become more diversified, less dependent on oil, more industrialized, more urbanized,
increasingly driven by private initiatives and much more integrated into the global economy.
Moreover, Indonesia's record on poverty reduction since the mid-1960's has been impressive by
any international measure. Longer-run development challenges facing the country are now being
shaped by fundamental structural transformations underway such as (a) the shift from a primarily
natural resource-based economy to a more human capital productivity-based economy; (b) the
transition from a largely rural economy to a more urban society, especially in Java, and the
consequent environmental management, social and infrastructure challenges; and (c) a political
transition featuring a more open debate of public policy issues and a rethinking of the role of the
Government, private sector and community organizations.  Enhanced competitiveness and
poverty reduction through increased deregulation, reduced cost of finance and improved
infrastructure services are key objectives of Indonesia's development strategy.
3.           The Infrastructure Sector.  Recognizing the critical role of infrastructure
development in sustaining rapid economic growth and in reducing poverty during the last 15
years, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has allocated over 40 percent of development
expenditure to infrastructure, which led to a rapid increase in the infrastructure stock. However,
high urban and industrial growth rates are outpacing the supply of infrastructure services,
resulting in a substantial unmet demand. Concurrently, economic diversification and the general
rise in living standards are leading to an increasing premium on quality, reliability and variety of
infrastructure services.  The investment program for the major infrastructure sub-sectors --
power, telecommunications, transport, municipal services -- under the current (1994-99) five-year
plan (Repelita VI) is likely to be about six percent of GDP, or about US$75 billion. This is an
increase of approximately one percentage point of GDP over Repelita V, and represents a
reasonable compromise between infrastructure needs and macroeconomic stability. Increasing the
level of investment in infrastructure will not suffice in itself, and equal importance needs to be
given to the efficient utilization of assets and achieving the greatest economy in planning and
construction of facilities and service delivery operations.
4.           The quest for cost-effectiveness, coupled with the need to mobilize additional
financial resources, lies behind the changing role of the Government, particularly at the center,
from directly supplying most services to relying more on the private sector and markets as well as
on local governments. Like many other developing countries, however, Indonesia is still at an



-2-
early stage in this transition with unclear frameworks for regulation and governance, fragmented
institutional responsibilities and a need to update policies, technical standards and financial
arrangements. The systemic and cross sectoral nature of these challenges means that the national
planning agency (BAPPENAS) must pay more attention to strategy design, program evaluation
and monitoring, in addition to taking a leading role in weaning central ministries away from
project execution and into policy making and technical advisory functions.
5.           The vast geographic expanse of Indonesia and the wide disparity in conditions
across the regions pose a particular challenge for infrastructure development. While the nation's
fiscal structure implies that central resources will remain important for financing, nevertheless the
service standards and designs have to be tailored to location specific needs, physical conditions
and economic capacities which puts a great premium on effective decision making at local levels.
As GOI shifts towards increased responsibility of local agencies in the planning and delivery of
services, the latter would need considerable assistance and capacity building to face this new
challenge.
6.           Private  financing  will play  an  increasing  role  in  power  generation,
telecommunications, water supply, mass transit, ports and toll roads, in order to free public
resources for other vital needs such as other roads, including rural roads, health and education.
Of the US$75 billion projected for infrastructure investment during Repelita VI, about US$21
billion (28%) is envisaged from private sources. Thus far, enhanced management efficiency has
not been a driving motivation for GOI to seek increased private sector participation in
infrastructure. Concessions to date have mostly been awarded after direct negotiations usually
based on unsolicited proposals. A "deal-by-deal" approach slows progress, adds risk, results in
high costs and consumes scarce managerial and technical resources; without greater transparency
and competition, efficiency gains expected from the private sector may not materialize.
Development of a suitable regulatory framework is therefore critical.
7.           As economic  activity  and  the  scale  of infrastructure  required  expand,
environmental sustainability is increasingly an issue, particularly in urban centers and their
periphery. Population concentration and congestion often mean dealing with difficult resettlement
issues when building roads, drains or power plants. Effective protection of Indonesia's rich
natural and cultural resources requires close integration of sound environmental and social
practices into standard operating procedures and monitoring of infrastructure projects. Indeed, of
the five top "brown" concems identified recently, four -- water supply, sewerage and
environmental sanitation, solid waste management, and vehicle emissions -- are directly related to
infrastructure.
8.           Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. Overall, the Bank's experience with
Technical Assistance (TA) in Indonesia has generally been good. In the early 1990s, GOI's
annual expenditure on TA has averaged US$500 million per year, of which the Bank has financed
approximately US$200 million.  About 75 percent of Bank support has been for project
preparation, supervision and implementation support, and has generally been effective. TA for
capacity building and policy studies has had mixed results, particularly where the investment
programs that it was coupled with were not the appropriate vehicle for institutional development;
however, the results of demand-driven TA, including free-standing projects have been positive. A
common problem affecting execution has been the significant delay in the appointment of
consultants, often due to GOI's policy on fixed billing rates and the imposition of fixed



-3-
local/foreign consulting inputs which were in effect until late 1994 . This and other issues related
to TA were addressed in the 1994 Country Portfolio Performance Review and an Action Plan was
agreed; new GOI regulations were issued in early 1995. During negotiations, it will be agreed
that an independent review of the efficiency and effectiveness of provision of TA services in
Indonesia and a forward looking analysis of its impact on institutional development would be
carried out.
9.           The first Technical Assistance Project for Private and Public Provision of
Infrastructure (TAP4I-1) financed by Loan 3385-IND (US$30 million), signed in August 1991 is
having a high developmental impact. It is financing reviews by panels of independent experts,
program formnulation by high-level advisors or in-house study teams, and pre-investment and
engineering studies. Key technical assistance services already completed include: (a) assistance to
GOI's Private Power Team in evaluating bids and negotiations related to Paiton I, Indonesia's
first Build, Own, Operate (BOO) power project which closed in April this year; (b) assistance to
BAPPENAS with the integration of macro, sectoral, and spatial planning; (c) independent review
of a private Build, Own, Op. :ate, Trans.. r (BOOT) prcposal for bulk water supply to serve the
Surabaya region; and (d) the initial preparation of the Village Infrastructure Project in support of
GOI's poverty reduction program. Other activities underway relate, inter alia, to the urban
transport network in Surabaya; preparation of the proposed Strategic Urban Road Infrastructure
Project priority links in the proposed Java East-West toll road; institutional reform of the railway
subsector; strategy for private participation in the electric power sector; and port locations in
West Java and South Sumatra.
10.          After a slow start, the performance of TAP4I-1 has been increasingly good since
1993. The Project MvIanagement Unit (PMU), headed by a senior official from BAPPENAS and
guided by a Steering Committee chaired by the Vice-Chairman of BAPPENAS, has addressed the
key problems that initially impeded implementation. Standardized procedures for the employment
of consultants, consistent with Bank guidelines, have contributed to a more flexible GOI position
on billing rates. Arrangements are in place to develop clear and focused terms of reference, to
establish short lists, to evaluate proposals and to negotiate contracts. The disbursement lag is
almost fully attributable to the original delay; activities presently contracted or underway
represent about 90 percent of the loan amount. The closing date has been extended by one year
to Septemnber 30, 1995, at which date, about US$28 million would have been committed and
about US$18 million disbursed. GOI has requested a second extension until September 30, 1996,
and also seeks additional financing under a follow-on project -- the proposed project --
incorporating thie lessons learned from the first project, to support a backlog of pending
applications.
11.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is fully consistent with the
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, discuased by the Board on March 21,
1995. The CAS highlights the need to enhance competitiveness of the Indonesian economy and
reduce poverty, inter alia, through better infrastructure services provided in an environmentally
sustainable manner while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The proposed project provides
direct support for implementing key operational features of the CAS. namely decentralized
region-specific investment projects, complementarity and balance between public and private
investment, upstream integration of environment and resettlement concerns, as well as special
attention to management of technical assistance in the portfolio.



- 4 -
12.          As mentioned in the CAS, GOI is seeking advice in three areas regarding private
provision of infrastructure: (a) striking the appropriate balance between the public and private
roles; (b) developing sector policy and a regulatory framework for private entry; and (c) analyzing
the implications for debt management and the financial sector. As demonstrated by the first
project, some of the highest value interventions require quick response in order to take advantage
of "windows of opportunity" which are critically important in private ventures, or to review deals
that may not always be in the interest of the public at large.  Such activities do not lend
themselves easily to funding by other mechanisms, such as the project preparation facility or
"piggy backing" onto other investment loans. More strategically, if an acceptable enabling
environment and regulatory framework for private participation is not put in place rapidly, the
growing interest among foreign and domestic investors in power generation, telecommunications,
water supply, mass transit, ports and toll roads could shift to other countries of the region. The
proposed project would therefore address concerns that international investors may have, in
particular with regards to modern commercial transactions.
13.          As also described in the CAS, GOI and the Bank have adopted in recent years a
more rigorous approach in scrutinizing the need and cost of TA and studies financed under
investment projects and in reviewing proposals to reallocate unused funds. GOI would also like
to strengthen the management of project preparation and encourage more discipline in the use of
TA funds for this purpose; the proposed project provides the vehicle to do this. Also, the shift in
the composition of the Bank's lending program towards more decentralized investments provides
a compelling rationale for the proposed project by offering local government agencies TA to
prepare infrastructure projects.
14.          Project Objectives: The proposed project will assist Indonesia to: (a) assess
strategic priorities for reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; (b) develop an updated strategy for
public-private partnerships and suitable frameworks for private participation in provision of
infrastructure services; (c) redefine the relative roles of the central and local authorities in the
identification, preparation and implementation of infrastructure projects; and (d) enhance program
evaluation capability within BAPPENAS and regional planning bodies and project preparation and
implementation capabilities (including development of sound environmental and social practices)
in line agencies and local governments responsible for various infrastructure investments.
15.          Project Description. The proposed project would support the preparation of: (a)
national sector policies and planning studies; (b) strategies to develop institutions and design
regulation to strengthen public/private partnership in the provision of infrastructure services; and
(c) feasibility studies, engineering designs -- for public projects --, environmental and resettlement
assessments and remedial plans. It would also include reviews by independent experts of studies
as well as unsolicited proposals by private investors, and audits of selected major assignments to
evaluate their impact of institutional development. Finally, it would finance the training of staff of
the PMU and the various project implementation units (PIUs) in the selection, monitoring and
evaluation of TA  services, project management,  private provision of infrastructure, and
negotiating techniques. The main focus of TAP4I-2 is on regional planning, power generation
and distribution, ports, toll roads, transport and communication, water supply and environmental
sanitation and water resources management.
16.          Project Cost and Financing Plan. Schedule A provides details of project costs and
financing. Schedule B sets out the amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement.



-5-
Schedule C summarizes key processing events. The status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia
is given in Schedule D. No Staff Appraisal Report was prepared.
17.         Project Implementation. The PMU established under TAP4I-1 would have the
overall responsibility for implementing the proposed project. It would continue to provide
assistance to the various PIUs of the central, provincial and local governments agencies
participating in the project for the preparation of project documentation packages (PDPs),
supervision and monitoring of TA services. The PMU has prepared a project implementation
manual (PlM) designed to provide clear guidance to PIUs and standard PDPs and contractual
documents fully consistent with Bank guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). The proposed project is
expected to be implemented during a four year period.
18.         Project Sustainability. Improved management of TA services has been identified
as a key element to increase project ownership and therefore its eventual overall success.
19.         Environmental and Social Impact. The proposed project has been classified in
environmental category C.  It could finance generic studies on infrastructure related
environmental issues. Also, appropriate provision for the preparation of environmental and
resettlement assessments and remedial plans consistent with Bank and GOI procedures would be
incorporated in terms of reference for feasibility studies and engineering designs whenever
relevant.
20.         Impact on Poverty. While the proposed project has little direct impact on poverty,
it will support increased access to basic infrastructure services which has been recognized as a key
contributor to Indonesia's impressive record on poverty reduction.
21.         Actions to be Taken: during negotiations, the following was agreed:
(a)   GOI would maintain, throughout implementation of the proposed project a PMU
established in BAPPENAS and headed by a senior official of BAPPENAS, with
competent and qualified staff in adequate numbers;
(b)   the PMU would furnish to the Bank for review and comments sub-projects
proposals including TORs for studies and training programs to be carried out
during the next 12 months, by not later than September 30 of each year starting
not later than September 30, 1996;
(c)   the PMU would furnish to the Bank for review and comments quarterly reports
monitoring and evaluating progress achieved in project implementation, in
accordance with performance indicators, and activities carried out during the
preceding three months and describing measures recommended to ensure the
efficient carrying out of the proposed project during the next three months, starting
not later than December 31, 1995;
(d)   the PMU would carry out technical audits, aimed at reviewing performance of
consultants of selected completed sub-projects and training programs, in



- 6-
accordance with TORs acceptable to the Bank, and furnish to the Bank for review
and comments the recommendations of these audits; and
(e)   GOI would carry out , in accordance with TORs satisfactory to the Bank, a
comprehensive review of externally financed TA received by GOI to assess the
effectiveness and efficiency of such TA and prepare an analysis of its impact on
institutional development; furnish it to the Bank for review not later than May 31,
1997; and review the finding and recommendations of such assessment and
analysis with the Bank by not later than September 30, 1997.
22.          Project Benefits and Risks. The principal benefit of the proposed project would be
its support to GOI's effort in the provision of sustainable infrastructure services, the strengthening
of BAPPENAS' focus on strategic issues and the overall decentralization process in project
preparation. A second benefit would be the continued improvement in the management of TA
services resulting from the combination of a pro-active Steering Committee and a competent
PMU. A third benefit would be the replenishment of the pipeline of adequately prepared and
bankable infrastructure projects that has become somewhat depleted.
24.          Risks pertaining to slow appointment of consultants would be minirnized by the
role the PMU would play in providing assistance to the various PIUs. Other risks are that too
many studies are managed at the central level -- and not enough at the local level -- and that not
enough attention is devoted to the preparation of feasibility studies and engineering designs for
infrastructure projects earmarked for public funding. This would be minimized in part by the
"marketing" of the available funds and the potential assistance which the PMU would provide to
decentralized agencies to help prepare infrastructure projects, and in part by regular supervision
by the Bank, for which an adequate budget would be allocated.
25.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
