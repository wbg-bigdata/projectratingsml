A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE
1. Country and sector issues

With a growing population, strong economic growth, and a policy o f universal access to
electricity, Morocco's electricity demand i s increasing rapidly. Growth in Moroccan electricity
demand'has accelerated over the last 3 years from 6% p.a. on average during 1997-2002 to 8%
p.a. during 2003-2006.       Even with intensified electricity conservation and demand side
management (DSM) efforts, electricity demand i s expected to continue growing at a similar rate.
The "Office National de 1'Electricite" (O.N.E.) projects that peak demand will grow from
3300MW in 2005 to between 4825MW and 5300 MW in 2010 and 7000MW and 8500MW in
2015 depending on assumptions on economic growth andenergy conservation.

Moreover, the country i s mostly dependent on imported fossil fuels to generate electricity, and
the role of fossil fuels is expected to increase further, given the lack o f endogenous resources.
Preventing a further increase in import dependency requires the urgent development o f the
country's renewable resources, inparticular wind and solar energy.

Inthis context, the major issues that face theMoroccan electricity sector include:
        Urgent need for new power generating capacity addition: on current plans, capacity will
        not be sufficient to meet peak demand without the addition o f the 472'MW Ain Beni
        Mathar Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Plant on schedule.                Widespread power
        blackouts could result from a schedule slippage.
        Bottlenecks in transmission and distribution to meet growing demand while ensuring
        security and quality o f supply.
        The need to reduce electricity demand growth through demand side management
        measures (DSM) to reduce bothpeak load demand and total demand.
        The lack o f availability o f natural gas in sufficient volumes to fire power plants beyond
        AinBeniMathar.
        The need to develop non fossil fuel fired power generation, renewables in particular, in
        order to diversifythe power generation mix and reduce import dependency overall.
        Integrationinto a regional Maghreb power market and with EUmarkets, that may impose
        harmonization o f some rules and regulations regarding market operation.
        Large financing requirementsto meet growingelectricity demand.
        A national electricity company which needs to invest over $lbillion per year in
        generation and transmissioddistribution infrastructure.

A number o f measures have already been taken or are under consideration by the Government
and O.N.E. to address these issues:
        Ambitious plans to increase the contribution of renewable energy (RE) to 10%of the
        primaryenergy demandin2012 (or 20% o fthe fuel input into the power sector). A law is
        inpreparationto ensure these objectives aremet.
        An aggressive program to increase energy efficiency (EE): the example is to be shown by
        the Government with new programs for energy efficiency in public buildings. The RE
        law also covers EE.

        Measures to ensure a healthy and dynamic local financial sector, that can provide local
        financing for power projects as was the case for the Tahaddart CCGT plant.

Overall, the private sector was actively involved in developing power generation capacity,
particularly inthe 1990s, and today 70% o f Morocco's power is generated by the private sector.
A resurgence in private sector investment is expected once the new regulatory framework i s
established, including for renewable energy.

Morocco ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on
the 28tho f December 1995. Inaddition, Morocco hosted the seventh Conference o f the Parties to
the UNFCCC inNovember 2001 and ratified the Kyoto Protocol on January 25,2002. As a non-
Annex Icountry, Morocco i s eligible for financing from the GEF through the mechanisms
established by the Convention. The proposed project has received the endorsement from the GEF
Operational Focal Point and i s formulated inaccordance with national priorities.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The proposed project integrates conventional combined cycle gas turbines with solar thermal
technology. It will provide urgently-needed power in Morocco (472MW), and simultaneously
contribute to an important global test o f a new approach to renewable energy. As noted in the
Bank's report to the Development Committee on the Clean Energy Investment Framework,
incentives are needed to induce technological change to a low carbon economy. The proposed
project would demonstrate how de-carbonizing o f the power sector could be facilitated by the
large-scale development o fnew energy production technologies.

The proposed project i s strategic for the achievement o f the objectives o f GEF's Operational
Program 7, which aims to reduce, over the long term, the costs o f energy technologies with low
greenhouse gas emissions, and which are currently not cost-competitive (see below under
"Higher level objectives and Rationale for GEF funding").             The Bank fully supports that
pioneering objective. The proposed Morocco project i s one o f a series o f similar projects, which
together will contribute to learning about such technologies, and dissemination o f that learning.
In this way, Morocco, GEF, and the Bank are jointly participating in a very promising global
experiment.

The proposedproject is also strategic for the Bank inMorocco, now that the Bank has regained a
high-level of partnership inthe country's energy sector after a gap o f some years (the project i s
included inthe 2005 CAS). The Government o f Morocco, O.N.E., and the Bank are engaged in
an intensive policy dialogue in this key sector, and a comprehensive program o f financial and
technical support i s being developed. Reliability and long-tern involvement are the foundation
o fthis relationship.

The first in a programmatic series of Energy Development Policy Loans (DPL) i s now at an
advanced stage o f preparation (Board presentation i s proposed in FY07). The DPL supports the
Government's energy sector reform program which focuses on (i)energy security and
sustainable development;         (ii)increasing   energy sector     productivity and Morocco's
competitiveness; (iii)moderating fiscal exposure in the energy sector; and (iv) enhancing
monitoring, evaluation, and public communicationinthe sector.

The D P L i s being developed in consultation with the European Commission under the auspices
o f the European Neighborhood Policy, and the EU and Morocco's joint objectives o f closer
economic integrationand environmental protection.

There are clear synergies betweenthe proposed Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Project
(ISCC) and the programmatic DPL: (i)support for sustainable development through an
experimental renewable energy technology that could prove highly efficient, if the experiment
succeeds; (ii)   avoidance o f power blackouts inMorocco which would have serious political and
economic implications, and would undermine reform; (iii)a gradual approach to electricity
market liberalization which will be supportive o f renewable energy development; (iv) promotion
o f private participation inpower which would allow the eventual privatization o f the ISCC; and
(v) enhanced monitoring and evaluation capacity in Morocco which will be critical for global
dissemination o f the learningwhich is at the heart o fthe ISCC project.

The goals of the ISCC and programmatic DPL, will also be underpinned by a proposed Bank
investment loan to O.N.E.         This i s at a relatively early stage o f preparation (for Board
presentation in FY08), and will focus on augmenting transmission capacity to keep pace with
rapid electricity demand growth and investment in generation capacity, including ISCC. The
loan will also include assistance to O.N.E. to restructure in order to respond better to the
reformedpolicy framework, includinginits support for renewable energy development.

The Bank's participation inthe proposedISCC project is intended to catalyze the financing that
i s essential to the project going ahead. This financing comes fi-om GEF, the African
DevelopmentBank (AfDB), and 0.N.E andthe Bank's role i s to help coordinate the packaging
o f financing and contracting to achieve the project objectives. At this late stage o fproject
preparation, site selection and acquisition, biddingand contracting, it would be very costly to
Morocco ifthe package needed to be reconfigured inany major way. The EPC contractor has
beenselected andis ready to be mobilized inMarch2007. The Bank's role is to continue to
coordinate so that the plant commissioning remains on schedule and the project objectives are
achieved.

3. Higher level objectives and Rationale for GEF funding

In1996, the GEF's Scientific andTechnical Advisory Panel(STAP) recommendedhigh
temperature solar thermal power technologies as one o f the renewable energy technologies that
had significant cost reductionpotential. The GEF support for solar thermal technology was
mooted as a means to increase market awareness through limitedscale demonstrationprojects in
solar resource rich developing countries.

GEF Operational ProgramNumber7 ("Reducing the Long-term Costs o fLow Greenhouse Gas-
EmittingTechnologies") emphasized certain limited technologies includingparabolic trough
based solar thermal electric technologies to be cost-effective. "For cost-effectiveness, the scope
o fthe technologies coveredbythe operationalprogram needs to be limitedto those whose costs
will drop significantly with economies o f scale inmanufactureand application."

The selection o ftechnologies for OP 7 was madebased on certain criteria; extent to whichbasic
RD&Dhas already been done (for technologies where the markets arebothinrecipient and
developed countries) or significant prior operational experience exists; size o fremaining
technological barriers and risks; technology's current cost; prospects for reduction incosts o fthe
technologies inquestion (steep learning curves); contribution that GEF financing can make to
cost reductions; and the primary market i s inthe recipient countries because o f resource
endowment and potential for that technology, when commercial, to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.

Large-scale solar-based power plants are still a longway from beingcost-competitive with
fossil-fuel based plants. However, within the range o f solar thermal electric generation options,
the integrationo f solar and combined cycle (ISCC) technology is the most promising inthe long-
term as a reliable and cost-effective source o fpower supply. For developing countries
especially, where the primary needi s electricity (not necessarily green electricity), the
combination o f solar energy with a large-scale fossil fuel power plant can, inthe technology
introduction stage, be more attractive than stand-alone solar plants. For this reason, the
technology is consistent with the objectives o f GEF OP7, whichjustifies GEF grant support in
pursuito fthe global program objective o fincreasingthe market share o flow greenhouse-gas
emittingtechnologies that have not yet become widespread least-cost alternatives.

OP7 states that "the objective will be achieved by GEF's promotion o f such technologies so that,
through learning and economies o f scale, the levelized energy costs will decline to commercially
competitive levels.. ..A project leads to reduction in GHG emissions not only directly, but also
indirectly by being one o f series o f projects that induce cost reductions in the technology.. .The
direct outputs o f the technology are the amount o f energy generated, the amount o f GHG
emissions avoided etc. The indirect project output, o f greater programmatic interest, i s the
reduction in cost that it caused and the time horizon for the achievement o f program objectives
will typically be on the order o f decades. The technologies identified under this program will
require the       security  o f   funding and     long-term   commitment      o f   GEF support."

Consequently, GEF and the Bank agreed to pursue solar thermal projects inIndia, Mexico,
Morocco and Egypt as part of a strategy to facilitate the commercialization o f solar thermal

technology. The Indiaproject (later dropped) entered the work program in 1996, followed by the
Mexico and Morocco projects in 1999 and finally the Egypt project in2004. The Mexico project
i s now under implementation, and the financing for the Egyptproject has been negotiated, and
theprocurementprocess has almost beenconcluded. The proposedMorocco project is slightly
ahead o fthe Egyptproject: financing has beennegotiated, and the contractor has been selected.
After eight years o fpreparation, construction is ready to start - pendingapproval ofthe GEF
grant.

Inessence, the GEF participation inthe project is intended to support primarily global program
objectives, and Moroccan national development objectives only secondarily.                That i s the
rationale for substantial grant financing from the international community through GEF.
However, one-third o f the financing for the solar component o f the project would come from
O.N.E. equity and borrowings in testimony to the fact that the global environmental objectives
are closely linked to the Morocco's national sustainable energy development strategies.
In the GEF-World Bank portfolio o f solar thermal projects, the preferred configuration is the
ISCC. This configuration integrates the steam output from a solar field into the steam turbine o f
a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT). Given that there i s now significant experience relating to
combined cycle operation, as well as adequate knowledge o f solar field operations, the ISCC
configuration is sound from a technical standpoint. However, as projects utilizing this integrated
configuration have not yet been implemented, the first few projects, including the Morocco
project, may face teethingproblems. But any problems that arise are not likely to be fundamental
in nature but rather related to optimizing energy flows, particularly under transient solar
conditions.

Byintegratingthe solar field with the combined cycle technology, the ISCC configuration offers
several cost reduction and operational advantages over independent solar thermal plants that
make them more suitable for introducing solar field based electricity generation in developing
countries. Inthe ISCC configuration, the needfor an independent power block for the solar field
i s offset by utilizing a larger steam turbine in the CCGT plant, reducing the capital costs through
economies o f scale. Such a configuration also reduces the solar energy losses that occur in an
independent solar plant due to daily start-up and shut-down. In addition, the hybrid plant can
remain in continuous operation irrespective o f solar availability providing much needed
generation. The solar field also offers a power boost when CCGTs suffer a reduction in plant
output at times o f high outdoor temperatures, since that coincides with high solar radiation as
well.

In 2005, the World Bank commissioned an independent assessment of the World Bank/GEF
strategy for the market development o f concentrating solar thermal power. The study's
conclusions may be summarized as follows:

         0  Over the last 2 years, the industry has been reinvigorated.        Several projects are
            presentlyunder construction around the world. Nonetheless, these projects have not
            reached the kind o f critical mass to suggest that the industryis now self-sustaining.
        0   Solar thermal electricity offers a number o f advantages when considered as part of a
            country or region's energy generation options mix. Solar thermal, based on a hot

             fluid, can integrate well with conventional thermodynamic cycles and power
             generation equipment.
         0   Inmost cases, the IntegratedSolar Combined Cycle configuration showed lower LEC
            thanthe SEGS plants California. The reason for this is that the incremental cost of a
             larger steam turbine i s much lower than building a stand-alone power block for a
             SEGS plant.
         0   ISCC i s well-suited for market introduction because the additional marginal
             investment for the conventional plant components is relatively low. There are also
             areas o f overlap, and thus cost-reduction potential, with the plant infrastructure and
            project implementation costs.
         0  The technology i s not new, but stalled in its development path.             There is no
             fundamental reason why the technology could not follow a similar cost reduction
            curve to wind energy and eventually be cost-competitive. Cost reductions would
            require a combination o f plant scale-up, increased production volumes and
            technological innovation.
            Against the thousands o f megawatts needed for CSP to reach cost-effectiveness, the
            GEF portfolio will not, of themselves, lead to any significant reduction in the
            underlying cost o f the technology. However, the plant capacity o f projects in the
            GEF portfolio is not insignificant compared to the present 300MW or so o f possible-
            to-firm projects in OECD countries.        Therefore, the GEF co-financed plants are
            important to maintaining momentum in the CSP industry and to developing
            operational experience indeveloping countries.
            By supporting implementation of the first solar thermal power demonstration plants,
            the GEF will help create confidence in the technology and institutional learning,
            thereby reducing the hurdle for subsequent market entry o f CSP.

Several ISCC projects outside the GEF/Bank portfolio are also being developed inAlgeria, Spain
etc. Over the long run, it i s expected that the cost o f the technology will come down due to
technical progress and lessons learned from earlier deployment (as in the case o f the proposed
project).   In the Northern Mediterranean "sunbelt",      several STP projects are already being
planned in Greece, Spain, and Italy through national programs and the support o f the EU. Bulk
transmission o f electricity from STP plants from high insolation sites in Southern Mediterranean
countries, such as Algeria, Libia, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, may also open wider
opportunities for European utilities to finance solar plants inthat region for electricity consumed
in Europe. Reform of electricity sectors across Europe, the rising demand for "green power",
and the possibility o f gaining carbon credits are increasingthe viability o f suchprojects. Finally,
research and development work continues inEurope and the United States to hrther reduce costs
by improving plant components.

2.      ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandKey Indicators

The mainnational objectives o fthe project are to addurgently-needed capacity to the Moroccan
power grid to help cope with the sustained growth inelectricity demand, to increase the
contribution o frenewable energy sources inMorocco's energymix thereby reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, and to contribute to a program o f global environmental significance.

Keyspecific perfonnance indicators are the following:
--   Total electricity generated from the ISCC power plant (GWyear)
     Share o f ISCC energy intotal energy production (%)
-
-    Solar output (GWyear)
     Solar output as a percentage o f total energy producedby the ISCC power plant

3.      GlobalEnvironmentalObjective

The global environmental objective o f the project i s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from
anthropogenic sources by increasing the market share o f low greenhouse gas emitting
technologies.

The project will demonstrate the operational viability o fhybridsolar thermal power generation
technology and contribute to replication o f integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) power
generation technology inMorocco and elsewhere through the learning effect provided by its
construction and operation, and through economies o f scale as use o f the technology spreads. It
i s one o f a number o f similar projects inthe world to be supported by GEF, andby other
financing sources, as part o f a global programmatic effort to accelerate cost reduction and
commercial adoption o f large-scale low greenhouse emittihg generation technologies.
Secondarily, the project will make a modest direct contribution to the reduction o f greenhouse
gas emissions.

To evaluate the perfonnance o fthe project inachieving the global program objective, the
following indicators have beenchosen:

effect o f the project, which i s its overarching objective. They are considered at least as important
as the quantitative indicators, which measure the modest direct impact o f the project, and give
some quantitative indication o f this individual project's contribution to the overall impact of a
long-term series o f investments inthe technology.

 (See Annex 3 - Results Frameworkfor baseline and targets)

4.       Project components

The project includes the integration o f a parabolic trough solar field (of about 183,120 m2) with
a traditional natural gas-based power generating unit (combined cycle). The proposed project
involves the construction and operation of a solar/fossil he1 hybrid power station o f about 472
MW, o f which 452 MW2 from combined cycle gas turbine and 20 MW from the solar
component with an expected annual net production of 3,538 GWh per year. The solar output i s
estimated at 1.13% o f the annual production representing 40 GWh per year. It i s expected that
the solar thermal power plant will be inservice by February2010.

The plant will be built and operated through an Engineering, Procurement and Construction
(EPC) cum Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract. O.N.E. will thus be the owner o f the
plant. The O&M contract will last 5 years and include appropriate incentives to ensure an
efficient operation o f the plant, particularly the solar field. These incentives are related to the
output o f the solar field and efficiency o f its operation and are enforced by monetary penalties.
The O&M contract will also lay the ground for maximizing the utilization o f the solar field over
the long term through on the job training of O.N.E.'s staff in the operation and maintenance of
the solar field. The bidding documents issued in July 2005 established minimumrequirements
for the solar thermal power to ensure that the minimum solar share target could be met. The

* Ina previous design, the combined cycle capacity was only 207MW. However, a planned gas-fired plant
elsewhere inMorocco was severely delayed, so an additional gas turbine was subsequently added to the design of
the Ain Beni Mathar plant, to give a total combined cycle capacity of 452MW. The biddingprocess was modified
to require bidders to submit 207MW and 452MW options, and O.N.E. selected the latter.

Power Sector Development in Morocco

Inearlier Bank projects, some o f the critical issues were the high level o f subsidyprovided by
GoM to O.N.E.'s investment program to compensate for delayed tariff increases, the high level
o f arrears in subsidy payment, and the lack o f autonomy o f O.N.E. GoM has now shifted its
policy by promoting financial sustainability o f O.N.E., as well as private participation, which in
turn has substantially reduced O.N.E.'s investment requirements. Recent GoM actions on
electricity tariff increases and those adopted by O.N.E. to recover arrears and to streamline its
organization, have substantially improved the financial and institutional performance o f the

the proposedinvestment loan to support O.N.E. restructuring.

Solar ThermalPower Plant Development Worldwide

N o large-scale solar thermal power plants have beenbuilt indeveloping countries to date, and no
plant integrating solar thermal technology and combined cycle gas turbines has yet been built
anywhere. GEF-supported projects are now in preparation in Morocco and Egypt, and under
implementation in Mexico. The most significant solar thermal installations are in California
where 354 MW o fparabolic troughs, with back-up gas-fired steam boilers, have beengenerating
electricity and selling it to the utility for more than 15 years. However, to meet the cost
reduction objectives o f GEF's OP7, it i s necessary to move beyond the troughhack-up boiler
design upon which the California projects were based. The purpose i s to permit higher thermal
efficiencies, improve the dispatching o f the plant and encourage greater competition in the
design and supply o f the equipment. Such a plant would be more attractive to utilities, thus
increasingthe market size.

For this reason the project includes the following features: (i)    bidders have been allowed to
choose among qualified manufacturers for the parabolic trough designs and the gas-fired power
equipment; (ii)   competition i s key to ensure the lowest electricity cost possible and, whenever
possible, locally manufactured components; and (iii)      the contractor will have incentives to
maximize output from the solar field, which will bring about a focus on O&M costs, thus
bringingdown life-cycle costs.

To accelerate utility acceptance o f a power generation technology based on intermittent energy
sources such as solar, a way must be found to provide reliable backup and enable the delivery o f
firm power. The project integrates the STP plant with a gas-fired combined cycle power plant
such that continuous generation by the hybridplant i s possible regardless o f the solar radiation
intensity at any particular time. Furthermore, more efficient construction, financing and
operation can also be expected as a result o fprivate sector involvement inthe EPC and operation
and maintenance contracts.

Biddingprocess

Given that no integrated solar thermal combine cycle plants have yet beenbuilt, and given that
the solar thermal market includes a limitednumber o f suppliers, pre-biddingcost estimates were
subject to a high degree o f uncertainty. Since the GEF grant funding was essential to allow
inclusion in the overall project o f a technology that is not yet cost-competitive as an energy
source, and the grant size was pre-determined, the bidding process needed to safeguard against
costs far inexcess o f the grant.

For that reason, bidders were asked to submit two offers: one for 30MW solar capacity and one
for 20MW.       This was deemed fully consistent with the objectives o f the project, since the
learningattained with 20MW o f capacity does not differ significantly from learning with 30MW
(see below).

This is also consistent with the recommendation o fthe independentstudy team commissionedby
the Bank, which concluded that bids should not "specify a particular solar field capacity, but
rather a minimum threshold, with capacity offered an assessment criterion. The resulting
competition will ensure the maximum capacity possible i s offered for the finance available."

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Inthe eight years over whichthis complex projectwas developed, using anuntestedtechnology
and during a period o f significant changes inthe power sector, a number o f alternatives were
considered, including outright cancellation. However, after due consideration, GEF, O.N.E., and
the Bank retained their joint commitment to go aheadwith the project inaccordance with the
mutually-agreed objectives.

Choice ofplant site

The pre-feasibility study financed by the European Community (EC) provided the economic
analysis for the 11alternatives studied at the Jerada andAin Beni Mathar sites. The alternative at
Ain Beni Mathar (about 80 km south of Oujda), which provided the lowest levelized tariff and
the highest rate o f return, was selected. The selection also included criteria about the sun level,
the availability o f cooling water, and the location with regards to the electricity grid'and gas
network.

It is notable that the relatively highsolar radiation (and hence temperature) and highelevationo f
the Ain Beni Mathar site made it simultaneously preferable for the solar component, but
suboptimal for the combined cycle component (which operates with lower efficiency at high
temperatures and high elevation). The choice o f site was essentially a compromise permitting
the effective testingo f the integratedtechnology concept, while incurring an incremental cost for
so doing. However, this choice did impose a risk: if the solar component o f the project did not
go ahead, because o f the complexities o f contracting and financing the project, the combined
cycle plant would either be left in a suboptimal location, or be subject to serious delays as the
whole project were redesigned in a different location. Nonetheless, O.N.E. decided to assume
that risk.

Choice of private versuspublic sector ownership

The proposed project, along with other similar projects in the GEF portfolio, were initially
expected to be implemented as Independent Power Projects (IPPs) and are now being developed
as public sector power plants. The IPP approach was unsuccessful due to the risk aversion of the
private sector to this new technology coupled with the general global decline in IPP interest in
developing countries. InMorocco, O.N.E. launched two expressions o f interest for an IPP for the
solar thermal combined cycle power project inMay and October 2002, but attracted no interest.
Likewise, a planned seminar in May 2003 to inform and attract potential investors was not held
due to lack o f interest. The issue was discussed with GEF Sec which provided its written
approval on July 17, 2003 for the structure to be changed from an IPP to a public sector project.
The issue was also brought to the attention o f the GEF council through a council paper titled

Choice of smaller versus larger solar capacity

At the time of GEF work program inclusion in 1999, a pre-feasibility study, based on then-
available cost estimates, concludedthat 38MW-45MW o f solar capacity could be financed with a
$43.2 million GEF grant. More detailed analysis conducted subsequently, in a` full feasibility
study, concludedthat possibly 30MW couldbe purchased for that amount. However, since there
was very considerable uncertainty about marketreactionto an untested technology with very few
suppliers, the biddingprocess for the proposedproject was designedto mitigate the risk o f costs
provingto be higher than expected (as described above). The biddingprocess therefore allowed
biddersto submit two solar options: one with a minimumo f o f solar capacity, which was used to
determine the selection o f the winning bid, and one with a capacity of 3OMW.

The outcome o fthe biddingprocess demonstrated the logic o fthat approach: even 20MW proved
to cost well above $43.2 million (the lowest evaluated bid gave a capital cost for 20MW o f $66
million, and for 30MW it was $70.3 million.). O.N.E. nonetheless decided to proceed with the
solar component o f the project -at the level o f 20MW - using $23 million o f its own financing to
supplement GEF funds.3This decision was based on O.N.E.'s commitment to the agreed GEF
objectives, and to avoiding the power blackouts that would likely occur inMorocco as a result o f
serious delays incurred through redesigning the project to exclude the solar component.
Furthermore, it was recognized that use o f own resources to this extent would not impose a
significant tariffburdenon Moroccanconsumers.

However, O.N.E. decided not to spend the additional $27.1 million o f its own funds that would
have been necessary to reach 30MW o f solar capacity, because achievement o f the project
objectives would not have been materially affected by that incremental expenditure, and O.N.E.
would have incurred significant borrowing/opportunity costs for those additional funds.

In essence, it was recognized by all stakeholders, that the global program objectives could be
achieved equally with 20MW of solar capacity as with 3OMW, given that the objectives focus
primarily on learning anddemonstration, rather thanon the direct reduction o f emissions. As the
"Assessment o f the World Bank/GEF strategy for the Market Development o f Concentrating
Solar Thermal Power" acknowledged in 2004, "Given that these are first-off projects in
developing countries, the risk margin is likely to be high, resulting in the possible situation
where all the bids come in either too expensive for the finance available, or non-conforming
(reduced field size). The capacity o fthese first projects is to some extent arbitrary. It is unlikely
that inten years time the issue o f whether the first ISCC project comprised 25 or 28MW o f solar
will be an issue. What will be an issue is whether.. ..theyoperated successfully."




 For ease of presentation. the O.N.E. contribution i s given here as a portion o f the total capital cost o f the solar
component. Elsewhere inthe report, O.N.E.'s contribution i s given as a portion of the incremental cost of the solar
component.

Cancellation of the solar component of theproject

Cancellation o fthe solar component of the project was considered in2004, but rejected. Some
GEFcouncil members expressed their concerns regardingthe slow pace o fimplementationof
this portfolio at the May 2004 council meetings. Inresponse, the Bank commissioned an
independentassessmento ftheseprojects inclose collaboration with the GEF Secretariat as well
as the client countries andthe Solar Thermal Industry. The draft o fthis review titled
"Assessment o fthe World Bank/GEFstrategy for the Market Development o f Concentrating
Solar Thermal Power," Information document number GEF/C.25/Inf. 11was circulated to the
GEFcouncil for the June 2005 councilmeetings for comments, and subsequentlyfinalized
incorporatingthe comments received. The review, carried out by a consortium ledby Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), South Africa, concludedthat the World Bank and
GEF should not pullout o fthe portfolio but rather follow a "prudent, active support o fthe
technology, but with appropriate exit strategies ifmilestones are not met."           Two o fthe key
conclusions o fthis study were:

        The solar thermal industry, beginningagain inearnest [after 354 MW additions in 1980s
        inthe U.S], is fragile. Against the thousands o f megawatts needed for the technology to
        reach cost-effectiveness, the Bank-GEF portfolio by itself will not lead any significant
        reduction inthe underlyingcost o f the technology. However, these projects are important
        to the global solar thermal industry as they constitute a significant percentage of the
        planned projects at present.

    0   Given these are first-off projects in developing countries, the risk margin is likely to be
        high, resulting in the possible situation where all bids come in either too expensive or
        non-conforming due to reducedfield size. Therefore, bids should not specify a particular
        solar field capacity, but rather a minimum threshold, with capacity offered as an
        assessment criteria.

Choice of small versus larger combined cycle capacity

The combined cycle capacity was initially conceived at about 100MW, at the time o f GEF work
programinclusionin 1999. Subsequently, it was increased to 207MW, given the rapid growthin
demand for power inMorocco andthe economies o f scale o f the larger plant. Duringthe bidding
process in 2006/7, an alternative option of 452MW was included, because another combined
cycle plant elsewhere in Morocco was encountering serious delays. Ultimately, O.N.E. selected
this larger option, inorder to avoid electricity blackouts inMorocco, and giventhat the increased
combined cycle capacity would have no negative impact on the achievement o f the project
objectives supported by GEF. Inshort, the solar learning experience is not significantly affected
bythe combinedcycle ~apacity.~




 A similar increase incombined cycle capacity took place duringpreparationof the GEF-supported Solar Thermal
Agua Prieta I1Project inMexico.

Choice of specific type of solar technology

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has identified "solar thermal-electric technologies in
high insulation regions, initially emphasizing the proven parabolic trough variant for electric
power generati~n"~,as one o f the renewable energy technologies it supports through its
operational program number 7. Development o f solar power technology (STP) represents one o f
the most cost-efficient options for renewable bulk,power production, and the most cost-effective
way o f producing electricity from solar radiation. Indeed, STP could play an important role in
meetingsome o f the increasingdemand for electricity, with fewer emissions than the alternative
plants powered purely with fossil fuels.

STP plants produce electricity in the same way as conventional power stations, except they
obtain all or part o f their thermal energy input by concentrating solar radiation and converting it
to high temperature steam or gas to drive a turbine. Essentially, STP plants include four main
components: the concentrator, receiver, transport-storage, and power conversion. Many different
types o f systems are possible usingvariations o f these components. Although there are, broadly,
three solar thermal technologies: the parabolic trough, the central receiver, and the parabolic dish
system; the parabolic trough is the most technically and commercially proven option. However,
although solar electric generating systems have proven to be a mature electricity generating
technology, they do not represent the end o f the learning curve o fparabolic trough technology. A
numberofimprovements and developments have taken place since.

One o f these improvements i s the integrated solar combined cycle system (ISCCS), which
integrates a parabolic trough plant with a gas turbine combined-cycle plant. Essentially, the
ISCCS uses solar heat to supplement the waste heat from a gas turbine in order to augment
power generation inthe steam turbine. This represents cost savings for project usingthis design.
Both the incremental cost and O&M cost o f the ISCCS are lower than a trough plant alone, and
the solar-to-electric efficiency is improved. Studies have shown that the ISCCS configuration
reduces the cost o f solar power by as much as 22 percent over the cost o f power from a
conventional solar electric generating station (SEGS) o f similar size. The ISCCS i s the most
efficient technology available and it has been adopted for the proposedproject (see Annex 15 for
an illustration). It has however been decided to exclude thermal storage as this technology has
not yet been commercially proven on a large scale.

The Government, through the Ministry o f Energy and Mines (MEM) and O.N.E., is committed
to the proposed project and has stressed its preference for a commercially proven technology for
the solar capacity. As such, it has been decided that the project design be based on the parabolic
trough technology.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

Consultants partially financed under a GEF PDF C grant, now closed, assisted O.N.E. in the
preparation o fbidding documents, and draft EPC and O&M contracts and advised O.N.E. during
the evaluation o fproposals.

The construction and operation o f the ISCC power plant will be implementedby an EPC cum
O&M arrangement secured through international competitive bidding. The Production
Department o f O.N.E. will have the responsibility for overall project management. This
Department will ensure the coordination and the technical and administrative management o f the
project. It will work in close collaboration with the Supply and Markets Department for the
procurement aspects, with the Environment and Quality Department for the coordination o f the
studies and the monitoring of environmental measures, and with the Technical Department for
the technical controls and oversight. The Financial Department will be in charge o f the project
financial management, and coordination with the various loadgrant providers. The production
department will be assisted by a consulting engineer to be recruited under the project and
financedby AfDB and O.N.E.

The World Bank will supervise and monitor the implementation o f the activities through regular
supervision missions (with the African Development Bank) and regular contacts with O.N.E.
The power station which comprises a combined cycle and a solar component will be jointly
financed by AfDB, O.N.E., and GEF because there will be a single contract signed for both.
Following the pre-qualification exercise that took place in May 2004, consortia were formed
each o f which was composed o f a combined cycle manufacturer and a solar manufacturer. This
arrangement minimizes the risk to the project due to the fact that the responsibility and the risk
of interface between the combined cycle and the solar component i s left to the consortium and i s
not borne by O.N.E.        Since the responsibilities are clearly defined, the arrangement also
reinforces the incentives for operatingthe plant inthe most efficient manner possible.

The implementationperiodwill be three (3) years and i s expected to take place betweenMay
2007 andApril 2010. Inaddition, the project will be supervised over the next three years to
learn from its operation and ensure that the integratedsolar combinedcycle power plant i s
optimally operated.

The Personnel and GenerationDepartments o f O.N.E. will oversee the training o ftheir own staff
invarious aspects o fISCCtechnology.

3. Monitoringand evaluationof outcomes/results

        Monitoring and evaluation

The project's primary purpose i s to demonstrate and encourage replication o f ISCC power
generation technology. Consequently, an adequate project performance monitoring, evaluation,
anddissemination system is a key component o fthe project design.

IntegratedSolar Combined Cycle Power Project                                               February 2007

The monitoring and evaluation o f results and outcomes will be the responsibility o f O.N.E. Data'
will be collected and reportedon by the EPC contractor and the consulting engineer while under
contract. The successor, be it O.N.E. or a private operator, will take over this responsibility for
the remaining life time o f the plant. This would allow continuous monitoring o f the project's
keyindicators.

The format, contents and frequency o f implementation progress reports as well as reporting
procedures have been agreed with O.N.E.. The Bank will closely supervise the project during its
construction and first three years o f operation to make sure that the learning from this experience
has been fully captured and disseminated. A mid-termreview will be carried out after the first
year o f operation to evaluate the achievement o f the project development objective and take
corrective action to ensure an efficient operation o f the project, especially the solar component.

Duringthe course o f implementation, the World Bank will monitor and evaluate global benefits
related to OP7 objectives (market penetration, global cost reduction o f ISCC technology, etc.) for
all the solar thermal projects inthe portfolio.

        Dissemination

O.N.E. will disseminate the results from the project both domestically and internationally, as a
way to support future replication. The main components o f O.N.E.'s dissemination strategy
include: (a) transparency in the availability o f information from monitoring and evaluation
activities; (b) ease o f access to relevant monitoring and evaluation information, as required by
decision-makers and other users, including full disclosure o f non-confidential information; (c)
special initiatives to engage policy and operations decision-makers and program stakeholders in
internalizing the lessons from experience and best practices; (d) use o f lessons learned and best
practices inthe development o f new policies and projects; and (e) systematic action on findings
andrecommendations that flow from the M&Eprogram.

Some o f the main dissemination techniques will include: preparation o f reports, summaries and
abstracts; management and staff review sessions; wide participation in project review processes
by project staff and intendedbeneficiaries; special analyses o f experience inproject documents;
country and regional seminars and workshops. O.N.E. will also make all the information about
the ISCC power plant, including performance indicators, available on its external web site.

The dissemination will also be made through facilitating visits by the power industry, utilities
and other interested institutions from all over the world to learn from the construction and
operation o f the plant and the results achieved. O.N.E. has indicated that it welcomes such visits
as well as requests for information.

The primary end users o f monitoring and evaluation products are: GEF Council and GEF
Secretariat, the relevant Conventions, STAP, other international organizations, NGOs, country
representatives, power industry, utilities and related stakeholders and interested members o f the
public.

Capacity building o f O.N.E. for the above activities will be implemented as part o f a technical
assistance component to be financed by the project. A result indicator has been included in the
results framework regarding the training o f O.N.E.'s staff in integrated solar combined cycle
power technology. The format will be a combination o f formal and on-the-job training.

The dissemination o f global results and outcomes will be the responsibility, as for the monitoring
and evaluation o f global benefits, o f GEF, andthe World Bank. . As part o f the dissemination
and replication strategy for the project, the World Bank and GEF will undertake a number o f
knowledge management activities, such as:

             Disseminate experience from the ISCC projects at key energy events and conferences,
             including those organizedby the Bank's Sustainable Development Network.
             Organize international workshops on ISCC projects, once operational, to share
             lessons learned from early operation o f the ISCC power plants.
             Identify financial resources for studytours from countries with potential interest in
             ISCC.
             Maintain a strong link with market initiatives for the development o f the CSP
             technology, such as the Global Market Initiative.
             Conduct a specific portfolio assessment o f the ISCC projects as part o f the Bank's
             annual GEF Project Implementation Review, with the participation o f stakeholders
             from power sector, industry, technology R&D institutions.

4. Sustainability

Project sustainability

The higher capital cost o f the hybridplant will be partly offset by the proposed GEF incremental
cost grant and will not require significant increases intariffs to consumers. The integration o f the
solar field with a CCGT is the most efficient technology available. The hybrid power plant i s
expected to operate sustainably as an integral part o f the Moroccan power system. The incentive
structure for the EPC cum O&M will ensure optimal design for integration o f the solar thermal
with the gas-fired plant and maximize solar output from the plant when in operation.
Dissemination o f information about this demonstration project will contribute to future
replication inMorocco and elsewhere andhelp refine GEF strategy regarding this technology.

The Government is currently engaged in the implementation o f policy measures that would: (i)
gradually liberate the electricity market; (ii)rationalize energy pricing; and (iii)promote
renewable energy and energy efficiency to reduce the country's energy dependence.

O.N.E. has devoted considerable efforts to preparing the proposed project to address growing
concerns in Morocco about the adverse environmental impacts o f SO2 and C02 emissions from
conventional power plants. The Government o f Morocco (GoM) and O.N.E., which will be

plant staff will be trained in the requisite skills for operating and maintaining a hybrid solar
combined cycle power plant duringthe construction and operation of the plant.

Solar thermal power (STP) technology has made remarkable progress over the past decade.
Many new STP plant technologies and component designs are now being operated successfully.
Teething problems experienced during adjustment periods have been successfully addressed.
Because o f the important risks related to the introduction of this complex technology,
governments and agencies in Europe and the U S have cooperated with the private sector,
sponsors and financial institutions to support demonstration projects to minimize investmentrisk.
As expected, performance o f some o fthe STP demonstration plantswas lower than expected and
appreciable adjustments and operational modifications were made to ensure trouble-free
operation. After the initial teething problems, the performance characteristics o f the plants have
approached designtargets and even exceeded them ina few cases.

For the proposedproject, a large part o f the experience gained inconstructing and operating new
STP projects in the U S and Europe will be made available through GEF support. However,
implementation and operation o f the technology in a developing country still carries appreciable
risks. The plant availability factor may be lower during the first year or two than those achieved
inoverseasprojects. Nevertheless, the chance ofultimate success for the project is good, andthe
global benefits from the dissemination o f the technology in Morocco and other countries should
be substantial. The success of the proposed project, which GEF support would promote, i s the
critical first step in Morocco's and the Northern Africa region's gradual approach for adopting
and developing ISCC technology on a large scale. GEF support i s also critical to strengthening
and speeding up the dissemination and replication strategy.

Replicability

The general approach adopted by the project is highlyreplicable within Morocco, regionally and
globally. The main barriers for future replication are costs and the associated learning needs, the
overcoming o f which this project i s expected to address by providing cost reduction and
operation information and disseminating it throughout the STP community.                 Successful
construction and operation o f the proposed commercial-scale ISCC project will convincingly
demonstrate a cleaner and reliable way to meet growing power demand in Morocco and thus
pave the way for replicating the technology elsewhere in Morocco and particularly in the
Southern Mediterranean "sunbelt" (Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt). The project would also
promote replication o f the technology in Morocco and elsewhere by: (a) transferring experience
in the design, construction, and operation of ISCC plants in a developing country context; (b)
facilitating the manufacture o f some ISCC components inMorocco, which will reduce their cost
and make the technology more cost-effective; and (c) training personnel o f neighboring
countries' utilities to operate ISCC power plants.

Furthermore and most importantly for replicability, there are no countervailing reductions in
international prices o f competing fuels (particularly fossil fuels) and competing technologies.
Quite the contrary is currently happening in international markets, particularly for fossil fuels
where the highprice levels achieved are widely believedto be a long-run trendthat is likely to be
sustained.

The legal and regulatory framework currently being put in place under the Bank's energy
Development Policy Loan (DPL), now under preparation, supports the development o f
renewable energy and its integration into the grid and lays the ground for replication o f the solar
combined cycle power technology in Morocco.               Furthermore, the project's potential for
replicability in Morocco alone i s large because the country has one of the world's best solar
resources. The success o f the proposed project, with GEF support, i s the critical first step in
Morocco's gradual approach for adopting and developing ISCC technology on a large scale.
GEF support is also critical to strengthening and speeding up the dissemination and replication
process. After the replication o f the proposed ISCC project on a larger scale in Morocco and
elsewhere, it i s expected that the production cost o f the ISCC power plants will fall significantly
and that the levelized electricity generation cost will be about the same or even less than that o f
conventional power plants. The cost reductions will result from three factors: reduced component
costs due to increased manufacturing volume, economies o f scale from increased plant size, and
technological improvements.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
1. Economic and financial analysis

The economic benefits o f the proposed project include increased availability and improved
quality o fpower supply. Furthermore, the project would assist ONE to develop institutional and
technical capabilities in solar thermal combined cycle technology.

The project i s expected to play an important role inthe optimal development and operation o f the
power subsector. The capital costs o f project, reduced by the amount of the grant, together with
incremental fuel and operating and maintenance costs associated with i t are shown in Annex 9.
All costs are expressed interms o ftheir equivalent border values. The minimummeasure ofthe
economic benefits associated with the project i s represented by incremental sales revenue. On
this basis, the net present value is estimated at USD48 million at 10%discount rate and the rate
o f returni s 11.4%.

Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Project                                                            February 2007

The foregoing revenue based measure o f the net present value is, by its nature, more a measure
o f the adequacy o f tariffs than of the true economic merit o f the project. A better measure o f
economic benefits couldhave been obtained by estimating consumers' willingness to pay (WTP)
for the incremental electricity sales. However, since domestic consumers are subsidized, the
WTP is likely to be much higher than the average 2006 tariff used in the calculations. If,
therefore, the project i sjustified with the average tariff used as proxy for economic benefits, it i s
afortiori justified ifone were to use WTP.

The switching values6 o f critical variables (investment cost, fuel cost, and sales) calculated in
Annex 9, show that the project i s sensitive to variations inthese variables. Fuels costs shouldbe
kept under constant review over the life o f the project and measures to adjust tariffs taken in a
timely manner.

Incremental CostAnalysis

An incrementalcost analysis based on intertemporal comparisons o fthe baseline and likelyplant
and the proposed GEF alternative i s shown in Annex 16. This incremental cost analysis shows
that the incremental cost o f the Ain Beni Mathar ISCC plant i s $63.16 million (of which $62.5
million i s incremental capital costs). US$43.2 million will be contributed by GEF and the
remaining US$ 20 million will be financed from 0.N.E's resources (equity and AfDB
 borrowing^).^ See Annex 16 for details of the incremental costs (particularly Table 16.4).

Financial analysis

     1. Historical analysis (2003-2005) :

O.N.E.'s financial position duringthe last three years (2003-2005) was sound. This is supported
by the following: (i)adequate tariff (average o f USD 0.08 per KWh in 2006, second highest in
the MENA region after Lebanon) compared with O.N.E.'s operating cost excluding
depreciations o f USD 0.065 per KWh; (ii)             new client arrears, which were substantially reduced
from 9 months in 1994 to 4 months in 1997. According to the 2005 financial data, last year
arrears have represented about 4 months and half of turn over. Table 1 (Annex 9) provides a
summary o f O.N.E. financial statements and performance during the last three years'. The
historical analysis shows that:

        O.N.E. operating revenues increased by more than 16% in2005. Half o f the growth was
        due to the quantity o f energy sold which increased by about 9 %, confirming the tendency
        o f the last three years in terms o f growth in electricity demand in Morocco. The



 A switching value indicates by how muchthe variable has to change to reduce the netpresent value to zero.

7For ease o fpresentation. the O.N.E. contributionis given here as a portion o f the incremental cost o f the solar
component. Elsewhere inthe report, O.N.E.'s contribution i s given as a portion o f the total capital cost o f the solar
component.

 The audit report for 2005 is still due. The financial data usedhowever is considered as final by the ONE finance
department.

        remaining change in operating revenue was due to other operating revenues which
         doubled in2005.
         However, the increase in operating revenues was more than offset by a sharp increase in
        production costs due to: (i) infuel costs which almost doubledbetween 2003 and
                                      increase
         2005 and (ii)14 % increase in the cost o f power purchased and imported by O.N.E.
        mainly from Jorf Lasfar IPP and Spain. Consequently, the operating income was negative
         in 2005 for the first time in three years. In order to preserve its financial autonomy,
         O.N.E. obtainedthe government approval for a 7% averageincrease intariff. The change
         inpriceswas made effective intwo stages during2006 (inFebruaryfor industrials andin
         July for households). This was the first increase inO.N.E. electricity prices since 1997.
    0    Arrears over a year old owed by former publicly-owned and operated regional utilities
         companies remain an issue. Their total amount i s MAD 1,072 million (USD 123 million
         equivalents). Most o f the arrears, 900 MAD, are due to the former public water and
         electricity utility o f Casablanca which i s now operated by Suez under a concession
         contract. Under the contract the private operator i s not responsible for the liabilities o f the
         previous public entity. Therefore, unless an agreement with the Municipality o f
         Casablanca i s reached O.N.E. will have to write them off as part o f the extensive balance
         sheet cleaning exercise currently underway. These arrears are expected to have minimal
         impact on O.N.E.'s future financial viability.

Projections and scenarios analysis (2006-2011)

Financial projections for 2006-2011 (Table 2, Annex 9) are largely based on the assumptions
summarized in Table 1. These assumptions were discussed with O.N.E. and are based on the
utilityleast cost plan for production and expectations interms o fcoal, fuel andnatural gas prices.
The base case scenario takes into account conservative expectation for hydropower production;

The planned investments for the period 2006-2011 will total approximately MAD 36 billion
(USD 4 billion equivalent). These represent the expansion and upgrading o f more than 70
percent o f O.N.E.'s fixed assets.

The base case scenario includes also O.N.E. planned extemalization o f its pension fund which
will require about 11billion MAD (USD 1.2 billion equivalent) o f additional debt to be financed
through the issuance o f two bonds in 2006 and 2008. Note that 2006 losses in terms o f net
income are mainly due to O.N.E. write o f f o f the pension fund assets. The write off should not
affect O.N.E. cash position.

Overall under the base case scenario and taking into account the 2006 tariff increase, O.N.E.'s
financial situation should remain sound during the next five years as perceived from its cash
position, earningbefore interest and taxes (EBITA) and debt service ratio.

Nevertheless, given that O.N.E. i s currently undertakingan update o f its investment master plan
in order to be able to respond to the recent upward change in terms of growth in electricity
demand, it i s likely that capital expenditure will be higher than currently planned. While the
financing of any additional capital expenditures would be financed through PSP/IPP schemes,
O.N.E. might need further tariff revisions in order to be able to raise additional capital (see
scenario analysis below).

A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess O.N.E.'s financial situation under different
scenarios for fuel, coal and natural gas prices as well as the price o f power purchased. The
analysis included two scenarios: (i) annual increase in the cost o f fuel, coal and natural gas
                                       5%
and 5% annual increase inthe price o fpower purchased and (ii)   same as scenario 1but with 10%
annual increase instead o f 5%. The table below summarizes the impacts o f both scenarios on
O.N.E.'s EBITA and Debt coverage.

O.N.E.'s financial position remains sound under the first scenario. However, as shown by the
results from scenario 2, an increase o f more than 5% will require a further increase in O.N.E.'s
tariff. Should the second scenario materialize the lengthy process for public utility tariff revision
inMorocco mighthave a further negativeimpact onO.N.E.'s financial performance.

2. Technical

The main technical issue to be addressed is the specification o f the performance required from
the plant in terms o f its capacity, output, fuel consumption, and efficiency and how these are to
be divided between the conventional and solar portions o f the plant. In addition to minimum
qualifications for the solar trough technology, these performance specifications will ensure
effective integration o f the steam systems for the solar field and the gas-fired combined cycle
plant. The contractor selection process reviewed plant designs to ensure that the plant will
operate effectively in all modes. In particular, integration and control o f the system should be
flexible enough to allow the solar contribution to be consistently maximized, while under other
circumstances allow power to be efficiently generated on natural gas only (e.g., duringnight time
or if, for some reason, the solar field i s not operational). Creating an incentive structure to
maximize solar output from the field for the whole life o f the plant and a bid evaluation
mechanism, which i s transparent but does not inadvertently introduce a bias for or against a
particular technology or cause bidders to `game' the evaluation i s a significant task. The bid
evaluation criteria and the determination o f the levelized electricity cost (LEC) include
incentives for the maximization o f the solar output. This i s reflected in the EPC and O&M
contracts.

3. Fiduciary

The financial management system was appraised to determine if it complies with the
requirements o f the Bank in respect to OPA3P10.02. The evaluation o f the O.N.E. covered the
areas o f accounting and financial management, as well as the reporting and auditing process of
the project. The financial management system, including necessary arrangements to respond to
the needs o f the financial monitoring o fthe project, satisfies the requirements o f the Bank.

The financial management system presents a low fiduciary risk. The project will be carried out
while beingbased on the procedures andthe accountingand financial organizationo fthe O.N.E.,
which has a financial management system considered to be satisfactory. As an autonomous
public entity with commercial and industrial characteristics, the O.N.E. has financial autonomy
and is subjected to the financial control o f the State. Its accounting system is based on the rules
applicable to the state owned enterprises and its financial statements are submitted to an annual
external audit. In addition, the O.N.E. has acquired a substantial experience in financed project
management.

The financial management will be ensured by the finance and treasury divisions within the
financial department o f the O.N.E., in coordination with the concerned technical departments.
Specific arrangements for the needs for financial reporting were approved during the evaluation.
Financial monitoring reports (FMR), which will cover all the activities and sources o f funds o f
the project, will be prepared quarterly by the O.N.E. and transmitted to the World Bank and the
other donors of the project 45 days after the end o f each period. The final format o f these reports
has been transmitted to the O.N.E. during appraisal. An annual audit report o f the project
accounts, transmitted to the Bank no later than six months after the end o f each exercise, will be
carried out in accordance with the Bank guidelines by an acceptable auditor and according to
acceptable terms o f references by the Bank.

The project i s co-financed by GEF, AfDB, and O.N.E. Financial flows will come from the funds
o f the GEF via the Bank, loan funds from the AfDB, and counterpart funds financed by the
O.N.E. Flows o f funds between the World Bank, the O.N.E., and the recipients will be organized
according to traditional disbursement procedures o f the Bank. In order to facilitate the
disbursement o f the eligible expenditures, the O.N.E. will open separate accounts individualized
for each donor in the name o f the project in a commercial bank. The opened account for the
funds will be managed in accordance with the procedures o f the Bank as regards to
disbursement.

4. Social

The development of the power plant is expected to have a positive social impact on the
local population and the local economy (i)    providing both direct (and indirect) sources o f
employment during the construction and production phases (500 direct jobs during the
former and 50 during the latter phase) - the majority o f workers will be locally recruited;
(ii)leadingto improvementsinlocalinfrastructureincludingthe rehabilitation oflocal
roads; and (iii)  improving access to electricity particularly for poor rural families who are
currently not connected.

Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Project                                           February 2007



During project preparation, the World Bank's team and a representative o f the Ofice
Nationale d 'klectricite' (O.N.E.) conducted a series o f informal consultations with
pastoralists in the immediate vicinity o f the proposed plant. The local pastoralists viewed
the plant as an asset to the region given its employment generation potential and improved
availability o f electricity.

The project site i s situated 10 kilometers to the West o f the national route P19 linking
Oujda (90 km to the North) and the town o f Ain Beni Mathar. The entrance to the access
road for the project site i s about 5km to the north o f the town o f Ain Beni Mathar. The
project site itself and its immediate vicinity are sparsely populated. The main economic
activities o f the inhabitants are extensive agriculture and extensive livestock grazing. The
site itself i s used by local nomadic pastoralists for grazing purposes. However, given the
large tracts o f land available in the vicinity it has been determined that the livelihoods of
the pastoralists will not be unduly compromised by the presence o f the power plant, or the
access roads, power lines or gas lines.

A potential negative social impact of the project is the spontaneous development of a
shanty town community in the vicinity o f the project site drawn to the increased
employment opportunities in the area. The presence o f a sizeable town in the area, Ain
Beni Mathar, may mean however, that immigrants to the area may relocate there. Local
authorities and O.N.E. will have to be aware o f the potentially negative impacts and
monitor the development ofthe area.

5. Environment

An initial environmental assessment was undertaken by a consultancy firm and completed in
mid-2004. The project was designated as Category B project on the basis o f this first report and
the subsequent Environmental Assessment Study performed by a consortium composed of
another international and a local consultancy firm; as the O.N.E. decided to undertake a
complementary study in order to cover the aspects related to the construction o f the two 225 kV
and the 60 kV transmission lines, and to cover some o f the missing aspects related to the World
Bank policies and requirements.

The new assessment, undertaken for the totality o f the project, with both components integrating
the solar trough collector field and the traditional natural gas-based power generating unit,
confirmed that the project has minimal negligible impacts on the environment as the plant
utilizes solar and natural gas. The use o f solar power does not produce any pollutants, and the
combustion o f natural gas generates the lowest level o f C02 emissions compared to any other
fossil fuel. In addition, the combustion o f natural gas does not entail SO2 emissions, and has
significantly lower emissions o f NO2 than other fossil fuels. In that respect, the project has an
overall direct environmental benefit as it will lead also to an increase in the share o f renewable
energies in the country's energy sector, and a reduction o f green house gases emissions. The
report also confirmed the potential very positive socio-economic fallouts due to the creation o f
employment.

The key environmental issues raised and properly addressedinthe environmental assessment and
the EMP are the main risks that could exist due to an accidental contamination o f the site by the
heating fluids during operation as well as during transportation to the site in the construction
phase. Such risks will be largely reduced and properly managed through the inclusion o f a
retention and treatment system and by following the safety measures for proper handling and
transportation o fhazardous substances.

The volumes o f cooling water to be pumped from the aquifer, inthe selected proposal presented
in the international competitive bidding, should not exceed the maximum amounts, as
determined in the environmental assessment in order to maintain the current balance o f the
resource.

The most important impacts expected duringthe construction phase are due to the large volumes
o f construction and solid wastes that will be generated.

The Environmental Management Plan has included the potential environmental impacts
associated with the construction o f the Power Plant, the substations, the access road to the Plant
and the transmission lines; in addition to the proposed mitigation measures, and a proper
monitoring program. A capacity building program to strengthen the capacities o f the O.N.E. for
the follow-up on the implementation o f the overall EMP, as well as the implementation o f the
parts o fthe EMPunderthe direct mandate o f the O.N.E., has also beenbuilt ininto the project.

Inaddition and giventhe special nature of the project as a GEF project aiming at disseminating
the results and the lessons learned to increase the overall global benefits, a comprehensive
monitoring and evaluation program that goes beyond the environmental safeguards requirements
o f the Bank has been included in the Environmental and Social Development and Management
Component.

6. Safeguard policies

Environmental
The project has triggered the Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01), which requires a
partial assessment to be conducted for the project, and the preparation o f an Environmental
Management Plan. The Borrower has contracted out an independentconsultant to undertake this
assessment and prepare the EMP. The review o f the first drafts o f the EMP revealed an obvious
lack o f details and specific mitigation measures, which did however exist in the Impact
Assessment Report. The Borrower was accordingly requested to amend the EMP with the
support o f the consultant, to integrate the specific mitigation measures. The potential
environmental impacts o f the power plant are confined to the site and appropriate mitigation
measures have been identified and included in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP),
which follows the World Bank's guidelines, notably OP 4.01.

Social
The Social Safeguards policy onInvoluntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) has beentriggered
as it has been determinedthat land acquisition will be requiredfor the construction site o f

the power plant, the gas pipelines, the access road and the electric lines. Specifically, the
project requires the acquisition o f
         --  159 ha 97 are 50 ca for thepower plant;
             6 ha 17 are 11 ca where the gas pipelines will be laid and 12 ha 35 are 20 ea

         -   will be     temporarily occupiedhsed during the constructionphase; and
             For the access road and electric lines, a study is being undertaken to determine
             the exact land size requirements.

A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)havebeen
prepared for the project. The RAP applies to the power plant site and the gas pipelines
because the project-affected people have already been identified and land acquisition
procedures have been launched. Since the exact nature and extent o f land acquisition for
the access roads and electric lines has not yet been determined, an RPF has been
formulated, which will be followed with a Resettlement Action Plan downstreamonce the
feasibility study has been completed.

At the time o f appraisal, the project affected persons on the Power Plant site had been
compensated by O.N.E. for the loss o f agricultural productivity. The assets valuation o f the
people on the gas pipeline site has been completed and O.N.E. anticipates to proceed to the
compensation due to these people prior to the start o f the work. As mentioned earlier, the
precise sites and lands to be acquired for the construction o f the access roads and the
electric lines have not yet been determined; hence the compensation procedure will be
launched once the sites and the people whose land will be acquired have been determined,
as stated inthe RPF.

Thepersons and government agencies affected by the land acquisition canbe classified as follows:

    -    Public land: For the power plant site, the Ofice Nationale de I'Electricite' (O.N.E.) has
         proceeded with the purchase of land from the Ministryo f Interior, the custodian o f public
         collective land. Two land parcels for the gas pipelines will also be acquired in the same
         manner.
    -    Collectiveland owned by the Communeof BeniMathar - Collectivite' Ethnique de Be'ni
         Mathar: O.N.E. has compensated the collective landusers who are actually farming on the

    -    site selected for the power plant for the loss o ftheir cropsharvest.
         Private land:For the gas pipelines, 21 landowners will be compensated for their landand
         any eventual loss o f cropsharvest. As for the power plant site, there are no private land

    -    owners whose landwill be acquired.
         Land owned by public Agencies (Office Nationale de Chemin de Fer, Direction
         Rkgionale de 1'Equipement, et 1'Agence du Bassin Hydraulique de Moulouya): O.N.E. i s
         preparing and processing a request letter for the permission o f temporary occupation o f
         these lands ownedby public entityagencies duringthe constructionphase.

InJune 2006, a social assessment was conductedat the project site with all the acquisition-
affected people. A series of intensive consultations were conducted with 8 persons whose
land andor assets will be affected by the power plant construction and 21 persons affected
by the gas pipelines. The people were informed about the project and the compensation

procedures for their loss. Inaddition the consultations touched upon the implications o f the
project in terms o f employment generation. The assessment further improved the local
communities' understandings o f the project and its implications, and confirmed that the
populations are awaiting the employment opportunities whichthe project will likely offer.

Equally, elected representatives o f the local commune o f B6ni Mathar as well as three
public agencies that will be affected by the land acquisition for the gas pipeline, including
I'OfJice National des Chemins de Fer (ONCF) ;la Direction Rkgionale du Ministkre de
1'Equipernent et 1'Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Moulouya have been consulted in this
regard.

The entityresponsable for land acquisition inO.N.E. is the Division Gestion du Patrimoine
et des Affaires Immobilikres. The Division has experience in land acquisition issues and
operates according to Moroccan law. However, given their unfamiliarity with Bank
guidelines, a capacity buildingprogram will be conducted for the 0.N.E.staff working on
land acquisition inorder to enhance their knowledge about the Bank's guidelines on Social
safeguards, and precisely the policy on Resettlement and Land acquisition. It is further
recommended that a third party (NGO or consultant) be hired to work with O.N.E. and
provide additional oversight on land acquisition issues during the implementation and
supervision stage o f the RPF and RAP, in compliance with Bank social safeguards to
ensure the timely implementationo f land acquisition procedures.

                            Annex 1:Countryand Sector Background
     MOROCCO:INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWERPROJECT

TheEconomy

1.      Promoting rapid growth and creatingjobs: Morocco's population i s about 30 millions
and its 2005 income per capita was about $1,653. Approximately 400,000 new jobs must be
created annually until 2010 to meet the goal o f 6% unemployment set in 2004 by the
government. The challenge for the country i s therefore to promote rapid economic growth as an
engine for job creation.

2.      Maintaining macroeconomic stability:             Morocco has maintained macroeconomic
stability. Morocco's consumer price inflation rate was 1%in2005, down from 1.5% in2004. As
a result o f higher food and fuel prices, it i s estimated to have been2.5% in 2006. The challenge
for Morocco is to keep the inflation rate differential between Morocco and its main trading
partners incheck so as to maintainthe competitiveness of Moroccan exports.

3.      Controlling fiscal expenditures: Controlling fiscal expenditures remains a priority for
Morocco. The fiscal position of the Kingdom improved in 2005 despite important expenditures
generated by the implementation o f early retirement programs and higher petroleum product
prices, because of the remarkable resilience o f fiscal revenues. The 2005 budget deficit was
about 4.2%. The public wage bill accounts for more than half o f government expenditures and
control i s therefore a priority for the government. The purpose is to reduce its weight relative to
gross domestic product (GDP) and to strengthen public savings to finance public investment.
Early retirement and other measures which have benefited about 38,800 public servants have
contributed to the reduction o fthe wage bill from 13% o f GDP in2005 to 12 % o f GDP in2006.

4.      Fostering efficiency and trade: Since the early 1 9 8 0 ~Morocco has pursued other
                                                                        ~
economic liberalization efforts including a reform program supported by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Morocco has signed several agreements with the European
Union on economic cooperation, including one establishinga free trade zone for industrial goods
over a 12-year transition period. The U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which was
signed in 2004, eliminated tariffs on 95% o f bilateral trade, with the remaining tariffs to be
eliminated over the next nine years.

TheEnerm sector

5.      High level of import dependency: a source of vulnerability and of concern over
security of supply: Morocco is almost entirely dependent on imports to satisfy its energy
demand, with 95% o f primary energy demand (excluding non commercial forms o f energy)
covered by imports. The country i s the largest energy importer in northern Africa with a total
cost for its imports increasing from $3 billion in2004 to $4.2 billion in2005 because o f risingoil
prices.

Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Project                                                       February 2007

Imports are dominated by oil, accounting for 2/3 o f energy imports, and coal ( 1/3 o f imports),
while electricity is only a small proportion o f imports at present. Energy imports have increased
steadily since 2000 andrepresented 22 percent o f the country's imports (US$4.6 billion) in2005.
Thus, Morocco is highly exposed to international price fluctuations,' which have a destabilizing
effect on its balance o f payments. The increase in energy prices i s estimated to have reduced
Morocco's GDP growth by 1percent over the 2000-05 period.2 Inthe Government's base case
projections, Morocco's energy risk exposure i s projected to grow, as consumption increases from
10 million tons o f oil equivalent (toe) in 2005 to 17 mtoe in 2014.                    The energy price risk
exposure also impacts the poor directly through the increase intheir energy-related expenditures,
which presently represents 8.7 percent o f their b ~ d g e t . ~

The price control policy in place since 2000 has substantially subsidized consumer prices for
petroleumproducts. Energy subsidies representedUS$1.04 billion in 2005 or 46 percent o f the
Government's capital investmentbudget, andwould have further increased to US$l.26 billion in
2006 had the Government not taken measures inSeptember 2006 to reduce subsidies.

One o f the key element o f Morocco's energy policy i s to reduce import dependency and increase
security o f supply through the development o f indigenous sources o f energy ( in particular
renewable energy) andenergy conservation.

6.      Universal access to electricity, strong electricity demand growth and urgent need for
additional power generating capacity: Access to electricity, a priority o f the Moroccan
government, i s already high and increasing hrther with a rapid growth in rural electrification:
from only 18% in 1995, it has increased to 72% in 2005 and 81% in 2006 and i s projected to
reach 100% in 2007. This rapid growth in rural electrification will contribute to boosting
electricity demand growth. Growth in Moroccan electricity demand has accelerated over the last
3 years from 6% p.a. on average during 1997-2002 to 8% p.a. during 2003-2006. Even with
intensified electricity conservation and demand side management (DSM) efforts, electricity
demand is expected to continue growing at a similar rate. The "Office National de 1'Electricitk"
(O.N.E.) projects that peak demandwill grow from 3300MW in 2005 to between 4825MW and
5300 MW in2010 and 7000MW and 8500MW in2015 depending on assumptions on economic
growth and energy conservation.

Ifthe Ain Beni Mathar plant is not commissioned on schedule by 2010, then power generating

reserve margin o f lo%, even if capacity in the pipeline (projects under construction or
capacity will be insufficient to meet the level o f electricity demand, while maintaining the target

committed) i s fully commissioned. No large scale new plant has been commissioned inMorocco


  The increase o f petroleum product prices from US$38.25 per bbl in 2004 to US$54.0 per bbl in2005 increased
  Morocco's import bill by US$1.5 billion and imports' share in the balance o f payments from 17 percent to
  22 percent. Steam coal prices have also increased significantly over the same period, from US$34.9 per ton
  (Europe) in2000 to US$69.6 per ton in2005.
  This estimate is based on the evaluation o f DEC o f the impact o f a $30 increase o f oil prices on growth for
  middle-income countries.
  Energy expenditures at full market price represented in2000 about 8.74 percent o fhousehold expenditures for the
  lowest income quintile and 7.29 percent for the highest income quintile, based o n Morocco's 2000-0 1household
  survey results.

since March 2005 when the CCGT of Tahaddart came into operation. Ain Beni Mathar will be
the first large scale plant to be commissioned after Tahaddart. The proposed capacity for Ain
Beni Mathar has been doubled because another CCGT project at A1Wahda, originally scheduled
to be cofnmissionedin2008-09, has been cancelled because of lack o f availability o f natural gas.
The project was conditioned on the signature o f a new gas contract with Algeria which failed to
occur.

To face this tight capacity situation, the Government o f Morocco has increased the ceiling for
autoproduction capacity from lOMW to 50MW, and O.N.E. i s offering third party access for
those generators.

7. Increasing role for natural gas as a way to diversify the energy mix, but penetration
hindered by lack of resources; Extendeduse o f naturalgas, especially inthe power sector, i s a
cornerstone o fthe country's energy policy, aiming at the diversification o f the sources o f energy,
the provision o f energy at the lowest cost and the reduction o f the environmental impact. The
commissioning o f the Tahaddart planthas resulted inan increase inthe share o fnatural gas in
Morocco's primaryenergy demand to 3.5% in2006, from less than 1% in2004. The
commissioning o f Ain BeniMathar would lift that share to 6%, but it would also absorb the
remainder o f the transit gas available.

Furthernatural gas penetrationwould require an agreement with Algeria on contracting
additional gas volumes or the developmento f additional gas import infrastructure, which i s
unlikelyto be feasiblebefore 2012. For the moment, plans for additional gas-firedpower plants
have been cancelled.

8. Regional energy market integration: The Government recognizes that the country could
benefit significantly from integratinginto a regionalpower market. This would enable Morocco
to receive back-up services and benefit from reserve capacity at a lower cost, purchase/sell
electricity f r o d t o neighboring countries on the best financial terms, and possibly, export "green
electricity" from wind farms4. The potential gains interms o f avoided investment inreserve
capacity, improved security o f supply, and access to cheaper electricity contribute to lower the
cost o f electricity A Protocol was signed in2003 to create a Maghreb regional energy market that
would integrate gradually with the EUenergy markets andthe EuropeanCommission is
financing a study on regional market integration.

The EuropeanInvestmentBank has already been active infinancing the strengtheningo fthe
interconnectionbetween Morocco and Spainwhich was increased in2005 to 1400MW. The
strengthening o f the interconnectionwith Algeria will be completed by the end o f 2007.

AlthoughMorocco is a transit country for Algerian gas exports to Spain andPortugal, a regional
gas market has not yet developed inpractice. The Algerian gas i s transported across the Strait o f
Gibraltar via the 300-350 Bcf/year Maghreb-Europe Gas (MEG) pipeline. Morocco receives
royalties (in cash or inkind) from the pipeline as payment for passage through its territory and i s

  For instance the strong growth indemand in2006 was inpart met through imports as imports from Spain
increased from 784 GWh in2005 to 2003 GWh in2006.

 increasingly turning to natural gas to meet increasing energy demand, especially in the power
 sector. However, as discussed above, the volume o f gas available is limited and may not allow
 the development o f other power stations beyond Ain Beni Mathar.

 9.      Promotion of renewable energy and energy efficiency key to ensure security of supply
 and reduce import dependency: Inthis climate o f strong demand growth and expensive energy,
 energy efficiency (EE) and renewable energy (RE) seem to be the most promising ways to
reduce dependency on imports. The Government has therefore given priority to EE and RE inits
 energy policy, and a new program to accelerate the penetrationo f renewables and to promote EE
was announced by the Council o f Ministers on January 26th 2007. The objective i s for
renewables to capture 10% o f primary energy demand and 20% o f power generation by 2012.
 The DPL in preparation will ensure that the Bank provides the necessary support for this
program to succeed inachieving its objectives.

Renewable energy plays a key role in 0.N.E.k capacity expansion plan. The plan calls for two,
new wind projects by 2008:         One o f the wind power facilities (60 MW) will be located in
Essaouira, while the other (140 MW)-willbe located near Tangiers. The Essaouira facility i s
 scheduled to come on-line in 2007. The Ain Beni Mathar project is in line with the
Government's objective to increase the role o f renewables and O.N.E.'s plan to increasingly rely
on renewablesto meet its objective of diversification.

In parallel, O.N.E. has initiated a demand side management (DSM) program to tap the large
potential for energy savings which has been identified. This initiative is in line with the
objectives o f the Moroccan energy policy and consistent with efforts advocated by the Bank and
other lenders to give priority to measures that reduce growth inenergy demand. Ifsuccessfbl, the
program would reduce greatly the need for massive investment in generation and
transmissioddistribution infrastructure. In order to successfilly implement the program, O.N.E.
i s setting up a D S M department, as part of its reorganization.

10.      Electricity sector liberalization under way expected to induce a revival in private sector
financing: Supported by the Bank DPL, reform o fthe Moroccan electricity sector i s under way.
A draft law, presentlyunder discussion by the Government, calls for: (i)      gradual liberalization of
the electricity market, starting with eligibility o f high-voltage customers, (ii)establishment o f an
electricity regulator who will advise on price revisions, attribution o f licenses for new generators
and distributors, supervision o f existing and new concessions, setting o f technical and
commercial standards, supervision of calls for tenders for new capacity in the context o f sector
planning by the Transmission System Operator, and regulation o f competition and (iii)
restructuring o f O.N.E. and unbundlinginto three commercially separated activities: generation
for the regulated market, dispatch and transmission, and distribution. These lines o f business
will be entrusted to separate subsidiarieswithina O.N.E. holding company.

The creation o f a stable and clear regulatory framework should encourage private sector
participation in the expansion o f power generating capacity, and possibly other activities o f the
electricity value chain. The private sector already plays a key role in the electricity sector in
Morocco, with over 50% of the power generating capacity in the hands o f IPPs (contributing to

Although private sector financing in Morocco has been deemed a success story5, recent
experience has been less positive, in particular with no private bidder for the Ain Beni Mathar
plant. It is expected that interest will be revived once the electricity liberalization law is fully
implemented and enforced. Moreover, the interest in wind energy o f domestic and international
investors has remained vivid. The interest o f large industrial companies to further expand auto-
production in units o f increasing size i s a sign o f a dynamic market keen to experience
competition.

The Bank has resumed a high-level o f partnership inthe Moroccan energy sector after a gap o f
some years. The Government o f Morocco, O.N.E. and the Bank are engaged in an intensive
policy dialogue in this strategic sector, and a comprehensive program o f financial and technical
support i s being developed. Reliability and long-term involvement are the foundation o f this
relationship.

The first in a programmatic series o f Energy Development Policy Loans (DPL) is now at an
advanced stage o f preparation (Board presentation i s proposed inFY07). The DPL supports the
Government's energy sector reform program which focuses on (i)energy security and
sustainable    development;     (ii)increasing energy sector productivity and Morocco's
competitiveness; (iii)moderating fiscal exposure in the energy sector; and (iv) enhancing
monitoring, evaluation, andpublic communication inthe sector.

The DPL is being developed in consultation with the European Commission under the auspices
o f the European Neighborhood Policy, and the EU and Morocco's joint objectives o f closer
economic integration.. The DPL preparation i s also supported by a number o f ESMAP-hnded
studies focusing on renewable energy, energy efficiency, andsocial protection.

There are clear synergies between the proposed Integrated Solar and Combined Cycle Power
Project (ISCC) and the programmatic DPL: (i)       support for sustainable development through a
renewable energy technology that could prove highly efficient, if the experiment succeeds; (ii)
avoidance o f power blackouts in Morocco which would have serious political and economic
implications, and would undermine reform; (iii)a gradual approach to electricity market
liberalization which will be supportive o f renewable energy development; (iv) promotion o f
private participation inpower which would allow the eventual privatization o f the ISCC; and (v)
enhanced monitoring and evaluation capacity in Morocco which will be critical for global
disseminationo f the learning which i s at the heart o f the ISCC project.

The goals o f the ISCC and programmatic DPL will also be underpinned by a proposed Bank
investment loan to O.N.E.        This is at a relatively early stage o f preparation (for Board
presentation in FY08), and will focus on augmenting transmission capacity to keep pace with
rapid electricity demand growth and investment in generation capacity, including ISCC. The
project will also include assistance to O.N.E. to restructure in order to respond better to the
reformed policy framework, including inits support for renewable energy development.

O.N.E. all the payment orders. In addition, the internal audit function i s performed by the audit
and organization department, directly attached to the general manager's office.


        External audit

4.      The financial statements o f O.N.E. are subjected to an annual external audit. The
financial statements o f the last three exercises, audited by an international audit firm, were
certified with qualifications. These are mainly the result of the upgrade o f the accounting system
and do not suggest the existence o f accountability issues. The audit of a GEF Grant (Grant GEF
22942) didnot raise issues likely to questionthe use o f the funds o f the grant.

5.      Bank policies require that an annual external audit of the project accounts, established in
accordance with acceptable accounting standards, be carried out in accordance with acceptable
auditing standards and terms o f reference and that the auditor i s acceptable to the Bank. The
project financial statements including all sources and use o f funds must be audited each year in
accordance with Bank guidelines. The project audited financial statements must be transmitted to
the Bank no later than six months after the end o f each fiscal year.

        Financial reporting and information system

6.      The financial monitoring of projects i s ensuredby the service for long and mediumterm
financing within the finance and treasury division (financial department), in coordination with
the concerned technical departments. O.N.E. acquired a substantial knowledge inmanagement of
projects financed by international donors (BIRD, BAD, ED, INSIPID, BID, KFW...). The
existing human resource capacity is adequate to carry out the financial management tasks o f the
project. There i s no need for change inquantity and quality o f the existing staff to meet Bank and
O.N.E. financial reporting requirement. The integrated information system (11s) allows a follow-
up o f outstanding debt in foreign currency and in Dirhams (module loan) but it does not
automatically provide a sufficient level of information for the financial monitoring of the project
in term of allocation and use of funds by component and category of expenditure. O.N.E.
elaborates project financial statements according to the format agreed with the donors based on
the existing information adapted for the needs o fthe project.

        Project monitoring

7.      O.N.E. will submit to the Bank a half yearly FinancialMonitoringReport (FMR) 45 days
after the end o f each period. These reports will be established in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The FMRwill provide, for all the sources o f funds for the project:
        -   a summary cash-flow table showing received funds by sources and expenditures by
            category for the past semester and the accumulated amount up to the date o f the

        -   report, as well as projection for the next six months,
            a summary o f the use o f funds showing payments by project component/activity for

        --  the past semester and the amounts accumulated as o fthe date o f the report,
            a summary o fprocurementprocesses andprocedures,
            a summary o f the physical progress byproject component/activity.

8.      Insofar as the existing information system of O.N.E. does not automatically provide a
sufficient level o f detail requiredby the Bank for the production o f the FMR, a project financial
information system will be produced in term o f resources and use o f funds, by component and
category o f project expenditures and sources o f financing. The financial tables will be produced
manually based on the reprocessing o f the data provided by the existing information system. The
formats o f the reports were agreed with O.N.E. duringproject preparation.


        Evaluation of the system in use

9.      The financial management system of the project is in line with the minima conditions
requiredby the Bank taking into account the management system o f O.N.E. and the experience
acquired in financial project management.


        Flow of funds

10.     The project i s co-financed by GEF, AfDB and O.N.E. Financial flows will come from
GEF funds via the Bank, the loan funds from the AfDB, and counterpart funds financed by

11. Method of disbursements. The proceeds o f the grant will be disbursedfirst and once the
grant funds are fully disbursed, the AfDB loan will take over. The proceeds o f the Grant would
be disbursedinaccordance with the traditional Disbursementprocedures o f the Bank and will be
used to finance project activities through the disbursement procedures currently in use: i.e.
Withdrawal Applications (WAS) for direct payment, for Special Commitments and/or
reimbursement accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation or. The Project
Management Unit (Office National de 1'Electricite) will be responsible for submitting the
appropriate supporting documentation for activities implemented so that payments can be made
from the Special Account opened for that purpose, or to submit WASfor direct payment to the
Bank accompanied by the necessary supporting documentation. As projected by Bank's standard
disbursementprofiles, disbursementswouldbe completed four (4) months after Project closure.

12. Special account. To facilitate disbursementof eligible expenditures O.N.E. will open and
establish at a Commercial Bank a Special Account in Dirhams with an initial authorized
allocation equivalent to $5 million to cover Grant's share o f eligible Project expenditures. The
Authorized allocation o f the SA would be the equivalent o f an estimated four (4) months' o f
eligible expenditures financed by the Grant. O.N.E. will be responsible for submittingmonthly
replenishment WASwith appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures incurred and
will retain and make the documents available for review by the Bank supervision mission and
project auditors. The supporting documentation will include reconciled bank statements and
other documents as may berequired.

A. General

All procurement activities under the project will be carried out by Office National de
L'Electricitk (O.N.E.). Procurement for the proposedproject would be carried out inaccordance
with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
May 2004; and the provisions stipulatedinthe Legal Agreement. The Grant will finance a single
contract, which i s jointly financed with O.N.E. and the African Development Bank.
Consequently, no Procurement Plan i s required. A general procurement notice was publishedin
UNDevelopment Business and on d-g Market on April 6, 2004. Such contract consists inthe
supply and installation (single responsibility contract) o f the ISCC Power Plant at Ain Beni
Mathar estimated at about US$519.27 million (including contingencies) o f which the GEF grant
will finance up to US$43.2 million. The borrower carried out a prequalification process under
the Bank's supervision andno objection. Prequalifiedcontractors were invited to submit bids for
this contract.    Procurement was conducted using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents
(SBD). Procurement for non-Bank financed contracts will be conducted using AfDB and
national SBD satisfactory to the Bank. The supply and installation o f the transmission lines and
substations for the evacuation o f the power from the power plant will be financed by the AfDB
and O.N.E.

Selection o f Consultants: Consulting services for the supervision and management o f the ISCC
Power Plant will be financed by AfDB and O.N.E. and consultants will be selected inaccordance
with AfDB procedures.

B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement

An assessment of the capacity o f O.N.E. to implement procurement actions for the project was
carried out during the pre-appraisal mission in September 2005 and updated during the appraisal
mission in June 2006. The assessment reviewed the organizational structure for implementing
the project. The main findings are as follows:

The Direction Production o f O.N.E. would be responsible for the construction o f the ISCC
Power Plant. A project manager within the Direction Production has been appointed.             The
Project Manager reports directly to the Director o f Production and will liaise with and rely for
support from the following Departments: Direction Approvisionnernents et Marches for
procurement matters; Direction Technique et Ingenierie for technical matters; and Direction
Financiere for financial managementandaudit matters.

O.N.E. has substantial project management experience including familiarity with standard
bidding documents for projects financed by international financial agencies, such as the EIB,
AfDB, Islamic Bank and others. The Direction Production will manage the procurement,
erection o f equipment/materials and commissioning, and will closely coordinate with the other
relevant departments. The consulting firm Fichtner (financed by the AfDB) i s assisting O.N.E. in

the preparation o f prequalification document and evaluation, bidding documents and evaluation
o fbids, and assisting incontract negotiation. A source o f possible risk i s that O.N.E.'s staff may
not be fully updated on the Bank procurement/contract management procedures. To minimize
this risk, duringproject t launch, training to O.N.E. procurement specialists will be`provided to
update the procurement skills including familiarization with new Bank procurement guidelines.

C. ProcurementPlanandAdvancedProcurement

Procurement Plan:

This project involves the financing o f only one contract under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) which had its procurement process advanced and is nearly completed. Consequently, a
procurement plan i s not required. For the overall project, Attachment 1 shows the procurement
actions.

Advanced Procurement:

The single contract beingfinanced by the GEF Grant had its procurement actions advanced. It i s
a Two Stage biddingprocess with prequalification. The contract i s for a combined cycle power
plantjointly financed by the Bank, O.N.E., and AfDB. It includes a solar component fundedby
a GEF grant. The Borrower has the help o f a consulting engineer (Fichtner Solar who i s also
working on a similar project inEgypt).

Prequalification -- The borrower issued prequalification documents, received and analyzed
applications and finally prequalified four potential bidders. The Bank supervised all steps o f the
process and issued the corresponding no objections (OPRC cleared the no objection to the list o f
prequalified potential bidders). The number o f bidders in this case was low because the solar
component restricts the number o f qualified bidders.

First Stage o f Bidding-- The borrower issued biddingdocuments (200-250 MW plant capacity)
for the first stage o f bidding for the four prequalified bidders and received technical bids
submitted by only 3 bidders because one excused himself16. The borrower carried out
clarification meetings with bidders, cleared their minutes with the Bank and sent it to bidders.
The borrower (with the Bank's no objection) issued final biddingdocuments.

Second Stage o f Bidding -- The borrower received final proposals from only two bidders since
the third excused himself17. Inaccordance with the biddingdocuments the Borrower has opened
the technical proposals and has kept sealed and safeguarded the price proposals submitted by the


16The bidder indicated that "Infact we are not in the condition to submit a bidfor this biddingprocess being
responsive to all the requirements included in the bidding documents because the conditions and guarantees
required are very strong and we do notfind interest in the contract resultingfrom such bidding documents."
  After having participated inthe technical discussions this bidder sent a letter indicating that it would not submit a
bidfor this contract. This bidder was contacted again (for the higher capacity option) and reaffirmed his lack o f
interest inparticipating inthis biddingprocess.

two bidders for both options o f solar capacity (20 M W and 30MW solar) for the 200-250 MW
plant capacity. Before the opening o f the price proposals, O.N.E. contacted the Bank requesting
approval to issue an amendment to the bidding documents asking bidders who offered
commercial bids to submit additional bids for a higher plant capacity (400-450 MW) for the two
options for solar component (20 M W and 30 MW). The Bank agreed to the request with the
condition that O.N.E. would keep (sealed and safeguarded) the price proposals received for the
lower capacity (200-250 MW). Therefore, O.N.E. evaluated the commercial proposals for,the
higher plant capacity for the 20MW solar component option to define the winningbidder. Then,
O.N.E. opened the winning bidder's commercial proposal for the 30MW solar component
option. O.N.E. analyzed this proposal and submittedto the Bank a final recommendation on the
option o f its choice for contract signature, namely 452MW o f CCGT and 20MW o f solar
capacity.

D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision

In addition to the prior review supervision the Bank has been carrying out of the advanced
procurement process, the capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended
one field supervisionmission to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.

2. ConsultingServices

No consultant contract will be financed under this Bank project. All Consultancy services for
project management for the ISCC Power Plant will be financedby the AfDB and O.N.E.

      MOROCCO: INTEGRATED SOLARCOMBINED CYCLE POWER PROJECT


A. ProiectEconomicAnalysis

Method
1.       The proposed project forms an integral part o f O.N.E.'s least-cost expansion plan.
Incremental capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, and benefit streams o f the project (all
in2006 prices) are shown in Table 1of this Annex. Assumptions underlying these figures are
detailed below:

Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
2.       Incremental operation and maintenance costs at generation have been estimated at $14.4
million per year

Transmission and distribution costs
3.       Transmission and distribution costs are estimated at 0.6 U S cent/kWh

FuelCosts
5.       Fuel costs have been estimated on the basis o f the economic cost of gas for Morocco o f
$6/MMBtu.

Economic Benefits
6.       Economic benefits associated with incremental electricity supply to consumers are
calculated using average tariffs. Although benefits in this case are more a reflection o f the
adequacy o f tariffs than the true value o f the benefits o f the project, calculations using
consumers' willingness to pay (WTP), as proxies for benefits, are unnecessary. As tariffs,
particularly for domestic consumers, are subsidized, WTP i s likely to be greater than average
tariffs. Therefore, if the project i s justified using average tariffs, it is, a fortiori, justified using
WTP.

Results o f the Analysis
7.       The calculations show that the NPV o fthe project is equal to $48 million andthe rate o f
return i s equal to 11.4%.

Switching Values:
8. The switching value o f a variable i s that value at which the project's NPV becomes zero (or
the IRR equals the discount rate). The switching values for the ISCC project are given in the
table below in terms o f the percentage change in the value o f the variable needed to turn the
project's NPV equal to zero. Switching values are useful in identifying which variables most
affect project outcome and are presented below:

                          Total InvestmentCosts                   13%


    The most two critical variables are the level o f sales and the fuel costs. While sales may
    drop, it i s unlikely, given past experience and the growth of the economy that they will drop
    by the required level of 3% to bring down the NPV to zero. Things are, however, different
    for fuel costs. They can easily increase by 1%. This is also an area o f concern for the future
    and their evolution should be kept under constant review. Beyond operating its power
    stations efficiently, this variable i s beyond the control of O.N.E. As suggested earlier, should
    fuel prices increase, tariffs would have to be adjusted accordingly (ifthe reforms take place,
    the adjustment would concern the regulated market, the non-regulated or competitive market
    will automatically adjust). Finally, the project's worth is also sensitive to changes in total
    investment costs, but an 13% increase in total investment costs i s considered quite unlikely
    since we are dealing with actual bidresults.

Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Power Project                                           February 2007
                                                                                             Annex 10

      MOROCCO: INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWER PROJECT


In accordance with the World Bank Safeguards policies on environment, the project has been
classified as a "Category B" Project.         The project has also been classified under the
"Environmental Category 11" o f the African Development Bank, which means the impacts are
site specific and that measures to minimize or mitigate these impacts can easily be identified and
recommended. The rating i s based on the conclusions o f the preliminary assessment at the
concept stage and reconfirmed after the Environmental Impact Assessment was done. The two
safeguard policies to be triggered under this project are OP 4.01: Environmental Assessment and
OP 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement.

The Bank's Safeguard Policies have been made available to the implementing agency, O.N.E.,
which on its side shared it with the consultancy consortium, BurgCap and PhCnixa, which
conducted the EIA. The first draft presented to the Bank did not follow the directives and the
operational procedures o f the Bank with respect to environmental and social assessment, and
O.N.E. was asked to re-submita revisedEIA, which was found to be acceptable to the team and
the Environmental and Social Safeguards reviewers.

Inaddition to the Bank's guidelines, the assessment took into consideration the requirements of
various national environmental laws and regulation o f direct relevance to the project, namely
Law 11-03 on the protection of the Environment, Law 12-03 on EIA, Law 13-03 on Air
Pollution, despite the fact that no Executive Regulations have been issued to-date to
operationalize the enforcement o f these laws. Other regulation o f relevance, such as Law 10-95
on Water and the 1914 Decree governing the establishment o f hazardous, unsanitary and
disagreeable establishments.

EnvironmentalAspects

Several alternatives were considered as part o f the EnvironmentalImpact Assessment, including
siting and technology alternatives. A pre-feasibility study conducted in 1994 has considered 2
alternative sites for the solar-thermal power plant: Ouarzazzate and Taroudant. In 1996, the
search for a more suitable site on the basis o f various environmental factors, the proximity to the
water resources needed for the cooling system, and the proximityto the Maghreb-Europe natural
gas network ledto the selection of the Beni-Mathar site, inJerada, because o f its proximity to the
transmission and distribution network and the land availability.

The electricity produced by the proposed plant will be evacuated through two 225kV
transmission lines and one 60 kV transmission line. The two 225 kV lines will go to the Oujda
substation (110 km) and to the Bourdim substation (70 km) while the 60kV line will be
constructed to provide a backup power supply to the auxiliaries o f the plant in case o f
emergency. This line, o f about 10 km, will connect the 60/22 kV substation of Ain Beni Mathar
to the power plant.

In its identification o f the path o f the high voltage transmission lines, the Office National de
1'Electricite has taken into consideration to generally avoid inhabited areas and protected areas o f
ecological importance.

The operation o f the solar thermal power plant does not lead to negative impacts with respect to
i t s air emissions ,as C02 and NO2 emissions associated with the use o f natural gas are much less
than in the case o f any other fossil fuel, and there are no SO2 emissions. The main risks that
could exist would be due to accidental contamination o f the site by a spill o f the heat transfer
fluid duringoperation as well as during transportation to the site inthe construction phase. Such
risks will however be largely reduced and properly managed through the inclusion o f a retention
and biological treatment system to be included in the detailed design o f the project, and by
following the safety measures for proper handlingand transportation o f hazardous substances.

Due consideration should also be given to avoid exceeding the allowable volumes o f cooling
water to be pumpedfkom the aquifer inorder to maintain the current balance o f the resource.

Other important impacts, for which mitigation measures have been identified, and that should be
included in the terms o f reference (TORs) and contracts o f the construction firms are related to
solid waste and the final disposal o f such waste inpre-identified controlled landfills, incase they
cannot bere-used or recycled on site.

EnvironmentalManagementPlan

Following the guidelines o f the Bank and the Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook, an
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan has been developed. The Government o f
Morocco i s in general familiar with the Bank's safeguard policies and its requirements, and
specifically the Quality and Environment Division o f O.N.E. has acquired very important
experience during the preparation o f the TORs for the EL4 and the supervision o f the EIA
consultant's work, in close collaboration with the project's environmental and social safeguards
team.

The implementation o f the Environmental Management Plan will be the responsibility o f the
EPC Contractor and its sub-contractors, as clearly specified in bidding documents that should
take into considerationthe recommended mitigation measures. Monitoring the implementation o f
the Environmental Management Plan will be the responsibility o f the Quality and Environment
Division o f O.N.E. The cost o f implementation and monitoring o f the EMP i s covered in the
cost o fthe project.

PublicConsultationandDisclosure

A day o f public consultations was organized by O.N.E. on December 29, 2005 in the
Municipality o f Ain BeniMathar. The objective was to provide information to the general public
on the power plant, to raise awareness among the invited participants, and to answer their
questions and concerns while sharing the results o f the Environmental Impact Assessment. The

Social Aspects

Background

The project triggered the Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OPBP 4.12) as it has been
determined that land acquisition will be requiredfor the construction site o f the power plant, the
gas pipelines, the access road and the electric lines. Specifically, the project requires the
acquisition o f

-            159ha 97 are 50 ea for thepower plant;
             6 ha 17 are 11 ca where the gas pipelines will be laid and 12 ha 35 are 20 ea will be

-            temporarily occupiedhsed during the constructionphase;
            As for the access road and the electric lines, a study is being undertaken to determine
             the exact land size requirements.

This Annex presents the summaries o f (i) Resettlement Action Plan and (ii) Resettlement
                                             the                                     the
Policy Framework (RPF) that have been prepared under the project. The Resettlement Action
Plan applies to the power plant site and the gas pipelines because the project-affected people
have been identified and land acquisition procedures have been launched. Since the exact nature
and extent o f land acquisition for the access roads and electric lines has not yet been determined,
a Resettlement Policy Framework has been formulated, which will be followed with a
Resettlement Action Plan downstream once the feasibility study has been completed. Both the
RPF and RAP documents have been based on the findings of the project feasibility study, the
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments, the site visits conducted and consultations held
with the project-affectedpeople.

The RPF and RAP have been disclosed at the World Bank's Infoshop and made available at the
local commune level, a place accessible to the public concerned in Morocco (Le. relevant
municipalities) prior to project appraisal.

I. SummaryoftheResettlementActionPlan
        A.       PotentialImpactsof LandAcquisition

The land acquisition for the power plant site and the gas pipelines does not lead to
involuntaryresettlement,either residentialor commercial,of local inhabitants,nor does it
pose any threats to incomes or livelihoods,or createhtensifypovertyor vulnerability.
The acquisition, which directly affects 8 and 21persons, respectively, involves minor reduction
inagricultural plot area, none o fwhich wouldrequirethephysicalrelocationo fthesepersons.

        B.       CensusSurvey & SocialAssessment

A social assessment was conducted at the project site with all the acquisition-affectedpeople in
June 2006. A series o f intensive consultations were conducted with 8 persons whose land and/or
assets will be affected by the power plant construction and 21 persons affected by the gas

pipelines. The people were informed about the project and the compensation procedures for
their loss. Inaddition the consultations touched upon the implications o f the project interms of
employment generation. The assessment further improved the local communities' understandings o f
the project and its implications, and confirmed that the populations are awaiting the employment
opportunities which the project will likely offer.

Equally, elected representatives o f the local commune o f BCni Mathar as well as three public agencies
that will be affected by the land acquisition for the gas pipeline, including 1'Office National des Chemins
de Fer (ONCF) ; la Direction Rkgionale du MinistBre de 1'Equipement et I'Agence du Bassin
Hydraulique du Moulouya have been consulted inthis regard.

         C.      LegalFrameworkGoverningLandAcquisition

The compensation for the land acquisition can be done either on mutually agreed terms or
through expropriation in the public interest, which is stipulated in law n"7-81 issued by dahir
n"1-81-254 dated6 M a y 1982.

This law supersedes previous dahirs dated April 3, 1951, June 25 1929, and August 22, 1938
respectively as well as the vizirial order dated October 20, 1954. (Refer to RAP for details).

        D.       EligibilityCriteria

The persons and government agencies affected by the land acquisition canbe classifiedas follows:

    -   Public land: For the power plant site, the OfJice Nationale de I'Electricite' (O.N.E.) has
        proceeded with the purchase o f land from the Ministry o f Interior, the custodian o f public
        collective land. Two land parcels for the gas pipelines will also be acquired in the same
        manner.

    -    Collectivelandownedby the Communeof BeniMathar - Collectivite' Ethnique deBe'ni
        Mathar: O.N.E. has compensated the collective land users who are actually farming on the
         site selected for the power plant for the loss o ftheir cropdharvest.

    -   Privateland:For the gas pipelines, 21 landowners will be compensated for their landand
         any eventual loss o f crops/harvest. As for the power plant site, there are no private land
        owners whose landwill be acquired.

    -   Land owned by public Agencies (OfJice Nationale de Chemin de Fer, Direction
        Re'gionale de I'Equipement, et I'Agence du Bassin Hydraulique de Moulouya): O.N.E. i s
        preparing and processing a request letter for the permission o f temporary occupation of
        these lands owned by public entity agencies during the construction phase of the gas
        pipelines.

         E.      Valuation and Compensationfor Losses

    Description ofthe compensation

    The compensation levels are determined by a Commission o f Experts comprised o f the
    following members:
    ....
    1   Representative o fthe local authority o fAin BCniMathar ;
        President o fthe Rural Commune o fBCniMathar ;
        Two community representatives o fthe Collectivitk Ethnique o fBCniMathar;
        The representative o f the Sewice de I'Enregistrement de la Direction Rkgionale des
        ImpSts ;
        A representative o fthe Direction Rkgionale desDomaines.

    This Commission has fixed the compensation based on the current land value inthe region and
    also on the basis o f negotiationsbetweenits members among whom are local community
    representatives: the President o f the Rural Commune andthe representatives o f the Locla
    Commune - Collectivite` Ethnique of Bkni Mathar.

    Land acquisition procedure

    The taking o f land and related assetdcrops may take place only after full compensation has
    beenmadeto all affected people.

    The procedures applied by O.N.E.for land acquisition are as follows:

        Address a letter to the Governor of the concerned Province to call for a meeting with the
    .   Commission o f Experts;

        Participate as observers in the two meetings o f the Commission of Experts, who are in
        charge o f validating the list o f affected persons and agencies as well as fixing the land
    ..  value;

        Undertake Social Assessment and census;

        Compensate the land users and/or land owners, in conformity with the validated list and
        agreed prices.

        F.        CommunityParticipation

In June 2006, a series o f intensive consultations were conducted with local project affected
people as part o f the social and land acquisition assessment. The assessment was conducted by a
local consultant. The study consulted with individuals whose land and/or assets will be affected
by the construction o f the power plant and the gas pipelines and they were informed about the
project and the land compensation procedures. In addition, the consultations touched upon the
implications o f the project interms o f employment generation. The assessment further improved

Equally, elected representatives o f the local commune o f BCni Mathar as well as three public
agencies that will be affected by the land acquisition for the gas pipeline, including I'OfJice
National des Chemins de Fer (ONCF) ;la Direction Rkgionale du MinistBre de I'Equipement et
1'Agence du Bassin Hydraulique du Moulouya have been consulted on this regards.

Additionally,
    In October 2005 the project team conducted a series o f informal consultations with
pastoralists in the immediate vicinity of the proposed plant. The local pastoralists viewed the
plant as an asset to the region given its employment generation potential and improved
availability of electricity.

    On December 29,2005 and as part o f the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a day o f
public consultations was organized by O.N.E. in the Municipality o f Ain Beni Mathar. The
objective was to provide information to the general public on the power plant and to raise
awareness, among the participants, and to answer their questions and concerns while sharingthe
results o f the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The participants, over 120 individuals,
included: the local population, elected officials, NGO representatives from the region and
economic operators.

        G.       Grievance Procedures

Incase of litigation or conflict, the concerned populations can directly address their complaints
and concerns to the two local representatives o f the Collectivitk Ethnique and the Commune
Rurale.

Additionally, the land owners and/or land users who would like to contest the proposedfixed
compensation can call upon the tribunal for a revised valuation o f the landassets. Any affected
person may appeal to the court for redress. The court has the power to hear submissions, review
the process, and make such provisions as it deems necessary.                These include ordering
compensation to be paid, halting works, etc.

        H.       Organizational Responsibilities

 O.N.E., which i s the grant recipient for the project, will be responsible for ensuring that the land
acquisition procedures will be undertaken in compliance with the Moroccan law on
Expropriation and Land Acquisition as well as the World Bank's operational policy OP 4.12.
The main Unit in O.N.E. who will be incharge o f the implementation of these procedures is the
Division de la Gestion du Patrimoine et des Affaires ImmobiliBres.

Commission of Experts. The required public land has been purchased, and the compensations to
the communal landusers for the loss of use o f the land andor loss o f crops have been grantedby
O.N.E.

InFebruary 2006, the Commission of Experts completed validatingthe list of landowners/users,
the size o f the land and other characteristics and valuated the land/assets to fix the compensations
for the land acquisition entailed by the construction o f the gas pipelines. Due compensation will be
granted to the affected people prior to the start o fthe work on the gas pipeline.

O.N.E. is officially requesting authorizationfrom the concerned partiedagencies for the temporary
occupatiodusage o f their lands for the construction o f the gas pipeline. O.N.E. expects to obtain
the official permissionbyNovember 2006.

         J.      Cost and Budget

For the power plant site:
H         7 998 750,OO Dhs has been transferredpaid to the Ministry o f Interior for the acquisition
o f communal land; and
H         192 877,08 Dhshas been paid to the 7 communal landusers for their loss o f crops/assets.

For the gas pipelines,
H         687895,OO Dhshas been allocated for the private andpublic land acquisitions; and
H         19 024,OO Dhs for the temporary occupation/ of landparcels.

The land acquisition costs (including compensation, land purchase, etc.) are being financed from
O.N.E.'s budget. This cost remains negligible/much lower in comparison with the overall project
cost.

         K.       Monitoringand Evaluation

O.N.E. will be incharge o fmonitoring the implementationof this RAP to ensure that the project-
affected people are adequately compensated. For every operation and any type of land
acquisition (private, public or communal land), the table in annex 3 will be filled out and
submittedto the Bank for non-objection. This table will allow O.N.E. to inform the Bank o f the
progress made on the Plan and will be used as a monitoring and evaluation tool to document
accomplishments, identify the dates for specific activities, delays, if any etc.


Inaddition to the internal supervisionby O.N.E., the implementationofthe Resettlement Action
Plan should be followed up by a third party entity such as a local NGO/ consultant who i s
specialized in Land acquisition and Social Development related issues. Performance indicators
shouldbe usedto measure progress.

11.     Summaryof the ResettlementPolicy Framework

    A.       PrinciplesandObjectivesGoverningResettlement

Minimization of expropriation of land. The expropriation o f private land is minimized in
accordance with Moroccan law, which requires public utility projects o f any nature to make
maximum use o f public land, and only to resort to expropriation when there i s no alternative.
Minimal expropriation o f private land also serves the interest o f O.N.E. and the concerned
municipalities which are obliged to pay compensation awarded by independent assessment as
explained below. Preference i s always given to transfer o f government or public land from other
agencies where this i s available, but even in this case compensation i s payable. Also provisions
will be taken by O.N.E. to avoid disturbing existing structures, in particular residences, farms,
areas o f religious or cultural heritage value, parks or other areas o fpublic value.

Legal process is obligatory.All expropriations must be carried out according to the provisions
o f Moroccan law. The law o f expropriation defines the procedures to be followed and protects
the rights o f all parties involved. Wrongs committed during expropriation may be redressed by
the courts with provision for payment o fdamages and punishment o foffenders.

Compensation and eligibility principles. Whenever expropriation o f private land is
unavoidable, Moroccan law clearly indicates that land should be expropriated through full
Compensation at market value, independently determined, with advance public notice,
negotiation and right o f appeal. Rights to compensation extend to owners, tenants, workers, or
any personwho can demonstrate any interest lost as a result o f expropriation.

    B.       Descriptionof Proceduresfor PreparingandApprovingA ResettlementActionPlan

The procedure for the land acquisition for the access road and the electric lines i s as follows:
    .   Address a letter to the Governor of the concerned Province to call for a meeting with the
        Commission o fExperts;
        The Commission o f Experts meets to fix the landvalue and compensation ;
        The local Authorities validate the list o f land ownershsers to be compensated based on the
        Commission's valuation.

Finally, O.N.E. pays the fixed compensation according to the validated list. Compensate the land
users and/or landowners, inconformity with the validated list and agreed prices.

As per the World Bank's safeguard policy on Involuntary Resettlement OPDP 4.12, a Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (LARP)will be formulated and implementedby O.N.E., and
will encompass the following.:

The completion o f the feasibility study will determine the exact location and size o f land
requiredfor the access road andthe electric lines. A censuswill be conductedto identify the
people that will be affectedby this land acquisition.

    D.      EligibilityCriteria

The following main categories are entitledto compensation where land/assets loss i s established.

                                                                                                             Annex 16

           MOROCCO: INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWERPROJECT


IncrementalCost Analysis

1.      Total incremental costs o f the Morocco Integrated Solar Combined Cvcle (ISCC) project (472
MW with 20 MW solar) are US$63.16 million. The GEF will cover an amount o f US$43.2 million,
corresponding to 68% o f the total incremental costs.

GlobalEnvironmentalObjective

2.      The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has identified"solar thermal-electric technologies inhigh
insulation regions, initially emphasizing the proven parabolic trough variant for electric power
generation"'*, as one o f the renewable energy technologies it supports through its operational program
number 7 (OP 7). The project, with other thermal power projects now being developed worldwide (e.g.
Algeria, Spain, etc.) including two planned GEF solar thermal projects in Egypt and Mexico, will
contribute to buildinga critical mass to bringdown the production costs o f the ISCC technology.

3.      The demonstration o f the use o f parabolic trough for electric power generation as per OP 7 i s at
the heart o f the support o f the GEF for this project. In accordance with the findings for renewable energy
technology development for power generation, the IEA (2002) report emphasizes that "the highest
potential for cost reduction among the renewable electricity technologies are (a) expensive and (b) recent
in development. They tend to have a steep learning curve with a progress ratio of about 80%".'9 ISCC
technology fits in this category. The construction o f the projects in Egypt, Morocco, and Mexico are
intended to set the stage for future developments. In 2002, about 354 MW o f parabolic trough solar
concentrating power plants were installed. The addition o f 20 MW in Morocco would increase the
installed capacity by 6%. An addition o f 30 MW solar would increase the installed capacity by 8%.
Parabolic trough technology, as used for ISCC power plants, i s the leading concentrating power
technology. The other two types o f technologies (power tower and parabolic dish) are at a more
experimental stage.

4.      Among the countries inAfrica, Morocco has led the application o f renewable energy together with
Egypt. Because o f its strong dependence on fossil fuel from imports, Morocco has targeted its energy
policy towards the diversification o f the sources of supply and the valorization o f the national resources,
inparticular through the promotion of all the useable forms of renewable energies (hydraulic, wind and
solar), which use domestic resources.

5.      Morocco has a large potential o f renewable energy, as reflected in solar radiation o f 5
kWh/m*/day, and inwind with a potential o f 6,000 MW (inparticular on the 3,500 km o f coastal areas).
Inrecognition of this importance, Morocco has adopted a renewable energy strategy, which prescribes
that the share o f Renewable Energies (including hydraulics) reaches 10% in the national energy balance

by 2012, compared to 3.9% at present2' While Morocco has accessed her significant wind energy
potential with the commissioning o f the 50MW wind farm at Koudia A1 Baida (2001) and a number o f
additional wind farms have been posted for submission o f tender, Morocco still has not found a way o f
tapping its significant solar resources.

6.       In early 2007 - and despite large progress made inthe area o f solar technologies - no competitive
solar technologies exist. Solar photovoltaics have become increasingly popular for off-grid applications or
applications dedicated to a specific type o f use (lamps, hifi equipment, navigation equipment, mobile
phone network equipment). At a cost o f UScents 25 - 80/kWh, the technology i s still far away from being
competitive for large-scale electricity production. As identified by IEA (2002)21, which reviewed the
future potential of different solar technologies, solar trough technology has the most important
technological development potential for large-scale solar applications. IEA (2002) estimate solar trough
technology to be in the range o f UScents 20 - 25/kWh. Consequently, the possibility o f a grant from the
GEF towards the incremental costs o fthe solar troughtechnology constitutes a unique opportunity for the
G o M to become a driver inthe development o f technology.

7.       A direct global benefit o f the project is the carbon abatement achievedby substitutingsolar energy
for fossil fuels. Assuming the 20 MW solar field will be operating about 35% o f the time (compared to
67% for the gas turbine), the solar contribution to the overall generation o f the power plant will be about
1.1%or about 40 GWhper year. This translates into carbon savings o f about 24,300 tons of C02 per year
or 610,000 tons o f C02 over the 25 year lifetime o f the plant. These values are based on the actual bids
received and represent an increase in carbon savings compared to the original estimates o f 22,500 tons of
C02 per year. The incremental cost per ton o f C02 avoided i s US$ 104/ton o f C02.

Sector Background

8.       Morocco's energy sector faces serious constraints due to its dependence for more than 95 percent
on energy imports and its remaining substantial use o f traditional energy (firewood and charcoal). The
energy sector inMorocco is also characterized by the preponderance o f the petroleum products, even if
their share in the power sector were reduced from 83%,in 1980 to 62% in 2005. Total consumption,
though, remains relatively low (0.4 TEP/capita/year). Morocco's total energy expenditure increased from
27 billion DH (US$3 billion) in 2004 to 37.7 billion DH (US$4.2 billion) in 2005 due to the rise in the
prices o f oil and coal. In order to counter this dependence, Morocco has actively sought to increase the
diversity o f energy resources usedinthe electricity sector inthe last 15 years. Inearly 2007, the primary
fuels used in the production o f electricity include coal, heavy fuel oil, natural gas, hydraulics, wind and
solar photovoltaics.

9.       Moroccan electricity demand grew about 5 to 7 % per year on average over the last decade, and it
i s expected to continue growing at this pace for the foreseeable future. In 2006, total sales o f electricity
amounted to 21,104 GWh, an increase o f 10% compared to 2005. The total number o f customers i s at
2,654,222 up by 10.6% due to the ongoing rural electrification program. Under the rural electrification
program some 3,610 villages were connected to the grid, and some 363 villages received individual solar


2o The Moroccan Government states       in their 2007 Energy Sector note that "The importance of om local potential, the
considerable evolution o f technologies and the strong growth o f the world market, accompanied by a significant and
continuous fall o f the costs, constitute for Morocco, essential opportunities which will result in these new resources
representing a significant share inthe national energy balance inthe years to come."

systems. The rate o f electrification inrural areas increased from 62% in2003 to 85% in2005 and 89% in
2006. The average tariff in 2004 was 0.678 MAD/kWhcorresponding to about U S # 8kWh. To meet the
growing demand, additional generation capacity o f between 200 - 300 MW per year will be needed. The
connection to the grid o f the solar thermal power plant in the Moroccan expansion plan is scheduled for
the middleo f 2009.

10.      Institutional Framework: since 1963, the National office o f Electricity (ONE) i s the principal
actor o f the electricity sector. As a publicly-owned commercial and industrial entity, it was created by
dahir it no163-226 o f August 5 1963 which:             22
    entrusts ONE with the public service responsibility for the generation, transmission and the
    distributiono f electricity;
    obliges ONE to ensure the service o f the distribution o f electricity inthe absence o f service supplied
    by the communes ("Regies") or by concessions;
    gives ONE exclusive right for the settingup o f generation capacity exceeding 10MW.

11.      The Government o f Morocco (GOM) has embarked on a power sector reform program and has
undertaken important steps to secure private investors to operate the sector's power generating and
distribution facilities. As early as 1994 the electricity law was amended to permit the operation of
IndependentPower Producers (IPPs). By Order inCouncil no2-94-503 o f September 23, 1994, the ONE
was entitledto enter in agreements with private entities, for the generation o f electricity by entities with
generating units larger than 10 MW, provided that the generation i s intendedexclusively for the needs o f
ONE. Since this law was passed, three concession contracts for the generation o f electricity with off-take
by ONE through dedicated Purchasing Power Agreements were concluded with Jorf Lasfar Energy
Company (JLEC); the Wind company o f Strait (CED); and Electric power o f Tahaddart (EET).23

12.      As a singlebuyer established by the Order inCouncil o f September 1994, ONE ensures the supply
o f electricity to all the customers o f the Moroccanmarket through its own generation, the purchase from
concessionaires, and imports. ONE i s the most important distribution company inMorocco, covering 95%
of the national territory, serving 1.466 communes and supplying 56% o f the customers.

13.      Energy supply: in early 2007 a total of 5.2 GW capacity was installed inMorocco, o f which 3.5
GW was thermal power (of which 1.6 GW are coal-fired), 1,265 hydropower, 54 MW wind power, and
464 MW pumpedstorage. Several IPPs are operating inMorocco, including the coal-fired power plant o f
Jorf Lasfar. The latter contributes about 10,000 GWh or almost 55% o f Morocco's electricity demand.



22The rights and obligations o f ONE are defined ina schedule o f conditions, approved by the decree no2-73-533 o f November
29, 1973, which defines the technical, administrative and financial terms relating to the operation o f installations for
generation, transmission and distribution o f electricity.
23More details on these concessions as follows:
    Jorf Lasfar Energy Company concluded on September 12, 1997 a contract with ONE for the exploitation o f the two
    existing generation units inJorf Lasfar and for the construction and operation o f two other units inthis same power station.
    The total capacity o f these four units is 1.356 MW. The generation o f this power station accounted for 55.4% o f the
    demand at the end o f 2004.
    Wind company o f the Strait which signed a contract with the ONE on October 2, 1998, and designed, built and operates
    the wind farm Abdelkhalek Torres (Koudia A1Bai'da), with a capacity o f 50 MW.
    Electric power o f Tahaddart, with 48% o f capital held by the ONE, 32% by ENDESA and 20% by SIEMENS. The
    purpose o f the company is the construction and the operation o f a combined cycle power plant at Tahaddart, with a
    capacity o f 384 MW and using transit natural gas. The power station was brought into service on March 26,2005.

Substantial amounts o f electricity are also being imported from Spain. In2006, the net import from Spain
amountedto 2,003 GWhor nearly 10% o f electricity generation.

14.     In2004, electricity generated from coal accounted for about 70% of generation. The secondmajor
fuel was HFO with 1,881 GWhproduced in2004. InFebruary 2005, natural gas became the second major
fuel with the completion of the 385 MW combined cycle power plant at Taharddart. Morocco i s
beneficiary o f a natural gas wheeling arrangement whereby the country can extract up to 7% o f all gas
wheeled from Algeria via Morocco to Spain through the Euro-Maghreb gas pipeline.The consumption o f
Tahaddart was 348 million m3 in 2005, producing nearly 11.6% o f Moroccols electricity or a share o f
3.1% o fthe countryk total energy balance.

15.     The G O M i s committed to developing renewable energy resources such as mini-hydro, solar, and
wind. The most visible sign o f the GOM's commitment to renewables is the construction of the 50 MW
wind farm at Koudia A1 BaYda. The addition o f further capacity is planned for April 2007 at Cap Sim (60
MW) and for 2008 at an area near Tangiers (140 MW). Power generated from wind is around 200 GWh
annually or 1% o fpower generated.

16.     Due to the availability o f GEF funds, the solar thermal power plant planned at Ain Beni Mathar
has figured inMoroccok power expansion plan. The inclusion of full incremental costs allows the plant to
enter the least cost expansion plan. The G o M fully recognizes in its recent Energy Sector Letter the
importance o f such funding to access the significant solar resources inthe country: "Inthe last few years,
the renewable energy sector benefited from a favorable national and international environment supportive
to durable forms o f energy".

Baseline

17.     An analysis o f Morocco's system expansion plan, fuel supply and availability, and potential
candidate plants suggests that the least-cost baseline course of action would be the commissioning o f
further gas-fired combined cycle capacity, if natural gas was available. The baseline plant is therefore
assumed to be a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) fueled with natural gas capable o f producing the
same output as the proposed GEF alternative.

GEFAlternative

18.     The GEF alternative i s a combined CCGT and solar field power plant o f the parabolic solar trough
concentrating solar power design. As opposedto photovoltaic technology, the Integrated Solar Combined
Cycle Power Plant (ISCC) technology uses direct insolation. Due to Morocco's high levels o f direct
insolation, it makes the country an ideal location for the settingup o f such plant. The plant i s to be located
inA h BeniMathar, which is about 86 kmsouth o f Oujda. Inthe context o fMorocco, A h BeniMathar is
a least cost site with excellent levels o f solar insolation 2,290 kWh/m2/year, direct access to natural gas
(close vicinity to the Euro-Maghreb pipeline), water supply, and close access to the national grid. The
plant is directly implemented by ONE through a combined Engineering, Procurement, Construction
(EPC) and O&M (Operation andMaintenance) contract.

19.     The preferredproposed alternative foresees the construction o f a solar thermal - fossil fuel hybrid
power plant of a total net capacity of 472 MW, with 20 MW solar. The bids for power plant were made
for different options. The originally planned 227 MW plant was substitutedin favor o f a larger plant, as

 Scope of the Analysis

 21.      The analysis is based on the direct comparison o f the proposed solar thermal plant with the least-
 cost conventional solution, assuming the same load factor.

     Additional domestic benefits

 22.      The GEF alternative will result in improvements in domestic air quality. Morocco has already
 initiated and implemented important actions dealing with local air pollution, including measures on
 promoting renewable energy (e.g. the Koudia A1 BaYda windfarm), utilizing cleaner fuels (in particular
 natural gas), and improving efficiency in energy production and usage (e.g. at Jorf Lasfar Iand 11, which
 are underprivate management).

        Key Assumptions

23.     The incremental cost analysis uses assumptions common for economic analysis at the World
Bank. The economic cost o f gas i s assumed at US$ 6/mm BTU. This i s the price o f gas throughout most
of Europe and can be assumed the market price for transit gas, as if this gas was not consumed in
Morocco it could be sold in Spain at about that price. Key assumptions are summarized in Table 16-2
below.

costs

This incremental cost analysis benefits from the availability o f the actual bid data. For the purposes of
comparability, both initial cost estimates and actual bid data are compared. It i s noteworthy that the bid
prices for both the CCGT and the solar component are higher than anticipated. Equally, the incremental
cost estimates are higher than originally estimated, by a total o f nearly US$14 million. Difference o f
estimates incapital costs are due to:

    (a) the decline of the US Dollar with respectto the Euro: since 2003 the US$ has declined by 33%
        with respect to the Euro. As the market is dominated by European suppliers, this would hlly
        convert into a price increase o fplant;
    (b) the increase of metal and other commodity prices in world markets: as the solar part of the
        plant i s particularly heavy in equipment (steel), changes inthe metal markets affect the plant price
        significantly. Since 1999, when the GEF adopted the strategy o f pursuing concentrating solar
        technology, the price o f steel has increased by 77% (inreal terms). Similarly, the copper price has
        increased by 284% (inreal terms). See also graphbelow.
    (c) the winning bid's plant size: although rated at 20 MW, the winning bid has a solar field that i s
        32,000 m2 larger than the estimated value. This indicates that the estimates had underestimated the
        required size for guaranteeing a rating at 20 MW. Against this background, the increase in
        incremental costs at 28% appears relatively modest.

financial rates of return than the public sector. Finally, the project configuration and arrangements have
been optimized in the selection process for the EPC cum O&M contract through the utilization o f open
competitive bidding.

         Capital costs

25.      The cost for the baseline CCGT was estimated at US$632/kW and that of the GEF alternative at
$826/kW. The actual costs o f the least cost offer for the CCGT part o f the ISCC was US$ 918. Solar
power entails substantially higher capital costs than conventional generation and the kW installed costs an
estimated $2,16O/kW for the solar field. The actual costs as per bid amounted to US$3,289. The overall

detailed cost breakdown - based on the findings o f the feasibility study and project appraisal- i s shown in
estimated cost o f the ISCC was US$826/kW, but the actual price was higher at US$997.4. A more

table 16-3 below, and a technical breakdown i s provided in Table 16-6 below. Capital costs include
physical contingencies. The comparison o f cost estimates between the baseline and the GEF alternative
focuses on the costs of design, construction, and operation alone as the costs for the requiredtransmission
lines, substation, access road, boreholes, gas pipeline connection, environmental mitigation and
consultancy services are assumed to be roughly the same in both cases. A detailed breakdown o f Project
costs is included inAnnex 5 above.

         Recurrent costs

26.      The main recurrent cost elements concern fuel purchases and operation and maintenance (O&M).
The original estimates for O&M data for the ISCC plant were based on the experience in this area
collected from the nine solar thermal plants that have been operating in California since the 1990s. Over
the years, operators have succeeded insubstantially reducing O&M costs by increasing the efficiency and
lifetime o f solar field components, improving the effectiveness o f the solar field - power block interface
and other measures. Nevertheless, the ISCC envisaged under the GEF funding i s technologically
substantially different to those plant constructed in California. Most importantly, the plants in California
are significantly smaller in size. This introduced a significant level o f uncertainty into the estimate for
O&M costs. The fixed annual O&M costs hadbeen estimated at a total o f US$2,750,000. The actual fixed
O&M price as per lowest evaluated bidder amounted to US$5,210,000. This indicates that the operating
experience from plant inCalifornia may not be readily converted into cost for ISCC.

        Incremental costs

27.     The above considerations result in an incremental cost estimate o f US$ 63.16 million for the 472
MW ISCC with 20MW o f solar field. Table 16-4 presents baseline costs and the costs o f the ISCC
alternative broken down in capital, fuel and O&M costs over the plant lifetime. The incremental cost i s
equally broken down in incremental capital, fuel and O&M costs. It i s assumed that the baseline plant
would generate the same GWh o f electricity as the ISCC alternative. Due to the high actual O&M costs
compared to the somewhat lower fuel cost savings, the overall operational costs o f the ISCC plant are
somewhat higher than o f the baseline plant. More detailed technical data are provided intable 16-7.

changing underlying assumptions on the level o f incremental costs. The results o f the sensitivity analysis are
summarized in table 16-5. They indicate that the results are highly robust to changes in the underlying

      MOROCCO: INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWERPROJECT
                                 Independent Tec h ica1Review

1.       Introduction

This project will assist the Government o fMorocco, through its state-owned Office National de
1'Electricite (O.N.E.), to finance and construct an integrated solar thermal combined cycle
(ISCC) power plant through an Engineer, Procure and Construct (EPC) cum Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) contract. O.N.E. will finance the plant through an African Development
Bank (AfDB) loan (already secured for about 64% o f the project cost), their own contribution of
about 16%, and a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which will beusedto
finance the incremental cost o fthe solar thermal portion o fthe ISCC power plant (about 20% of
total investment costs.) The O&M contract will last 5 years andinclude appropriate incentives to
ensure an efficient operation o f the plant, particularly the solar field.

Selection o f the EPC/O&M contractor will be through an international biddingprocess, and
details o f the plant design and the contractual arrangements can only be defined after the winning
bidis selected. As aresult, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) has beenwritten with a
limitedamount o ftechnical details, basedprimarily on the feasibility studycarried out by
Fichtner Solar in2005. Therefore, this technical review can only address the details provided
regarding the project approach, site selection, conceptual design, biddingprocess, and expected
contractual arrangements. It cannot comment on the adequacy o f the final plant design or
contracts.

The gross capacity o f the ISCC power plant i s expected to bebetween 200-250 M W e and the
solar thermal parabolic trough collector field i s expected to have an equivalent capacity o f
between20-30 MWe. Based on the feasibility study, the annual net electricity producedby the
plant i s expected to be about 1,590 GWh, which includes the solar field contribution o f about 56
GWhper year. This corresponds to a solar share o f 3.5 percent ofthe total plant output when
operating at a full load. The primary fuel for the gas turbinewill be natural gas suppliedvia a
spur from the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline.

2. GEFContext

The proposedproject addresses GEF Operational Program 7 (OP7): reducing the long-term cost
o f low greenhouse gas-emitting technologies. OP7 aims to accelerate market penetration o f
several large-scale backstop technologies that are constrained by highcapital costs and high
commercial risks. The strategy i s to identifyprojects that address national priorities and then
finance the incrementalcosts o f investments,capacity buildingand other activities that reduce
market barriers and perceived risks by investors.

Based on the technical success o f the 354 MW o f solar thermal power plants still operating in
California after more than 15 years, this technology can be considered an important large-scale

non-carbon emittingbackstop technology. Many o f these plants currently operate at solar
outputs that exceed their initial design specifications. Also, this reviewer agrees that significant
cost reductions and eventual commercial acceptance ofthis technology can only beginto occur
with the implementationo fseveral demonstration projects incarefully selected countries and
sites. The proposedproject i s one o f four similar projects (the others being inIndia, Mexico and
Egypt), which havebeen approved byGEF as part its program to accelerate cost reduction and
commercial adoption o fthis large-scale non-carbon emittinggeneration technology. Inaddition,
the timingo f this project fits well with new installations o f solar thermal power technology
taking place inindustrialized countries. These projects include a 1MWEsolar parabolic trough
organic Rankine cycle power plant undergoing start-up inArizona, a 64 M W e solar thermal
power plant under construction inNevada, and two 50 MWe solar thermal power plantswith
thermal storage under construction inSpain.

3.       Key Issues

            a. Project Approach

The reviewer agrees with the Project implementation approach o f constructing the plant on the
basis of a turnkey EPC contract and a 5-year O&M agreement with the same contractor. First,
the ISCCS design integration and the technology selection risks will beborne bythe contractor,
who will have the expertise to manage those risks.      Second, competition among the EPC bidders
will help ensure that the most cost-effective combination o ftechnology and local component
manufacturing will be selected. Third, the O&M contract should contain appropriate incentive
structure for bothmaximizing the total plant reliability as well as maximizing the utilization o f
the solar field over the longterm. The PAD only discussesthe latter issue, but the O&M
contract will needto address both issues. As 0.N.E.owns the plant, it i s assumed that they will
control the dispatch of the gas-fired portion o f the plant. Finally, the use o f only pre-qualified
biddersis likely to allow the selected EPC contractor andkey suppliers to capture technology
and organizational learning effects that are essential to achieving long-term cost reductions for
solar thermal power.

One question that this reviewer could not assess from the PAD is whether the bidder
prequalification includes the potential manufacturers o f the solar collectors and heat collection
elements.
3.2      Scientific and Technical Soundness

Nine solar thermal power plantsthat raise steam to generate power have been successfully
operating for over 15 years. The basic concept o f integrating a solar thermal steam raising
facility with a natural gas combined cycle power plant i s sound and has been extensivelystudied.
While such a project has yet to be implemented, a project employing this concept should be
completely feasible, as the technical basis for such an integrated system i s quite straightfonvard
andbothaspects o fthe plant are technically proven. The reviewer concurs with the decisionnot
to include thermal storage within the plant configuration.

                                                                                             Annex 17

The technical andeconomic effectiveness o fthe ISCC power plant will depend on the detailed
design and selection o f equipment,which will be made at a later stage o fproject development.
Therefore, this review will only list the most important technical issues that will needcritical
analysis when the detailed design i s available.

As the technology selection will be left to the EPC Bidders,who will all be pre-qualified, the bid
documents must establish minimumrequirements for the solar thermal steam raising component
to ensure that the minimumsolar share target can be met. Effective integration o f the steam
systems for the solar thermal field and the gas-fired combined cycle plant i s essential to
achieving significant cost reductions and proper performance o f the power plant. The selection
process should review plant designs to ensure that the plant operates effectively inall modes. In
particular, integration and control o fthe system should allow the solar contribution to be
consistently maximized. Inaddition, the system should allow power to be efficiently generated
on natural gas only, ifrequired (duringnighttime or ifthe solar field i s not operational).
3.3      Adequacy of the FinancingMechanism

The financing approach to this Project is muchsimpler than the IPP approaches that havebeen
attempted on other GEF solar thermal power projects. Inparticular, this financing approach
avoids the complicated negotiation for power purchase, he1supply and implementation
agreements that can be problematic for IPP projects.
O.N.E.'s funds appear to be available, the AfDB loan i s reported as secured, and with approval
o f the GEF grant, all Project funds will be inhand. Inaddition to the EPC/O&M contract, the
Project includes funds to enable transmission o fthe power to load centers, provision o fnatural
gas from the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, and supply o f water for cooling and collector field
washing.


3.4      Identificationof GlobalEnvironmentalBenefits

The project's principal global environment objectives are to contribute to improving the
economic attractiveness o f non-carbon emitting solar thermal generation technology globally and
to demonstrate the operational viability o fthis hybridsolar thermal power generation system ina
developing country. The Project will contribute to the global learning effects that will lead to a
reduction incosts for solar thermal technology over the long term. Inaddition, this Project
could be the first solar thermal power plant constructed ina developing country, and will be
critical to demonstratingthat the technology capacity can be developedto manage these type
plants.

With the new solar thermal power plants beingconstructed inthe U S andEurope, andthe other
GEF solar thermalpower projects movingtowards implementation, the technology has the
potential to provide a significant proportion o fnew electricity generating capacity inthe next
century on a non-carbon emitting basis. Major markets exist for this technology inother high
sunlight regions o fthe world, many o fwhich are indeveloping nations.

This project will build an ISCC power plant designed to minimize the cost o fbuyingdown the
solar technology. As a result, the global benefit from reducing carbon emissions fi-om power

generation, estimated at 570,000 tons o f COz over the 25-year lifetime o f the plant, are relatively
small. They represent only 3.5% reduction o fthe conventional gas combined cycle power plant
emissions. As solar thermal costs decrease the solar fraction o f future plants will increase, and
so will the global environmental benefits from reducing carbon emissions.
3.5      Fit with GEF Goals

The project has a good fit with the GEF Operational Program #7. The plant itself will have
lower CO;! emissions than a combined cycle power plant o f the same annual output. More
importantly, it will help revitalize the solar thermal industry, and it will facilitate the
technological and organizational learning that are critical to achieving long-term cost reductions.
3.6      Regional Context

The project i s a good fit to Morocco's growing electricity demand, its existing commitment to
private sector development o fnew power projects, its excellent solar resource and its current
availability o f natural gas. The project also meets Morocco's commitment to develop renewable
sources o f energy.
3.7      Replicability

This project and its companions inMexico, India and Egypt are not likely to result inimmediate
cost-competitiveness for solar thermal power plants. However, they are very important steps in
that direction. A comprehensive study by Sargent and LundJ6, which assessedthe viability o f
long term cost reductions for solar thermal technology, concluded that with cumulative
installations o f about 1000 MWe, the cost for the technology can be reduced from today's cost of
10 - 11 cents per kWhto a range o f 5 - 6 cents per kWh. This report confirms the
commissioned incollaborationwith the GEF Secretariat, which concluded that a phased
approach should be adopted to support longterm cost reductions for solar thermal technology.

These four projects represent the first o f three phases, and they will provide an initial opportunity
for cost reduction. Achieving the cost reductions identified inthe Sargent and Lundyreport
would create very important opportunities for replication o f solar thermal power plants, not only
inMorocco, but also throughout theMediterraneanRegion, SouthAsia, andother partsofthe
world with similar climates. The need for future GEF buydown will most strongly depend on
the cost o f conventional power, the future benefits that canbe achieved through C D M and the
valuation (ifany) o f environmental externalities.
3.8      Sustainability

From the GEF perspective, the main sustainability issue will be to ensure that the plant i s
operated ina manner that maximizes output from its solar thermal field throughout the lifetime
o f the plant. As already discussed inSection 3.1, the O&M contract should contain appropriate
incentive structure for bothmaximizing the total plant reliability as well as maximizing the
utilization o f the solar field over the long term. However, as the owner, O.N.E. will be directly

6.       SUBSTANTIVE EDITORIAL        COMMENTS

Minor editorial comments are provided ina marked-upversion o f the PAD. However, a few
items were significant enough to warrant discussion, and are summarized below.

6.1      GHGCalculation

Ifthe annualproductionfromthe solar field is 35 GWh, andthe C02 emissions from anatural
gas combined cycle power plant are 0.65 kgper kWh, then 23,000 tons per year o f CO2 emission
reductions i s correct, as givenon page 24. Then, the 25 year emission reduction total shouldbe
575,000 tons o f C02 (as statedon page 51), not 200,000 tons of C02 as stated onpage 5.
6.2     Annual Solar Output

The reviewer can't determine ifthe expected annual solar output, based on the feasibility study,
i s 35,38 or 56 GWyr. Page 5, and Table 2 on page 51 use 56 GWh/yr, but page 24 used 35
GWyr, and page 51 at the top uses 38 GWh/yr. Correctingthis output value will also impact
the C02 calculation.

6.3      Solar ThermalPower PlantCosts

The second data row o fthe table onpage 24 gives what appear to be costs for the solar thermal
portion of the ISCC power plant. There i s no basis for these numbers. Ifthe method of
calculation i s the annualized capital investment inthe solar field plus the solar field O&M costs
dividedby the equivalent solar output, thenthe initial operating year value appears too high, and
the reduction inthis value for the second and third years appears too great. Some explanation i s
needed.

      MOROCCO: INTEGRATED SOLAR COMBINED CYCLE POWER PROJECT


The aim o f any electricity producing technology must be to realize competitive electricity
generation costs. Several studies have examined the future cost reduction potentials for solar
thermal power generation technology. The most important studies inthis context are Enennodal
(1999), and DLR (2004) which arebriefly reviewedbelow:

Enermodal (1999): CostReduction Studyfor Solar ThermalPower Plants
The Enermodal study uses the specific investment costs per installed capacity ($/kW) as a
reference measure. This reference number does not however seem appropriate to forecast cost
reduction for solar thermal power plants because larger solar fields in combination with heat
storage can lead to lower levelized electricity costs due to a higher plant capacity factor, even
though the specific investment costs increase. The second point o f note in the approach usedby
the Enermodal study is the fact that it uses the cost o f the first plant out o f the nine existing
parabolic trough plants as the starting point o f the learning curve instead o f using a linear
regression function o f all reference plants (see Figure 1). Therefore the cost o f the first plant
determines strongly the cost forecast for future technology deployment.

This study assumes as a starting point the empirical values from the existing parabolic trough
plants. But for the future cost reductions, it i s explicitly mentioned that all solar thermal power
technologies are included.Technological variants and improvements as well as competition are
essential preconditions o f the experience curve model.
Cost reduction inthis study i s split into four categories:
    >    Improving efficiency (from 13.2 percent today to 17.0 percent in2025)
    P Learningeffects dueto volume production
             o collector costs, surface-specific progress ration (PR) is 0.9
             o thermal energy storage (up to 12hrs), capacity-specific PR=0.88
             o steam cycle components from 850/kW down to today's conventional plant costs
                 o f 740 /kW, PR=0.94
   >    Economies o f scale due to larger units (up to 200 MW,): doubling capacity leads to
        15 percent cost reduction
   P The annual operation and maintenance costs will decrease proportionally to the reduction
        of investment costs (2.5 percent o f investment).

Furtherassumptions o fthis model are:
   >    N o CO2-allowances considered, respectively carbonprice increasing from initially 7.5
        Eurolt C02 to 30 Euro/t C02 in2050
   >    Plant life time: 25 years
   >    Internalplant project interest rate: 8 percent (inreal terms)
   >    Solar Resource DNI=2350 kWh/(m2a)(favorable sites for solar thermal power generation
        range between 1800 and 2900 kWh/(m2a).
   >    Market growth of 23 percent p.a. (IEA references: wind (1971-2000) 52 percent p.a., PV
        32 percent), (implementation of 5000 MW till 2015 corresponds to GMIgoal).

According to the Athene study, the cost competitiveness o f solar thermal power generation will
be reached in2025. The total necessary subsidiesaccount to 12billion, which corresponds to a
total installed capacity o f 42 GW,, not taking into account COz trading. Ifthe above-mentioned
carbon prices are included, cost competitiveness will be reached in2023. The total necessary
investmentwill thereby be significantly reduced to 2.5 billion, respectively 22 GWe.

The implicit assumption is that the numberof full-load hours is constantly increased due to
largerthermal energy storages up to 6500 hrs/a (12 hrs thermal storage). However, insome cases
it maybe more economical to aim at producing only peakingto mid-load-power for the period
when power tariffs on the electricity market are highest(smaller energy storage), which inturn
couldjustify lower thermal storage.

The Athene model is a very thorough assessment usingmanyvalidation points from experienced
facts and developments. The assumptions usedare generally conservative. Inthis context, the
Athene scenario maybe considered as a very conservative scenario for solar thermalpower cost
and market development.

Cost Reduction-Summary

All studiesreferenced assumed a conservative global solar thermal power market development.
It has also to be stated that many o fthe countries inthe world's sunbelts lack the financial
resources to finance solar energy. With present global solar thermal power marketmovements
re-emerging,there is no fundamentalreasonwhy technology growth similar to wind energyis
not feasible.

The main messagesfrom the comparison of costprojection studies are:
        >   The technology has the potential to be cost-competitive within 10to 25 years, and has
            thepotential to be a significant electricalpower option for developing countries, which
            often have abundant solar resources. With hybridization and thermal energy storage,
            solar thermal power is dispatchable power that helpsto support grid stability.
        >   Should GEF promote solar thermal investments now in developing countries and not
            once the technology has moved further down the learningcurve?
            The GEFprojects will contribute to OP7's goal o f "reducing the long-term costs o f
            low greenhouse gas-emitting energy technologies" ifat least two or three are
            successfully deployed and operated. However, the projects inthe current portfolio will
           not have a significant cost-reduction impact on the underlyingcost o f the technology.
           It is difficult to quantify the cost reductioneffect o f the four projects: Inthe beginning
           o fthe portfolio's history, it seemedthat it would be one o f the GEF plants that would
           be the first to be built after the California SEGS plants. However today, with other
           commercial solar thermal power activities evolving, other projects may perhaps come
           infirst. Thereforethe questionis, whichpart ofthe cost reduction curvewillthe GEF
           projects influence? Intheory, the cost reduction effect will be largest for the first
           plants built. Inpractice, much o f the early cost reduction will result from a reduction
           o f the risk premiumas design, construction, and O&M experience i s gained. The
           developing countries inparticular experience an additional premium due to the
           perceived added difficulties o f carrying out large projects usingnew technology. This
           i s another cost reduction area that the GEF projects can impact in a positive manner.

Affordable technology and climate protection are goals officially supported by many developing
countries with good solar resources. Inorder to meet these goals, GEF should support the
implementation o f climate-protecting renewable energy indeveloping countries. Whereas the
OECD countries can afford subsidizing power technologies on a large scale, developing
countries usually are not able to do so. By supporting the implementation o f the first solar
thermal power pilot plants, GEF will help create technology trust and institutional learning and
therebyreduce the hurdle for subsequent market entry. The solar fields o f solar thermal power
plants contain many components that can be locally manufactured, such as concrete foundations
or standardsteel components or, dependingon the solar technology andthe project, country,
mirrors.
