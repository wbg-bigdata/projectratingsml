PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: SECOND SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1451-CO)
PREFACE
This report covers developments and achievements under
Loan 1451-CO to the Banco de la Republica (BR) for onlending to the
Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP). The loan, in an amount of
US$15 million, was intended to assist CFP's onlending and technical
assistance operations with the small-scale industrial sector. It was
appraised in October/November 1976, approved by the Board of Executive
Directors in June 1977, declared effective in February 1978 and
closed, with disbursements at 99%, in September 1981, nine months
after the original closing date.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Latin
America and the Caribbean Regional Office. The report reviews the
Loan's direct and sectoral objectives, discussing in particular CFP's
resource base, systems and procedures, financial structure and
changes in its technical assistance program. It also analyzes the
relevance of CFP's experience gained under the project of improving
the provision of its financial and technical assistance services to
SSIs. Although the provision of an integrated technical assistance
program and CFP's role in the program were given somewhat lower
priority in designing this project than financial and institutional
aspects, this report considers such assistance essential for CFP's
financial program to have a lasting effect on SSI's development.
Accordingly, this aspect is given prominence in the report, including
some new developments in technical assistance and training programs
in Colombia. Comments from the Borrower are shown in Annex 18.
This project has not been audited by the Operation Evalu-
ation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: SECOND SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1451-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
Reflecting its concern with two principal constraints which had
been identified as impeding SSI development in Colombia--insufficient
access to term credit and technical assistance--and based on the experience
under the first SSI Loan 1071-CO, the Bank made a second loan for SSIs to
the Banco de la Republica for onlending to the Corporacion Financiera
Popular (CFP) totalling US$15 million in 1977. This report covers the
1977-81 period, during which Loan 1451-CO was committed and disbursed and
focusses on activities that pertain mainly to the Loan.
In making its second loan to CFP, which was designed to build on
the achievements of Loan 1071-CO, the Bank had five basic objectives: (i)
to provide term funds on reasonable conditions for establishment, expansion
or relocation of privately-owned small industrial firms and coperatives;
(ii) to assist CFP in building up a diversified and sound resource base;
(iii) to help CFP build up further its technical capability and operational
effectiveness; (iv) to support, through CFP's onlending, the government's
industrial decentralization and regional policies; and (v) promote
government policies more responsive to SSIs' financial and technical needs.
Bank funds were provided for 696 subprojects with an estimated
employment generation of some 3,300 jobs which was in line with
expectations. About 75% of the lending went to smaller firms exceeding the
50% minimum target (para. 3.07). The average investment cost per job
(US$13,500 equivalent) too, met the appraisal expectations; moreover, data
on cost per job created were found to be highly correlated with the size of
the firm (para. 3.13). While geographical dispersion of Bank assisted
enterprises was more favorable than originally expected, relatively few new
enterprises were created with Bank proceeds and a still smaller number of
assisted SSIs was geared towards external markets (para. 3.10, 3.11).
In early 1978, CFP decided to discontinue much of its direct
technical assistance activities. Since then it has reoriented its
activities towards helping SSIs to diagnose their technical assistance
needs and referring them to appropriate specialized agencies, including
SENA. CFP itself has focussed on supplying technial information and making
loans to finance technical Consultants. In addition, CFP has sought to
coordinate and better focus the technical assistance activities of the
specialized agencies. This new approach represents a positive step,



- iv -
although SSIs' reluctance to accept and pay for the full cost of technical
assistance is likely to remain a constraint (para. 4.21-4.24).
During the life of the Loan CFP's organization was streamlined
considerably. The most important aspects of its institutional development
have been the strengthening of CFP's regional offices and substantial
changes in its operating policies and procedures (paras. 4.02-4.07).
Nevertheless, CFP's administrative costs have remained relatively high and
target ratios of administrative costs to total assets were not achieved.
Because of the strong monetary control measures adopted by the
Colombian Authorities in the late 1970s, the Bank's discussions with the
Government have focussed above all on CFP's resource position tending to
preempt a broader review of SSI policies. Also, the lack of success in
Bank's policy dialogue stemmed in part from a failure to define
specifically enough which are the policies of particular relevance for SSI
sector development and what policy changes might be conducive to promotion
of SSI (paras. 5.02, 5.03).
Other points of interest are:
- An improvement in the maturity offered by CFP on its credits
for fixed assets financing (para. 4.14);
- Introduction of full time supervision of CFP's clients
conducted by the regional offices (para. 4.05);
- CFP's resource mobilization, while adequate in quantitative
terms, was not fully satisfactory as CFP continued to depend
heavily on official sources (paras. 4.08-4.11).
- Substantial reduction of CFP's portfolio affected by arrears
(para. 4.20);and
- CFP's involvement in the new micro-enterprises program (para.
4.26).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: SECOND SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 1451-CO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Corporacion Financiera Popular (CFP) was founded in 1967 by Banco
Popular, a government-owned commercial bank, partly in response to a study
by the Stanford Research Institute on the prospects and needs of Colombian
small scale industry.1/ CFP's main institutional objective, as broadly
defined in its statutes, is to assist in the promotion and development of
small- and medium-scale industrial, agroindustrial and mining enterprises
(SSIs) by providing medium- and long-term financing. Since commercial
banks and private financieras focus mainly on medium and large firms, CFP's
role is to develop and help put into effect a broad range of services
tailored to the characteristics and needs of SSIs.
1.02      The Bank has made three loans for CFP. Loan 1071-CO, approved in
January 1975, for US$5.5 million equivalent was the Bank's first SSI
operation in Latin America; the second, Loan 1451-CO, for US$15.0 million
was approved in June 1977; and the third, Loan 1834-CO for US$32.0 million
was approved in April 1980. Bank lending to support the Colombian
industrial sector has been well diversified, encompassing eight more loans
totalling US$492.0 million to finance industry through private development
finance companies; an agroindustrial loan component of US$19.0 million
mainly for medium-sized and small enterprises; a loan of US$15.0 million
for an export processing zone in Cartagena; and a loan component of US$2.0
million for very small enterprises in target areas of the Intermediate
Cities Urban Project.
1.03      Preparation of Loan 1451-CO began in early 1976.   Appraisal took
place in October/November 1976 and February 1977. The Loan was signed in
September 1977 and became effective five months later. This report covers
the period 1977-1981, during which the Loan was committed and disbursed.
It focusses on activities that pertain mainly to Loan 1451-CO.
II. OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE BANK
2.01      The second loan to CFP was designed to build on the achievements
of Loan 1071-CO, and to complement Bank lending to the private DFCs for
larger industrial subprojects, with the following objectives:
(i) alleviate SSI's inadequate access to credit by
providing funds on reasonable conditions for the
establishment, expansion or relocation of privately-
owned small industrial firms and cooperatives;
1/   There is not a generally accepted definition of SSI in Colombia.    For
the purpose of Loan 1451-CO SSIs are defined as manufacturing
enterprises with total assets below US$650,000 equivalent.



-2-
(ii) assist CFP in building up a diversified and sound
resource base for its operations through 1980;
(iii) build up further CFP's technical capability and
operational effectiveness for efficiently allocating
scarce development funds and for coordinating technical
assistance to SSI;
(iv)  support, through CFP's onlending, the government's
industrial decentralization and regional development
policies; and
(v)  promote government policies more responsive to SSI's
financial and technical needs.
2.02      The Bank Loan of US$15.0 million was made to Banco de la
Republica (BR), Colombia's Central Bank, which onlent the proceeds to CFP
in local currency. The Loan had two components: US$14.9 million for CFP to
make subloans to SSIs, and US$0.1 million for technical assistance to CFP
and its clients, an amount which was later increased to US$0.2 million.
Under the lending component, to help ensure financing on reasonable terms,
all subloans were subject to a minimum four-year maturity and one year
grace period. The onlending interest rate for subborrowers was initially
24%, with CFP's spread of 5.5% per subloan to enterprises located in
Bogota, Medellin and Cali, and 7% elsewhere. Technical assistance subloans
carried an interest rate of 15% p.a., and CFP's spread was 3%. Maturity
and approval conditions were similar to those applied under the lending
component. All subloans were in Colombian pesos, with BR bearing the
foreign exchange risk.
2.03      The economic and social benefits to be brought about by the
project were expected to be substantial. An estimated 600-750 small
entrepreneurs were expected to benefit from Bank funds, with an expected
40% of subloans going to enterprises located outside Colombia's three major
cities. Bank financing was expected to help foster 3,000-4,000 direct job
opportunities with another 1,000-1,500 created indirectly through forward
and backward linkages. A wide variety of industries were to benefit from
the project, with no single industrial subsector likely to receive more
than 20% of the subloans. It was also expected that about 10-15% would
involve export-oriented operations and an equal number the establishment of
new enterprises. Since the revenues generated by the project were
estimated to accrue mostly to unskilled workers, small owners-operators and
the government, its income distribution impact was expected to be good.
2.04      The project was expected also to help CFP's development as a
specialized SSI institution by assisting CFP to strengthening its
resources, setting up an internal information system and SSI data bank, and
laying the basis for organizing its regional offices as cost centers.
Specifically, the government was expected to take steps through 1980 to
provide CFP with an adequate resource base including (i) annual
contributions to CFP's capital stock to help compensate for the erosion of
CFP's paid-in capital through inflation, for a total of Col$225



-3-
million; (ii) opening of new local sources of borrowings to CFP of Col$50
million annually through 1980 to cover a local currency gap of Col$250
million; and (iii) reviewing with BR the Fondo Financiero Industrial's
(FFI)2/ financial situation and the issuing of appropriate resolutions to
improve, by year-end 1977, FFI's resource base and rediscounting
characteristics to permit broader SSI access to its financing and provide
financial intermediaries with a better incentive structure to assist SSI in
the less developed regions of the country. Also, CFP expected to play a
major role in coordinating the activities of the National Vocational
Training Organization (SENA), the Foundation for the Development of
Scientific and Technological Research (FICITEC) and other institutions in
providing technical assistance to SSEs.
2.05      As part of Loan preparation, the Bank identified some areas where
improvements were needed to strengthen the overall impact of national SSI
policies and programs. In this regard, in addition to the institutional
development of CFP, and the coordination of technical assistance for SSIs,
the Loan was expected to have a sectoral impact by institutionalizing
within the government responsibility for: (i) gauging the impact of past
and new government policies and programs on SSIs; (ii) ensuring a
sufficient and timely flow of resources to SSIs; and (iii) establishing a
coordinated policy framework to promote SSIs.
2.06      Most of the project's objectives were met in a satisfactory
degree. The project represented a major source of SSI term financing,
supporting relatively small subprojects and achieving a satisfactory
geographical and subsectoral distribution. It also had an important impact
on SSI employment, output and productivity with most of the assisted
subprojects experiencing satisfactory rates of return. During the
project's implementation, CFP's technical capabilities in allocating
financial resources and coordinating technical assistance to SSI were
further strengthened as well as the role of its regional offices. CFP
succeeded in achieving a satisfactory operational growth, maintaining a
sound quality of its portolio and mobilizing financial resources.
Diversification uf its resource base that would allow CFP a more stable
growth, however, has not been fully achieved. The project has been less
successful in promoting a government coordinated policy framework more
responsive to SSI's development needs.
III. UTILIZATION OF LOAN PROCEEDS
Economic Environment
3.01      During the second half of 1978, when the first disbursememts
under the loan were made, the industrial sector began to lose the dynamism
it had experienced in the 1976-78 period. Industrial production during
that time (1976-1978) grew at an average annual rate of 6.6% mainly because
of a strong domestic demand resulting from the boom in coffee prices that
2/   FFI rediscounts loans made by financial intermediaries to SSIs for
fixed assets and working capital.



-4 -
began in late 1975. As a result, capacity utilization in manufacturing
reached 86% in 1978 and factory employment was up 1.8% over the 1977
level. Manufacturing exports, however, stagnated during that time, and in
1978 they represented only 6.9% of total gross value of industrial output
as compared to 10.7% in 1974.
3.02      Given the priority of the stabilization effort to control
inflation through restrictive credit policies, the industrial sector was
not able to take full advantage of the flow of financial resources to
Colombia during 1976-78, to further increase its rates of real growth and
capital accumulation. During the period industrial investment remained
relatively low. By mid-1979, the economic conditions changed, the economy
began slowing down, inflationary pressures resumed after a year's respite
and the balance of payments outlook began to deteriorate. Industrial output
growth rate in 1979 (4.5%) barely surpassed half of that achieved in the
previous year (8.6%). Manufactured exports showed a modest growth in 1979,
but because of the real appreciation of the exchange rate they started to
decline and experienced a substantial drop in real terms in 1980 (Annex
1). High interest rates, which in the 1979-80 period reached 15% or more in
real terms further affected industrial sector investment. Factory
employment in the manufacturing sector declined by 1% in 1980 and the
output growth was only 2.6%.
3.03      Although increased investment efforts by the public and private
sectors provided a stimulus for improved growth performance in 1981, the
industrial sector still faced a series of constraints. Low export
competitiveness, persistence of slow growth in domestic and international
demand and frequent power shortages during the early part of 1981 were the
principal factors leading to a negative growth rate of -1.2% in industrial
production in 1981.3/
3.04       Detailed data are not available to determine the impact of the
changes in the overall world and national economic conditions on the SSI
sector. Based on recent surveys, some observations can nevertheless be
made.4/ During 1978-80, SSI's output grew about 6.6% p.a. in real terms
as compared to 5.2% for the manufacturing as a whole. Like the total
industrial sector, SSI's growth rates have been declining since 1978 (see
Annex 2). The average capacity utilization of the SSIs in the sauple was
67%. Rubber products, metal mechanical and garment industries show the most
vigorous growth whereas firms producing paper had no increase in
production, and production of footwear declined during 1978-80. In 1980,
four SSI subsectors had negative growth rates (textiles, leather, paper and
chemicals). SSIs on the average exported less than 2.5% of their output in
3/   Preliminary estimate.
4/   A recent survey carried out by the Bank and annual surveys carried out
by CFP during 1978-81 (Encuesta Industrial--Situacion y Perspectivas
de la Pequena y Mediana Industria en Colombia). The CFP's surveys
were on some 700 enterprises, which are the larger SSIs with access to
banking sector's financing.

spite of an exports growth of 13% p.a. in real terms from 1978-80. Total
sales showed a real growth similar to that of SSI production in 1978-80
period (6.7% p.a.), but during the last two years because of declining
domestic demand they grew considerably less than the output. In SSIs' view,
the main problems concerning the production process were high cost of raw
materials, difficulties to obtain working capital financing and the absence
of government support to stimulate SSI. Because of difficulties to obtain
external resources, 52% of the total financing came from small
industrialists' own resources in 1980, commercial banks provided 15.6% and
CFP 12.5%. Almost 71% of the financing in 1980 went for working capital and
over 25% for machinery and construction.
Commitments and Disbursements
3.05      After some initial start-up delay the pace of commitment of Loan
1451-CO became faster than foreseen at appraisal due to the strong demand
for subloans. During 1979, however, demand slackened somewhat and the
terminal date to submit to the Bank subloans had to be extended by six
months (until June 30, 1980). Investment and technical assistance
subprojects submitted by CFP by June 30, 1980 appeared sufficient to fully
commit the loan. Nevertheless, due principally to exchange rate
fluctuations between the Colombian peso and the US dollar during the loan
commitment period, it became obvious by early 1981 that about 6.7% of the
proceeds of the loan (US$1.0 million equivalent) would not be required by
the subprojects submitted theretofore. The Bank accepted the CFP's
proposal that the uncommitted proceeds be made available to finance a group
of 55 investment and technical assistance subprojects, all of which had
been submitted to the Bank prior to June 30, 1980. Throughout the
commitment period, Bank funds represented an important source of CFP's
financing, accounting on average for some 23% of total CFP commitments
between mid-1978 and mid-1981.
3.06       Disbursements under the loan started some five months after
loan effectiveness. As of December 31, 1980, the original closing date for
the loan, aggregate disbursements amounted to US$13.5 million, equivalent
to 90% of the loan (Annex 3). Due mainly to the initial commitment delays,
cancellations during the commitment period, and exchange rate fluctuations,
the closing date for disbursements was extended to September 30, 1981.
Overall, given the growing number of small entrepreneurs which experienced
delays in meeting the legal and other conditions of subloan effectiveness,
both the commitment and disbursement experience of the loan was quite good.
Characteristics of Lending
3.07       Since term-lending for SSI was in short supply in Colombia during
1978-81, CFP had no difficulties in identifying a large number of projects
that were eligible for financing. Bank subloans provided term financing
for 696 subprojects that were expected to create 3,280 direct jobs
in line with the original target ranges of 600-750 subprojects and
3,000-4,000 direct new jobs. About 75% of the lending was to firms with



-6 -
total assets below US$300,0005/ equivalent which compares favorably with a
50% minimum target. Only 12 subloans were above the US$100,000 "free
limit" for Bank review, accounting for some 11% of total commitment under
the loan. Annex 4 gives a detailed breakdown of subloan approvals.
3.08      Characteristics of ultimate beneficiaries matched up closely with
the initial expectations.   About 70% of the assisted enterprises have less
than five owners/shareholders, while about half of the assisted concerns
have total assets below Col$5 million (about US$116,000 equivalent), and
employed less than 20 people (three-quarters of the firms fall in the below
50 employee category). Out of the 665 enterprises that benefited from Bank
funds 70 were newly established with the help of the loan and about 35% had
been in existence for less than five years. CFP's clientele included a
broad spectrum of industrial subsectors, and no single subsector received
more than 20% of subloans. The firms that obtained the largest number of
subloans are in the food and beverage (17.8%), paper and printing (13.7%),
wood and furniture (10.6%), non-metallic minerals (8.9%) and apparel and
footwear subsectors (8.9%).
3.09      The average size of subloans under the lending component was
Col$1.0 million (about US$23,950 equivalent) which falls within the
US$20,000-25,000 range estimated at the time of appraisal. About 60% of
the subloan amounts were below Col$2 million (US$46,400 equivalent). Some
14% of the subloans had maturities of less than 4 years, about 70% were
between 4 and 6 years, and 16% had maturities above 6 years. The
relatively low average maturity is partly a result of weaknesses in CFP's
cash flow and repayment capacity analysis. In response to Bank
recommendation during project supervision, CFP introduced a detailed flow
of funds analysis for all subloans exceeding Col$0.5 million. This
gradually improved the adequacy of the maturities and grace periods granted
during the loan commitment period.
3.10      As can be seen in Annex 4, more than 86% of the subprojects
involved capacity expansion, 10% provided "start-up" costs for new
enterprises, and 4% were for technical assistance. As expected, purchase
of machinery and equipment was the main category financed under the loan,
amounting to 62% of the total. Industrial construction expenditures
accounted for a high 37% of the total financing under the loan.6/ About
US$0.2 million were used for technical assistance to finance 26 technical
assistance subprojects, accounting for 1.2% of total loan amount. Over 50%
of the technical assistance subprojects were for accounting and
administrative assistance, 25% for assistance related to production
5/   Smaller SSI as defined in Loan 1451-CO.
6/   Under Loan 1834-CO CFP started a new policy for industrial
construction financing. Up to 90% of construction costs for
productive purposes, and no more than 20% of total construction costs
for office construction can be financed with CFP funds. For
subprojects to be established in the Rio Negro industrial park, the
maximum financing is 70% of the subproject cost.

processes and the balance for technical assistance regarding marketing,
financial management and organization. Geographical dispersion of Bank
assisted enterprises was more favorable than originally expected.7/ Some
63% of the subloans accounting for 49% of the total loan amount went to the
firms located outside of the most industrialized departments of
Cundinamarca, Antioquia and Valle. This positive shift in geographical
distribution of CFP's lending is in part a result of CFP's efforts to
strengthen the role of its regional offices.
3.11      The bulk (93%) of the expected production of the subprojects was
geared towards local markets. Only 2.5% of the production was oriented
solely towards exports and 4.5% towards both exports and domestic markets.
Lower than expected export orientation8/ of Colombian SSIs can be
attributed to the strong domestic demand for SSI subsector products as well
as to the lack of knowledge of foreign markets, the difficulties in
obtaining adequate working capital financing,and the appreciating real
value of the Colombian peso during the loan commitment period which lowered
the export competitiveness of enterprises.
3.12      The average total cost per subproject amounted to about Col$2.7
million (US$63,500 equivalent) as compared to the SAR estimate of
Col$2-2.75 million (US$55-70,000 equivalent). The total project cost
reached US$44.2 million i.e., 5% higher than expected. The Bank's
participation in total project cost reached 34% (Table 1) compared to an
original forecast of 36%. Reflecting domestic currency resources
constraints experienced during the project period, CFP credits contributed
only 40% of total cost of the project, compared to 60% expected;
subborrowers contributed 38% (24% forecast) and other local sources,
including extra-bank market and suppliers' credit, provided 11% (7%
estimated at the time of appraisal). Overall, institutional credit
financed 50% of subproject costs, compared to 76% projected at appraisal.
7/   About 40% of the subloans were supposed to go to enterprises located
outside of Colombia's three major industrial centers.
8/   The SAR contemplated that some 10-15% of the subprojects would be
export-oriented.

Impact of Subprojects9/
3.13      Employment Generation and Investment Cost per Job.    The 696
subprojects assisted under the loan are expected to generate some 3,300
direct job opportunities at an average investment cost per job of US$13,500
and an average expected 4.7 new jobs per subproject. A significant
increase in the investment cost per job can be observed with the increasing
size of firms and substantial differences are evident between subsectors
(Annex 7). While employment in the small subborrowers (i.e., with total
assets below US$300,000 equivalent) grew by 26% during the loan commitment
period, it fell 2.2% in the larger firms (with total assets between
US$300,000 and US$650,000). The poor employment generation and the
consequent high investment cost per job in the larger subborrowers can be
attributed to modernization of production in some subsectors such as
chemicals and non-metallic minerals. In other subsectors, such as food
processing, leather goods and metallic products, employment grew between
24-70% and the average investment cost per job of US$8,600 was well below
the amount projected at the time of appraisal and comparable to that
attained in the First Small Scale Industry Project.10/
9/   In order to asses the economic impact of the subprojects financed
under the loan, two surveys were recently conducted. CFP's survey
(Survey I) was conducted on 183 subprojects whereas the survey carried
out by a Bank consultant (Survey II) included 31 subprojects. The two
surveys jointly accounted for about one-third of the total project.
Their main characteristics are shown in Annexes 5 and 6.

3.14      Sales Growth and Increase in Productivity.   The average
subborrower's annual sales during the subproject implementation period grew
by 24% in real terms. Wide fluctuations, however, can be observed across
different subsectors. While e.g., the leather goods subsector succeeded in
doubling its sales in real terms and non-metallic products and food
processing subsectors also experienced strong sales increases during the
period, poor sales performance in real terms is evident for the metallic
products subsector, apparel and textile subsectors and chemicals (Annex,
8).11/ Slow growth or stagnation in sales in some of the subsectors was
probably the consequence of an overall slackness in the demand for products
in those subsectors, increased competition in some subsectors as SSIs
expanded and new ones entered production, as well as that some subprojects
are not yet fully operational.
3.i5      Subprojects' gross incremental capital/output ratio (ICOR)12/
was satisfatory on average (1.27).    Labor productivity as sales per worker
on an average subborrower increased by approximately 9%, with the
productivity growth considerably higher for larger category subborrowers
than for smaller firms. Some of the larger SSIs succeeded in increasing
their labor productivity by reducing their work force (para. 3.13) and
expanding production by modernizing their plant and equipment. Capital
productivity on the other hand, experienced a 16% decrease (20% for large
subborrowers and 8% for smaller) implying that the rate of capacity
utilization may have decreased over the period covered.13/ The
entrepreneurs probably built capacity ahead of demand, or the expected
growth in demand was not fully realized within the period covered by the
surveys. Only in three out of eleven subsectors was growth in capital
productivity achieved (food processing, leather goods and non-metallic
products, the subsectors with best sales performance, highest employment
growth and lowest investment cost per job).
3.16      New Enterprises.   Given the level of development and maturity of
the SSIs in Colombia, CFP lending operations focus largely on established
clientele and not so much on fostering new enterprises. Also since CFP did
not make any special efforts in promoting creation of new enterprises, the
achieved results as regards the number of new firms assisted by CFP
financing and the total amount of funds channelled to those enterprises,
were relatively modest. Under the First Small-Scale Industry Project less
than 4% of the total of 305 subprojects were for new enterprises who
received a little over 5% of the CFP loan amount. The second loan assisted
70 new firms (i.e., over 10% of the total population) accounting for 7.5%
of the total loan amount. Based on an analysis of new enterprises financed
by the project, it can be concluded that an average new enterprise is
smaller in terms of sales and employment than the average subborrower,
11/ Sales of some 700 SSIs included in the CFP annual survey increased by
21% in real terms during 1978-80 (see Annex 2).

but it has higher labor productivity and a lower investment cost per job
(US$11,250) than an average subborrower. New enterprises on average
created more new jobs (9.6) than the existing ones (4.7).
IV. INSTITUTION BUILDING
Management, Staffing and Organization
4.01      CFP experienced managerial ups and downs during 1977-1981. It
experienced a period of relative management stability from 1975 to
mid-1977, with substantial progress in its institutional development.
However, the resignation of the general manager in August 1977 dealt a
temporary blow to CFP, especially since the 3 submanagers and 5 of the 14
regional managers also resigned. CFP suffered also from a high staff
turnover, partly as a result of unattractive salaries. CFP's general
manager changed again in September 1978, following the accession of a new
government. The new management altered the institution's emphasis toward
greater cost-consciousness and profitability, halted staff turnover and
improved morale.14/ It also emphasized productivity and monitored more
closely the efforts of the regional offices to increase lending while
containing costs.
4.02      CFP's organizational structure also experienced some changes
during the period under review. The institution has consolidated
responsibilities under 3 major areas rather than 5, focussing on financial
management and programming, lending operations, and general administration
including personnel management. This has permitted a better coordination
within the institution. In addition, CFP has maintained the 14 regional
offices which were established in 1975 to support the government's
industrial decentralization policy. CFP believes that this network of
regional offices is adequate to enable CFP to economically serve the
majority of actual and potential SSI clients. However, while CFP's overall
operating efficiency has continued to improve (Annex 9), too high a
proportion of staff is concentrated in CFP's headquarters (general
management, supporting services and operational control). Headquarters
accounted for about 45% of the total staff and operating costs during
1977-1981, when staff constraints in some regional offices were holding
back the growth of CFP's lending operations. CFP's management has agreed
with recent Bank supervision missions on the need to achieve a better
balance between headquarters and regional office staffing.
4.03      The regional offices' overall performance has varied among
offices due mainly to differences in the availability of experienced
14/ Because of differences in opinion with the Minister of Economic
Development, CFP's General Manager resigned in October 1981. A new
General Manager was appointed in December 1981.



-  I11  -
managers and staff. The Regional Advisory Boards (RAB)15/ have
contributed substantially to the quality of regional offices' work, mainly
in their role of reviewing and approving credit applications. This has
been accompanied by an increase in the regional offices' loan approval
authority and responsibility. While the quality and quantity of staff are
adequate at the larger branch offices, the small and medium sized branches
are less well favored. The general shortage of technically qualified
professionals in the regions, the unwillingness of such people to move to
or to work for a long period in the regions outside the metropolitan areas,
and the agreement between CFP and the staff union which provides that only
by agreement may any staff member be reallocated from one office to
another, seem to be the principal factors accounting for the prevailing
situation.
Systems and Procedures
4.04      Subproject appraisal and supervision systems, monitoring of
regional offices, internal auditing, and financial management improved
steadily during the period. They received substantial attention during
Bank supervision and from a UNDP technical assistance program to CFP.16/
While subproject appraisal quality varied during 1976-1978, due to staff
turnover, it has improved since 1978. The preparation of a credit manual
and some training of CFP analysts contributed to the improved quality of
appraisal work. During the whole period, the thrust of project appraisal
changed gradually from an excessive emphasis on the history of the
enterprise to the viability of the proposed subproject, but further
improvement, mainly regarding the market and repayment capacity analysis of
the subprojects and/or enterprises is needed. The average subproject
processing time was about four months.
4.05      CFP also gradually improved its subproject supervision system.
Initially, supervision was rather sporadic and ad-hoc, depending mainly on
management's concern about portfolio quality at the time. In the course of
the project (from mid-1978 onwards) CFP began to put more emphasis on
supervision, defining also its frequency and scope. Headquarters'
supervision was discontinued in early 1977 when the regional offices were
made responsible for subproject supervision. However, it was only in late
1978/early 1979 when regional offices started doing supervision
systematically. Supervision is now the responsibility of full time
"supervisors", but is still too influenced by the availability of personnel
rather than by the supervision needs or plans. Further strengthening of
regional offices is needed to help correct this situation.
15/ The RABs are normally composed by the local manager of Banco Popular,
two prominent DanKers or inaustrialists, tne representative of ACOPI
(the national SSI association) and the local manager of SENA.
16/ The UNDP-financed, UNIDO-executed technical assistance program
assisted CFP to strengthen its operational capabilities, providing
experts in cooperatives, marketing, subproject appraisal and
supervision, financial system, industrial parks and information
system.  The program was carried out between July 1978 and March 1981.



-  12  -
4.06      Since 1977, portfolio monitoring has become more effective.
Control of arrears is good, with each client in arrears monitored monthly,
but controls on implementation of policies and procedures for debt recovery
are still somewhat lax. The quality and scope of statistical information
on CFP operations has improved substantially. This is partly as a result
of reporting requirements the Bank asked for under the loan. However,
while ample information exists on subprojects' financial situation, status
and results, both ex-ante and from the supervision reports, it is not being
processed and used systematically for evaluating CFP's impact or for
providing some general patterns for subproject appraisal. In addition,
analytical feed back between headquarters and regional offices needs to be
further developed. The UNDP technical assistance program provided
assistance to CFP in strengthening and broadening its electronic data
processing, but the assistance was incomplete,17/ and the results
disappointing. CFP is currently using the UNDP expert's initial findings
to prepare a further study to computerize its information system.
4.07      During 1977-1981, CFP prepared annually three-year financial and
operational projections with brief revisions undertaken semi-annually,
which have proved to be reasonably accurate and beneficial. Based on these
projections, CFP has established annual lending targets for its regional
offices, increasing progressively their operational autonomy. CFP has
introduced monthly budget ceilings for each regional office, which are
closely monitored and are contributing to cost control. Internal auditing
procedures are adequate. These procedures and CFP's annual accounts have
been reviewed by Board-appointed auditors annually. After frequent
changes of the external auditors during its earlier years, because of lack
of clarity of the corresponding reports, the same auditing firm has been
used consecutively since 1976. The quality of audit reports has been good,
but there have been delays of about 2-3 months in their submission to the
Bank.
Resources
4.08      The project was designed, among other things, to assist CFP in
building up a diversified and sound resource base for its operations
through 1980. Apart from CFP's internally generated funds, CFP was
expected to mobilize Col$2.7 billion in local currency and Col$1.1 billion
equivalent in foreign exchange. To this end, Loan 1451-CO required the
government to take adequate steps to provide CFP with: (i) annual
contributions to CFP's capital stock to compensate for the erosion of its
paid-in-capital through inflation (Col$225.0 million); and (ii) opening of
new local sources of funds to CFP, other than FFI, Banco Popular and
the Export Promotion Fund (PROEXPO), of Col$50.0 million p.a.
4.09      CFP's overall mobilization of resources during 1977-1981 was
adequate to support the lending demand and exceeded the appraisal estimates
(see Annex 10). However, shortages of funds during different periods
17/ The UNDP expert resigned in 1980, without designing the system. No
other expert was hired to finish the work.



- 13 -
(para. 5.02),18/ hampered CFP's efforts towards stable growth. CFP relied
heavily and more than expected on three sources: FFI, PROEXPO and the
Bank. Mobilization of local resources by CFP as required under Loan
1451-CO, was met almost wholly by increases in CFP's equity. The capital
contribution of Col$244.0 million (of which Col$183.0 million were from
PROEXPO), made available to CFP by late 1978, was larger than the Col$225.0
million target established under the Loan. However, since Loan 1451-CO
became effective only in February 1978, delays in providing local financing
as required under the Loan, produced a serious resource shortage to CFP in
early 1978. Requirements of mobilization of local resources other than
capital under Loan 1451-CO were superseded by the requirements under Loan
1834-CO. These requirements are being met by the government.
4.10      During 1977-81 CFP has relied mainly on traditional domestic and
own resources to finance its lending program. However, while domestic
borrowings grew about 3 times during the period, their share as percentage
of CFP's total assets decreased from 49.4% in 1977 to 39.1% in 1981. The
most important domestic source continued to be FFI, representing about one
third and one half of total and of domestic borrowing respectively during
the period, but CFP's outstanding borrowing with FFI fell from 28.6% of
total borrowing in 1977 to 23.2% in 1981. CFP mobilization of FFI's
resources fluctuated during the period, due to mainly FFI's exhausted funds
from late-1977 to about March 1978. The remaining local resources were
mainly provided by PROEXPO, the government and CFP's own sources.
PROEXPO's resources which are mainly for short-term/export financing grew
more than expected, but they were maintained far below the upper limit
established under the Loan (2.0 times equity).
4.11      CFP's foreign resources grew by 2.5 times during 1977-81, and
represented about one-third of total borrowing. CFP's foreign outstanding
debt/total assets ratio grew substantially from about 20% to 37% during the
period, mainly because foreign resources are in the form of long term loans
from the Bank, the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). Bank loans have
provided about two thirds of foreign resources (about US$2.2 million under
Loan 1071-CO, US$15.0 million under Loan 1451-CO and US$10.0 million under
Loan 1834-CO) in 1977-81.
Interest Rates
4.12      CFP's onlending interest rate varied, depending on the source of
funds to be used for a particular subproject, and is more in line with
lending development purposes than with CFP's resource mobilization
18/ Shortages of FFI's funds in 1978-79, FFI delays in subloan
processing, and government delays in providing resources to CFP
required under Loan 1451-CO. Recognizing the adverse impact of
fluctuating resource availability, the Bank recommended under Loan
1834-CO to seek non-traditional permanent sources of local funds to
complement the funds obtained from PROEXPO and FFI.

efforts.19/ CFP has been mobilizing domestic financial resources mainly
from public sector institutions. Onlending interest rate under the Bank
Loans has been positive in real terms (26% and 29% effective rate p.a. for
Loan 1451-CO and 1834-CO, respectively, compared with a 24% average
inflation rate p.a. during 1977-81). However, the onlending rate with
other resources was slightly negative during the period (between 20% and
24% effective rate p.a.). -Overall, CFP's onlending rate has been a main
factor, coupled with tight credit situation in Colombia, to increase CFP's
lending to SSIs, but it has affected negatively its profitability (para.
4.17). The Bank has pointed out to the government and CFP the need to
review CFP's onlending rates, bearing in mind its profitability as well as
resource mobilization purposes.
Operations
4.13      CFP's lending operations grew considerably but not steadily
during the period 1977-81, although they exceeded the appraisal estimates
of Col$2.5 billion for 1981 (Annex 11). Commitments and disbursements
tripled, after having experienced a slow-down in 1977-78. The number of
subprojects financed grew by 30% during the period amounting to 2,321 in
1981, representing about 10% of the total number of SSIs in Colombia.20/
During 1977-81 CFP maintained some equity investments in industrial estates
and enterprises. These investments, however, are marginal within CFP's
overall operations and have poor financial results, considering in
particular the cost of the time CFP had to spend in managing the
projects. 21/
4.14      In line with its statutory objectives, CFP focusses primarily on
lending to smaller industrial firms that do not have alternative credit
source. In 1977-81, about two-thirds of CFP's subprojects financed were
for enterprises with total assets of up to COL$3.0 million (about US$70,000
average equivalent during the period). 2/ The average loan was about
Col$806,000 (about US$19,000 average). Assisted firms continued to
represent a wide range of industrial subsectors. Food, apparel and
footwear, printing, chemicals, metal working, non-metallic minerals and
19/ Onlending rates with FFI, PROEXPO,and Industrial Development Institute
(IFI) resources, are pre-established by them. Currently, FFI's rates
vary between 22% and 26% depending on size, location and job
generation of subprojects. Lending with PROEXPO resources is at
17-19%. IFI resources are relended at 25%. Overall, CFP's onlending
rate has been on average lower than commercial rates by about 10
percentage points.
20/  Estimated uy aCuel to be 20-25,000.

paid-in capital of the Guarantee Fund created by the government

1558-CO). See Annex 11.

transport materials accounted for about two thirds of total CFP approvals.
Subloan with maturities of more than 3 years increased from 37% of subloans
in 1977 to 45% in 1980 and 1981.    CFP has substantially increased its
lending outside the three major departments of Cundinamarca, Antioquia and
Valle, from Col$419.0 million (43% of the total lending) in 1979 to about
Col$1,650.0 million in 1981 (54% of total lending). Working capital
financing has represented about two thirds of CFP financing, and fixed
assets financing one third. New clients accounted for about 10-15% of the
total number of enterprises financed. On balance, these figures confirm
CFP's successful efforts towards lending to a broad and regionally
well-diversified range of SSIs.
Financial Position and Results
4.15       Financial Structure - CFP's financial condition has developed
satisfactorily. Better financial projections have proved to be an
important tool in balancing operational targets with resource
availabilities. By 1981, CFP had exceeded the targets projected during
appraisal, for growth of total assets, portfolio, net profits, net
profits/average total assets ratio, domestic and foreign borrowing, etc.
Debt/equity ratio and debt from short-term and export portfolio/equity
ratio were maintained below the upper limits (5.5 and 2.0 respectively)
established under Loan 1451-CO (Annex 12).
4.16       CFP's total assets and loan portfolio grew about three times
since 1977, amounting to Col$4,111 million and Col$3,616 million,
respectively, as of year-end 1981 (Annex 13). Equity increased by about
Col$480.0 million, of which Col$244.0 million were paid-in capital under
Loan 1451-CO (para. 4.09). Provisions for bad loans of about 4% of average
portfolio have proven to be adequate, as the bulk of CFP's loans are backed
by real guarantees, and the portfolio quality is satisfactory (para. 4.20).
4.17       CFP's profitability has improved during the last five years
(Annexes 12 and 14). Profits grew faster than assets and portfolio, mainly
as a result of short-term investments made with cash resources. While
profits did not fully compensate the erosion of CFP's equity by inflation
during 1977-81 (para. 4.08), the profit/equity ratio showed a growing trend
during the period. Profits were affected by relatively high administrative
costs, growing and higher costs to attend to the smaller enterprises, and
decreasing financial margins (mainly because the CFP's onlending interest
rates did not increase as much as the CFP's cost of financial resources).
4.18      A major concern of the Bank and CFP has been the level of CFP's
administrative costs. Loan 1451-CO required CFP to reduce its
administrative costs from 7.8% of average total assets in 1976 to 6.9% in
1979 and to 5.8% by 1981. However, the excessively rapid reduction in
administrative costs as a percentage of average total assets in 1978
(to 5.9%), adversely affected CFP's capacity to carry out its development
role, particularly in respect of supervision/technical assistance. During
negotiations of Loan 1834-CO in 1979 CFP agreed with the Bank on new
targets, i.e., to maintain administrative costs below 7.5% of average total
assets in 1980, 6.9% in 1981 and 6.0% in 1982 and onwards.



-  16  -
4.19       CFP managed its administrative costs to reach 7.3% of its average
total assets in 1980 and 7.2% in 1981. While CFP's assets grew
sufficiently fast in 1980 (by 43%) to enable CFP to reach the target
administrative cost/total assets ratio, slower nominal growth of assets in
1981 (34%) did not permit compliance with the more ambitious target for
that year. CFP's administrative expenses grew by 38% average p.a. in
1980-81, mainly as a result of salary and legal fringe benefit increases at
the beginning of both years to compensate for the domestic inflation.
Total number of staff declined slightly in 1981. To achieve a lower
administrative cost/assets ratio, bearing in mind understaffing at some
branches, CFP should focus its attention on a better balance between
operational and support staff, so as to achieve a faster rate of portfolio
growth (see also para. 4.02).
4.20       The quality of CFP's portfolio, another major area of Bank's and
CFP's attention, has continued to improve since 1977. The portfolio
affected by arrears decreased from 14.2% of the total portfolio at the
beginning of 1977 to 12.6% in 1979 and 11.6% in 1981 (Annex 15). Portfolio
affected by arrears of 360 days or more fell from 6.8% at the beginning of
1977 to 4.0% at year-end 1981. While during 1979 and 1981 CFP experienced
slight increases in its portfolio in arrears, they were due to increases in
arrears between 1 day and 360 days. The key actions that improved the
quality of CFP's portfolio were: (a) strengthened subproject supervision;
(b) monthly follow-up of clients in arrears; (c) acceleration of the
procedures for dealing with clients in arrears; (d) improved appraisal
techniques; and (e) more stringent insistance upon real guarantees for
loans. Penalty interest rates also contributed to decreasing arrears in
most of the cases provided that such rates were higher than the cost of
alternative funds to SSIs. In 1981, penalty interest rate was 36%, whereas
the "parallel" market interest rate rose to about 42%-44%. This, coupled
with the generally tight liquidity situation in Colombia led to a slight
increase in CFP's arrears. The present arrears level appears satisfactory
given the (a) adequate real guarantees of most CFP loans, (b) the adequacy
of provisions for losses, (c) CFP's development role catering to smaller
enterprises of the SSI sector and (d) the need to have some flexibility in
demanding prompt repayment from CFP clients, who often have liquidity
problems due to poor cash management and/or the recurring credit shortages
in Colombia that affect them more seriously.
Technical Assistance
4.21      The project expected at the time of appraisal that CFP would
build up its capabilities and operational effectivenss for coordinating and
financing technical assistance to SSIs. CFP, after an initial period of
ad-hoc initiatives, expanded and reviewed its technical assistance
activities in 1976, and again in 1978. In addition to a small technical
assistance department at the headquarters, 17 advisors were attached to the
regional offices. In May 1978, CFP discontinued the bulk of the direct
technical assistance activities, replacing them with systematic supervison
of clients. CFP involvement under this revised approach has focussed on:
(i) supervision and referral services to external sources of technical
assistance, which limited CFP's direct assistance mainly to the
identification of client needs; (ii) coordinating with SENA and other



-  17  -
institutions their provision of direct technical assistance and training to
SSIs; (iii) lending to SSIs to finance technical assistance needs; and
(iv)supplying technical information. The new approach reflects CFP's
experience that effective direct technical assistance to a large number of
individual firms requires more staff time and expertise than CFP could
allocate. CFP's technical assistance advisors generally do not have the
qualifications or experience to perform in-depth consultancy on specific
problems of SSIs whereas there are now several public and private
institutions (SENA, FICITEX, universities and other entities) and
consultants who provide technical assistance to SSIs.
4.22      The CFP's new technical assistance approach, while still at a
relatively early stage, appears to make sense. Detailed information on the
cost/effectiveness of the whole approach still is not' available. A close
monitoring system for such purpose should be established. Annex 16 shows
CFP's technical assistance activities during 1977-81. CFP's participation
in arranging training seminars and courses, is now much more demand
oriented. Similarly, CFP's technical information services have proved
useful. Lending to SSIs to finance their technical assistance needs has
had a limited sucess. SSI's reluctance to pay for the full cost of
technical assistance, even when loan financing is provided, remains a
constraint.
4.23      CFP has also achieved some level of coordination with other
agencies providing technical asistance to SSI, mainly with SENA. Coopera-
tion between CFP and SENA is particularly important in view of SENA's new
program of integral technical asistance. The program is designed to improve
management of small and medium-sized industrial enterprise through two
consecutive group and individual training session of 100 hours each spread
over about six months, giving equal weight to: (i) general management, (ii)
marketing, (iii) production (process and technology), (iv) finance and
accounting, and (v) industrial relations. The seminars are followed by a
series of individual consultancy assistance to the participants, to put in
practice within the enterprise the concepts presented in the seminars.
Most importantly, each participating entrepreneur is assisted in
self-diagnosing deficiencies and in preparing an action plan to remedy
them. This also leads to the identification of financial requirements and
the preparation of longer-term development plans for the enterprises.
4.24      CFP is now proposing to provide some financial assistance to SENA
in order to encourage an increased level of coordination and cooperation.
Coordination with SENA has been negatively affected mainly in 1981 by
(i) SENA's policies and priorities in providing technical assistance to
SSIs; (ii) the lack of motivation/control from CFP on SENA's technical
assistance activities; and (iii) SENA's constraint in number and quality
of consultants. In addition, coordination between CFP and other
institutions e.g. FICITEC, the Institute of Technological Research (ITR),
the Fondo Colombiano de Investigaciones Cientificas y Proyectos Especiales
(COLCIENCIAS), universities and private consultants, needs to be
strengthened. CFP should also review its strategy to carry out effectively
its new technical assistance program taking into account the comments
stated above, and preparing annual technical assistance plans as
recowmended under iLuan 1034-CU.

New Developments
4.25      Consistent with the objective of the second small-scale industry
project (Loan 1451-CO), CFP has reviewed its policies and operations under
the third project (Loan 1834-CO). CFP has approved a new policy in
financing individual plant construction, placing emphasis on financing
production facilities, as opposed to storage and office space, outside the
major urban centers (para. 3.10). In addition, it has financed the
construction of an industrial park for 35-40 SSIs in Rio Negro, 50 km
outside Medellin. SSIs to be established in Rio Negro have been financed
with proceeds of Loan 1834-CO. Another innovation during 1977-81 is the
Special Artisan Credit Program, which finances mostly working capital
requirements of very small labor-intensive firms located outside the areas
of influence of Bogota, Medellin and Cali. CFP has earmarked for this
program, rollover funds under previous Bank loan and some specific local
resources. The third loan included additional US$5.0 million (15.6% of
loan resources) for this purpose. CFP lowers its normal guarantee
requirements for these loans if the firm signs a technical assistance
agreement with SENA.
4.26      The micro-enterprises program is another new area of CFP's
involvement. This new approach to develop smaller enterprises is a
comprehensive program of (i) initial training in general administrative
aspects and/or entrepreneurial development; (ii) additional training and
technical asistance, in accordance with the characteristics and/or needs of
the enterprises, working with groups of nearby enterprises (clusters); and
(iii) financial assistance. Once the entrepreneurs are enlisted in the
program, they have to go through the initial training in order to have
access to the other two parts of the package. The program which focusses
on enterprises with total assets of up to US$15,000 equivalent, was
initiated by Fundacion Carvajal in Cali in 1980. It is expanding to other
geographical areas in Colombia (Antioquia, Cundinamarca, Santander,
Bolivar, etc). The program in each region is administered by "Fundaciones"
established by larger private enterprises from the region.
4.27      CFP has been providing financing to the microenterprises through
the Fundaciones (a line of credit of Col$15.0 million). The Fundaciones
are responsible to CFP for the credit risk, they administer the loans and
keep a financial spread of 6% on CFP's funds. In addition, two Fund-
aciones23/ had negotiated each one a US$0.5 million soft loan with the
Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), for lending to the micro-
enterprises. By year-end 1981, the two Fundaciones had identified about
2,000 microentrepreneurs; provided training and technical assistance to
about 1,200; and financed about 340 enterprises, with total loan amount of
US$0.5 million of which only about 0.75% were in arrears. The bulk of the
Fundaciones' operating costs are financed with grants from larger private
enterprises. The training and technical assistance, which is provided with
23/ Carvajal in Cali and Fabricato in Medellin, which are the ones
currently operating with the program.



-  19  -
Fundaciones' staff and some graduated small industrialists is financed by
the Fundaciones. SENA is also providing technical assistance, which is
coordinated by the Fundaciones.
4.28      As yet firm conclusions cannot be drawn on the merits of this
approach. Nevertheless, initial indications appear promising. The cost
per job created (US$1,100) is very low. Moreover, this approach provides a
way to create new small enterprises that start their existence with the
basic administrative tools. The Bank and CFP should follow closely the
developments and results on this program within its dialogue on SSI's
development.
V. SECTORAL IMPACT
5.01       In addition to the project's sectoral objectives regarding
lending, technical assistance, and industrial decentralization, at the time
of appraisal the Bank expected the government to take several actions and
policy measures for the development of the SSI sector. The Bank
recommended to institutionalize within the government responsibility for:
(i) gauging the impact of past and new government policies and programs on
SSI; (ii) ensuring a sufficient and timely flow of resources to SSI; (iii)
taking steps conducive to country wide promotion and coordination of
technical and financial activities to SSI; and (iv) establishing a
coordinated policy framework to promote SSI.
5.02      The government through CFP has succeeded in increasing the
lending to SSIs, in achieving a sectoral impact at regional level, and in
strengthening CFP's development and operating capabilities during 1977-81.
CFP has also initiated the coordination of technical assistance to SSIs
with other public and private institutions mainly with SENA. However,
restrictive credit policies during the period precluded FFI from
representing a growing source of financing to SSI and even made FFI to
decrease its lending in nominal terms (Annex 17)24 .     In addition, FFI's
rediscount characteristics during the period, did not provide adequate
incentives to financial intermediaries to use FFI's resources. The credit
policies, also affected SSI's borrowing from commercial sources, for
working capital. In the above context, since BR's development credit
policies through FFI were to a large extent subject to the fluctuation of
the overall monetary policy to control inflation, and that for such reason
the amount of money in BR available for SSI financing varies considerably
(as during the period), it appears that without an institution like CFP it
would be very difficult within the Colombian context, to maintain a
relatively stable flow of institutional financing to the SSI sector.
However, the possibility of providing greater stability to FFI operations
should be further analyzed and discussed with the government.
5.03      The project's contribution in inducing the government to design a
concrete coordinated policy framework and to institutionalize
responsibilities for the SSI sector development was limited. The Bank in
its dialogue with the government perhaps was not explicit enough as to what
policy measures should be taken to help SSI sector development.
24/ CFP and FFI account for the bulk of term lending to SSIs.



-  20  -
Colombian industrial and trade policies have focused on the sector as a
whole without differentiating between SSIs and larger enterprises.
Nevertheless, with the exception of some monetary-credit policies mentioned
above, prevailing policies did provide a generally favorable climate for
SSI's growth and apparently did not discriminate against SSIs. Also a
guarantee fund was established in late 1981, to encourage commercial banks
and financieras to increase their term lending to SSIs25/.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01      The project achieved most of its objectives in a satisfactory
degree. It represented a major source of term funds to SSIs. It supported
a large number of subprojects (696), concentrated in the lower spectrum of
the SSIs sector. The financing of relatively small subloans (average
US$24,000) achieved a satisfactory geographical and subsectoral
dispersion. No single subsector received more than 18% of subloans and
about 63% of all subloans and 49% of the total financing went to firms
located outside of Colombia's three major metropolitan areas. The economic
impact of subprojects financed was satisfactory. Some 3,300 direct new jobs
are estimated to have been generated, with an average investment cost per
job of about US$13,500 in current US dollars. In addition, some 1,500
indirect new jobs opportunities are expected to open through subprojects'
forward and backward linkages. Overall, sales growth and increases in
productivity of enterprises financed were good. The subprojects' financial
rates of return were satisfactory, reaching on the average 40%. Economic
rates of return were not calculated, but based on Bank experience of larger
projects financed by the private financieras it is expected that on average
economic rates of return would be somewhat higher than the financial rates
of return.
6.02      CFP's progress in institutional development has been
substantial.The project was an important factor in this development, mainly
through loan requirements and Bank's supervision. CFP's operating policies
and procedures, as well as the strengthening of its regional offices,
proved to be the most important aspects for CFP's growth and satisfactory
financing performance.
6.03      CFP's resource mobilization was adequate in quantitative terms.
However, its continuing dependency on the government and on public sector
agencies for domestic resources, led to significant fluctuations in
resource availability during 1977-81 ,and hampered CFP's efforts towards
25/ The guarantee fund was established as a "private commercial
operation", with a total authorized capital of Col$200 million.
Currently, the shareholders are: IFI, participating with Col$100
million as paid-in capital and CFP with Col$50 million. The fund
would operate with guarantees approved/equity ratio of 10:1. It is
expected to start operations within the second part of 1982, once its
operating regulations are approved.

stable growth. Bank resources also have become increasingly important as a
source of foreign funds to CFP. Building up a diversified and sound
resource base adequately to finance its operations, remains an important
objective for CPP.
6.04      CFP's average onlending rate, while marginally positive in real
terms does not permit CFP to compete with other local financial
institutions for private domestic resources. This is particularly true at
present when some short-term deposit rates are above CFP lending rates.
Moreover, as a specialized SSI institution, CFPs average loan size is small
and its transaction costs relatively high. Thus CFP needs a higher spread
between borrowing and lending rates than do the private financieras. A
review and upward revision of CFPs interest rates is needed to increase
CFPs profitability and enable it to use a higher proportion of debt
resources in its operations. However, such interest rate adjustment should
preferably be made in the context of a broader restructuring of interest
rates charged by public sector institutions and funds.
6.05       CFP's operations grew considerably during 1977-81.    Its financial
condition and portfolio quality continue to improve. CFP's profitability
has improved gradually but remains inadequate to enable CFP to maintain the
real value of its equity. When account is taken of CFP's focus on the
smaller SSIs and of its developmental activites in support of the sector
for which it is not remunerated, CFP's financial performance can be judged
to be reasonably satisfactory. CFP has applied a sound banking approach,
maintaining a balance between lending for development, maintaining a sound
portfolio and keeping administrative expenses under control. Shifting an
increased proportion of existing CFP staff to operations would contribute
to a more rapid rate of growth at lower unit cost. This implies further
strengthening the regional offices and streamlining the headquarters.
6.06      CFP's decision to concentrate on coordinating technical
assistance to SSI provided by other agencies, rather than providing such
assistance directly, appears to be appropriate. SSI's willingness to
accept technical assistance and/or pay for its full costs is still a
constraint which may be overcome only in the long run. Nevertheless,
CFP's new technical assistance approach represents a positive step towards
further development of the SSI sector in Colombia and it should be
strengthened.
6.07      While a coordinated policy framework for SSI still does not
exist, the overall policy framework is reasonably favorable for SSIs and
does not discriminate against them. Idenfication of policies relevant for
SSI development and a review of their impact on SSIs should be pursued by
the Bank in its dialogue with the government.



-  22  -
6.08      The relatively favorable experience of the first two projects led
the Bank to continue to support CFP through a third SSI project (Loan
1834-CO) still being disbursed. The growth of CFP's operations under the
second loan and its lending projections justified a substantially larger
third loan of US$32.0 million. Since subproject, subborrower, subsectoral
and regional characteristics under the second loan were considered
satisfactory, few changes were made in onlending terms. However, given the
acute shortage of working capital available to SSIs in Colombia, the third
loan made available up to US$9.0 million for working capital financing,
which includes US$5.0 million to support the CFP's new Special Artisan
Credit Program. A US$0.6 million technical assistance component was
designed to finance consulting services for CFP or its clients.
6.09      Colombia is an interesting case study for SSI financing since it
has both a specialized institution for the subsector, CFP, and a two tier
system for supporting commercial bank lending to SSIs via the FFI. Overall
our experience with CFP suggests that the specialized institution approach,
within the Colombian context, has several strong points: (i) because of
CFP's specialized role it has a stronger motivation to expand lending to
SSIs than the general purpose banks, which have other less costly or less
risky lending opportunities; (ii) similarly, the volume of SSI lending
handled by CFP enables it to develop the expertise needed to undertake
appraisal based lending and thus to lend to a broader spectrum of SSI
clients; (iii) identification of technical assistance needs and
coordination of such assistance by appropriate institutions is also better
done by CFP, that can develop the necessary special skills, rather than
being done separately by individual commercial banks; and (iv) as a
specialized institution CFP also has a vested interest in advocating
adoption by the government of a policy framework that is favorable to SSIs
efficient development. On the other hand, a specialized institution
inevitably has rather high administrative costs because all of its
transactions are quite small. As a result, a specialized institution like
CFP would only be able to mobilize all the resources it needs in the market
if it charged interest rates to SSIs that are significantly above the
interest rates charged to larger industries. CFP's financial position could
be mitigated in part if it received direct budgetary support for those
activities which go beyond pure financial intermediation as provided by
private lending institutions.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director, Operations Evaluation
Department
IBRD, Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Kapur:
We have the pleasure of referring to your letter of January 17, 1983
with which you forwarded us the "Project Completion Report on the Second
Small-Scale Industry Project (Loan 1451 CO)."
The Corporation, after having made a thorough analysis of this report,
has concluded that the opinions contained in it reflect the effort made to
meet the conditions laid down and the commitments entered into when the second
loan was negotiated with the World Bank and we therefore inform you that we
have no comments of substance to make on it.
At the same time, we would like you to know that we have taken
careful note of certain recommendations on aspects requiring improvement in
a particular area of the Corporation and that we are taking appropriate steps
to increase the efficiency of our operations.
Thank you again for the interest shown by the Bank in the Corporation's
work in the Small and Medium Industry field in Colombia.
With best regards,
/-/Luis Armando Galvis Valles
General Manager
