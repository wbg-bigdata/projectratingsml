PREFACE
The Finance and Planning department, Government of Andhra Pradesh, entrusted EPTRI,
Hyderabad with the task of preparing "Environmental Assessment Report". The proposed
environmental management frame addresses
a) Develop environmental screening criteria for the subprojects to be taken up in the six
districts of A.P under AP-DPIP project according to their expected environmental impacts
b) Establish administrative structure for environmental Management
c) Develop a Capacity and Awareness building program
d) Establish Environmental Supervision and Monitoring plan.
A comprehensive study was done to develop a "Screening Checklist", which would screen
the subprojects into different categories depending upon the expected impacts due to the
proposed activities and the level of environmental studies required to come up with suitable
mitigative measures.
EPTRI gratefully acknowledges the help rendered by the State Government departments
(District Collectorates, Panchayat Raj, R&B, Fisheries, Ground water and Forest etc) during
the collection of data for the above project.
EPTRI is also grateful to Mr. Paul J. Martin, Environmental Specialist, the World Bank, for
his active and continuous support during the study.

CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION
Poverty is both the cause and consequence of many social evils. Developmental projects
are primarily meant for the poor aiming at achieving their poverty alleviation and thus an
egalitarian society. But often, in a hurry to achieve faster development, they ignore the
environmental aspects and thus endanger the environment. The environmental
degradation in turn aggravates the health risks of the poor thus throwing them into a
vicious circle of disease and squalor. Therefore, for the development projects to be more
effective in delivering the set goals and objectives of meeting the needs of the poor, it is
pertinent to address the environmental issues right in the beginning. To make
development sustainable, one needs to consider environmental aspects along with that of
development. As the definition of Sustainable Development suggests, we need that
development that meets the needs of the present without compromising on the
ability of the future generation to meet their own needs.
The Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives Project (AP-DPIP) exactly aims at
judicious development that is sustainable both economically and environmentally. It aims
at poverty alleviation in six districts of Andhra Pradesh. The developmental projects to be
taken up under AP-DPIP need to consider the environmental aspects as well in order to
prevent environmental hazards and make development sustainable.
1.1 STUDY AREA
The districts selected under AP-DPIP based on different criteria eligible for funding are
Adilabad, Ananthapur, Chittoor, Mahaboobnagar, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram.
1.2 DISTRICT PROFILES
The profile of the districts selected for the implementation of the AP-DPIP needs to be
considered while formulating the environmental criteria to be integrated into the
development projects at the design stage. The six districts taken up for the Project belong
to Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. The districts are chosen



EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
for the project based on their developmental needs. The district profiles are discussed
below in detail:
1.2.1 ADILABAD
Adilabad has a land area of 16000 sq. km, comprising a total population of 20.82 lakhs
and 1559 villages. The forest is of the Southern Tropical Dry Deciduous type and quite
dense in nature constituting about 44.8% of the land area. Therefore the area under forest
is much more compared to that of the other districts. The district experiences a maximum
and minimum temperature of 40 and 140C respectively and belongs to the Telangana
region. The rainfall is found to be 744mm during the South-West monsoon, 123mm
during North-east monsoon, 19mm during winter and 64mm during hot weather period.
The depth of ground water generally ranges from 6 to 60 m depending on the area. The
estimated groundwater resources of the district are 1355.20 million cubic meters (MCM)
of which the utilisable ground water resource is only 1151.94 (MCM) and net ground
water draft is 152.09 MCM leaving the balance of 999.85 MCM. The table 1.1 gives the
mandals, which fall under Grey and dark areas.

1.4 SCOPE OF WORK
The Finance and Planning department, Government of Andhra Pradesh, appointed
EPTRI, Hyderabad as consultants to prepare environmental screening criteria for the
subprojects to be taken up in the six districts of A.P under AP-DPIP project according to
their expected environmental impacts.
TASK I
In order to arrive at possible impacts due to the proposed subproject activities, an
Assessment of Environmental Criteria (AEC) should be conducted with the following
scope
The Sub-Projects listed under the community investment funds according to the Andhra
Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives project (DPIP II) Mission, Aide Memoire (November
23 to December 11,1998), are considered.
A Generic Screening List will be used to group the sub-projects in the districts into
appropriate levels for Enviromnent Assessment as follows:
Environmentally Beneficial, requiring environmental review (ER)
Environmentally benign, requiring environmental review (ER)
Require Limited Environmental Assessment (LEA)
Require detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Environmental Review checklist with standard mitigation measures specific to the sub
project category falling under level 1 and 2 (as above) will be prepared.
Generic TOR for Limited Environmental Assessment (LEA) will be prepared for
category 3 sub -project.

CHAPTER 2 - ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
The philosophy and the practice of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) or
Environmental Assessment (EA) is not only to assimilate and integrate a broad range of
geological, physical, cultural and legislative considerations along with that of
environmental aspects, but also to maintain inherent simplicity and flexibility of the
approach. One of the main objectives of E.A. study is to ensure that potential problems
are foreseen and addressed at an early stage (the project planning and design stage) to
prevent environmental degradation by equipping the decision-makers with good
information about consequences, that development could possibly have on the
environment.
2.1   ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS
Environmental analysis focuses on the relationship between the project activities and its
surrounding environment. It first examines how the project might affect human health
and the stocks of natural resources. It then goes on to consider what measures might be
introduced to mitigate the damaging environmental effects of the project. Finally it tries
to inform the decision-makers on the options for avoiding or reducing the adverse
impacts and to analyse the trade-off involved in choosing between alternative actions.
In principle, all subproject proposals can have potential environmental effects and should
therefore be subjected to environmental appraisal. However, certain types of subprojects
can be excluded from environmental appraisal, as the magnitude of environmental impact
expected will be low due to the size or nature of the subproject. Hence certain screening
criteria are required to identify the degree or level of environmentail studies required for
the proposed subproject activity. For example in case of 'Repair of Rural Roads', the
impact on environment will be minimal and hence an environmental review with standard
mitigative measures would be sufficient for environmental clearance. But in case of
"New Roads" the impacts on the environment may have to be reviewed from a broader
perspective before being cleared, hence requiring a Limited environmental Assessment.

EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
2.2   CRITERIA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING
To ease the bottlenecks created by environmental evaluation and simplify the process of
environmental clearances, the Finance and Planning department, Government of Andhra
Pradesh, appointed EPTRI, Hyderabad, as consultants to prepare standard environmental
screening criteria for the subprojects to be taken up in the six districts of A.P under AP
DPIP project. The screening checklists prepared for screening the proposals are simple
and clear, so that a non-specialist (with no environmental background) can use them with
suitable training.
2.3 SCREENING PROCEDURE
There are basically 3 steps in the screening process.
2.3.1 FIRST STEP: Location of the project
In the first step, the location of the subproject plays an important role in broadly
classifying the areas into three categories and in predicting the range of impacts and their
magnitude based on the sensitivity of the area. Thus the areas of the sub projects can be
broadly identified as Environrnentally highly sensitive-A, Environmentally moderately
sensitive-B and Environmentally less sensitive-C, depending on the terrain, vegetation
and other natural resources in the region. It is the responsibility of the community
facilitator to categorise the subproject location into one of the above classes with the help
of the "Location sensitivity checklist" given in table 3. 1.
2.3.2 SECOND STEP: Classification of sub projects
In the second step depending on the location category, type of activities proposed in the
subprojects, the possible range and magnitude of environmental impacts and the
mitigative measures required, the subprojects will be categorized into four classes. These
are
i.    Environmentally beneficial: Subprojects with positive environmental impacts on
the environment.
ii.    Environmentally benign: Subprojects likely to have some less significant
impacts on the environment but for which standard mitigative measures have been
identified.
Page 10



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
iii.   Minor Potential Environmental Impacts: Projects that have some moderately
significant environmental impacts (which do not set off a chain of other
environmental impacts) for which standard mitigative measures are not readily
identifiable.
iv.   Significant Potential Impacts: Subprojects that have potentially significant
impacts and may set off a chain of other environmental impacts or impacts
requiring detailed environmental studies.
2.3.3 STEP THREE: Environmental Assessment
In the third step, the level of environmental analysis or study required is decided keeping
in view the different environmental considerations and actions required. They are
Environmental Review, Limited Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact
Assessment.
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW (ER): It is required for subprojects that are
Environmentally beneficial or Environmentally benign (screening categories i&ii).
Environmental Review checklists (ER) with standard mitigative measures for various sub
projects are annexed (Annexure I)
LIMITED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (LEA): It is required for subprojects
with minor potential impacts (screening category iii). LEA checklists with Terms of
Reference (TOR) for various sub projects are annexed (Annexure II)
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA): It is required for subprojects
with significant potential impacts (screening category iv). In most of the cases these
subprojects will not be eligible for funding.
The above classification with level of environmental Studies required is in-built in the
Generic checklist.
2.4 RESPONSIBILITIES
Depending on the level of analysis required, the responsibilities for the environmental
screening, mitigation and clearance of subprojects are shown in figure 1.
Page 11



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
2.4.1 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
If the subproject requires ER according to the Generic checklist, then the community
facilitator (CF) will fill up environmental review checklist. The filled up checklist will be
submitted with the subproject proposal to the District Project Management Unit (DPMU)
for their review prior to the subproject approval.
2.4.2 LIMITED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
In case of subprojects which require LEA as per the Generic checklist the DPMU will be
responsible for ensuring that it is conducted according to the TOR by specialist or by a
trained person at DPMU.
2.4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
In case of a subproject requiring an EIA as per the Generic checklist, the DPMU or
SPMU will decide if the subproject proposal is to be rejected, or whether a full EIA is
warranted (likely to be only in few cases).
The screening flow chart with the level of involvement and responsibilities (of people) is
given in figure 1.

CHAPTER 3 - ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING CHECKLISTS
3.1   LOCATION SENSITIVE CHECKLIST
The Location sensitive checklist (LSC) for sub projects shown in Tablel is prepared
taking into consideration environmentally sensitive parameters like terrain, vegetation,
slope, population etc to identify and classify the areas into Environmentally Highly
Sensitive-A, Environmentally Moderately Sensitive-B and Environmentally Less
Sensitive-C.
3.1.1 HIGHLY SENSITIVE AREAS (A OR D)
Those areas where, if the subproject is taken up, the possibility of direct impact with
considerable magnitude due to the project activities is high on the area.
3.1.2 MODERATELY SENSITIVE AREAS (B OR E)
Those areas, within which if the subproject is located, possibility of direct impact of
considerable magnitude on the area due to the proposed activities is low, but the indirect
impacts can be of appreciable magnitude.
3.1.3 LESS SENSITIVE AREAS (C)
Those areas, within which if the subproject is located, the possibility of direct or indirect
impact of appreciable magnitude on the area due to the proposed activities is low.
3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES FOR CLASSIFICATION OF AREAS
The Environmental attributes taken into consideration for the classifications of these
areas are:
1. SLOPE: During the subproject execution, the slope of the terrain will have a significant
influence on the type and magnitude of the environmental impact. Hence based on slope
as criteria (as per Indian Road Congress rules) the areas have been divided into the
following three groups keeping in view the possible type & magnitude of impacts:
A. Mountain or Steep terrain as highly sensitive
B. Rolling or undulating terrain as moderately sensitive
C. Level or plain terrain as less sensitive.
Page 14



EPTRI                                             Environmental Assessment Report
2. PERENNIAL FRESH WATER BODIES: In order to preserve and reduce the possible
impact due to the proposed subproject activity on the water bodies, these areas have been
classified depending on the distance from the water bodies:
A. The areas within 50 m from the water bodies as highly sensitive
B. The areas between 50 to 500m from the water bodies as moderately sensitive
C. The areas with distance more than 500 m as less sensitive
3. MARINE AND ESTUARINE WETLANDS: In order to preserve and reduce the
possible impact due to the proposed Subproject activity on the ecosystem, these areas have
been classified as
A. The areas within 50 m from the water bodies as highly sensitive
B. The areas between 50 to 500m from the water bodies as moderately sensitive
C. The areas with distance more than 500 m as less sensitive
This attribute is more applicable in case of coastal districts like Srikakulam and
Vizianagaram.
4. NATURAL HABITATS/VEGETATION/ RESERVED FOREST: In order to
preserve and reduce the possible impact due to the proposed subproject activity on natural
habitats/vegetation/ reserved forest, these areas have been classified as
The areas within 50 m from natural habitats/vegetation/ reserved forest as highly sensitive.
The areas between 50 to 500m from the natural habitats/vegetation/ reserved forest as
moderately sensitive.
The areas with distance more than 500 m from the natural habitats/vegetation/ reserved
forest as less sensitive
5. NATIONAL PARKS AND SANCTUARIES: As these have endangered species or
protected wildlife, no activity must be allowed or encouraged around them. The areas
surrounding them are classified into
The areas within 500 m from National park/ sanctuaries as highly sensitive.
The areas between 500 m to 1 Km from National park! sanctuaries as moderately sensitive.
The areas with distance more than 1 Km from National park/ sanctuaries as less sensitive.
This attribute is more applicable in case of districts like Adilabad, Anantapur, Chittoor
and Mahaboobnagar.

EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
6. SITES OF CULTURAL OR HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Care must be
taken to preserve the historical monuments and traditional centers of national
/state/local importance. Hence activities which can endanger their existence must be
avoided. The area surrounding them have been classified into
A. The areas within 50 m from sites of cultural or historical significance as highly
sensitive.
B. The areas between 50 to 500m from sites of cultural or historical significance as
moderately sensitive.
C. The areas with distance more than 500 m from sites of cultural or historical
significance as less sensitive
7. POPULATION DENSITY: The villages/ habitations are divided into 2 classes
depending on their population, (1 )Having more than 2000 people and
(2) Having less than 2000 people. This classification is made considering
issues like the amount of resources required (like water etc) and wastes
generated (like waste water, solid waste etc). The distance from the
habitati is used to classify areas to plan suitable mitigative measures to
minimise the adverse impacts of the proposed activity on the people.
D. The areas within 500 m from habitation with a population > 2000 as highly
sensitive.
E. The areas between 500 m to 1 Km from habitation with a population > 2000 as
moderately sensitive.
C. The areas with distance more than 1 Km from habitation with a population > 2000
or the villages with a population < 2000 people as less sensitive.
Table 1 gives the list of environmental attributes taken into consideration for the
classification of these areas

EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
The community facilitator will classify the location of the proposed subproject into one
of the 3 categories for each of the attributes in the location sensitive checklist. The area is
declared as category A, if it falls under it at least incase of one attribute in checklist. Else,
in case of the area not falling under category A, if it falls under B for at least one attribute
then it is declared as category B. Else it is declared as category C.
3.3 GENERIC CHECK LIST
While preparing the Generic checklist the following issues were given due importance
1) These projects are basically meant for meeting the minimum requirements of the
habitats.
2) The cost of the sub projects is less than $ 100,000 and in many cases is around 40,000
to 50,000 US dollars.
3) There is no major rehabilitation required for taking up these projects.
Depending on the subproject type, activities and location, the checklist identifies the level
of environmental analysis or study required for the proposed subproject. In some cases
the sub projects have also been classified depending on parameters like number of
people, size of the project, area affected, ground water utilization and depth etc to
incorporate the already existing guidelines or standards being followed by the concerned
departments in their already existing or completed projects.
Hence keeping the above issues in view the sub projects have been mostly divided into
three categories: a) Repairs or Rehabilitation b) Up gradation and c) New ones depending
upon type of expected activities, their impacts and level of environmental analysis
required.
3.3.1 REPAIRS AND UPGRADATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
As the subproject under consideration is already existing, it only needs to be improvised
to meet today's needs and demands, and to increase its utilization and survival. In most of
these cases the impacts of these activities are not of considerable magnitude. Hence an
environmental review with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take
Page 18



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
up the project. In very few cases due to some environmentally sensitive conditions a
Limited Environmental Assessment may be required.
3.3.2 NEW SUBPROJECTS
In most of the cases, the impacts due to the proposed activity may have to be reviewed
from a broader perspective with more details. It may require more information and data
of the prevailing conditions in order to take up suitable mitigative measures or look into
other possible altematives.
In few cases due to a number of inter linking conditions and factors the subprojects may
require a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment to know the environmental impact
of the project. The Table 2 gives the generic checklist.
3.3.3       ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW (ER)
It refers to a very simple level of environmental assessment. It does not require
sophisticated environmental expertise and can be adequately completed by the
community facilitator. The checklist basically identifies all the possible impacts due to
the proposed activity perceived from the past experiences of similar projects. It also
provides suitable mitigative measures to reduce or nullify the adverse impacts expected.
The community facilitators can identify the likely and applicable impacts of the proposed
subproject from the ones listed in the relevant checklist. Then he must look into the
corresponding mitigative measures suggested and see that they are implemented. The ER
checklists are annexed.
3.3.4 LIMITED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (LEA)
Certain projects might have some unforeseen impacts. In order to withstand these
impacts, one needs to know the profile of the region and the projects in greater detail.
LEA helps in equipping with the relevant information with the help of which any number
of unforeseen impacts can be managed with certain mitigative measures. Thus, a
subproject requiring a LEA needs to be reviewed by an environmental/technical
Page 19



EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
specialist. The information regarding baseline conditions and potential site-specific
impacts must be analysed. The outline for collection of baseline information is given in
the LEA checklist. The mitigative measures recommended by the expert must be
incorporated into the design by the community facilitators or the implementers of the
project.
For subprojects requiring a LEA, it is important to monitor the work, both during
construction and also operation to ensure that mitigative measures are implemented and
that no unforeseen negative impacts are left unmanaged. The LEA checklists are
annexed.
3.3.5 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (EIA)
An EIA would be required in the event of significant direct or indirect impacts due to the
proposed subproject. Such subprojects would generally be subjected to national
requirement for an EIA. The necessity of a full EIA appears to be very rare for DPIP
subprojects: normally, a subproject requiring this kind of environmental analysis would
be refused funding.
3.4 ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES FOR SCREENING AND
CLASSIFICATION OF SUBPROJECTS
1     RURAL ROADS
Considering the activities associated with the repair and up gradation of rural roads, the
impact will be marginal and can be addressed by standard mitigative measures. Hence ER
with standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take up these projects in all categories
of areas.
For construction of new roads/widening in areas (B, C, D and E) LEA is required because
the impacts due to the proposed activities are far fetched and must be looked into from a
broader perspective. They may require more information and data (location specific
features like slope and drainage pattern etc) to come up with suitable mitigative
measures.
Page 20



EPTRI                                              Environmental Assessment Report
In the case of construction of new road/widening falling under category A (e.g. area very
close to sanctuaries or hilly terrain), the sub project may have significant and long-term
impact, which needs detailed impact evaluation. Hence it requires an EIA.
2     BRIDGES
The sub projects under this category generally constitute repairs to the existing bridges or
construction of new bridges on existing roads. Considering the activities associated with
the sub project and the costs allocated, the impact will be marginal irrespective of the
location. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take
up the project.
Where as in the case of construction of new minor bridges in all areas, site specific data
(like drainage pattern of the area, upstream and down stream activities etc) is required for
evaluating the impact of the project on the surroundings and to suggest suitable
mitigative measures. Hence it requires a LEA.
3   COMMUNITY HALLS
Keeping in view the utilization of the multi purpose community halls (for activities like
social functions, community festivals, cyclone rehabilitation etc.) and the activities
associated with repair and rehabilitation in all areas and construction of new community
halls in areas falling under category B, C, E, the impacts on the surrounding environment
will be marginal and concern mostly waste disposal considerations. Hence they can be
addressed by standard mitigative measures. So an ER with standard mitigative measures
regarding waste disposal, sanitation facilities etc., is sufficient to take up the project.
In case of D and A categories which are nearer to sensitive zones like sanctuaries and
habitats etc., LEA is required because the impacts due to the proposed activities on
surrounding environment should be looked into specific to the context of cyclone
rehabilitation, community fetes and festivals etc. Hence it may require more information
and data (location specific features like water availability and ground water details) to
come up with suitable mitigative measures.

EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
4     SCHOOLS / TRAINING CENTERS / OTHER EDUCATIONAL CENTERS
Keeping in view the proposed activities for which it will be used (like residential hostels,
schools etc.) and the activities during repair and rehabilitation (in all categories), the
impact on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can. be addressed by
standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with standard mitigative measures is
sufficient to take up the project.
In case of construction of new ones (in all categories) the evaluation of impacts due to the
waste generation on the surrounding environment will require more site specific
information and data (like quantity of waste generated, ground water levels, drainage
pattern etc) to come up with suitable mitigative measures.
5     HEALTH CENTERS/ CLINICS
The health centers are meant for health care in the village. Owing to the gravity of the
cases, the quantity and characteristics of wastes (organic especially biomedical and
inorganic) generated and the population of habitats (number of people using the facility),
the impact on the surrounding environment will be marginal and concern mainly disposal
of waste, both biomedical and general. As the scale of the projects is very small, these
issues can be addressed by following standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with
suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the project in B, C, D, E
category areas.
Whereas in case of health centers located in category A will require site specific data like
the degree of impact that can be allowed taking into consideration the importance of the
area and species in the surrounding for careful handling and disposal of the wastes
generated. Hence a LEA is required.
6   MARKETS
Keeping in view the proposed activities, the quantity and characteristics of wastes
(organic and inorganic) generated and the population of habitations (number of people
using the facility), the impact on the surrounding environment will be marginal and
concern mainly waste disposal. Hence they can be addressed by standard mitigative

EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
measures. Therefore, an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient
to take up the project in B, C and E category areas.
The location of Markets/ Commercial centers in category A and D must be avoided as far
as possible. The amount of organic and inorganic waste generated will be of considerable
magnitude posing health problems, increasing congestion and enhancing the human
interference in the sensitive/protected areas. In case of unavoidable circumstances an EIA
study is required for clearance of such subprojects.
7     DRINKING WATER SUPPLY
SURFACE WATER
Keeping in view the proposed activities during up gradation of multipurpose communal
ponds and the waste (organic and inorganic) generated due to such activities on the
surrounding environment, the impacts will be marginal and can be addressed by standard
mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is
sufficient to take up the project.
In case of construction of new multipurpose communal ponds in areas C and E which are
environmentally less sensitive require a ER as the impact due to change in drainage
pattern on the aquatic life will be minimal and standard mitigative measures can be
suggested to reduce them. LEA will be required is case of subprojects located in
category B as it may require more information and data (location specific features like
drainage pattern, aquatic life etc.) to come up with suitable mitigative measures.
The construction of new multipurpose communal ponds in category A and D must be
avoided as far as possible. As Problems associated water stagnation and change in
drainage pattern can have irreversible damage in the sensitive areas (like A) and spread
diseases in the surrounding areas (like D). In case of unavoidable circumstances an EIA
study is required for clearance of such subprojects.

GROUND WATER
NEW OR UP GRADATION OF (TUBE WELLS/OPEN WELLS)
In case of dark areas where the ground water exploitation is more than 85% of the
available water, the upgradation or new construction of tube wells will require a LEA
because the impacts due to the proposed activities may result in depletion of water
resources. Moreover it may require additional information and data (location specific
features like drainage pattern, groundwater aquifer details etc) to come up with suitable
mitigative measures. In case of Grey or white area the impact on the surrounding
environment will be marginal and can be addressed by standard mitigative measures.
Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the
project.
DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANT
-Drinking water treatment plant must be allowed only in area C and B considering the
area required and the type of activities like quantity of water stored and different
activities related to treatment. It requires a LEA because the impacts due to the proposed
activities may have to be looked into from a broader perspective and will require
additional information and data (location specific features like drainage pattern,
elevations, ground water table etc) to come up with suitable mitigative measures.
The location of Treatment plants must be must be avoided in other area as far as possible.
But in case of unavoidable circumstances an EIA study is required for clearance of such
subprojects in category E areas. As they requires a suitable site identification study-to be
carried for finalisation of the location.
PIPED WATER SUPPLY OR GRAVITY SCHEMES
The major activities in this subproject are digging, laying of pipes and refilling the trench.
The impact of these activities on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can
be addressed by standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard
mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the project in categories B, C, D, E. Whereas
in case of subprojects located in category A require site specific data to propose suitable
mitigative measures. Hence a LEA is required.

8.    SANITATION FACILITIES
The individual latrines with soak pits in areas where the ground water depth is within 10
m require a LEA because the possibility of ground water contamination has to be looked
into. This will require additional information and data (location specific features like
ground water table, aquifer characteristics and ground water movement etc) to come up
with suitable mitigative measures. Where as in areas where the ground water depth is
more than 1 Om the possibility of ground water contamination is less. Hence the impact of
these activities on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can be addressed by
standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative
measures is sufficient to take up the project.
The community open channel drainage system is mostly required in C, D and E category
areas. It may create foul odor, health risks and community conflicts. In order to address
these problems, site specific information is required for suggesting suitable mitigative
measures. Hence a LEA is required. Where as in case of subprojects located in category
A & B require an EIA as a detailed study is required to identify suitable mitigative
measures to minimise the impact. Some of the impacts can create serious environmental
and health problems that will be irreversible if not managed properly.
The compost pits must be allowed only in category C area as they can create serious
environmental and health problems. It requires an EIA because in some cases there might
be irreversible environmental damage due to the proposed activity. So an in depth study
is required to propose suitable mitigative measures.
9     SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Keeping in view the proposed activities, the quantity and characteristic of wastes (organic
and inorganic) generated and the population using the facility, the impact on the
surrounding environment will be marginal and can be addressed by standard mitigative
measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to
take up the project.
Page 25



EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
The construction of new waste disposal sites must be allowed only in category C areas as
they can create serious environmental, health problems and social conflicts. It requires an
EIA because in some cases there might be irreversible environmental damage due to the
proposed activity. So an in depth study is required to propose suitable mitigative
measures.
10    FLOOD/ EROSION PROTECTION BARRIERS
The impacts of structural barriers (dams, reservoirs, dikes etc) and non-structural barriers
(involving zoning, floodplain regulations) vary from each other. The project overall
would be beneficial as flooding recharges soil moisture and helps in preservation of
topsoil and nutrient enrichment. The activities related to the subproject would involve
only marginal impacts and can be addressed by standard mitigative measures, which are
sufficient to take up the project. Only in case of construction of new embankments with
height greater than 2 m in category A areas may require a LEA. As site specific
information like area that will get submerges and water-logging etc is required for
predicting the magnitude of impacts.
1-1    MINOR IRRIGATION
TUBE WELLS
In dark areas as there is over exploitation of the ground water and any additional pressure
on it must be very carefully analysed from the environmental point of view. It requires an
in depth study to avoid grave environmental problems. Hence an EIA is required.
Moreover these must be allowed only in Category C so that there is protect highly
sensitive and moderately sensitive areas from further exploitation of ground water.
In Grey areas suitable mitigative measures are to be suggested to prevent the region from
becoming a dark area. For this purpose site-specific information such as aquifer details,
ground water availability etc., is required. They must be allowed only in category C, and
E, to avoid conversion of forests to agricultural use. Hence a LEA needs to be carried out.
The sanction of new bore holes in category B areas must be avoided as far as possible. As
they may initiate series of impacts of which some be irreversible. Hence requires an EIA
for their sanctions.
Page 26



EPTRI                                             Environmental Assessment Report
In the case of white areas as the pressure on ground water is less the impact due to the
proposed activity on the environment will be marginal and can be addressed by standard
mitigative measures in category C and E areas. Hence for these ER with standard
mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the project in Category C and E. In case of
projects at category B will require an LEA as site specific data (like as aquifer details,
topography etc) are required to predict the impacts and suitable mitigative measures.
Where as in case of sanction of new bore holes in category A areas must be avoided as
far as possible. As they may initiate series of impacts of which some be irreversible.
Hence requiring an EIA.
CHECK DAMS, PONDS, LAKES AND PERCOLATION TANKS
REHABILITATION OF EXISTING STRUCTURES
Keeping in view the proposed activities in the subproject and the waste (organic and
inorganic) generated the impact on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can
be addressed by standard mitigative measures for sub projects located in categories C and
E. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the
project. Where as a LEA is required in case of sub projects located in Category B areas,
as it requires site specific information (like drainage pattern, and aquatic life etc).
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW STRUCTURES
In the case of construction of new ones LEA is required as the impacts due to the
proposed activities may have to be looked into from a broader perspective. Hence it may
require more information and data (location specific features like drainage pattern,
aquatic life, submergence area details etc) to come up with suitable mitigative measures.
They must be allowed only in category C and E to avoid conversion of forests to
agricultural use. . But in case of unavoidable circumstances an EIA study is required for
clearance of such subprojects in category B areas.

IRRIGATION CHANNEL
REHABILITATION OF EXISTING CHANNELS
Keeping in view the proposed activities in the subproject and the waste (organic and
inorganic) generated the impact on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can
be addressed by standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard
mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the project. They must be allowed only in
category C and E to avoid conversion of forests to agricultural use. Where as a LEA is
required in case of sub projects located in Category B areas, as it requires site specific
information (like drainage pattern, and aquatic life etc). But in case of unavoidable
circumstances an EIA study is required for clearance of such subprojects in category A
areas.
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW CHANNELS
In case of construction of new ones LEA is required as the impacts due to the proposed
activities may have to be looked into from a broader perspective. Hence it may require
more information and data (location specific features like drainage pattern, and aquatic
life etc) to come up with suitable mitigative measures. They must be allowed only in
category C and E areas to avoid conversion of forests or sensitive areas to agricultural
use. But in case of unavoidable circumstances an EIA study is required for clearance of
such subprojects in category B areas.
12    CROPS
IMPROVED FARM/CROP MANAGEMENT
GREY AND WHITE AREAS
The project includes new and improved techniques of farming so as to improve crop
varieties as well as management practices so that better yield is obtained in a limited area
of given land. The activity is environmentally beneficial but needs an ER so as to
maintain the improved condition on a long-term basis.
DARK AREA
It will require a LEA because the impacts due to the proposed activities (like suitability
of soil, increase in water uses and fertilizers etc) may have to be looked into from a
Page 28



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
broader perspective. Moreover location specific features (like drainage pattern, type of
soil, microenvironment and type of fertilizers used etc) are required to come up with
suitable mitigative measures. They must be allowed only in category C areas to avoid
conversion of forests or sensitive areas to agricultural use.
AGRICULTURE TOOL DEVELOPMENT
Keeping in view the type of agricultural tools developed and the number, the impact of
the proposed activity on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can be
addressed by standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard
mitigative measures is sufficient to take up the project. They must be allowed in category
B, C, D and E to minimise/discourage the use of forest and sensitive area resources like
(felling of trees or animal bones etc) for tool development.
13 HORTICULTURE
DARK AREA
An activity related with extraction of the ground water in dark areas must be evaluated
carefully to avoid the serious environmental problems (micro climatic changes eg
conversion to barren lands etc). Hence it requires a LEA as additional information and
data (location specific features like drainage pattern, ground water potential, quantity of
water required and type of fertilizers used etc) is required to come up with suitable
mitigative measures. They must be allowed only in category C and E areas to avoid
reduction of availability of water to habitats or conversion of sensitive areas for the above
purpose. It must be discouraged to take up such activities in category B areas. But in
unavoidable situation a detailed environmental analysis is requires to identify the possible
impacts of the proposed activity on the environment and to come up with suitable
mitigative measures. Hence an EIA is required
GREY AND WHITE AREAS
The impact of the activities involved with horticulture (like use of ground water or
surface etc) on the surrounding environment will be marginal and can be addressed by
standard mitigative measures. Hence an ER with suitable and standard mitigative
measures is sufficient to take up the project. They can be allowed in category B, C, D and
Page 29



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
E areas. The use of category A areas must be avoided to protect them from land cleaning
and encroachments. In unavoidable circumstances an EIA study must be carried for
taking a decision regarding clearance of the project.
14    ANIMAL HUSBANDRY
SHEEP REARING, DAIRY AND POULTRY FARM (stall fed)
The activities under the project are intended to support the livestock population providing
stall-feeding facilities to prevent grazing in the surrounding areas or encroaching into
core forest lands. The project will involve sheep rearing, dairy, poultry farming. The
impacts arising through these are negligible and can be undertaken with the help of an ER
with standard mitigative measures in cases of sub projects involving Dairy and sheep in
categories C, B & E areas and Poultry form in category C.
*A LEA is required for sub projects involving Poultry form in category B and sheep
rearing which are not stall-fed, as location specific information like water availability,
vegetation, demography and drainage pattem of the area is required for predicting the
impacts.
MANUAL SLAUGHTER HOUSES OF SMALL CAPACITIES
Waste disposal in manual slaughterhouses of small capacities being minimal, the impacts
arising through this are negligible and can be undertaken as per the suggested standard
mitigative measures through an ER in category C areas. Where as the ones proposed in
category B require site specific information like the water availability demography and
drainage pattem to identify the possible impacts (like the health risk surface water
contamination & odor nuisances) and suitable mitigative measures.
SLAUGHTER HOUSES OF GREATER CAPACITY/SEMI-
MECHANICAL/MECHANICAL
For the above project, waste disposal issues have to be considered in depth to avoid
health risks and contamination by seepage of wastes and therefore needs to be considered
for a LEA in category C areas. Where as a EIA is required in Category B areas.

1 5    SERICULTURE
Sericulture is a highly remunerative programme and therefore helps in increasing the
economic gains of the local population. It can also be supported in the conventional fields
along margins, along contours of less slopy areas, and in the form of terrace cultivation
along highly sloppy regions. The impacts due to the sericulture on environment are very
marginal, as all types of wastes such as waste from reeling units, double cocoons, silk
waste, pupae etc are put to use in some form or the other. The only problem that can be
foreseen is the use of dyes and wastes from dyes. Hence suitable standard mitigative
measures through an Environmental Review are sufficient to take up the project in
category C area. Where as LEA will be required in case of sub projects located in
category B areas, as site specific information (like water availability, drainage pattern etc)
is required to predict the possible impacts.
16    ENERGY
The sub projects in energy involve using of smokeless chulhas or fuel -efficient cooking
stoves. As these are environmentally beneficial but still need to be looked into regarding
Fuel wood resources, an Environmental Review with suitable measures would be
sufficient.
17 RESTOCKING OF COMMUNAL PONDS
These projects involve increase in fish production, than the normally available fish stock
by restocking them in the existing communal ponds. It is environmentally benign but
needs an ER to ensure proper management to avoid over dense fish population,
introduction of exotic species etc. which would lead to loss of productivity due to spread
of disease. A careful selection of species is therefore required.
18 PASTURE DEVELOPMENT / SOCIAL FORESTRY
The project has a number of positive impacts by way of planting of species for fodder,
fuel and fruit production to meet the needs of the inhabiting human and livestock
population. It can enhance slope stabilization, form shelter belts and act as wind breaks,
form live fences etc. and helps in increasing the soil fertility, moisture content and soil
nutrients. However, it needs an ER with standard mitigative measures in category areas
B and C. This is because care must be taken with regard to the choice of species for

specific purposes, suitable to the region taken up for the project. Also the activity is to be
restricted only to the buffer zones and should not be allowed to encroach the core forest
areas keeping in view the serenity of the habitat.

3.5 CONCLUSIONS
A comprehensive environmental screening procedure, which is simple and appropriate to
the size and nature of the subproject must be evolved and implemented. This should not
only look into the relevant environmental issues but must also help the decision-makers
in speedy clearance of the subproject proposals.
Keeping the above issues in view the present exercise is a first step to integrate the
environmental issues into project planning at an early stage. This will not only help the
policy planners and decision makers to foresee the environmental problems in advance
but also to evaluate the influence on the over all objective of the proposed mission.
By ignoring the environmental factors at the project initiation stage, project costs go up
due to additional environmental precautions and measures needed. For instance, instead
of proposing a tube well in the dark area where the ground water exploitation is high, a
rainwater collection pond or water shed management will be more feasible and may lead
towards sustainable development by recharging the groundwater aquifer.
Moreover there are two main reasons why environmental development planning has
given great importance to the issue of the interrelationship between development and
environment. The first is that the destructive effect on environment has negative
repercussions on development itself. The second is that adequate considerations of
natural resources and the environment development strategies, plans and policies
constitute rich source of opportunities for improved social and economic development,
while mitigating the effects of the proposed subproject activity.

CHAPTER 4 - ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE AND DATA
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT IN
AP-DPIP
The district Poverty Initiative project (AP-DPIP) aimed to improve the standard of living
of the poor has been evolved out of the experience draw upon from the past and on-going
social fund projects like UNDP's South Asia poverty Alleviation program (SAPAP) etc.
The activities to be financed under this project would be demand driven and community-
based. These projects will be targeted to mobilise poor rural community to seek
fulfillment of felt needs and to improve their access to services provided by the public
institutions.
The comprehensive administrative structure for APDPIP projects has be addressed in
detail in the Institutions and Implementation arrangements chapter
Of Institutional capacity building report. This chapter addresses the administrative
structure requirements for environmental management of the AP-DPIP.
4.1   INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS PROPOSED FOR THE PROJECT
In accordance with the proposed institutional arrangements agreed with GOAP, a district
level autonomous society dealing directly with the CIGs will be established. The
management structure proposed for the AP-DPIP project consists of 5 levels
1) State Steering Committee
2) State Project Management Unit (SPMU)
3) District society for poverty Alleviation
a) Governing council
d) District Project Management Unit (DPMU)
4) Mandal Community Support Cells (MCSC)
5) Common Interest Groups (CIG) / Community Facilitators (CF).
The key elements of the institutional arrangements for Environmental management of the
AP-DPIP is designed keeping the above management structure and sequences of
Page 35



EPTRI                                            Environmental Assessment Report
activities involved in formulation, implementation and monitoring & evaluation of the
sub projects. The sequences of activities is illustrated below
1) Need for the project is felt and identified by CIGs in consultation with the
Community facilitator (CF).
2) The CF will help the CIGs in formulating the project proposal and filling up the
required application forms.
3) CF will screen the sub projects using the Location Sensitivity Checklist (LSC) and
Generic Checklist (GC) included in the Environmental Assessment Report (EAR). In
most cases, it is expected that the checklists will indicate that only an Environmental
Review (ER) is required, which will also be conducted by the CFs using the
Environmental Review Guidelines (ERG) included in the EAR.
4) The CF will submit the completed screening checklists and relevant sections of the
ERG to the District Project Management Unit (DPMU) as part of the subproject
proposal.
5) The DPMU staff will review the completed LSA, GC and if submitted the ERG.
6) If the screening checklists indicate that a Limited Environmental Assessment (LEA)
is required, then DPMW staff will be responsible for contracting approved
environmental consultants.
7) The list of approved environmental consultants will be prepared by the
Environmental Agency (EA) to be appointed by the State Project Management Unit
(SPMU). Environmental consultant will follow the Limited Environmental
Assessment Guidelines (LEAG) included in the EAR for caring out the study.
8) In the few cases that the screening checklists indicate that a full Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) is required, if the subproject costs less than Rs. 10 lakh, the
DPMU will request an estimate of the EIA cost from the EA. If the subproject
requiring an EIA costs more than Rs. 10 lakh, the DPMU will refer the subproject to
the SPMU's subproject appraisal expert, who will request an estimate of the cost from
EA.
9) For subprojects costing less than Rs. 10 lakh, if the estimate of the EIA cost exceeds
20% of the total subproject cost, the proposal will not be approved. If the EIA cost
Page 36



EPTRI                                           Environmental Assessment Report
estimate is less than 20% of the total cost, then subproject preparation may continue
at the DPMU's discretion.
10) For subprojects costing more than Rs. 10 lakh, the SPMU subproject appraisal expert
will decide whether to approve further processing of the subproject proposal based on
a comparison of the EIA costs and expected economic benefits.
11) In the unusual case that a subproject requiring an EIA is approved, it will be
undertaken by the EA under separate contracts with the DPMU or SPMU.
12) In accordance with the finding of the EIA study, the DPMU or SPMU subproject
appraisal expert will decide on the funding of the subproject.
13) The environmental agency shall carryout monitoring and supervision of the project as
per the guidelines given in chapter on Monitoring and supervision.
For carrying out the above activities related to environmental issue the administrative
structure proposed is shown in the figure below & table 3.

4.2 DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The APDPIP project is proposed to be initially implemented in three districts with a
project cost of RS 6000 millions to be spread over a period of five years. The number of
sub projects that shall be funded will be around 2000 to 5000. These sub projects will be
spread over 10 to 15 mandals of each district over a period of five years. From the
generic checklist it can be seen that there are about 17 category of sub-projects with each
category being again subdivided.
Page 38



EPTRI                                          Environmental Assessment Report
The process of environmental information collection and status of project with respect to
environmental issues related to it has to be maintained effectively for initiating prompt
action and effective implementation of the project. Moreover to speed up the process of
environmental clearances and reduce delays, an effective data documentation system that
is easy to handle with in-built warning system to identify and reduce delays and easy to
transfer information among different units must be setup.
Number of sub-projects that shall be funded are in thousands and these will be
1) Spread over five years
2) Will be implemented in different mandals of the districts, being handed by different
individuals at different stages of the project.
3) The sub projects shall be in different categories requiring environmental inputs from
different units of APDPIP and external agencies.
In the above context it becomes very difficult for manual maintenances of environmental
status of all projects by the available staff. Hence for prompt handling of environmental
issues and systematic documentation a user friendly computer documentation system is
required.
The proposed Environmental Information Documentation System (EIDS) shall contain
following modules
a) Status of environmental clearance procedure (Environmental issues)
b) Status of environmental activities and responsibilities in ongoing projects
c) Information on completed project and environmental reports
As the environmental information related to the projects will be maintained at the DPMW
level hence the EIDS shall be installed and maintained at DPMU. The Environmental
Officer and Computer operator at DPMU shall input the required information and down
load the information required as per their requirements.
EIDS can be integrated with the overall project management system software.
The Project Coordinator, Senior Environmental Officer and Computer operator at SPMU
and Project Directors, Environmental Officer and Computer operator at SPMU will be

trained in Data Entry and Operation of the Environmental Information Documentation
System.
The Environmental Information Documentation System shall be developed using Oracle
and Visual Basic packages on NT Platform. The end uses ( DPIP staff) need not know the
above packages for using the EIDS.
4.2.1 COST
The cost for development of Environmental Information Documentation System Package
shall be RS 6,00,000 (six Lakhs only) . The breakup for the above amount is given below
1) Development of Environmental Information            4,00,000

CHAPTER 5- ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY BUILDING STRATEGY
FOR APDPIP
Sustainable development essentially meant development of the present generation without
affecting the posterity. It encompasses development of two important aspects viz.,
development of people and that of environment. Thus it is pertinent to take precautions that
environment is also improved while addressing the improvement of the socio-economic well
being of the people. It thus necessitates equipping people to take care of their environment
while improving their social and economic environment. Since the APDPIP project is
basically a social fund project aiming at people's involvement in their own development, the
target group for training in environment also basically hails from the same section of the
society. Apart from them, the authorities who screen the proposals for social fund projects at
various levels and thus facilitate development also need to be aware of the environmental
dimension of development.
One of the principal tasks of the Environmental Agency appointed by the SPMU will be to
provide adequate training to allow the CFs, DPMU and SPMU staff, and approved
environmental consultants to fulfill their environmental responsibilities. To meet this goal, it
was agreed that the EA should prepare four training Modules, to be given on demand as
requested by the SPMU. These Modules shall be prepared in close consultation with the
SPMU training expert. The four training courses are
1. Environmental Awareness Raising for DPIP Beneficiaries
2. Basic Environmental Screening and Mitigation for Community Facilitators
3. Environmental Screening and Mitigation for DPMU and SPMU Staff
4. Limited Environmental Assessment for Environmental Consultants
5.1   ENVIRONMENTAL CAPACITY BUILDING MODULES
COURSE 1: ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS RAISING FOR DPIP BENEFICIARIES
Ultimately, the prevention of environmental damage and promotion of environmental
improvements under the DPIP will depend on the enthusiasm and understanding of the
Page 45



EPTRI                                         Assessment of environmental criteria
subproject beneficiaries. Enviromnental awareness raising modules shall help in wider DPIP
grass-roots publicity and information effort.
Course content
These modules shall highlight the need for environmental protection, and promote activities
for enviromnental improvement that may be supported by the DPIP. The use of creative
mechanisms for grass-roots communication, such as theatre, will be considered with the
guidance of the SPMU and DPMU training expert.
Total course duration
Enviromnental awareness raising will be integrated into the public awareness programme of
the DPIP. Considering that, each district has at least 10 mandals where the sub-projects shall
be taken up, there are a total of 30 (3xIO) mandals in the 3 districts where the project is
proposed.
The course shall be of half-day duration with 50 participants per batch. The course shall be
conducted for 3 days per mandal (that is six batches per mandal).
The total duration of the course for 30 mandals shall be 90 days.
Location
Since the community is large in number, it is better to organise this course in respective
mandal headquarters.
Cost of training
The cost for carrying out Course I shall be RS 60,000 (sixty thousand only) per Mandal that
is RS 20,000 ( Twenty thousand per day). The total cost for 90 days training programme shall
be 18,00,000 /- (eighteen Lakhs 50 thousand only).
Course II: BASIC ENVIRONMENTAL SCREENING AND MITIGATION FOR
COMMUNITY FACILITATORS
To enable the CFs to effectively apply the LSC, GC and ERG, the Environmental agency
shall prepare and deliver courses on Basic Environmental Screening and Mitigation. In this

Considering that, each mandal has at least 25 villages, there are a total of 250 (25xIO)
villages in each district. There will be at least 4 community volunteers / facilitators per
village who would be coordinating the proposals for sub projects. Hence there will be 100
CFs / CV per mandal and 1000 (lOOx 0) from each district.
The course shall be of one-day duration with 20 participants per batch. The course shall be
conducted for 5 days per mandal (that is five batches per mandal).
The total duration of the course for 30 mandals shall be 150 days.
Depending on demand, these courses shall either be given at the district or mandal level.
The total course duration will be 150 days (50 day per district in 3 districts)

CHAPTER 6 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING, SUPERVISION &
AUDITING
To ensure that the Enviromnental management Frame work is effectively implemented, and
remains responsive to the environmental conditions prevailing in DPIP areas, responsibilities
should be assigned for environmental supervision, monitoring and auditing.
6.1 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
It will be a responsibility of the EA to remain abreast of changing environmental conditions
and emerging environmental concerns in DPIP areas. This will not be achieved through the
collection of primary data, but rather through monitoring information collected and provided
by other GoAP and civil society sources. On the basis of this information, the EA will
recommend revisions to the EMF, and highlight local concerns to DPMUs. Details of
changing conditions, emerging concerns, recommended revisions and local issues will be
included in the six-monthly supervision reports provided to the Director of SPMIU.
The cost for collection of data and preparation of status report is Rs 1,75,000 per district.
6.2 ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISION
Supervision of EMF implementation will be conducted at two levels. At the district level, as
part of their overall supervisory responsibilities, the DPIP staff will be required to verify that
CFs are correctly using the LSC, GC and ERG, and that the environmental mitigation
measures included in the approved subproject proposal are implemented. This verification
will be conducted for the same sample of subprojects as used by the DPMUs for other
supervisory requirements, and the results will be included in their overall supervision reports
provided to the SPMU. These supervision reports will be submitted for review of EMF
implementation by the EA.
At the state level, the EA will conduct six-monthly supervisions of EMF implementation,
selecting a representative sample of ER, LEA and EIA category subprojects. The sub-projects
shall be selected randomly at the rate of 20 projects per year per district (about 12 ER, 6 LEA
and 2 EIA).
Page 51



EPTRI                                         Assessment of environmental criteria
The duration of supervision exercise shall be 10 days per district and the activities that shall
be carried out as listed below
1) The EA shall verify whether the screening process was correctly applied, suitable
mitigation measures specified, and these measures were correctly implemented.
Two environmental experts shall visit the district for 5 days and under take the above work.
2) The EA shall prepare supervision report, addressing the following
a) Application of the EMF in the sample
b) Implementation of environmental mitigation measures in the sample

3) Submit the supervision report to the Director of SPMU
The cost of carrying out the above supervision study shall be Rs 1,50,000 per district.
6.3 ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING
To provide an assessment of whether the effectiveness of the design and implementation of
the EMF, the Director of the SPMU will contract an environmental audit of the DPIP once
every two years, to be conducted by an external civil society organization. The principal
focus of the audit will be to assess the extent to which the EMF has lead to the
implementation of appropriate environmental mitigation measures in DPIP subprojects, and
has promoted the implementation of environmentally beneficial subprojects. A secondary
goal of the audit will be to attempt an assessment of the extent to which the DPIP may have
led to improvement or deterioration in environmental quality.
6.3.1 At sub project level
It is recommended that the environmental auditing agency must review 5-10% of subprojects
requiring an ER, 10 - 20% of all subprojects requiring a LEA, and all subprojects requiring an
EIA. The Environmental Audit should include an assessment of:
* the screening category attributed to a particular subproject is correct;
* expected impacts and recommended mitigation measures are correctly indicated as
mentioned in the E R or LEA;
* proposed mitigation measures are carried out as planned;
* the subproject has been imnplemented according to design;

no unexpected environmental impacts have surfaced, which have not been reported to the
State APDPIP Environment Unit.
Depending on the results of the above assessment the audit must rate the environmental
performance in accordance to World Bank (1 996a) criteria as described below in Box 1.
Box 1 - Environmental performance rating
1  Highly satisfactory  Environmental components are being implemented in a
timely and satisfactory manner.
2  Satisfactory          Implementation of the critical aspects of the environmental
components is proceeding in a timely and satisfactory
manner. There are some problems with certain other aspects,
but these are not undermining the progress of implementing
the components and are being addressed by the
implementing agency.
3  Unsatisfactory        There are major problems in implementing some or all of
the environmental components of the subproject, including
aspects critical to the success of the components and the
subproject as a whole. However, appropriate measures are
being takeri by the implementing agency to address the
problems. Or problems are not being addressed properly
6.3.2 Environmental out come of DPIP
The cumulative impact of large number of subprojects being taken up should be examined to
attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMF system. The table 6 list the
suggested parameters for auditing of environmental out come of DPIP.
