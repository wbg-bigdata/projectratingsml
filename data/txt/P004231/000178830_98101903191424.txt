REPORT AND RECOM1NENDATIONJ OF THE PREST-ET TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON1 A PROPOSED LOWiN TO THE MAIAYTN RAILWAY
ADMTIISTRATION FOR Il RAILTWJAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Malayan Railway Administration with the guarantee of the Govern-
ment of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$16 million to help finance part
of the Malayan Railway's modernization program during the Second Mlalaysia
Plan (1971-75). The loan would have a term of 25 years, includin-g 5 years
of grace, with interest at 714 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The proposed loan would be the Bankts seventeenth to Malaysia,
its second in transportation and its first for railways. The first 'Urans-
port loan was made for reconstruction and mcdernization of ports in Sabah
(Loan 774-Mm of June 1971).
3.        Other loans have bee-n for projects in agriculture, forestry,
industrial finance, power, water supply, education and teleccmmunications.
The execution of these projects has been satisfactory.
4.        Although the Muda project is almost completed and doub'le cropping
has been successfully introduced on part of the project area, the Closing
Date for Loan 434-lvA (Muda Irrigation) has been posL-poned to allow- for some
correctional work on canal embankments and river control below the dam which
will significantly improve the ef'fectiveness of the project.
5.        The main features of the Kemubu irrigation project (Loan 500-MA)
have been substantially completed and double cropping on about two-thirds of
the project area is expected to start in March 1972. Hiow-fever, due to delays
caused mainly by the floods early this year, it is not expected that all of
the qutatGrnary oanals pumping stations and road surfacing on canal banks can
be completed until early 1973. The present Closing Date of June 30, 1972
may therefore have to be postponed by 18 months to December 31, 1973.
6.        As of September 30, 1971 the loans to Malaysia held by the Bank
amounted to US$267 million. In addition, the Bank made a loan in 1965 to
the Public Utilities Board of Sin-apore (Loan 405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia,
to finance the Johore River Water project: the amount due to the Bank is
US$5.7 Tdllion. For a summary of Dank loans and IFC inves-tments in Malaysia
see Annex 1.
PART II - THE ECONO1MY
7.        An economic report, dated May 17, 1971 (EAP 23a) was circulated
to the Executive Directors on June 4, 1971 and was summarized in my Report
on Loan 774-MA (Second Telecommunicauions Project Report No. P-952). No
major changes in the economy have taken place since that time. An economic
mission is currently in Malaysia and upon its return will be preparing a
report.  The following paragraphs touch on the main features of the Mlalaysian
economy.



- 2 -
8.        The current state of the Malaysian economy is paradoxically, one
of satisfactory economic growth and financial stability in spite of la-fging
private and public investment and gradually rising unenployment, bothl of
which cause concerni about its long;-tern growth prospects. Despite sluggish
investment, the economy is buoyed by rising ouuput fromu heavy investments
in the early 1960's, especially in the planting and replanting of rubber
and oil palm, uhich have lon,) gestation periods, and in the exploitation
of forests. Continuing the trend of the early 1960's, real GX? increased
at about 6 peircent par year between 1i65 ana 1971C.
S.        A major economic policy objective for the future is thLus to raise
substantially the level of investment, not only in order to maintain the
growth of income and employmlent in the immediate future, but, more importantly,
to lay the basis for rapid economic eypansiLon in the long, run. This objecti-ve
calls for the strengthening of aoricultural and industrial policies to induce
larg,er private investment, as well as larger public investmeint than in the
recenLt past. This will not be easy to do since tne plannin- and implementa-
tion capacity of tihe Government is already be-ng strained by the shortage of
technical and othe-r especially skilled personnel. The situation coluld,
however, improve in two to three years, when ef'forts initiated by the Govern-
men-l during the pzast five years to improve sd expand technical and vocational
education begin bearing fruit.
10.       Lack of firnds does not seem to be the primary obstacle. Horwever,
this coeld becomz.e a problem if the Governmcnt snoceeded in improving its
implena-itation capacity and in raising the level of investment, resulting
in a more rapid exoansion of the economy and hence ir1port demaind. The debt
service ratio is low at 3 percent and is expected to remain below 5 percent
in the rest of the 1970's. Malaysia is thus creditworthy for substantial
external borrowings on conventional terms.
The Bank's Role
21.       -A major problem in the imrplementation of the Second Malaysia Plan
is, as has been noted, the lack of capacity in tihe public sector to prepare
and implement investnent projects. The Bank has, however, played a role,
and plans to continue to do so, by including technical assistance in its
lendin, and by acting as Executing Agency for JNDP>-financed projects. For
exaaple, the Bank has recently agreed to act as Zxecuting Agency for a
1nTDP-financed study for the regional development of Klana Valley. The
objectives of the Klang Valley study are (a) to improve and coordinate
plann:in. within the region; (b) to increase the Government's effectiveness
in implementing its plans; and (c) to identify specific high priority projects
for feasibility studies and investment.
12.       YIalaysia's public investment program consists to a large extent of
projects which for a variety of reasons often are unattractive for external
lenders. This is particularly true in education, agriculture and transporta-
tion. The Bank will continue to concentrate its lending on sectors and projects
which are not likely to attract commercial financing but which could benefit



from the Bank's help in project preparation and in strengthening the
responsible public agencies. These policies are reflected in the loans
which I hope to brin:; before you in the next year or so, including two
before the end of the current fiscal year, one for education and the
other for an urban highway near Kuala Lumpur.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PRBJBT
13.       During the First and Second Malaya-: Plans (1956-60 and 1961-65)
about 25 percent of total public investment was devoted to transport, i.e.
1M$0.8 billion out of a total investment of M$3.2 billion. Of this, about
two-thirds 'ias for roads and bridges. This, and the fact that West Malaysia,
upon i' Js independence, inherited a -well maintained railroad tas resulted in
a reasonably well developed transport net-mork.
14.       In the First Malaysia Plan (1966-70) the Government deliberately
limited further expenditure on the transport sector because it felt the need
for a comprehensive assessment of priorities for investment in transport
before making major new conmitments. A general transport survey, was
carried out in 1967169, financed by UiDP, with the Bank as Executing
Agency. This recommended that transport policy should concentrate on
measures to increase efficiency rather than major extensions of the net-
work. The Government adopted this policy in the Second Malaysia Plan
(1971-75) and in West Malaysia priority is given to improvement of exist-
ing r1ail-w,ays and highways. The iblayan Railway Development Program
(1971-75), part of which would be financed by the loan now proposed, is
one of the high priority investment programns reconmended by the General
Transport Survey.
15.       The Malayan Railway Adninistration (MR) is a Government-owned
statutory authority. The General Manager is responsible to the Ministry
of Transport and is assisted by a ten-man Railieray Board acting in an
advisory capacity.  MR is reasonably well managed and its operating
standards have steadily improved. The basic system, which runs north
and south astride the central mountain range from the Thai border to
Singapore, was established when Singapore wnas the main port of the
peninsula (see map). With the separation of Singapore from Malaysia,
Port Swettenham on the west coast has increasingly become the main port
for the trade and commerce of West Malaysia. At the same tine, population
and economic activity have increasingly concentrated to the west of the
central mountain range, particularly around Kuala Lumpur, which is only
27 miles frcm Port Swettenham. Both factors have caused traffic patterns
particularly for short-haul traffic to change in favor of road transport,
somewJhat to the disadvantage of the rail-way.  Intermodal cost comparisons
reveal that the railway remains the most economic mode of transport over
mediimn and long distances for a great bulk of West Malaysia's agricultural,
I/ Eefore Malaysia was forTred.



forestry and mining production.  In order to sustain the growth of the
eccnomy and to move the produce frbm the extensive land development schemes
now.v being developed or planned by the Government, it is essential that
the railway be adequately maintained and modernized. In face of chan-ging
patterns of traffic and severe competition from road traffic Ha has
adopted marginal cost pricing and reduced rates.  Increased productivity
and reductions in operating costs could not, however, offset the loss
of revenues resulting from loss of traffic and the reduction in rates that
it has had to grant. Consequently, si.nce 1963 Nfl has incurred substantial
financial deficits.
16.       The Nalayan Railway Development Plan (1971-75) is aimed at
enabl-ing MR to continue to play its role in the national economy and at
the same tine achieve financial viability, which is essentially a ratter
of increasing productivity. The principal means for achieving that is
complete dieselization. MR, therefore, intends to replace as part of its
Development Plan about 90 steam loconotives with h0 diesel locomotives.
Finance for the locomotivees has already been secured under bilateral aid
and a suppliers' credit, both from, the U.K. All of the locomotives have
already been ordered and their delivery is expected to be ccmpleted in
1972. 
17.       To secure mnaximrum benefits fromr dieselization, however, the
in1estaent in diesel locomotives will Lhve to be accomparied by supple-
mentary investaients in such items as the acquisition and modernization of
rolling stock, realirinment of track and modernization of workshops. The
proposed Bank loan will help finance these investments.
18.       The total cost of the Plan (1971-75) is estimated at about
US$43.S5 million equivalent, with an estimated foreign exchange component
of about US$533 million, concentrated larg,ely in the first three years of
the Plan on items for which the justification has been definitely established
and firm cost estimates are available.  Investment durirng thie last two years
of the Plan, except renewal of 6C miles of track on the West Mlain Li.ne for
which plans are already firm, is subject co review. Total investment during
the last two years is not expected to exceed US$6 million equivalent. Annual
expenditure under the five-year Plan is summarized in Annex III.
19.       The proposed project consists of the equipment to be procured and
works to be undertaker. turing the years 1972-73, i.e., acquisition of diesel
locomotives and freight cars, strengthening of couplers, modernization of
rail cars, realignment of the Port Dickson line, track renew-eal and w-orksbop
modernization, and studies to improve cost accounting and operational
efficiency.  Including contingencies, the total cost of the project is
estimated at US$23 mXillion equivalent, with - foreign exchange component
of about US$18 million equivalent.
20.       Of the US$18 million foreign exchange cost, US$3.1 million will
be provided by the balance of the U.K. financing already arranged for the
purchaase of diesel locomotives, US$0.2 million from Canada for technical



assistance (see para. 21below), and UIS$0.2 million by the Federal Govern-
ment to cover the costs of a trainin,g progran already in progress.  The
remaining US$145. million would be covered by the proposed Bank loan, which
would also finance US$1.5 million of interest and other charges on the loan
during construction, to help the railway through a period of financial
difficulty which is likely to continue until the fall benefits from the
investment can be realized. The local costs of the project will be financed
from MR's internal cash generation and loans from the Federal Gcvernment
(see Annex III for a summary of the financing plan).
21.       The General Transport Survey pointed out some weaknesses in the
management and administration of the railway. Most of these have since been
overcome.  However, some improvements are still needed and during negotia-
tions certain institutional refonns were agreed upon.  ER undertook (i) to
strengthen its planninr unit and make it more effective by the end of 1972;
(ii) to introduce a modern accounting system and appropriate traffic costing
procedures by the end of 1973; (iii) to reduce by attrition or redeployment
staff that might become redandant as a result of modernization. Canarla is
expected to provide funds for training staff in costing, marketing, planning
and modernizing the accounting system. In addition, the Government has
applied for UNDP technical assistance to send abroad three of its staff
who would run MR's planning unit for training in economics and planning.
22.       Although the existing route of the railway was laid out at a time
when Singapore was the principal port of Malaya and is no longer ideally
suited to the needs of West Malaysia in its present form, with Port Swetten-
ham as the m.ajor port for Malaysia's commerce, it still enjoys a compara-
tive advanta7e over other modes of transport in carrying bulk traffic over
medium and lon!- distances. The proposed project wSill enable the railway
to continue its important role in the economy and at the same time enable
MR, despite the disadvantages it faces, to overcome its financial probleas.
MR should be able to break even in 1973 and achieve by 1975 and thereafter
an annual rate of return of not less than 2% on its net fixed assets in
operation.  The economic rate of return on the incremental investment
proposed is estimated at about 20%.
PAlRT IV - LEGAL DISTRUIMIENTS ;rFD AUTHORITY
23.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Malayan
Railway Administration, the draft Guarantee Agreement betw19een Malaysia
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
