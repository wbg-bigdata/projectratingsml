MEXICO
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
I. PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos, S.A.
(BANOBRAS)
Guarantor:        United Mexican States
Project
Executing
Agency   :        Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT)
Amount:           US$200 million, including a capitalized front-end fee of
approximately US$500,000.
Terms:            Repayment in 15 years, including three years of grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project          The proposed project is a part of SCT's 1984-1986 highway
Description:    program.  The program components supported by the loan are:
(i) construction, reconstruction and expansion of national
and toll roads and bridges and urban bypasses;
(ii) rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of rural
roads; and (iii) consultants' services.   The project
will help to: (i) improve seriously congested
sections of the national network, upgrade substandard
pavements and extend the road network to developing areas;
(ii) strengthen the planning and execution of rural roads
periodic maintenance and determine appropriate budgetary
allocations; (iii) strengthen the newly organized SCT
Planning Directorate for all modes; and (iv) facilitate a
dialogue on land transport pricing and road freight
regulatory policies.
Beneficiaries:   Because of the geographic dispersion of the investment
program, project benefits will accrue to the economy at
large in the form of vehicle operating cost and time
savings. While the benefits will initially accrue to road
users, it is expected that such benefits will subsequently
be broadly distributed to consumers through improved
transport costs and service levels. The technical
cooperation component will provide significant support to
improving the general planning capabilities of the newly
organized SCT.
Risks:            Although a prolongation of the economic recession could
reduce sectoral investment levels below those assumed for
this project, the flexible format of the sector loan and the
setting of the loan amount at a relatively small percentage
of the projected investment budget should minimize the risk



- 2 -
of delay in project execution. For the rural roads
component, potential monitoring difficulties have been
minimized by concentrating financing within a limited number
of states. Finally, future progress on policy issues such
as land transport pricing may face political resistance.
The lending program for the sector has been timed to permit
progressive monitoring and assistance on such issues.
Estimated Cost:  The total cost of the SCT highway investment program for
1984-1986 is estimated at US$1.6 billion equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$541 million equivalent.
The Bank loan represents 12% of the total program and 37% of
the foreign exchange requirements.

Rate of Return:  Highway subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan
would be appraised according to agreed technical and
economic criteria and would have a minimum rate of return of
12%. Rural road periodic maintenance subprojects would be
approved based on a technical evaluation of road condition,
population served and traffic.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. General Background
2.01      The accelerated development generated by the oil boom in the late
1970s resulted in unprecedented growth in transport demand and revealed
serious deficiencies in transport operations and infrastructure affecting
international trade between 1978 and 1982. Prior to that period, transport
had declined as a percentage of public sector investment from 21% in 1972 to
under 10% less than a decade later. The Government responded to the new
demand by increasing real investment in the railways by 173%, ports by
ten-fold and highways by 86% between 1978 and 1981 (Table 2.1). The
budgetary restrictions which accompanied the economic crisis in 1982 and
1983, however, resulted in reducing transport investment to 1979 levels,
postponing major investments which were not near completion and focusing upon
maintenance and rehabilitation. The lull in transport demand caused by the
economic situation has given the Government some leeway, in terms of timing,
to reorder its transport priorities, but critical investment decisions will
have to be made within the next few years in order to serve any economic
recovery effectively. The Second Highway Sector Project is the initial
element in a comprehensive lending strategy for the transport sector which is
designed to provide assistance in meeting the immediate financial needs of
the sector, as well as to help in developing medium- and long-term investment
programs and policies for the sector. Because of prior transport lending
operations to Mexico, the discussion of the sector in this Chapter focuses
upon transport development during the past administration and the major
issues which face the present administration.
B. Transport Development and the Economy
2.02      Mexico has developed an extensive transport network which comprises
over 200,000 km of roads (including 67,000 km of paved and over 80,000 km of
rural roads with the rest being state and local unpaved roads); about 20,000
km of railways (all except 500 km being standard gauge); some 30 ports, of
which 13 serve international traffic; about 50 airports capable of handling
medium or larger size aircraft; and over 20,000 km of crude oil, refined
products and gas pipelines. From 1972 to 1982, traffic on the nation's roads
grew by about 10% annually with road traffic representing an estimated 48% of
total traffic in ton-km and over 90% in passenger-km. Railway freight
traffic, representing about 14% of total ton-km, experienced a growth of 7%
annually. Even more significant growth rates were registered by coastal
shipping and pipelines, with annual growth rates of between 13% and 15% in
ton-km because of increased oil production, resulting in an estimated 15% and
21% share respectively of all ton-km in 1982. After only limited growth
prior to 1977, the ports registered average annual increases of almost 17% in
cargo tons handled from 1977 to 1982. In passenger transport, domestic
aviation traffic increased by over 17% annually, with total passenger-km
generally equal to that of the railways.



- 4 -
2.03      During the 1960s and early 1970s, substantial amounts were invested
in transport, particularly roads, railways and aviation. The transport
sector was receiving about 20% 1/ of all public investment. The network was
generally in place at that time and was considered sufficient to meet
expected demand. The sector, therefore, did not pose a constraint to
economic growth.2/ Emphasis was placed on operational improvements and
pricing and on using transport investment to foster decentralization and the
development of outlying areas. As a consequence, the sector's share of
public investment declined from 21% in 1972 to 9% 3/ in the early 1980s. In
1977 and 1978, transport experienced real reductions in investment levels as
other sectoral priorities prevailed.
2.04      This investment policy, however, proved to be untenable with the
surge in economic activity in the late 1970s. Between 1978 and 1981, serious
bottlenecks emerged, clearly affecting the operation of basic industries and
the conduct of international trade. Transport problems were evident with
respect to the importation of basic grain and the movement of iron ore and
pellets to the steel industry. The problem centered on the railways and the
ports. In addition to the increase in general economic activity in 1980 and
1981, the poor local grain harvest led to the importation of 7 million tons
in each of those years, double the average of the previous five years. The
bottlenecks at the ports and on the railways were costly.
2.05      It was evident that the transport network was unable to cope with
the accelerated growth and that, even with operational improvements, capacity
restrictions would continue to be severe. The industrial ports program was
one of the proposed investment solutions. Although conceived mainly as a
means to decentralize industrial activity, it would also be expected to
resolve port capacity problems for containerized and general cargo and many
bulk commodities. It was initiated in 1979, and investments grew quickly
thereafter. The railways were also targeted for improvements, and real
investments, primarily related to track improvements where capacity
bott:Lenecks were occurring, increased by 62% in 1979, 37% in 1980 and another
23% in 1981. Except for a one-year increase in 1981 covering various types
of projects, the roads' budget was maintained at a relatively constant
level. By 1981, roads' share of transport investment declined from 68% in
1972 to 51%, compared with rails' share rising from 15% to 30% during the
same period, and ports' share increasing from 8% to 15%. Major airport
construction and reconstruction outside of Mexico City were also carried out
between 1979 and 1981.   Although there were instances of premature
investment and some works suffered from poor programing, the overall response
of the Government to the situation in those years was appropriate.

- 5 -
2.06      The budgetary restrictions which accompanied the economic
recessions in 1982 and 1983 again shifted the emphasis in the transport
investment program. Transport investment was reduced in real terms to about
US$1 billion, roughly equivalent to 1979 levels. This reduction, however,
was not as great as the reduction in the overall public investment program,
leaving transport with an increase from a 9% to an 11% share (excluding urban
transport), the apparent rationale being the ability of the sector to quickly
generate short-term productive employment during this critical period of
economic contraction. The approved investment budget thus focuses on
maintenance and reconstruction of existing infrastructure and on the
completion of ongoing construction at minimum cost, deferring the initiation
or continuation of major investments such as the full-scale industrial ports
program, railway electrification and new rail line construction.
2.07      The lull in transport demand caused by the economic situation is
giving the Government some time to reorder its transport investment
priorities. In 1982, rail traffic fell by 12% and the ports registered
declines of 25% at Tampico and 19% at Veracruz. Highway authorities are
reporting traffic declines of 10-15% in 1983. Industries which experienced
transport bottlenecks in the past do not anticipate difficulties in the near
future. In addition to the limited traffic, this improved situation can be
attributed to the investments carried out in 1979-1981, particularly with
regard to rail track improvements (Mexico City-Veracruz) and the acquisition
of rolling stock and locomotives.
2.08      The 1984 budget basically represents a holding strategy with no
major new investments. The Government', in establishing its six-year plan,
must still face major decisions concerning the deferred large transport
investments. The rail infrastructure investment program is expected to
receive a full economic and technical review in preparation for the proposed
Railway Sector Project, particularly to determine priorities between new
projects such as a new line between Guadalajara and Monterrey, the coastal
line between Tampico and Veracruz and various major rail yards. The Mexico
City-Queretaro electrification, because of prior commitments, cannot be
delayed further and will require substantial budgetary allocations between
1984 and 1987. For the ports, the major decision will be to determine what
further investments are justified at Lazaro Cardenas and Altamira (with
assistance to be provided under proposed Bank-financed port projects) and to
establish the timing of the remainder of the industrial ports program and
industrial decentralization. In the roads subsector, Mexico faces a
significant backlog of modernization (widening) works on the trunk network,
particularly on the toll roads. In addition, capacity limitation problems at
Mexico City Airport would require substantial investments. Most of these
decisions will depend upon the expected timing and structure of the economic
recovery, the projected level of import substitution and its impact upon
grain imports and related transport facilities, the transport requirements of
non-traditional exports, and the prospects for industrial decentralization
and urban deconcentration efforts.
C. Institutional Framework and Planning
2.09      The first major positive action affecting transport taken by
the current administration was the incorporation of all transport modal
agencies under the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT). Prior



- 6 -
to this incorporation, port and railway investments, as well as all transport
tariff and regulatory policy, were handled by SCT, while highway and airport
development was under the jurisdiction of the Secretariat for Human
Settlement and Public Works (SAHOP). This dispersed institutional
arrangement hampered efforts at coordinated planning and investment and
limited Bank dialogue on cross-modal issues. Under the new organization
(Chart 25805), there is a Subsecretary for Infrastructure with responsibility
for road, rail, port and airport infrastructure development and a
Subsecretary for Operations with responsibility for operational, regulatory
and tariff matters for all modes. There is a Directorate General for
Planning which reports directly to the Secretary.
2.10      SCT is presently reorganizing the Directorate General for Planning
and the other modal planning offices within the Subsecretariats for
Infrastructure and Operations. Once fully implemented, it is expected that
planning units in the various modal directorates will be responsible for
identifying and proposing capital investments and will provide the technical
details required for the analysis of such investments. The Directorate
General for Planning will have the responsibility for carrying out the
economic feasibility analysis and providing a consistent multimodal
analytical framework to the preparation of the medium- and long-term
investment program. The Bank is reviewing SCT staff training requirements
for planning and is already providing assistance to SCT under ongoing loans
(1671-ME, 1929-ME and 1964-ME) to improve planning capabilities and determine
resource requirements; further assistance would be provided under the
proposed project (para 3.18(c)).
2.11      In addition to SCT, the Secretariat for Programing and Budgeting
(SPP) plays an important role in ensuring consistent and complementary modal
planning. The Directorate for Public Infrastructure of SPP is responsible
for reviewing and approving the proposed SCT investment and operating budgets
and conducts a serious review of all major investments in the sector.
Although small, this unit has proven effective and capable during the first
year of this administration.
D. Land Transport Pricing
2.12      The Government of Mexico has traditionally played an active role in
the setting of prices for major goods and services. In transport, road, rail
and air tariffs and port and terminal charges are regulated by the
Directorate General for Tariffs in SCT.  In addition, fuel prices are set by
the Government.  In the past, road and rail tariffs and charges for land
transport have been set below marginal costs, resulting in substantial
subsidies to transport users. The present administration has taken
substantive actions in the past year to reduce subsidies in the sector, and
further needed price and tax increases are planned in order to fully
implement this rationalization policy so that all transport users pay the
appropriate cost of the services they require and the drain on the public
treasury is minimized. The main issues and actions in land transport pricing
and taxation are discussed in the following paragraphs.
(i) Fuel Pricing
2.13      A Bank-financed road user charges study in 1975 found that refined
petroleum products were being priced at the pump well below world market



- 7 -
prices. This situation worsened as domestic inflation surged and gasoline
and diesel prices remained no higher than US$0.42 and US$0.18 per gallon
respectively during 1981. Since December 1981, however, the Government has
followed a policy of gradually raising domestic fuel prices toward
international levels (Table 2.2). From December 1981 to April 1984, gasoline
prices have risen from Mex$ 7/liter to Mex$ 54/liter (US$1.30/gallon) for
extra and Mex$ 2.8/ liter to Mex$ 40/liter (US$0.96/gallon) for regular, a
real increase of 84% and 240% respectively. Diesel prices have been
raised even more significantly from Mex$ 1.17/liter to Mex$ 26/liter
(US$0.63/gallon) for a real increase of over 430%. In dollar terms, however,
while gasoline prices are above international levels (US$0.82/gallon for
regular), diesel prices are still below international levels (estimated at
US$0.80/gallon 4/).
2.14      The Government has shown that it is taking serious action to
resolve the fuel pricing issue and is trying to reduce the price differential
between diesel and gasoline while approaching international levels.
Understandably, political concerns have determined the timing of the price
increases. With the present level of prices, no major distortions are
evident (Annex 1); rail tariffs as well as costs are still well below road
tariffs and costs for the main railway commodities (para 2.19) so that no
significant competitive distortion is apparent. One concern has been the
effect of low diesel prices on the selection of construction techniques,
i.e., labor-intensive versus equipment-intensive, for rural roads. Recent
analyses, however, show that the impact is not significant. The Bank,
through its macro-economic discussions with the Government and its economic
and sector work, will continue to monitor progress on the fuel pricing issue
and help the Government to assess the implications of its pricing policies.
(ii) Road User Charges
2.15      Related to the issue of fuel prices is the question of whether the
various road-related tolls and taxes imposed on road users sufficiently cover
the cost of providing road infrastructure. The general principle to be
applied in determining a minimum equitable distribution of user charges
should be that users pay the full costs of owning and operating the vehicle
and the attributable costs of operating, maintaining and reconstructing the
roadway, which vary in accordance with the number and weight of the various
types of vehicles. The charges which enter into this calculation in Mexico
include road and bridge tolls, fees for licensing, permits and public
transport concessions, producer taxes for tires and vehicles (over and above
normal taxation level), special import duties on vehicles and special taxes
on fuel. None of these charges are directly assigned to roads or identified
as road user charges, and all enter the federal treasury to be distributed in
accordance with general budgetary practices. Even road and bridge tolls
collected by the Toll Road and Bridge Authority, Caminos y Puentos Federales
(CyPF), are defined as being a tax and are turned over to the federal
treasury.
2.16      With the surge In inflation, the subsequent devaluations and price
changes, an updated analysis of road user charges is required. Prior studies
and Bank estimates showed that the gross receipts from user taxes covered all
4/ Based on mid-November 1983 Caribbean market prices, FOB.



- 8 -
administrative, construction, reconstruction and maintenance costs for the
federal, state and local networks. However, fuel tax revenues represented
the major contribution in these analyses, based on the fact that special
taxes on fuel represent about 45% of the total pump price (Table 2.3). Since
pump prices are generally at or below international levels or their
opportunity costs, fuel tax revenues, in economic terms, cannot be considered
as a contribution to road infrastructure. Without this element, the results
of the prior analyses would be negative, with economic road user charges
covering little more than maintenance and administration. The deficit is
apparently not equally distributed over the network. A Bank-sponsored sector
study of the Mexican toll roads found that, with the increases in tolls along
the 1,000-km toll road network of almost 500% in the past year, gross toll
revenues (about US$135 million) should be sufficient, in 1984, to cover all
administrative, operating and maintenance costs of CyPF and all debt service
as well as contribute to capital extensions and widenings (para 3.13 and
Annex 2).
2.17      As fuel prices near international levels, it is time for the
Government to attempt to resolve the road user charges issue. The proposed
study on road user charges should be directed at the interurban road user and
should focus on the overall balance between tax receipts and road
expenditures, and on the allocation of taxes and costs by type of road user.
Prior analyses concluded that diesel-powered commercial vehicle operators,
particularly for heavy trucks, were paying a lower percentage of the costs
they impose upon the network than were other types of road users. The study
should also recommend additional taxes to resolve observed deficiencies. SCT
has already initiated Phase I of the draft terms of reference provided in
Annex 3. It was agreed at negotiations that SCT would, by December 1985,
complete a study on the allocation of road costs and revenues by type of user
and would subsequently discuss with the Bank (during the early 1986
semi-annual review meeting (described in para 4.24)) alternative policy
options and timing for resolving identified deficiencies.
(iii) Railway Tariffs
2.18      Among the objectives of the present administration is the
improvement of the financial status of the Mexican railways 5/ through a
well planned combination of operational improvements and tariff actions. As
discussed in paragraph 2.02, unlike railways in many other developing
countries, Mexican railways have experienced consistent growth in traffic
over the last decade. The Government's pricing policy and failure to permit
tariffs to keep up with inflation, however, limited improvements to the
railways' financial status, and working and operating ratios improved only
gradually from 149 and 172 in 1980 to 132 and 154 in 1982. A more
substantial improvement occurred when the new administration increased
freight tariffs by over 100% in real terms during 1983.   The working ratio
is expected to fall to 114 and the operating ratio to 139 despite the decline
in traffic levels caused by the economic recession. These results are
generally in accordance with the targets established under the ongoing Fourth
Railway Project (Loan 1929-ME) (Table 2.4).
5/ Actually there are four railways in Mexico, but they are gradually being
incorporated within the largest one, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico
(N de M). The discussion in this report, then, relates to N de M.



2.19      While the prior tariff increases have been across the board, the
railways and the Government are now preparing to raise tariffs on selected
commodities for which present tariffs are not covering variable costs. 6/
These commodities represent 30% of rail tonnage and include coal, coke,
limestone, iron-ore, cement, sugarcane and lime. In Table 2.5, it is clear
that certain commodities are carried at tariffs well beyond variable costs,
while others are charged as low as 61% of variable costs. It is also evident
that, for those commodities priced below variable costs, there is a
significant differential between road and rail tariffs, providing competitive
room for tariff increases. The Government and the railways are in agreement
on the need to restructure railway tariffs and, as part of the jointly
developed National Rail Modernization Program (September 1983), have proposed
a plan of action on tariff restructuring to be initiated during 1984.
Progress on this plan of action will be monitored during the preparation of
the proposed Railway Sector Project.
2.20      N de M reduced passenger services by 43% between 1974 and 1978 and
entered into an agreement with the Government whereby it continues to run
certain services for social reasons and claims the specific working losses
from the Government. The expected loss of US$22.5 million for 1983 is small
compared to N de M's net deficit of US$400 million. As part of its
preparation for the proposed Railway Sector Project, N de M is carrying out a
comprehensive review of passenger services, tariff policies and investment to
help determine appropriate future actions.
E.   Railway Operational Efficiency
2.21      To improve the railways' financial position as well as to minimize
investment requirements, the Government and N de M have put the primary
emphasis of the National Railway Modernization Program (para 2.19) upon
operational efficiency.  The core of the Program is to negotiate with the
railway unions regarding the revision of work rules, job reclassification and
training. These negotiations have been made possible by the pending
retirement of almost 20,000 railway employees (of a total workforce of
64,000) over the next two to three years. A series of operating targets have
been set for 1984-1988 to help direct and monitor improved productivity
efforts (Table 2.6). Among the more critical targets is that for the
improved availability of locomotives, which declined from over 85% in 1975 to
under 70% in 1983, to the extent that traction power is a major constraint in
rail capacity. Through the ongoing Fourth Railway Project and the
preparation of the Railway Sector Project, the Bank is assisting N de M in
analyzing the problem and in finding solutions.
F.   Road Freight Regulation
2.22      Over the past decade, the Mexican Government has moved to expand
and tighten its regulatory authority over road freight haulage, in contrast
to the general international tendency toward deregulation. Prior to 1971,
the Government had substantial regulatory authority, but had not exercised
that authority nor enforced the existing regulations. It believed that the
trucking industry had become chaotic, with a growing number of individuals
6/ Including the capital cost of locomotives and rolling stock and some
proportion of track costs.



- 10 -
providing substandard service at below-cost tariffs, which caused an unstable
environment for vehicle operators in financial terms, as well as for shippers
in terms of service. In response to this problem, the Government, through
SCT and its Directorates for Motor Transport (DGAF) and for Tariffs (DGT),
established and enforced a series of regulations covering entry, capacity,
commodity restrictions, geographical operating rights, tariffs and corporate
structure. The regulations apply to all trucks operating on Federal highways
with a load capacity of over three tons, and they distinguish between four
types of service:
(a) general freight service for which a permit is issued to carry any
freight within a specified corridor;
(b) specialized freight service for which a permit is issued to carry a
specific commodity, usually one which requires special handling or
equipment, e.g., tank or dump truck. This permit has no geographic
limitation;
(c) non-processed farm and animal products service, which is treated as
specialized freight service and which is flexibly defined to p,ermit
the transport of agricultural inputs to the farm; and
(d) private own-account service for which a permit is provided to a
non-transport company to carry its own goods.
2.23      One of the major objectives was to improve the organization of the
truckers. All operators had to organize themselves into companies or
cooperatives, and no new permits are to be issued to an individual unless he
joins one of the existing firms. To avoid monopolistic practices, no
individual could receive more than five permits (one for each vehicle) in his
name. From 1976 to 1982, the number of vehicles with general or specialized
freight permits rose from 85,000 to 128,000, which represents over 90% of
interurban road freight traffic (Table 2.7).
2.24      Although the Government is relatively satisfied with its road
freight regulatory system, there are several questions on the economic
benefits and costs of the system which warrant further analysis:
(a) How effective is rate regulation and is it worth the effort?
(b) To apply for a permit, a potential operator must apply to the route
or commodity committee related to the service he is offering. The
committees comprise the other operators and represent a delegation
of responsibility by SCT. What capacity and utilization measures
and other criteria are applied by the committees and are they
serving the national interest?
(c) The number of routes for general freight has been reduced from 40
to 9, which gives the operator a broad geographic area within which
to find traffic. What purpose do the route restrictions serve and
how much cross-route traffic is there?
(d) Are costs higher than they would be under deregulation and are
returns reasonable?



- 11 -
(e) What service benefits are provided by regulation?
(f) What is the administrative cost of regulation?
2.25      To answer these questions, the Government has agreed to participate
with the Bank in a study. The terms of reference, timing and resource
requirements are to be defined during a Bank mission scheduled for June 1984.
While there have been theoretical discussions between the Bank and the
Government, no detailed analyses have been conducted to measure the benefits
and costs of the regulatory system and to help design possible regulatory
reform.
G.   Port Charges
2.26      Cargo-handling services in most of the ports are provided by
publicly owned operating companies - Empresas de Servicios Portuarios (ESP).
Since these companies are operated on a commercial basis, the tariffs charged
for their services are cost-related and subject to frequent adjustment. They
do, however, require approval by SCT's Directorate-General for Port
Administration and the Directorate-General for Tariffs before they are
officially published and become effective. This means that there is often a
considerable time lag between the application by an ESP for a tariff change
and its eventual implementation. With the rapid inflation of the last two
years, this has meant that cargo-handling tariffs have steadily been falling
behind the increasing costs, often eroding profits and reserves of the port
operating companies. Ship dues, berthage and wharfage are paid by ship
operators to SCT's local Superintendent of Port Operations and deposited in
the Federal Treasury. They bear no evident relationship to the capital
investment in port infrastructure and, according to a recent estimate of the
Directorate General of Port Works (DGOM), currently amount to only about 10%
of port dredging costs and make no contribution toward construction.
Pilotage is paid for separately to the quasi-private Pilot Cooperatives and
is, therefore, cost-related, as are towage charges, with tug services given
either by the ESP, private operators or the Navy.
2.27      The Comision Nacional Coordinadora de Puertos (CNCP) recently
proposed a greater decentralization of port administration, beginning with
the relatively new port of Lazaro Cardenas as a prototype for the rest,
including commercial ports. By this scheme, a local administrative body,
with its own board of directors, would have control over its own budget
(although it would still require Federal approval) and all aspects of port
development, equipping, operations, maintenance and tariffs. The Region is
presently appraising a project to finance part of the Lazaro Cardenas
Industrial Ports development (Mexico Ports III); if the project is approved,
it would help to further the process of reform of the port subsector.
H. Past Bank Participation and Experience
2.28      The Bank's major lending activities in transport have been in
highways and railways. Eight highway loans have been made, the first
in 1960 and the eighth (a First Highway Sector Loan) in 1979 (Table 2.8).
There have been four railway loans, one for Ferrocarril de Pacifico and three
for N de M, helping to finance track rehabilitation, locomotives, rolling



- 12 -
stock and equipment, and promoting improvements in planning, operational and
financial 'performance. The first loan (103-ME) of US$61 million was made in
1954, and the fourth loan (1929-ME) for US$150 million was made in 1980.  The
first port loan (820-ME) was made in 1972, and a port preparation loan
(1964-ME) was made in 1981 which is expected to lead to an Industrial Ports
Project. In addition, an airport loan (1022-ME) was made in 1974 and
completed in 1982.
2.29       The total Bank participation of about US$387 million for the
development of the Mexican highway network has had a great impact upon the
improvement of the primary highway system; out of a total length of about
44,000 km of federal and toll highways, the Bank has assisted, or is
assisting, in the improvement or construction of about 15,000 km
(Map IBRD 17957). Although the quality of works executed is satisfactory,
cost increases, construction delays, and insufficient budget allocations have
generally resulted in delayed completion of the projects.
2.30      The Seventh Highway Project (Loan 968-ME) was signed in March 1974,
and substantial delays were encountered from the onset because of shortage of
budgetary allocations in the face of sharply higher bid prices caused by
rapid inflation. Macroeconomic control measures were taken to reduce the
impact of the public sector deficit upon inflation, the road budget was cut
in real terms, and the allocation for all projects was reduced. After the
Mexican peso was devalued late in 1976, SCT reevaluated its programs and
proposed a reduction of the project from 16 to ultimately 11 sections. The
project continued to experience large cost increases, caused mainly by
inflation but exacerbated by design modifications due to increased traffic
projections and to difficulties in mountainous areas; the loan was fully
disbursed by July 1981.
2.:31      The problems encountered with the Seventh Highway Project 7/
illustrated the limitations of conventional project lending in Mexico despite
a mature and well developed highway authority. With Bank funds tied to a few
large subprojects, there is little flexibility to meet changes in
priorities. The Government may face great difficulties in allocating
domestic funds for the Bank-financed subprojects, which can lead to slow
disbursing projects. The approach followed in the Highway Sector Loan to
Mexico (Loan 1671-ME) was designed to overcome those limitations and to allow
the Bank to better adapt its contribution within SCT's planning and budgeting
process.
2.32       The Highway Sector Project was signed in March 1979.  The initial
progress was relatively slow because contracts related to approved
subprojects had first to be tendered and execution started, often with small
initial annual budget allocations, but, by mid-1981, progress was such that
it was expected that funds would be fully disbursed by end-1982. However,
the devaluations, the severe budgetary restrictions in real terms, and thie
consequent much smaller amounts expressed in dollars allocated to Bank-
financed subprojects caused delays in construction and in disbursements,
aggravated by a slow processing of disbursement applications. With the
approved subprojects now in execution, full commitment of loan funds was
reached in December 1983, so that full disbursement may be expected by June
1984, although not all individual subprojects will be completed. The
7/  Documented in Project Completion Report, June 22, 1982.



- 13 -
potential rapid execution of highway sector lending will be apparent during
the execution of the proposed second sector loan through the financing of the
1984-1986 time-slice of 24 subprojects initiated during the earlier loan.
Even with the restricted budgets for 1984, and possibly for 1985 and 1986, a
very quick disbursing loan may be expected.
I. Role of the Bank and Lending Strategy
2.33      The potential Bank role in the sector has been expanded because of
several important actions taken by the administration which assumed office in
late-1982. As a first step, the Government combined all modes under one
Ministry, SCT, and then proceeded to establish a Planning Directorate in SCT
covering all modes (para 2.09). Most important, the Government has made it
clear that its official policy is to reduce subsidies and has taken direct
action affecting the transport sector, such as raising fuel prices and rail
tariffs and eliminating tax benefits to the automotive industry. Following
the new Government's indication that it wished to have a substantial lending
program for the transport sector, a sector lending strategy for Bank
operations was agreed. In terms of investment, the strategy is to develop
relatively quick disbursing lending operations which focus upon short-term
investment in maintenance, rehabilitation and modernization and upon making
prior investments operational while assisting the Government, through the new
Planning Directorate, to reassess the medium- and long-term need for major
new investments.
2.34      With respect to non-investment policies such as land transport
pricing, railway financing and highway transport regulation, earlier Bank
projects have been less successful. The lending and sector work programs
will raise the awareness of the Government and will help in assessing the
issues and in developing appropriate actions. The timing of the lending
program permits the Bank to effectively monitor incremental progress on
studies or specific actions concerning these policy issues. The main policy
focus in the rail and road projects will be on railway tariffs and road user
charges.
III. THE SCT INVESTMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A.   Development of the Highway Network
3.01      The Mexican highway network has evolved rapidly (Table 3.1).  In
1952, there were only 27,000 km of roads, of which 16,000 km were paved. By
the 1980s, the network had grown to over 212,000 km, of which about 67,000 km
are paved (including 1,000 km with four or more lanes). The slower annual
rate of growth of paved roads, from 6.6% per year between 1952-1960 to 2.4%
from 1975-1980, is a sign that the network has reached relative maturity and
that, with the exception of some areas, the trunk network is in place. Road
investment in the past ten years has shifted from the extension of the trunk
network to rural access roads and, more recently, to the widening of existing
trunk roads to relieve congestion.
3.02      Administration of the road network is principally under the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government, with the exception of state and
municipal roads. 8/
8/ Other background information on the Highway Subsector is included in the
Project File (Annex 8).



- 14 -
(a) Federal Highways: SCT is directly responsible for the planning,
construction and maintenance of all federal highways; financing is
100% from federal funds. The network consists of 42,500 km, with
93% paved.
(b) Toll Facilities: While SCT plans and constructs toll roads and
bridges, they are operated and maintained by CyPF. The toll road
network consists of about 1,000 km, of which 49% are four or more
lanes.
(c) State Highways: Planning, construction and maintenance of the
49,300 km of state roads (49% paved) are the responsibility of each
state's highway administration. Coordination with the federal
authorities is carried out by state highway boards (Junta Local de
Caminos), of which the state Governor is chairman and on whiclh SCT
is represented through its Centro SCT, the fully staffed and
equipped dependency of SCT in each state. Federal funding is
provided for 50% of maintenance and construction costs.
(d) Local Roads 9/: The 3,200 km of local roads are also the
responsibility of the state highway boards, and financing is
provided on a tri-partite basis between the federal government, the
state and local authorities and private enterprises.
(e) Rural Roads: Since 1971, a very large rural roads program has been
carried out, aimed at joining small towns and villages with the
nearest main road and providing temporary employment through the
application of labor-intensive construction methods. Over 80,000
km have been built in the last 12 years under a variety of federal
programs. By 1984, all rural roads programs are expected to be
consolidated under SCT, with SCT having responsibility for
construction and maintenance and the states participating in the
selection and planning; financing is 100% from federal funds.
3.03      Federal road investment has declined over the past 12 years from
68% to less than 50% of transport investment as the Government attempted to
resolve critical ports and railways problems which were evident in
1979-1981. In real terms, road investment increased by 95% between 1977 and
1981 and has since declined to the 1977 level.
3.04      Within the highway subsector, there has been a substantial shift in
emphasis in the last few years (Table 3.2). While the rate of construction
of new roads has remained relatively constant since 1977 (with the exception
of 1983), reconstruction and "modernization" (road widening) works have
received substantial real increases, rising from 5% to over 30% of the
highway budget. No additions or widenings of the toll road network have been
carried out since the early 1970s, and rural roads allocations increased
substantially until the reductions of 1983. Road maintenance allocations
remained relatively constant until 1983 despite the growing network and
9/ Those that, for administrative reasons, are not defined as rural roads.



- 15 -
increases in traffic. In 1983, however, SCT's maintenance budget was raised
by 76% in real terms, and, in 1984, reconstruction and maintenance represent
almost 50% 10/ of the road budget as compared with less than 25% in 1981.
3.05      The shift within the road investment program is an appropriate
response to the unprecedented continuous traffic increases and to the
budgetary restrictions since 1982. Traffic indicators for 1970-1980
(Table 3.3) show that the vehicles in circulation increased at an annual rate
of 13% from 1970-1975 and 12% from 1975-1980, compared to the growth in GDP
of about 6.5% annually. The rate of motorization was so significant that the
number of automobiles per 1,000 inhabitants rose from 26 to 63 over the
decade, compared with 70 in Brazil and 200 in Spain. Traffic counts along
the toll roads (Table 3.4) confirm the remarkable rate of growth, with an
average increase of 10% per year from 1971 to 1982. Because of this
accelerated traffic development, light pavements were insufficient to meet
the heavier demand and severe congestion occurring along the trunk network.
With limited budgets, however, SCT spread investment throughout the network
to resolve the most critical congested road segments and increased
maintenance outlays to provide emergency measures until the reconstruction
budget could be raised. Today, road surface conditions appear adequate, but
deferred reconstruction needs are growing, and periodic maintenance will not
be sufficient on many routes. Traffic congestion is a continuing problem
since SCT estimates that there are over 6,400 km of roads with over 6,000
vehicles per day and only 1,000 km of four-lane highway. Recent fuel price
and toll increases, along with the economic recession, have relieved some of
the problems as traffic has declined, but will provide a respite of only a
few years. An indication of the recent declines is evidenced in the
manufacture of vehicles, which today is generally at 1973 levels (Table 3.5).
B.   SCT Highway Investment Program 1984-1988
3.06      Potential road works for the SCT road investment program are
identified from three sources: the continuous road inventory which provides
sufficiency ratings on the structural and geometric characteristics of the
national network; the state offices of SCT and local authorities based on
their observation of local road conditions and their knowledge of local
development requirements; and the national highway plan called the Esquema
Director Nacional de Carreteras (EDNC). The EDNC is the primary basis for
the modernization program. It was originally prepared in 1975, with
consultant assistance, and was updated in 1981. It includes a projection of
traffic flows and determines what investment levels would be required to
maintain different levels of service (based on speed and congestion).
Important corridors were identified for investment by the study, and all
works in the 1984 road-widening program have originated from the EDNC.
3.07      SCT prepared a draft investment program for 1984-1988 assuming
that, while 1984-1986 budget levels would remain restrictive, substantial
real increases would be forthcoming after 1986. The general breakdown of the
projected investment program is along the lines shown in Table 3.6, as
confirmed at negotiations. No real increases are projected for bridge
10/ This does not include the reconstruction elements of the modernization
program, which would raise the proportion even higher.



- 16 -
construction, while new road construction, reconstruction and modernization,
trunk and rural road maintenance and bypasses will receive real increases
from 1985 to 1988. The major additions to the investment program will be the
inclusion of high priority toll road widenings. The total investment program
would require US$3.6 billion, including routine and periodic maintenance but
excluding rural roads construction. About US$420 million has been allocated
for 1984. Although these budget levels will not be sufficient to
significantly relieve the problem of congestion, they should be sufficient to
serve the most critical reconstruction needs. If maintenance budgets for
trunk roads are kept at 1984 levels, the general surface condition of the
network should be adequate. Further increases in the roads budget will
depend upon overall increases in the public sector investment budget. More
details on the composition and major works included in the investment program
are provided in Annex 4.
C.   SCT Road Maintenance Program
3.08      While the 1984 highway investment budget will experience a decrease
in real terms from 1983 levels, the share allocated to trunk road maintenance
will increase from 33% to 38% of the federal trunk road investment budget,
representing US$3,400 per km (including routine and periodic maintenance
tasks). The relatively high proportion reflects two facts: first, the
network is aging and upgradings have been postponed, requiring more
maintenance; and second, trunk road maintenance quality is good. Routine
maintenance is carried out by force account; only major betterment or
periodic maintenance works on the trunk network are contracted. Maintenance
requirements traditionally have been identified on the basis of separate
annual visual inspections by the Directorate General for Technical Control
and by the Directorate General for Maintenance (DGC). More recently, DGC has
instituted a program for measuring roughness and deriving an index
representing the geometric and structural adequacy of the road. Road
sections with low indices are identified for more detailed analysis,
including deflection measurements.
3.09      SCT equipment is maintained, operated and allocated by DGC, and
equipment investment is included within the DGC budget. Systematic records
are kept of each item of equipment and each vehicle, specifying its use and
maintenance data and forecasting the timing for replacement. Although abouit
half of the equipment and vehicles are older than their rated economic life,
almost 80% are still in use because of good workshop facilities and an
innovative equipment rehabilitation program. In 1983, about US$15 million
worth of equipment was procured locally, and the budget for 1984 provides
about US$20 million which, in view of the overall restricted budget
situation, is satisfactory. SCT has managed to fulfill some of its equipment
needs through the rental of contractors' equipment, much of which is idle or
under-utilized because of the recession.
3.10      Rural road maintenance under the Directorate General for
Maintenance is not as satisfactory and has been neglected in the past. Since
1971, the Government's attention has been directed at the construction of
rural roads with minimum design standards. With over 80,000 km built in ten
years, the requirements for maintenance, particularly periodic maintenance
including spot improvements, are accumulating rapidly. Rural road inventory
procedures have been inappropriate for identifying maintenance requirements,



- 17 -
and it is clear from limited field inspections that the need is significant
and that the US$300/km allocated in 1983 hardly met 50% of the needs. In the
state of Chiapas, estimates were made on the cost of routine and periodic
maintenance which showed that US$650-750/km is required, of which about 60%
represents periodic and emergency maintenance (Annex 5). Taking into account
the deferred maintenance works, it is expected that the budgetary
requirements in the coming years may be even higher in several states. It
was agreed at negotiations that the Government would provide adequate
resources to maintain rural roads appropriately. Already, for 1984, the
Government has increased the rural roads maintenance budget by over 45% in
real terms and has projected substantial increases in future years by
allowing rural road construction funds to be used for reconstruction purposes
as well. To assist in defining the specific level of resources required, the
Government has initiated a rural roads inventory which is expected to cover
40% of the network by the end of 1984, 75% by the end of 1985, and 100% by
June 1987, applying agreed upon inventory procedures. The Government would
develop a program of periodic maintenance works from the inventory data and
would review progress with the Bank during the semi-annual project meetings
(para 4.24). The format for the inventory and review is provided in Annex 5.
D.   Financing of the Road Investment Program
3.11      There are three principal sources for financing road investments:
the federal treasury, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the
Bank. Although various road-related taxes are collected from road users,
including highway tolls, they are incorporated into the general treasury and
not assigned to any specific sector (para 2.15). For the period 1984-1986,
of a total estimated investment budget of US$1.6 billion, including
maintenance but excluding rural roads construction, IDB is expected to
provide US$45 million through an ongoing loan directed mainly at new road
construction; the Bank is to provide US$200 million under this project, and
the rest is to be provided through annual budgetary outlays.
3.12      Major improvements to the toll road network have been delayed
because of the Government's uncertainty over how such works should be
financed. The original concept was that CyPF should be self-financing, but
the toll levels permitted in previous years were barely able to cover
operating and maintenance costs, and, in recent years, CyPF registered
significant deficits as the devaluations affected its debt situation
(Annex 1). The new administration changed the situation by declaring that
tolls were a form of federal taxation, to be collected by CyPF but deposited
in the federal treasury. The operating and investment budget for CyPF is
determined with Government approval and funded from Government allocations.
Investments for widenings and extensions are to be determined and executed by
SCT, which will then turn them over to CyPF for maintenance and operation
(the impact of this policy upon CyPF accounting and operational efficiency is
discussed in paragraph 4.22). This treatment is similar to that of major
railway infrastructure investments, which are executed by SCT and turned over
to N de M. The Government's policy is a sound one, providing maximum
flexibility to optimize investment options.



- 18 -
3.13      The policy for setting tolls is determined by SHCP in consultation
with CyPF, SCT and SPP. In the past 12 months, tolls have increased by about
500% and now vary not only by vehicle type, but also by day of the week, with
higher tolls imposed on weekend leisure traffic.   The toll levels are
equivalent to those required to cover all costs, including debt service.
Government policy is for current tolls to be maintained in real terms so that
toll road and bridge users will also be contributing substantially to new
investments. Concern over the need for investment on the toll network and
the effect of recent toll increases led the Bank to sponsor a Toll Road
Sector Study in 1983, the recommendations of which have been accepted in
principle by the Government. 11/ The study concluded that the full cost
recovery tolls did not appear to be causing significant diversion of traffic
to parallel free roads, and, thus, the system is considered acceptable in
economic as well as financial terms. The study did recommend, and the
Government has instituted, a program of traffic counts on competing roads to
monitor the situation continuously.  A report on these counts and toll levels
will be included for the semi-annual discussions (para 4.24).  For new toll
roads, the study recommends that the Government begin by fixing tolls at the
level of marginal costs to determine the baseline traffic attracted to the
road and then to increase the tolls toward full recovery until significant
diversion is apparent. To help monitor the efficiency of toll collection,
CyPF will annually calculate agreed upon indices for Bank review (para 4.22).
E.   Economic Evaluation of the Investment Program
3.14      SCT carried out an economic evaluation for all road works in the
construction and modernization program whether or not they were candidates
for external financing; the procedures applied were those agreed to under
Loan 1671-ME. Estimated economic rates of return for the 1984 investment
program cover 94% of the construction and road widening budget and range from
13 to 86% as shown in Annex 4, with over 80% of the funds invested in workcs
with estimated rates of return of over 20%. The principal benefits are
vehicle operating cost and time savings because of reduced congestion in the
modernization and bridge works. For new road construction, development
benefits are often significant. Reconstruction works are selected and
evaluated on the basis of engineering criteria, reviewed through annual
inventories. At present, no economic analysis is carried out for such works,
but, under the project, SCT is expected to develop appropriate analytical
procedures (Annex 6, para 6).
3.15      Based on discussions during project preparation, SCT has updated,
upgraded and revised its economic evaluation methodology, taking into account
recent technical findings on vehicle operating costs in other countries and
the results of local surveys to better estimate vehicle speeds and time
values. At negotiations, the economic evaluation procedures and methodology,
as well as the general economic criteria, to be applied in the annual
updating of the road investment program were confirmed (Annex 6). All
candidate civil works subprojects for financing must have a minimum economic
rate of return of 12%. For rural road maintenance works, however, only a
technical analysis will be carried out (para 3.10), and traffic counts will
be made to confirm the degree of utilization of the road.
II/ Mexico Transport Sector Study: Mexico Toll Roads, September 9, 1983
(Yellow Cover).



- 19 -
3.16      Traffic forecasting procedures depend upon the scale and type of
project.  For new construction, origin and destination surveys serve-as a
basis for projecting traffic. Otherwise, SCT depends upon the results of the
EDNC study (para 3.06) and general social and economic indices for the
various states. For the great majority of modernization and reconstruction
subprojects, traffic forecasts are not a significant element since, with
existing traffic, the first year benefits are sufficient to meet the minimum
economic selection criteria.
F. The Bank Project
3.17      The Second Highway Sector Project would continue to help finance
works initiated under the First Highway Sector Project as well as other works
initiated under the SCT investment program. The quick disbursing nature of
this followup sector loan would provide virtually immediate assistance to the
Government in alleviating its continued foreign exchange shortage. The
objectives of the project are the following:
(a) to improve seriously congested sections of the national highway
network including sections of the toll network, upgrade substandard
pavements and extend the paved network to developing areas;
(b) to strengthen the planning and execution of rural road
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance and help the Government to
determine and allocate an appropriate maintenance budget;
(c) to strengthen the newly organized SCT Planning Directorate for all
transport modes;
(d) to facilitate a continuing dialogue on land transport pricing
policies and monitor progress with regard to road and rail pricing
issues; and
(e) to assess the costs and benefits of existing road freight
regulations in order to assist the Government in policy
formulation.
3.18      The proposed loan of US$200 million would be made to BANOBRAS with
SCT as the executing agency and would help to finance the 1984-1986
time-slice of the 1984-1988 SCT investment program, based on the expected
rate of execution for candidate subprojects. In 1984-1986, SCT expects to
spend US$1.6 billion on-road works (excluding rural road construction) with a
foreign exchange component of about US$541 million (as shown in Table 3.6 and
the tabulation on the following page). The loan would represent 12% of the
total program and 37% of the foreign exchange requirements. The main
components would be as follows:
(a) the civil works component would help to finance the construction,
reconstruction and modernization of sections of the federal road
network including the toll roads;
(b) the rural roads component would help to finance the rehabilitation
and periodic maintenance 12/ of sections of the SCT rural roads
network; and
12/ Including regraveling, spot improvements and betterments.



- 20 -
(c) the technical cooperation component would provide funding for
individual high level consultant services on a range of issues to
be agreed upon by the Government and the Bank (Annex 7).

3.19       About 55% of the civil works component is related to the 1984-1986
investment time-slice for roads on which works were started under Loan
1671-ME (Table 3.7). Many sections of these works, however, are still to be
tendered. The potential new candidate works included in the SCT investment
program are listed in Table 3.8.  It is estimated that 65% of the subprojects
to be financed (whether new or in execution) would pertain to modernization
works, 5% to reconstruction and 30% to other types of civil works
(Table 3.9). Final engineering has been completed for the first year's
candidate subprojects.
G.   Assessment of Risk
3.20       This Second Highway Sector Project has been prepared on the basis
of the experiences of the First Project and has been designed in accordance
with the present economic circumstances of Mexico and the projected outlook
for 1984 to 1986. One risk to the project is that, if the economic situation
does not improve at the rate predicted or if inflation accelerates, further
restrictions to transport investment may be required, delaying the investment
program and interrupting ongoing investments. With the experience of the
past few years, SCT has shown its ability to respond to such situations by
redirecting limited funds toward priority works, and particularly toward
maintenance. In addition, SCT is now programing road works such that
contractors are directed to focus on completing shorter segments which can be
made fully operational. If investment funds are cut, at least the benefits
of the initial investment can be realized without significant delay. As for
the impact of further budgetary restrictions on loan disbursement, it was
shown in 1982-1983 that the flexibility of the sector loan format minimizes
such risks by not tying the loan to predetermined subprojects; sector loans
are more responsive to changing investment requirements during such critical
periods. The loan amount has been set well below the full potential for
eligible subprojects, and the disbursement estimates include a delay factor
in subproject execution.
13/ Including price contingencies estimated using an annual international
inflation rate of 7.5% in 1985 and 9% per year for 1986-1988.



- 21 -
3.21      Another risk to the project concerns the counterpart funding
required to carry out the rural roads maintenance component and the technical
difficulty of monitoring a large number of relatively small subprojects. To
minimize such risks, the project component is designed as a pilot exercise,
geographically concentrating efforts on a limited number of states which will
be progressively increased during the course of the project. Detailed
inventories and program preparation and review procedures have been
established which will facilitate the setting of physical targets and
financial accountability (Annex 5). These actions will help to document the
financial requirements for rural road maintenance and support SCT's request
for sufficient budgetary levels.
3.22      One uncertainty is the extent to which the Bank will be able to
influence sector policies and to which the Government will be able to
maintain its course toward the rationalization of pricing policies. The
Second Highway Sector Project has been presented at this time in response to
the substantive actions, in terms of pricing and institutional organization,
taken by this administration on sector policy issues which have traditionally
been of concern to the Bank. The lending program for transport has been
timed in such a way as to be able to monitor further incremental progress on
these policy issues. Furthermore, technical cooperation funding and the
sector work program are oriented toward assisting the Government in analyzing
important issues and formulating appropriate policies.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Subproject Selection
(i) National and Toll Roads
4.01      Two important concepts to be considered during the execution of the
project are the individual subprojects and the associated contract(s).   The
subproject is the unit considered for purposes of selection, preparation and
evaluation, while contracts for the implementation of specific subprojects
are the basis for disbursements.
4.02      Bank financing would be restricted to the continued execution of
civil works contracts pertaining to eligible subprojects approved under the
First Highway Sector Project (1671-ME) and to the initiation of additional
civil works contracts pertaining to eligible subprojects to be awarded before
March 15, 1987. The proposed loan would consequently finance a time-slice
(1984-1986) of expenditures on subprojects approved by the Bank. Not all of
these subprojects would be financed until their completion since loan funds
would be depleted earlier. Full disbursement is expected by end-FY1988
(Table 4.1), but the actual timing would depend upon the annual budget
allocations. Although most subproject contracts would be completed within
six months of the full disbursement of the loan, SCT would agree to complete
the works still under construction when loan funds are exhausted in
accordance with a schedule defined for each subproject. At negotiations,
agreement was reached that the Government would provide adequate financing to
complete all subprojects assisted under the loan.



- 22 -
4.03      SCT would prepare, for each subproject, a technical and economic
evaluation summarized on a basic data sheet (Annex 6), which would include
information on the rationale for the proposed works, the design standards,
the alternatives considered, the cost, the results of the economic evaluation
and the proposed tendering schedule. The Bank would study this evaluation,
request additional information as required, and, if appropriate, confirm
eligibility. An estimated rate of return of 12% or more would be required
unless otherwise agreed to by the Bank.
4.04      Declaring a subproject eligible would mean agreement by the Bank,
in principle, to help finance contracts related to the subproject, provided
budget funds are allocated, the tender process has been executed according to
agreed procedures and the detailed engineering has been carried out in
accordance with the agreed design standards. Agreement on the above
procedures for subproject identification and evaluation was confirmed by the
Government at negotiations.
(ii) Rural Roads
4.05      The Government, after discussions with the Bank, would select the
states which would be targeted for financing under the rural roads
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance component of the project. The
selection would be based on the maintenance needs of the state and the
ability of SCT to carry out a condition inventory and to develop an annual
periodic maintenance program in a timely manner. It is expected that the
number of states included under this component would increase from three in
the first year to from five to seven in subsequent years. The maintenance
programs would be developed by the Government in accordance with agreed upon
procedures (Annex 5) and reviewed by the Bank on an annual basis. Once the
works and cost estimates are approved by the Bank, the program would be
considered eligible for financing. The procedures for the selection and
approval of subprojects under this component were agreed to during
negotiations. The monitoring of results would be carried out through annual
follow-up road inventories conducted by the Government.
B.   Procurement
4.06      General.  Civil works having an estimated contract value of more
than US$1.0 million equivalent, and which are related to the federal and toll
road networks eligible for financing under the proposed loan (US$185 million
equivalent), would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Eligible works valued at less than
US$1.0 million equivalent would be procured using local competitive bidding,
with the total of such contracts not to exceed US$15 million equivalent. In
the case of civil works related to the rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance of rural roads (US$14 million equivalent), the Bank would finance
a fixed percentage of the expenditures related to specific works in the
approved budget for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of rural roads in
the selected states (para 4.05). Because of the nature of these works (low
cost per kilometer and geographically dispersed), they would be carried out,
principally, by force account or, in exceptional circumstances, contracted
through local competitive bidding. Local competitive bidding procedures used
by SCT have been reviewed and found to be generally acceptable. Experts for
techn:Lcal cooperation (US$1 million equivalent) would be contracted by SCT in
accordance with Bank guidelines and subject to Bank approval.



- 23 -
4.07      Contractor Registration.  For civil works for federal highways and
toll roads, contractors would be subject to prior registration
(prequalification). For Mexican contractors, the system of registration now
in use would be continued. For foreign contractors, invitations to be
registered would be published in the Development Forum annually during the
course of the project and would be sent to embassies; the notices would
contain information on the program as a whole. In addition, notices for
specific tenders would be advertised locally. SCT would keep the Bank
informed on the list of registered foreign contractors and those refused
registration, if any, and the reasons therefor, and on the interest shown by
contractors for specific tenders. The prequalification procedures were
confirmed during negotiations.
4.08      Tender Process.  Once a subproject has been declared eligible, SCT,
because of its proven capabilities and long experience with the Bank, would
prepare tender documents and final cost estimates, advertise tenders, open
and evaluate bids, and award and sign contracts without the Bank being
involved at this stage.   However, if the data supplied in the original basic
data sheet would essentially change during the detailed engineering stage of
the subproject, causing the cost to increase by more than 20% or the
estimated rate of return to decrease below the 12% threshold, SCT would send
a revised form to the Bank for its confirmation prior to inviting tenders.
The time allowed for preparation of bids would be 45 days for tenders having
an estimated contract amount of less than US$5 million equivalent, 60 days
for those with estimated contract amounts of more than US$5 million
equivalent but less than US$20 million equivalent, and 90 days for larger
contracts.
4.09      Bank Acceptance of Contracts.  After the signature of each
contract, SCT would send to the Bank two conformed copies of the contract
together with the tender evaluation report indicating the award decision.
The Bank would review this information and, if satisfied, indicate no
objection, thereby declaring the specific contract accepted, or request
further information. The Bank would have the right to reject the contract
if agreed tender procedures were not followed, and to cancel the related loan
amount. In case a higher-than-expected tender amount would make the project
economically not feasible, SCT and the Bank would review the possibility of
lowering the design standards of the subproject. Also, if the design of a
subproject is materially modified after initiation of construction, Bank
concurrence would be required.
4.10      Technical Cooperation.  The technical cooperation program with SCT
financed under the project would provide a global amount which would finance
the contracting of individual experts with international experience for
limited periods of time to provide high level assistance during the course of
the project. As the need for specific consulting services arises, terms of
reference and consultant selection would be prepared subject to Bank
approval. Potential uses for this fund are listed in Annex 7, and an amount
of US$1.0 million has been provided. Loan funds would cover the full costs
of the experts. Local consultants with international experience would also
be eligible for financing under this component and would represent about
one-third of total man-months.



- 24 -
C.   Disbursements
4.11      For civil works related to federal highways and toll roads, after
Bank acceptance of the contract(s) of an eligible subproject, funds can be
withdrawn from the Special Account on the basis of statements of expenditures
(para 4.18). For civil works related to rural roads, after Bank acceptance
of the detailed annual program for periodic maintenance in a State, funds can
be withdrawn from the Special Account on the basis of statements of
expenditures on works detailed in its approved program. Disbursements for
technical cooperation would be made upon full documentation being provided to
the Bank.
4.12      Disbursements would be made on the following basis:
(a) 70% of total expenditures of civil works contracts related to
national highways and toll roads up to June 30, 1985, and 35% of
total expenditures thereafter;
(b) 70% of total expenditures of the works contained in the detailed
annual program for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance in
selected states up to June 30, 1985, 50% of expenditures incurred
from July 1, 1985 until June 30, 1986, and 30% of expenditures
thereafter; and
(c) 100% of the costs for technical cooperation.
4.13      The foreign exchange component for civil works is estimated to be
45% of total costs (excluding value added taxes). The Government, through
the Borrower, BANOBRAS, has requested that the Bank apply the facilities of
the Special Action Program and increase the disbursement percentage. In view
of the continuing shortage of foreign exchange and considering that the Bank
will be financing only 24% (US$185 out of US$768 million) of the 1984-1986
time-slice of SCT's civil works investment program (para 3.18), a
disbursement schedule is proposed in which disbursements on expenditures made
up to June 30, 1985 would be on the basis of 70% of total costs (excluding
value added taxes) and 35% of expenditures thereafter.
4.14      The foreign exchange component for rural roads maintenance has been
estimated at about 25% of total costs. The proposed loan amount of US$14
million represents about 8% of the total rural road maintenance costs for
1984-1986. In order to facilitate physical monitoring and financial
auditing, disbursements would be concentrated in selected states at an
average rate of 45% of expenditures, rather than providing a broader coverage
at a lower disbursement percentage. As with civil works (para 4.13), a
disbursement schedule is proposed in which disbursement on expenditures made
up to June 30, 1985 would be on the basis of 70% of total costs. Thereafter,
from July 1, 1985 to June 30, 1986, disbursement would be calculated on the
basis of 50% of expenditures, and 30% of expenditures after June 30, 1986.
4.15      Standard disbursement profiles prepared by the Bank in the LAC
region and in Mexico indicate that a seven-year period is required to obtain
full disbursement, but they pertain to standard project lending, which is not
considered appropriate for the proposed project. The First Highway Sector
Project in Mexico will likely be fully disbursed before the Closing Date of



- 25 -
June 30, 1984, requiring a five-year disbursement period, and it is estimated
that disbursement of the Second Sector Project would require about four years
since many subprojects are already under execution (Table 4.1). The
progression of disbursements assumes annual budget increases for Bank-
financed subprojects of, on average, 10% in real terms, as indicated by SPP.
D.   Retroactive Financing
4.16      A considerable amount of retroactive financing is required under
this project. The First Highway Sector Loan supports financing of a
time-slice of an investment program containing subprojects in various stages
of execution. The proposed project would help finance a subsequent
time-slice which would include subprojects approved and initiated under the
earlier project as well as new subprojects. This situation could lead to
substantial retroactive financing when there is a gap between the date of
signing of the second loan and the date when disbursements under the first
loan are fully committed. There will be a hiatus between the date on which
all funds have been committed (December 1983) under Loan 1671-ME and the date
on which the new loan would be signed, presently estimated as July 1984.
4.17      There will be a likely shortfall of funds of Loan 1671-ME for
works of about US$20 million executed between January and July 1984. During
negotiations, it was agreed that retroactive financing of up to US$20 million
would be provided for civil works under the loan.
E.   Special Account
4.18      In order to reduce the interval during which SCT would finance the
Bank's share of project costs with its own resources, the Government may
request the Bank to make advance payments from the loan account into a
Special Account, to be opened in US$ in the Central Bank, and which would be
available for reimbursing SCT, through BANOBRAS, for the Bank's share of the
project cost. The total amount in the Special Account would be that required
for project execution, but would not exceed US$15 million. BANOBRAS would be
entitled to make withdrawals from the Special Account in pesos at the
exchange rate applicable on the day upon which payments were incurred on
Bank-approved contracts and Bank-approved rural roads programs. The
withdrawal applications would be on the basis of statements of expenditures
covering the payments made for these specific contracts and works executed in
these specific programs respectively. Supporting documentation would not be
submitted to the Central Bank and the Bank, but would be retained by SCT; it
would be made available for inspection during audits (para 4.19) and project
supervision missions. The Bank would replenish the Special Account upon
request of BANOBRAS on the basis of the withdrawals made. At negotiations,
the Government confirmed its intention to arrange payment in foreign exchange
to foreign civil works contractors through the Bank's direct payment
procedure.
F.   Auditing
4.19      Under the project, the Bank would require three types of audits:
an annual audit of the Special Account in the Banco de Mexico; an annual
audit of the accounts of CyPF; and an annual audit of the accounts of SCT on
which the statements of expenditures are based. Procedures have been agreed



- 26 -
to between the Government, BANOBRAS and the Bank which would govern the
auditing of all Special Accounts established for loans with BANOBRAS. The
external auditor for BANOBRAS would carry out the required audit each year.
These procedures were confirmed at negotiations. For the accounts of CyPF,
there is a satisfactory external audit carried out annually in addition to a
system of internal auditing checks. It was confirmed at negotiations that an
external audit of CyPF would continue to be carried out annually in
accordance with sound auditing principles applied consistently by an
independent auditor, and that, beginning with the fiscal year ending
December 31, 1984, the Government would forward the audit report of CyPF to
the Bank not later than six months after the close of the fiscal year.
4.20      With regard to the auditing of SCT accounts, SPP will carry out the
control and verification of accounts under the project and will report on
such verification annually. There is also a General Directorate of Control
in SCT, independent from the operational departments, carrying out physical
as well as financial audits of SCT expenditures. The auditing procedures are
satisfactory, and SPP is considered to be an appropriate agency for carrying
out such audits as it has under other ongoing Bank loans for public sector
investment. At negotiations, the auditing procedures to be applied to the
related SCT accounts were confirmed and agreed upon.
G.   Accounting and Budgeting at CyPF
4.21      In preparing the Second Highway Sector Project, the accounting and
budgeting practices of CyPF were reviewed, and some improvements have been
implemented. The Government agreed that a review of CyPF depreciation
procedures and asset valuation would be completed by December 1985 and that
the results would be discussed with the Bank.
4.22      Since CyPF is dependent upon the Government for budgetary
allocations, its financial statements will be largely theoretical, and
indices will have to be generated to help measure and monitor the efficiency
of its operations. One measure is toll collection costs as a percentage of
gross revenues for each road and bridge. A review of this index, taking into
account the recent increases, showed that the toll road system average is at
7%, well below the 10-15% maximum accepted in other countries. However, five
roads had indices of over 15%, which raises questions concerning the
efficiency of toll collection on such roads. It was agreed at negotiations
that CyPF would annually (for the semi-annual reviews, para 4.24) prepare the
indices of collection costs to revenue and would review possible cost
reductions or other options for roads with excessive indices.
H. Semi-Annual Consultations and Project Monitoring
4.23      With regard to project monitoring, the Government confirmed at
negotiations that it would prepare periodic reports for the Bank providing:
the listing of eligible subprojects; the listing of contracts relating to
eligible subprojects; the progress of execution of Bank-financed civil works
subprojects; the status of rural road inventories; the progress of execution
of rural road maintenance programs in the selected states; the status of
disbursement requests; and the schedule of estimated withdrawals of the
proceeds of the loan.



- 27 -
4.24      Furthermore, in order to monitor progress on the objectives of the
Sector Project, it was agreed at negotiations that the Government would, at
least semi-annually, meet with representatives of the Bank and would provide
information generally in accordance with the following scope and schedule and
any other reports as the Bank may reasonably request from time-to-time.
(a) During the first semester of each year, SCT would provide
information on:
- level of completion during previous year of road works in the
investment program;
- level of completion during previous year of the rural roads
maintenance program in the selected states;
- summary of financial status of CyPF for previous year;
- use of technical cooperation funds during previous year;
- final investment and operating budget for transport for coming
year and investment objectives;
- indices of toll road collection costs compared with gross
revenue for each toll road for previous year; and
- toll road traffic compared with that of parallel free roads.
(b) During the second semester of each year, SCT would provide
information on:
- updated medium-term road investment program and objectives;
- proposed investment and operating budget for transport for
coming year;
- status of selection and execution of Bank-financed subprojects;
- estimated application of funds for technical assistance for
coming year;
- update of road freight regulation;
- status of road and rail tariffs; and
- results of rural roads inventories for all states and proposed
rural road maintenance program, particularly for selected
states.

V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following:
(a) a study on the allocation of road costs and revenues by type of
user (para 2.17);
(b) Government provision of adequate resources to maintain rural roads
(para 3.10);
(c) carrying out of a rural roads inventory (para 3.10);
(d) adequate financing by the Government to complete all subprojects
assisted under the loan (para 4.02);
(e) procedures by which foreign civil works contractors would be paid
in foreign currency (para 4.18);
(f) annual external audit of CyPF and the Special Account (para 4.19);
(g) auditing of the SCT accounts (para 4.20);
(h) review of procedures for valuing assets and estimating depreciation

(i) annual preparation by CyPF of indices of collection costs to
revenue and review of possible cost reductions (para 4.22);
(j)  submission of periodic reports to the Bank for project monitoring
(para 4.23); and
(k) semi-annual meetings between the Government and the Bank and
appropriate reports as requested by the Bank on project execution
and on specified policy issues (para 4.24).
5.02      During negotiations, confirmation of agreement on the following
was obtained:
(a) the highway investment program for 1984-1988 (para 3.07);
(b) economic evaluation procedures and methodology as well as general
economic criteria to be applied under the project (para 3.15);
(c) the procedures for subproject identification and evaluation
(paras 4.03-4.05);



- 29 -
(d) the procedures for international and local competitive bidding, for
prequalification, tendering and contracting; and disbursement
procedures for loan funds (paras 4.06-4.15); and
(e) the amount of retroactive financing required (para 4.17).
5.03      Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for a
Bank loan of US$200 million. The terms would be 15 years with a three-year
grace period.

ANNEX 1

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Impact of Diesel Price Subsidy on the Transport Sector
A. History of Fuel Prices in Mexico
1.         During the 1970s, Mexico followed a policy of maintaining fuel
prices at levels well below international market prices, with a substantial
differential between gasoline and diesel pump prices. Between 1974 and 1981,
fuel prices actually declined in real terms, with regular gasoline ("nova")
down 65% and diesel down 33% (Table 1 of this Annex). Since 1981, however,
the Government has taken action to raise fuel prices toward international
levels in response to the country's fiscal crisis. Regular gasoline prices
rose over 240% in real terms and diesel prices by over 430% from December
1981 to April 1984. The gap between gasoline and diesel prices has also been
reduced, with diesel being 65% of regular gasoline price levels compared with
21% in 1974. The Government's policy is to continue raising fuel prices
toward international levels. 1/
2.        At the exchange rate and price levels prevailing in April 1984
(Table 1 of this Annex), it is evident that gasoline prices (regular and
extra) are above international price levels. Regular gasoline is
US$0.25/liter compared with the FOB price in the Caribbean of US$0.22/liter.
Diesel, however, is about 80% of the FOB price in the Caribbean
(US$0.17/liter compared with US$0.21/liter) and will require further real
increases to reach international levels. The remainder of this annex focuses
on the probable impact of increases in diesel prices on the transport
sector. The general conclusion is that no substantive distortions are
evident in the sector as a result of prices being below international
levels. A broader macro-economic review is necessary, however, to assess the
combined impact of fuel prices on other sectors and the country's fiscal
situation.
3.         The assessment focuses on three potential distortions in the sector
because of underpriced diesel:
(a) Effect on road traffic demand and investments;
(b) Effect on modal split between road and rail; and
(c) Effect on selection of construction techniques (labor-based versus
equipment-based construction).

-49-                             ANNEX I
B. Road Transport Demand and Diesel Prices
4.        It is estimated that the transport sector in Mexico represents
about 27% of commercial energy consumption and about 50% of domestic
petroleum product consumption, which is equivalent to transport's share of
energy and petroleum consumption in the U.S. (Table 2 of this Annex). Road
transport represents about 97% of the sector's diesel and gasoline
consumption and about 89% of all diesel consumption by the sector. 2/
Between 1974 and 1981, as fuel prices declined in real terms, fuel
consumption, both diesel and gasoline, grew at about 10% per year, which is
equal to the average rate of growth of traffic on the interurban highway
network. Despite the substantial fuel price increases in 1982 and the
beginning of the economic recession, traffic on the toll road network
continued to increase by almost 9% (although down from 15% in 1981). 3/
5.        The elasticity of demand for gasoline for cars, with respect to the
price of gasoline, is in the range from -0.04 to -0.40 based on data from a
wide range of countries. 4/ In the particular case of Mexico, it is not
possible to estimate this elasticity using time series data because of the
lack of substantial increases in fuel prices until 1982 and the influence of
other variables such as economic recession, toll rates, etc. As stated
above, only in 1983 were there substantial increases in fuel prices, so that
an indication of the implicit elasticity could be obtained only by relating
the change in traffic in the toll roads in that year with the changes in the
cost of using these roads, which, in turn, can be defined as being the toll
rates plus vehicle operating costs (including fuel). The implicit elasticity
of traffic to changes in fuel prices (gasoline and diesel) which result from
that analysis is -0.08, which is well within the range mentioned above and is
equivalent to an overall elasticity of traffic to changes in total transport
costs of -0.77.
6.        To bring diesel near to international price levels, an increase of
28% would be required, or an increase of about 3% in average truck costs.
With the estimated elasticity of -0.08 (para 5), this would result in a 2%
decline in truck traffic, or an average 1% decline in overall traffic, which
would not affect road congestion or investment priorities, because normal
traffic growth would compensate for such losses within a period of six
months.
C. Road versus Rail Modal Split
7.        One concern is that low diesel prices would lead to underpriced
road transport and divert traffic from the railways despite the comparative
economic cost advantage of rail transport. A review of rail versus road

3/   See Tables 3.3 and 3.4 of the Appraisal Report.  The focus in this paper
is on the toll roads because these represent 1,000 km of the country's
most highly traveled roads with detailed historic traffic counts. These
roads are considered to be representative of what occurs on the rest of
the network.

tariffs and costs, however, reveals that road tariffs are already more than
20% above rail tariffs for about 90% of all rail tonnage. Thus, rail already
has a substantial tariff advantage for its major commodities. The remaining
10% of railway tonnage (about 5 million tons/year) is carried at tariffs
which are much closer to those charged by truckers and mostly cover
commodities classified as "industrial" products including sugar, fertilizers
and automotive components. 5/ For sugar, the railways' share of transported
tonnage declined from 50-54% in 1978 to 1981 to 42% in 1982.  For
fertilizers, the railways have steadily lost their share to road, declining
from 58% in 1971 to 27% in 1982. Price, however, does not appear to be the
major factor in this decline, with truck tariffs still 17% above rail
tariffs, and, in the case of fertilizers, the railways began recovering
traffic in 1983 despite the tariff increases. Similarly, for the other
industrial commodities, the value per ton is higher than average for most
rail tonnage and less sensitive to tariff changes which hardly influence
final product prices. Railway marketing studies point to the sensitivity of
these commodities to the quality of service more than any other factor.
Thus, a 28% increase in diesel prices, which would raise the relative price
of trucks over railways by about 1.5% (taking into account the increase in
rail costs and tariffs due to diesel), should not, in itself, enhance the
railway market significantly. However, in the medium term, a combination of
increased fuel prices and road user taxes, along with improved railway
service, should be encouraged in order to help capture a larger share of Long
distance industrial commodity movements.
D. Construction Techniques
8.        The Government spends about US$75 million per year for the
construction of rural roads throughout the country. It began as a
labor-intensive works program, but, by the late 1970s and early 1980s, it
shifted from force-account labor-intensive works to contracted
equipment-based construction. With the recession, the feasibility of labor-
intensive works has increased, and the question arises whether contractors,
with cheap fuel prices, inappropriately favor equipment over labor. A recent
review of the comparative cost of labor-based versus equipment-based methods
showed that labor-based methods are now financially and economically
competitive with equipment-based methods for rural roads under certain
terrain conditions and where underemployed labor is available. However,
contractors still favor equipment-based methods for reasons which will not be
overcome by raising diesel prices. 6/ The two major reasons are that the
contractors already own the equipment and must pay off related debt whether
or not they use it and, second, they lack the flexibility to organize work
schedules around labor's seasonal planting and harvest requirements, which is
essential to attracting underemployed labor to such works. A 28% increase in
diesel prices will raise equipment-based construction costs by only 3%, not
enough to alter contractor preferences. Thus, the Government directly
selects those works which are appropriate for labor-intensive construction
and carries out such works by force account.
5/   The railway tariffs for these commodities are virtually all above
railway variable costs including capital cost of rolling stock,
locomotives, a percentage of track costs and interest.

1976 and 1977, there was a gap in 1978 and 1979. However, rising costs
forced increases in the following years (about 10-15% in 1980 and 1981 and
20-40% in 1982) which, until 1983, were still not sufficient to halt the
decline in CyPF's ability to finance all operating, maintenance and financial
costs.
2.        In 1983, there were across-the-board increases of 200% in January,
followed by 40% in May and again in September. Different rates are charged
for motorcycles, autos, panel and pick-up trucks, autos pulling trailers,
buses and trucks, with rates increasing with the number of axles. Rates vary
with road sections and bridges, and with day of week.
3.         The basis on which individual rates have been set is not clear;
overall levels have probably been determined on the basis of achieving
financial objectives, in particular that CyPF be financially viable.
B.   Operating Results 1978-1982
4.        Revenues from operating its toll roads and bridges enabled CyPF to
earn annual net incomes until 1981 and 1982. Road and bridge toll revenues
have always more than covered full operating, maintenance and administration
costs, including depreciation and, until 1981, loan interest costs. Table 1
of this annex gives a breakdown for the years 1979-1982, over toll roads and
bridges, of revenues and the major expense categories. Because of CyPF's
depreciation policy, bridges bear a much greater depreciation burden than
roads. However, since road construction was financed by foreign loans to a
much greater extent than were bridges and, consequently, the book value of
roads has been increased by the effect of currency devaluation to a much
greater extent than that of bridges, the burden of loan interest, which has
been apportioned on the basis of fixed asset values, is much greater for the
toll roads. Administration costs have been apportioned on the basis of total
working costs for each activity. The overall net results are shown on the
next page.
1/   Actually, there was a small net loss in 1979, due to the loss on ferry
operations (now discontinued).

The main reasons for the declining results in 1981 and 1982 are:
(a) inadequate tariff action to counter the rapid rise in cost levels; and
(b) the rise in loan interest caused by local currency devaluation.
5.         Other activities carried out by CyPF include gasoline sales at
stations either owned or leased by CyPF; sales of asphalt, paints and other
materials; and the hire of maintenance equipment. Rents are also received
from commercial property owned by CyPF. The operation of gasoline stations
has consistently resulted in losses.  CyPF's position is that their expenses
are higher than those of comparable commercial gas stations in that:
(a) CyPF provides a full 24-hour service; (b) as required by union rules,
each eight-hour shift is fully manned, even though sales during the night are
low; and (c) CyPF has to pay union rates - higher than those paid by most
commercial stations. The response to a suggestion that CyPF cease to operate
the stations, and either sell or lease them on a franchise basis, was that
the service to the public would very likely deteriorate, and that it was
CyPF's responsibility to ensure that the toll road customers could always get
gasoline.  CyPF also cited difficulties in disposing of surplus staff if the
operation were terminated. The other activities generally earn net revenues,
except for sale of paints in 1982.
6.         One measure of operational efficiency is the estimation of toll
collection costs as a percentage of toll revenues for specific roads. Taking
into account toll increases in 1983, the average for the CyPF system is about
7%, which is well below the internationally accepted rule of thumb of
10-15%. However, the percentage varies significantly and, for five roads, is
greater than 15% (Table 2 of this annex), suggesting that CyPF should explore
ways of reducing collection costs on such roads or consider the elimination
of tolls when the percentage reaches extreme proportions. The Government
will keep the Bank informed, on an annual basis, regarding the toll
collection cost index and will study alternatives which would reduce that
percentage on roads with unacceptably high indices.
C.   Financial Position
7.         Summary, audited, balance sheets as of December 31, 1979-1982
(Table 3 of this annex) illustrate the rapid deterioration of CyPF's finances
and the erosion of its equity. Equity, as a result of the losses in 1980 and
1981, has become a negative figure, and CyPF has only been able to maintain



-55-                            ANNEX 2
its current assets at a reasonable figure, sufficient to cover payables and
accruals, by delaying reimbursement of debt service. While the net value of
fixed assets rose from Mex$ 6.5 billion in 1979 to Mex$ 17.7 billion in 1982,
long-term debt has risen from Mex$ 4 billion to Mex$ 11.5 billion and the
short-term portion of long-term debt increased from Mex$ 1.2 billion to
Mex$ 6.4 billion. If CyPF had revalued its fixed assets to reflect
replacement costs instead of merely adjusting the foreign financed element of
costs in line with currency devaluation, the addition of the resulting
revaluation surplus to equity would have restored the latter account to a
more healthy balance. In addition, of course, future operating results
should be improved with the aid of more timely tariff increases.
D. Future Financial Outlook
8.        CyPFts operational performance improved considerably in 1983
because of the tariff increases of about 200% in January, 40% in May and a
further 40% in September. Preliminary unaudited figures, summarized in
Table 4 of this annex, show total annual revenues for 1983 of Mex$ 12.9
billion, with net operating revenues of Mex$ 7.6 billion, and a net income,
after loan interest, of Mex$ 4.65 billion. This very satisfactory result
indicates a times-interest-earned ratio of 2.6, debt service coverage of 1.3
times, and a return on net fixed assets of 33%. This latter ratio overstates
the position due to the undervaluing of fixed assets. With only Mex$ 382
million being spent on capital investment, the increased cash generation
resulted in working capital being improved, although still not satisfactory,
with current and liquid ratios of 1/1.5 and 1/1.6 respectively.
9.        Projections for the years 1984-1987 have been based on estimates
made by CyPF. 2/ The increase of 30% in toll rates, effective on February 1,
1984, has been taken into account, but the forecasts exclude any provisions
for further inflation or for further devaluation of the Mexican Peso, other
than assuming an average exchange rate of Mex$ 176/US$1.00. The results of
these forecasts are that annual net income would rise from about Mex$ 4,650
million in 1983 to about Mex$ 22,100 million in 1987. Times interest earned
would improve from 2.6 times in 1983 to 8.4 times in 1987. The debt service
coverage ratios given in Table 4 overstate the position because of a
moratorium on loan repayments. The return on average net fixed assets rises
from 33% to 79% in 1985, falling to 65% in 1987 as the project assets come
into operation. These figures overstate the position, because of the
fixed assets being undervalued. CyPF intends to spend, on average, about
Mex$ 3,700 million annually to make up for deferred maintenance on roads and
bridges. These amounts are shown in Table 4 and reduce the net annual
surpluses accordingly.
10.       Table 5 of this annex shows the forecast summary annual cash flows
over the period 1983-1987. Annual expenditure on CyPF's portion of the
proposed project is estimated at Mex$ 2,350 million in 1984, and Mex$ 5,600
million in each of the years 1985-1987. These costs will be financed by
CyPF.
2/ The assumptions applied are described in a report in the Project Files
(Annex 8).



-56-                            ANNEX 2
11.       Since CyPF's cash generation in the early part of 1983 was not
sufficient to cover debt service and other requirements, the cash shortfall
was subsidized by the Government. However, later in the year, the situation
improved because of tariff increases, and CyPF's working captial increased
accordingly. In subsequent years, cash generation, together with accumulated
cash balances, will be sufficient to cover debt service and investment needs,
with resulting annual cash balances rising from about Mex$ 230 million at the
end of 1983, to over Mex$ 30,400 million at the end of 1987. Since CyPF's
revenues are regarded as Government revenues, these large funds will
obviously be taken as public funds.
12.       Forecast balance sheets, given in Table 6 of this annex, are
summarized below.

13.       The current and liquid ratios (rising to 7.7/1 and 7.6/1
respectively by 1987) given in Table 6 overstate the position due to the
restructuring of long-term debt, which reduces the annual short-term portion
included in current liabilities. The debt/equity ratio improves from the
negative of 1982 to 78/22 in 1983 and to 11/89 by 1987.

ANNEX 3
MEXICO
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for
Road User Charges Study
Background
1.        In accordance with the Government's policy of reducing subsidies,
and in rationalizing public sector pricing practices, as well as finding
appropriate public sector revenue sources, there is an increasing need to
review the status of road user charges, including the various road-related
taxes and tolls. In 1975, the Mexican Government carried out an analysis of
road user charges to determine whether road-related taxes imposed on road
users were sufficient to cover the cost of providing road infrastructure.
The study's recommendations focused mainly on the problem of the
cross-subsidization between types of fuel, which was the principal road user
charge issue at that time. In the past two years, the Government has taken
substantial action with regard to fuel prices and tolls. A reevaluation of
the road user charge issue is appropriate and would focus on the overall
balance between user tax revenues and road expenditures and, most
importantly, on the balance between the tax revenues received from each type
of road user and the costs that each user imposes on the network.
2.        The following are terms of reference for a two-phased study.  The
first phase, to be carried out by SCT staff and local consultants 1/, focuses
on the overall balance. The second phase would require consultant assistance
to SCT staff in allocating road costs and tax revenues by type of road user.
Study Objectives
3.        The objectives of the road user charges study are the following:
(a) to determine whether the current road-related tax and
toll structure is adequate to cover at least the marginal
costs of providing road transport facilities;
(b) to determine whether the distribution of road-related
taxes and tolls is equitable, ensuring that each type
of road user at least pays for the marginal costs that
he imposes on the road network; and
(c) to recommend possible measures to resolve deficiencies
identified in (a) and (b).
1/ This phase is already nearing completion.

Study Approach for Phase 1
4.         In order to take into account the full effect of changes in taxes
and tolls, actual and expected through 1983, the determination of the overall
balance between tax revenues and road costs should be based on projections
for 1984. The principal tasks for carrying out phase 1 are as follows:
(a) identification of road user taxes and tolls
and how they are imposed;
(b) estimation of road user tax and toll revenues
for 1984;
(c) estimation of road-related expenditures for 1984; and
(d) comparison of (b) and (c).
5.         Identification of road user taxes and tolls:  A review should be
made of the various road user taxes including fuel taxes, vehicle importat'on
taxes, vehicle registration fees, Federal user taxes, tolls, etc. This
review should also include a discussion of the way in which the tax is
calculated, the agency responsible, whether it is a Federal, State or locEal
tax and its expiration date.
6.         Estimation of revenues:  The estimation of revenues should take
into account the increases for 1983. In calculating the user tax element in
vehicle importation tariffs and other possible taxes on vehicle or parts
purchases, only the net amount above the normal VAT (IVA) for all products,
or the average import tariff for all imports, should be considered as a user
tax.
7.         For fuel taxes, only those tax revenues above the international
price for fuel should be considered as user taxes. In this analysis, an
international price of US$0.85 per gallon for diesel and gasoline can be
applied.
8.         Estimation of road-related expenditures:  Since 1983 was an
abnormally low year for road expenditures, it may be preferable to take 1983
as a base and increase it in real terms to represent an average annual roads
budget. Expenditure items should include all administration, design and
supervision costs, highway police expenditures and all construction,
modernization, reconstruction and maintenance for Federal, State, rural and
urban roads and bridges.
9.         Comparison of revenues and costs:  The comparison should
distinguish between marginal costs ("medium term") and total costs. For this
analysis, marginal costs should include all highway police expenditures and
all reconstruction and maintenance costs.
Study Approach for Phase 2
10.        In Phase 2, the revenues and costs will be allocated by class of
road and by type of user. On this basis, a proposal to resolve any tax
deficiencies can be derived. The principal tasks for carrying out Phase 2
are as follows:



-65-                            ANNEX 3
(a) allocation of revenues by class of road and by type of user;
(b) allocation of total road expenditures by class of road and
then by type of expenditure;
(c) determination of appropriate unit (vehicles, equivalent
vehicles, equivalent axle) on which to base allocation of each
type of road expenditure;
(d) estimation of units defined in (c);
(e) allocation of expenditures by units estimated in (c) and
aggregated by type of user;
(f) comparison of (a) and (e); and
(g) recommendation of tax and toll revisions.
11.       Allocation of revenues:  Based on available data, tax and toll
revenues should be allocated between urban, rural and interurban, and the
interurban by State versus Federal, if possible. Then a second allocation by
type of vehicle must be made. The main unit for this allocation exercise is
vehicle-kilometers. At least three truck types should be considered (C-2,
C-3 and T3-S2).
12.       Allocation of expenditures by class of road:  The estimated
expenditures can easily be divided among the classes of road identified in
paragraph 11. For each class of road, then, it will- be necessary to
distribute costs by type of expenditure, i.e., routine, maintenance, periodic
maintenance, reconstruction, bridge works, administration and new
construction and, for new construction, by cost component, i.e., land
acquisition earthworks, minimum base and pavement thickness, extra base and
pavement thickness, etc.
13.       Determination of units for allocating costs:  For each type of
expenditure identified in paragraph 12, a unit must be defined for allocating
that cost which relates to the magnitude of that cost component, e.g., using
vehicle equivalents for minimum pavement thickness, axle equivalents for
extra thickness costs or number of vehicles for administrative costs.
14.       Estimation of units:  Such units, defined in paragraph 13, must
then be calculated for each class of road in paragraph 12.
15.       Allocation of expenditures by units and by type of vehicle:  This
is simply carrying out the calculation and aggregating by vehicle type.
16.       Comparison of revenues and costs:  For each vehicle, a comparison
should be made between revenues and marginal (as defined in paragraph 9)
versus total costs.
17.       Recommendations: A series of efficient tax measures should be
explored which would raise cost coverage by each vehicle type to at least
marginal cost.

SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Composition of the SCT Road Investment Program - 1984-1988
A. General
1.        The draft SCT Road Investment Program has been reviewed and found
to be generally satisfactory by Bank staff. Priority investments are
described below. Detailed economic evaluations were carried out for the 1984
construction and modernization road works. As shown in Table 1 of this
annex, the estimated economic rates of return range from 13 to 86%, covering
94% of the construction and widening budget. Over 80% of the funds are to be
invested in works with estimated rates of return over 20%. During the course
of the project, SCT will update the economic evaluations of ongoing works
when required and will carry out economic evaluations of new works as they
enter the SCT program, whether or not Bank financing is directly involved.
B. New Construction
2.        With the completion of the Pacific coastal highway and the
Temascaltepec-Zihuatanejo Road (financed under Loan 968-ME), the trunk
highway network is generally complete. However, there are still areas in
Mexico where no primary or secondary roads exist. Specifically, connections
between the central plateau and the Pacific coast are still lacking to a
large extent. These roads cross mountainous, lightly populated areas with
little development potential, but are, nevertheless, essential for
establishing a basic road grid with individual roads which are as far as
several hundred kilometers apart. Progress on the construction of these
roads has been limited in recent years because it is costly and the scarce
funds available have been directed toward reconstruction and modernization of
congested highways. The proposed project will finance only a few new
construction works since the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
concentrates its efforts on these works.
3.        Two additional major new construction items have recently been
entered into SCT'S 1984-1988 investment program. The first is the road
skirting the Guatemalan border in the State of Chiapas (Fronteriza Road), a
strategic road with potential for access to exploration of petroleum and f-or
development of the vast jungle area. The Fronteriza road is in execution,
extending gradually from the existing network in Chiapas. Although quite
acceptable as part of SCT's program (if annual allocations are not too
large), the proposed project would not finance its construction. The second
major entry is a new highway bypassing, in a wide arc, the metropolitan area
of Mexico City and interconnecting the major highways leading from Mexico
City to Queretaro, Pachuca and Puebla. This high-cost bypass is still in the
planning stage, and execution of a first tranche will likely be delayed in
view of restricted budgets.

C. Major Bridges
4.        Loan 1671-ME and the proposed project would continue to help
finance the approach roads, the foundations and the viaducts on the major
bridges at Coatzacoalcos and Tampico, but not the main spans, which were not
tendered publicly.
5.        The Coatzacoalcos bridge will supplement the existing movable
two-lane road/rail bridge in that city which, with 18,000 vehicles/day, is in
an acute state of congestion triggered by the spectacular growth in this oil-
producing area. The bridge would also create a shortcut for transit
traffic. The total bridge connection is 38 km long, and the bridge itself is
1,200 meters; the central span is 260 m, allowing a clearance for ships of 35
by 150 m. The superstructure is in prestressed concrete; the three main
spans are suspended by cables from towers that reach 85 m above the water
line. Total cost will reach US$100 million; the estimated ERR is 25%. The
bridge is expected to be completed by end-1984. The Tampico bridge has
similar specifications, except that the central span is in steel construction
instead of concrete. The bridge replaces a congested, outmoded ferry and
will attract considerable diverted traffic which presently takes a detour to
reach Mexico City and the Central Plateau. Because of the emphasis to
complete the Coatzacoalcos bridge, execution on the Tampico bridge has been
delayed; it is expected that sizable allocations will be made starting in
1985 for possible completion in 1987.
D. Toll Roads
6.        In the last ten years, no additions have been made to the 930 km
Mexican toll road system, whereas traffic has more than doubled. There are
about 425 km of two-lane road sections which already carry between 8,000 and
14,000 vehicles/day. Those roads urgently require a second carriageway and,
in many cases, reconstruction of the existing road. In addition, there are
two major missing links in the network: the continuation of the
Mexico-Puebla-Cordoba toll road to Veracruz; and the Irapuato-Zapotlanejo
section between Queretaro and Guadalajara along the Mexico-Guadalajara
corridor. An early decision on the timing of these works is also of great
importance for the free roads in these corridors because major delays on the
toll roads will influence the need for works to be carried out on the
alternative roads. For years, the priority toll road works were excluded
from the investment program because it was not clear whether financing should
come from the normal SCT budget or through direct financing by CyPF. It has
now been decided to initiate these works under the SCT program.
E. Reconstruction and Modernization
7.        Under this item, various types of investment include paving of
gravel roads, paving overlays and reconstruction to Class A road standards,
and doubling of existing roads from two to four lanes. The paving of gravel
roads is presently only a minor item In SCT's investment program. Overlays
and reconstruction are increasingly important, with pavements aging and
higher traffic and axle loads than originally projected. Typically, a road
is scheduled to be upgraded to Class A standards when traffic exceeds 3,000
vehicles/day. The most important investments are, however, directed toward
the provision of second carriageways to existing roads as determined under



-68-                            ANNEX 4
the national roads study, Esquema Director Nacional de Carreteras (EDNC).,
Although such investments are generally considered to be justified when
traffic exceeds 6,000 vehicles/day, sufficient funds have not been availaLble
to convert all justified candidate subprojects to four-lane divided
highways. Conversion to four-lane roads does not mean the immediate
construction of limited-access motorways with elaborate interchanges; in most
cases, only the most necessary overpasses are made, and land is reserved for
future construction.
8.        Among the main modernization works in the SCT program, excluding
the toll roads, are Irapuato-Leon (18,000 vpd); Mexico-Pachuca (11,000 vpd);
Mexico-Toluca (40,100 vpd); Queretaro-San Luis Potosi (15,000 vpd); and
Coatzacoalcos-Villahermosa (6,100-13,000 vpd). Such works are usually
initiated near the cities at the termini or at major nodes, where traffic is
greatest, and then gradually extended as traffic grows along the other
sections.
F. Urban Bypasses
9.        In Mexico, transit traffic often has to cross through town
centers. With the more than doubling of traffic in the last decade,
congestion on the approach roads and in the towns has increased markedly and,
accordingly, the need for, and the justification of, urban bypasses.
However, the restricted budget funds do not allow a major effort to be
laurLched in this field, and many viable works have been postponed in order to
free more funds for inter-urban modernization works.

ANNEX 5
MEXICO
SECOND HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Guidelines and Targets for the
Rural Roads Maintenance Component
1.        To qualify for Bank financing of rural road periodic maintenance
including repair and spot improvements, the following would have to be
provided for the selected states:
(a) a complete rural roads condition inventory (Attachment 1 or its
equivalent), which describes the physical condition of the road and
confirms its utilization;
(b) a complete first year and tentative second year maintenance program
which responds to the needs and priorities identified by the
condition inventory.  The total maintenance program (routine and
periodic) should be sufficient to halt further deterioration and
contribute to an overall improvement of the network;
(c) annual budget for routine and period maintenance (separately);
(d) quarterly and annual reports on the status of the periodic
maintenance works program; and
(e) annual updates of the condition inventory on a continuing basis.
2.        On a national basis, the Government expects to extend the road

Economic Evaluation Guidelines for the Preparation of the
1984-1988 SCT Road Investment Program
A. Screening Process
1.        The identification of potential road and bridge works for incl-usion
in the SCT investment program is based on three principal sources:
(a) The continuous road inventory of the national network carried
out by the Directorate for Maintenance, which provides
sufficiency ratings for the structural and geometric
characteristics of road sections;
(b) The "Esquema Director," which is a study of future capacity
requirements on the national network, last updated in 1980;
and
(c) The state offices of SCT and local and state authorities,
based on their observation of local road conditions and
knowledge of local development requirements.
Except in the case of reconstruction, normally complete road links between
major towns and cities are identified in the investment program, and priority
segments are selected within that link, for the annual works program. For
potential Bank-supported sub-projects, a summary data sheet is prepared
(Attachment 1).
B. Types of Projects Subject to Economic Evaluation
2.        The following types of works will be subject to economic
evaluation, the detail of the evaluation depending upon the type of work,
the level of investment and the complexity of variables which could affect
economic feasibility:
(a) upgrading of unpaved roads and construction of new roads;
(b) freeway construction and climbing lanes;
(c) urban bypasses;
(d) reconstruction and pavement overlays; and
(e) bridge construction and modernization.



-77-                             ANNEX 6
C. Analytical Approach of Economic Evaluation
3.        Upgrading of Unpaved Roads and New Road Construction:  The benefits
of such road works reflect reduced transport costs and time savings for
normal (in the case of upgrading), generated and diverted traffic. Net
maintenance costs are accounted for, depending upon the level of traffic and
the type of surface. A more detailed assessment of maintenance costs is
required for such works. For road sections which serve primarily
developmental purposes and for which vehicle operating costs and time savings
are insufficient, a producer surplus approach in terms of generated
development is to be applied.
4.        Freeway Construction and Climbing Lanes:  In Mexico, this is
considered under "modernization" and would include adding lanes to existing
roads. Congestion is the critical factor in evaluating such works, and the
benefits are mainly time savings from increased speeds and reduced vehicle
operating costs. Because the standard vehicle operating cost models do not
provide for calculating costs under congested conditions, an average factor
of 15% is to be applied to non-time related costs under free flow conditions
to reflect the cost of acceleration and deceleration. This factor varies by
the level of congestion (as defined in U.S. Highway Capacity Manual), with a
maximum of 25%. In addition, traffic conditions are to be distinguished
between peak and non-peak hours in determining speeds and operating costs
rather than using a simple daily average. Safety benefits have traditionally
not been calculated. Further review of such potential benefits will be
conducted by SCT.
5.        Urban bypasses:  With increasing "through" traffic, the need for
urban bypasses has grown. The widening of major interurban roads which run
through small towns would cause considerable community disruption, and
alternative alignments must be sought. Since the benefits involve reduced
congestion, the evaluation is similar to that for freeway projects. The
benefits, however, accrue to intracity traffic on the streets, from which
through-traffic was diverted as well as the traffic on the bypass.
Substantial indirect benefits, mainly environmental, are not taken into
account in the quantitative evaluation. An assessment of the "social" costs
of such works is to be included for sub-projects proposed for Bank
financing. The assessment considers the disruptive impact of the works
caused by the taking of property and the displacement of residents in the
right-of-way. The assessment is to present the volume and income
distribution of the displaced population, the procedures to be applied for
relocation and the probable relocation opportunities in terms of comparative
life-style and employment.
6.        Reconstruction and Pavement Overlays:  Traditionally, SCT did not
carry out economic evaluations of reconstruction and overlay investments.
Based on a technical evaluation, the appropriate investment was determined.
As part of the Highway Project a methodology will be developed based on the
results of the recent update of the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Model. General benefit indications will be derived, and a simplified
methodology will be established.



-78-                              ANNEX 6
7.        Bridge Construction:  Vehicle operating costs and time savings from
alternate routings are the major benefits calculated for bridge
construction. Benefits from raising maximum vehicle loads could provide
further benefits.
D. Major Analytical Parameters
8.        Vehicle Operating Costs:  SCT's vehicle operating cost model was
originally based on Dr. Winfrey's relationships and then adjusted over the
years. The system is currently being revamped taking into consideration work
conducted in Kenya and other countries and, in particular, the Bank's Highway
Design and Maintenance Model (HDM). Local prices excluding taxes (except for
fuel, para. 12) are applied, and vehicle utilization factors are under
review. A summary is provided in Table 1 of this Annex.
9.        Traffic:  SCT has an extensive permanent and seasonal traffic count
system. This system provides basic traffic data and is amplified by origin
and destination surveys when a project could cause a substantial shift in
historical traffic patterns or when a new alignment requires information on
what portion of the vehicles will remain on the former alignment because of
trip origins and destinations along that section. Generated traffic,
calculated in the opening year and then increased at the normal growth rate,
is derived by multiplying transport cost savings by an elasticity factor.
This represents the percentage increase in traffic in the opening year
because of the improvement. Forecasting the normal traffic growth rate
beyond the opening year of the project is based on reviewing historical
traffic patterns and relating traffic to other relevant parameters such as
population, vehicle ownership, etc., taking into account differentials for
the state, or, in readily identifiable cases, the immediate zone of
influence. Except in the case of urban bypasses and new road construction,
no additional sophistication in traffic estimating is required.  Emphasis is
placed on obtaining reliable traffic estimates for the opening year in order
to calculate the First Year Benefits ratio with an acceptable degree of
certainty.
10.       Speeds: Vehicle speeds have traditionally been derived from the
U.S. Highway Capacity Manual. SCT is now revising these calculations andl is
conducting surveys to test validity. Particularly in the case of toll roads
with parallel free road alternatives, care must be taken to account for
diversion to alternative roads as congestion increases and speeds decline,
rather than assuming that traffic has nowhere to go.
11.       Time Values:  SCT applies the minimum wage for bus and car
passengers traveling for work-related purposes. For car drivers, a value of
three times the minimum wage is applied for work-related trips to represent
the minimum-income required to own a car. No time values are applied for
leisure trips. Occupancy factors and trip purposes are determined based on
surveys carried out some years ago. A new survey is being conducted to
update time values, occupancy factors and trip-purpose breakdowns.
Consideration will be given to including a time value for non-work related
trips.



-79-                             ANNEX 6
12.       Shadow Prices:  SCT adjusts fuel prices to a level equivalent to
the opportunity cost of exporting refined products. For the opportunity cost
of capital, SCT uses a minumum of 12%.
13.       Feasibility Indices, Sensitivity and Risk Analysis:  For each
road work, SCT is to prepare an estimate of the First Year Benefit/Cost
Ratio, Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return. To test the
sensitivity of the evaluation, critical variables are to be adjusted in
accordance with possible alternative scenarios when uncertainty is
significant. In most cases, however, calculation of switching values will
serve as the basic sensitivity analysis. A program for calculating switching
values will be installed at SCT.
E. Program Optimization
14.       SCT is developing procedures to facilitate determining project
priorities and for revising designs, taking budgetary constraints into
account. This approach will lead to improved maximization of program
benefits rather than the present practice of focusing mainly on individual
project feasibility. A major effort needs to be made in methodically
selecting priority segments of longer road links and to programing the
completion of such segments to be able to generate benefits as early as
possible rather than awaiting the completion of the entire link or longer
segments. In this regard, analytical procedures need to be developed and
adopted.
