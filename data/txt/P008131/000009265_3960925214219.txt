MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Uruguay
Power Engineering Prolect (Loan 2484-UR)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on Uruguay - Power
Engineering Project (Loan 2484-UR)" prepared by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office, with Part II summarizing the Completion Report
prepared by the Borrower.
The project aimed at fostering institution building in the electric
power sector and at preparing a follow-up hydroelectric power plant
rehabilitation project (subsequently financed by the Bank under Loan 2622-UR
approved in 1985). Project implementation was delayed by more than three years
as a result of a cumbersome legislative process for loan approval and of
burdensome local procurement procedures.   However the studies and training
financed under the loan were ultimately successful in bringing about improvements
in the electric utility's (UTE) technical planning capabilities (for distribution
and operations) and in upgrading the managerial skills of its staff. The loan
also included standard financial ratio covenants (which is somewhat unusual for
a T.A. operation), but these were not fully complied with during the period of
project implementation -- although UTE's finances have reportedly improved in
recent years.
As the project was successful in achieving its primary institution-
building objectives, its outcome is rated as satisfactory, its institutional
development impact as substantial, and its sustainability as likely.
The PCR is thorough and informative. No audit is planned.

POWER ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2484-UR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Power
Engineering Project in Uruguay, for which Loan 2484-UR, in the amount of
US$4.0 million equivalent, was approved on January 8, 1985. The Borrower
was the Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas
(UTE). The Loan was closed on June 30, 1990, three years behind schedule.
It was fuUy disbursed, with the last disbursement on November 7, 1990.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and
Energy Division, Country Department IV, of Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office and are based, inter alia, on the Memorandum
and Recommendation of the President (MOP); the Loan and Guarantee
Agreement; supervision reports; a final report prepared by the
Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas (UTE);
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda. Part II of the report summarizes the portion prepared by the
Borrower. In a letter from the General Manager, Cr. Carlos Pombo, dated
June 21, 1993, UTE indicated its agreement with the contents of this report.

POWER ENGINEERING PROJECT
(LOAN 2484-UR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The objectives of the Project were to:
(a)   strengthen UTE's management to promote economy and
efficiency in its operation;
(b)   improve the quality of electricity services; and
(c)   enhance the rational use of electricity by consumers
(para. 3.1).
Implementation Experience
2.    The forecast completion date for the Project was June 30, 1987. The
actual completion date was November 1990, or, approxirnately three and a
half years later than the appraisal estimate. The Project was delayed for the
following reasons:
(a)   Loan effectiveness was delayed 14 months because Congress
was slow in approving the Loan Agreement; and
(b)   the selection of consultants and the procurement of goods was
much slower than anticipated.
Project Results
3.    The objectives of the Project were met. UTTE inproved its system
planning and tariff methodologies substantially and, most importantly,
management quality was enhanced.
4.    The Project's most important achievement was strengthening the
capacity for planning the operation and expansion of the system. In fact, the
resulting methodologies are being used to optimize the operation of hydro-
thermal plants, and were used in the preparation of the Rehabilitation of
Gabriel Terra and Power Modernization projects, which were subsequent
operations financed by the Bank.
Lessons Learned
5.    The most important lesson was the following:
At appraisal, the Bank should have reviewed carefully the
process to be followed for the selection of consultants as well
as the procurement of goods by the Borrower. This would
have uncovered the convoluted procedures of Uruguayan



- iii -
procurement laws, and might have expedited the process, e,g.,
by preparing the documentation in advance, by issuing
standard bidding documents (as was done in subsequent
projects), or by establishing a more realistic implementation
schedule.

PART r. PROJECT REVIEW  FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name:     Power Engineering Project
Loan Number:      2484-UR
RVP Unit:         Latin America and the Caribbean Region,
Country Department IV
Country:          Uruguay
Sector:           Energy
Subsector:        Electric Power
2.    Project Background
2.1   UTE is the sole entity responsible for generation, transmission, and
distribution of electricity in Uruguay. In 1990, the installed capacity was
1,594 MW, of which 1,196 MW was hydro (75%) and 398 MW (25%) was
thermal. The number of connections in 1990 was about 980,000 and the
degree of electrification was about 97%, among the highest in Latin
America.
2.2   At appraisal, studies undertaken by UTE demonstrated limited
hydroelectric potential and, thus, future fuel savings would have to be
addressed by: more efficient operation of UTE's generating plants and
distribution systems; loss reduction; system planning; and demand
management, through pricing policies based on marginal costs.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1   The basic objectives of the Project were to:
(a)   strengthen UTE's management to promote economy and
efficiency in its operation;
(b)   improve the quality of electrical services; and
(c)   enhance the rational use of electricity by consumers.
The Project was also intended to allow the Bank to continue an uninterrupted
dialogue with sector authorities once a new Govermnent took over and the
previous Fifth Power Project was completed.
3.2   To meet these objectives, the Bank and the Uruguayan power
authorities agreed to complete the following studies:
(a)   Distribution System Study. This study would improve
distribution system planning and establish design criteria for
upgrading the distribution systems' engineering. It would also
include technical and economic analysis of the electrical
network configuration below 30 kV and an analysis of the



- 2 -
convenience of using a grounded 380 V system or another, as
required, for low voltage instead of the existing 220 V system.
The study would also include: evaluation of a load-dispatching
distribution center; a loss reduction plan at medium-and low-
voltage levels; and the expansion and/or remodeling of the
distribution systems.
(b)   Operation Planning Study. This study would optimize the use
of water at the hydroelectric plants. It would be carried out in
three stages:
(i)  training courses in optimization and simulation
techniques, with application in investment selection and
electrical system operation models;
(ii)  development of a new operational model for UTE's
generation system; and
(iii)  development of a model for planning based on cost
optimization.
(c)   Training Program for Managerial Level Officers. This
training would involve a series of seminars which would take
place in three phases:
(i)  a management development seminar;
(ii)  development of job management teams; and
(iii)  development of managerial activities involving teams
from different areas of the organization. The program
would prepare instructors for training UTE's personnel.
(d)   Consultant Services for the Feasibility Study of the
Rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra Hydroplant. This study
would:
(i)  review the conditions of the plant;
(ii)  determine the technical and economic feasibility for its
rehabilitation; and
(iii)  estimate the cost of replacement of electromechanical
equipment, and repair of some minor civil works, to
improve the plant's efficiency and extend its useful life.
(e)   Implementation of a Revised Tariff Structure. To implement
the first stage of the consultants' recommendations from the
study based on marginal cost criteria. This would include the
installation of about 10,000 meters.
(f)    Purchase of Instruments. The Project would include the
purchase of:
(i)  electrical instruments to measure distribution losses;
(ii)  instruments for operation and maintenance of the
distribution system; and



- 3 -
(iii) other instruments to monitor deficiencies at the Gabriel
Terra Dam.
4.    Project Implementation
4.1   Loan Signature, Effectiveness, and Project Startup. Although
Loan 2484-UR was approved by the Board on January 8, 1985 and signed on
February 20, 1985, it was not declared effective until about a year and a half
later, on July 30, 1986. This delay was caused by difficulties in obtaining
Congressional approval for the loan. In fact, this was the first democratically
elected Congress in many years; therefore, legislative procedures were not
firmly established, and required lengthy discussions to decide whether or not
loan approval was necessary. This situation delayed the Project because
although UTE had moved forward with the preparation of documents, it did
not want to call for bids, as there was some risk that the Legislature would
not approve the Loan.
4.2   Implementation Schedule. The Project was originally scheduled to
be completed by June 30, 1987, but the majority of the original Project
components were not completed until November 1990, about three and a half
years later than originally scheduled. The hiatus was caused by a delay in
loan effectiveness (para. 4.1), and by the convoluted procedures of
Uruguayan procurement law which, among other things, allowed non-
awarded bidders to stop the bidding process by presenting complaints.
Following, is a summary of studies carried out by UTE:
(a)   Distribution Study. The first bidding process for the
selection of consultants for this study was cancelled because
there were some deficiencies in the bidding documents to
which the bidders objected. The second bidding process was
initiated in August, 1987 and the contract with a German
consultant was signed on October 5, 1988, and basically
completed by November 1989. The purpose of the study was
to:
(i) prepare a pre-feasibility study for the load distribution
center in Montevideo, which was necessary to improve
the safety operations and maintenance of the system;
(ii) establish the basic criteria for evaluating the distribution
network and defining the optimal level of voltage and
grid configuration;
(iii) determine whether or not it would be necessary to
abandon the existing distribution network due to its
technical obsolescence and dangerously low voltage,
since there is no "neutral" connection for consumers;
consider the installation of a completely new system
using a different scheme and voltage level; and



- 4 -
(iv)  determine the level of technical and non-technical
system losses, evaluate the causes, and determine the
measures recommended to reduce them.
(b)   Operation Planning Study. The contract for this study was
signed with a French consultant on August 18, 1987, and was
completed on January 31, 1988. The purpose of the study was
to:
(i)  improve the capability to elaborate technical and
economic feasibility studies of electrical projects and
expansion plans for electrical generation;
(ii)  prepare models to improve the policy of operation of
the hydro and thermal plants; and
(iii) prepare a program to estimate the marginal costs of the
electricity service. These studies and models were
developed with the direct participation of UTE's
engineers, so that there was a real transfer of
technology. The tools and knowledge have been
employed successfully in the preparation of the Power
Plant Rehabilitation and Power Modernization projects,
which are subsequent operations financed by the Bank.
(c)   Training Program for Managerial Level Officers. UTE
executed a training program for its professional staff through
seminars, courses, and visits to some Brazilian power utilities
with characteristics similar to those of UTE. The Brazilian
utilities had succeeded in solving some of the problems UTE
faced at Project implementation. UTE also developed, with
the assistance of the International Labor Organization, various
training activities to enhance the planning capability of its
Division of Human Resources, as well as courses to train
instructors. UTE considers all training which was undertaken
as satisfactory in enhancing its capability to deal with problems
faced by modem power utilities.
(d)   Feasibility Study of the Rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra
Hydroplant. The contract for this study was signed with a
French consultant on April 12, 1984. This study was financed
retroactively from Loan proceeds. The study was completed
satisfactorily on September 22, 1986. Its recommendations
included: the replacement of electromechanical equipment in
the power plant (generators, turbines, voltage and speed
regulators, 150-kV circuit breakers, and station service and
auxiliaries); replacement of some mechanical equipment at the
dam, and repair of minor civil works, both in the power house
and the dam. This study was part of the technical and
economic justification for the Power Plant Rehabilitation
Project.



- 5 -
(e)   Purchase of Equipment. Through various contracts, UTE
purchased 2,500 meters for double tariffs and 3,000 meters for
triple tariffs, as well as computer equipment for its data
processing center. The key dates of these contracts are
presented in Annex 5. The computer equipment was an
addition to the original Project components, financed with
surplus loan funds. UTE acquired a mainframe computer with
a capacity for 400 terminals (96 have been installed, so far)
and remote control to access information throughout the
country. UTE believes this equipment was fundamental for
the development of its management information system. UTE
had some problems with the quality and delivery of meters.
The bad quality of these meters, supplied by the manufacturer,
obliged UTE to postpone the final reception, thus creating an
issue which was solved satisfactorily by February 1993. The
multi-tariff system is an option offered to customers and its
installation depends on the consumers' choice. 250 triple-tariff
meters had been installed as of April 1993 (200 as of
December 31, 1992). UTE expects that installation of these
meters will be intensified in the future. No double-tariff meter
has been installed yet, due to changes in the tariff structure and
the need to purchase transformers for their installation. UTE
is in the process of acquiring these transformers.
4.3   Project Cost. The estimated cost of the Project at appraisal was
US$5.3 million. The actual cost was about US$7.1 million, as shown in
Table 6, Part Im, which represents a cost overrun of 26%. On one hand,
this cost overrun was due to the acquisition of computer equipment not
originally included in the Project; on the other hand, a lower than estimated
quantity of meters was purchased (3,000 meters instead of 10,000 meters).
4.4   Disbursements. The Loan's estimated and actual disbursements
(Table 3, Part I) reflect the Project's slow implementation. The original
closing date was June 30, 1987, but the Loan was not closed until June 30,
1990, after three extensions. However, the Bank honored disbursement
applications received after this date. The last disbursement took place on
November 7, 1990.
4.5   Loan Allocation. The original and actual disbursements by category
are shown in Table 4 of Part m. The original allocations were changed to
take actual implementation needs into account.
5.    Project Results
5.1   Meeting Project Objectives. The objectives of the Project were met.
UTE substantially improved its system planning and tariff methodologies and,
most importantly, management quality has been enhanced by the training
program which was undertaken.



- 6 -
5.2   Financial Performance. Annex 1 compares the actual and appraisal
forecast income statements, sources and applications of funds, balance sheets
and performance indicators for 1984 through 1990. UTE's financial
performance during the period was adequate, but not without some financial
strain.' Operating and financial indicators fell short of those which were
covenanted.2 The rate of return on revalued assets averaged 4.7% over the
period 1984-1988. It declined to 0.2% in 1989, and 3.8% in 1990, values
which were lower than 6% which was covenanted for the period. The debt-
service coverage ratio ranges from 0.5 to 1.3, compared to the covenanted
ratio of 1.5. This obliged UTE to negotiate medium-term loans from the
Central Bank to finance its debt service. Contributions to investment were
close to the covenanted ratio of 60%, except during 1985 and 1989, which
showed negative values. The debt-equity ratio, which deteriorated due to the
incorporation of debt from the El Palmar hydroelectric plant in 1983,
continued improving with its timely repayment, which was financed through
capitalization of the 10% tax on electricity sales.
5.3   The primary reasons for the inferior performance from 1984 to 1990
were:
(a)    higher-than-forecast energy losses (para. 5.4);
(b)   higher-than-expected inflation and devaluation;
(c)    a drought which affected the hydroelectric production in 1988
and 1989; and
(d)   lower-than-forecast energy sales (about 6% during this
period) .3
5.4   Power losses reached 20% in 1990 compared to 14% at appraisal.
The data for 1992 shows that losses increased to 21 %, and are largely
attributable to the poor condition of the Montevideo distribution network.
The Bank seems to have been optimistic when the target of reducing the loss
ratio from the 14% existing at appraisal was established.
5.5    Operating costs per kWh, expressed in January 1984 US dollars,
increased from US$0.039 in 1984 to US$0.051 in 1990, which represented
an increase in the average rate of about 4.2% p.a. Operating costs per kWh
seem to be adequate and reflect the low cost of energy purchased at the Salto
Grande Hydroelectric Plant. Operating costs increased substantially in 1988
and in 1989 because of an extremely dry season which reduced
hydrogeneration and obliged UTE to cut off electricity consumption and
increase thermal generation in 1988 and 1989 six and seven times,
respectively, beyond the 1987 level (Annex 4). Fuel expenses increased
I     The financial performance in recent years has improved, as recorded in Bank
supervision reports kept in the Bank's files.
2     The President's Report did not include annual key financial performance indicators.
3     The reduction in sales was also due to the rationing of electricity consumption that took
place in the period 1988-90.



accordingly from US$6.2 million in 1987 to US$37.8 million in 1988 and to
US$56.4 million in 1989.
5.6   Although UTE adjusted tariffs regularly, the actual average tariff
during the implementation period was, about US$0.053 compared to the
forecast of US$0.065, or a shortfall of about 18%. The Bank considered the
company's performance acceptable and did not exercise its right to make
UTE fully comply with the revenue covenants of the Loan Agreement. Later
information shows that this approach was appropriate, as UTE continued
adjusting its tariffs and thus improved its financial performance. The
following table shows the actual tariffs compared with the average medium-
run marginal cost (MRMC):
Actual and Average Medium-term Marginal Cost per Kwh (1992)
Actual      Marginal Cost      Variation
(US Cents)  (US Cents)         From MRMC
Residential   6.81       6.93               -1.7%
Commercial  7.47         6.22               20.1%
Industrial    5.90       5.70                3.5%
Large
Customers   3.93        4.60               -14.6%
5.7   As demonstrated in the above table, tariffs are generally in line with
the medium-run marginal cost, except the tariffs for commercial and large
customers, which are 20% above and 15% below, respectively, the MRMC.
This is something that UTE needs to review soon in order to give a correct
signal to the consumers about the economic price of electricity.
5.8   The accounts receivable maintained a level close to the 75-days-of-
billing covenanted. The shortfall with respect to the covenant of this
financial indicator was caused by the accounts receivable of government
institutions, which maintained an extraordinarily high level over the loan
period. The level ranged between 171 and 350 billing days. Although,
Govermment bills represented only about 15% of total billings, this was an
element of concern to Bank missions, which urged UTE and the Government
to solve this problem. Beginning in July 31, 1990, a clearing mechanism was
implemented which is working satisfactorily. Likewise, UTE should be
given credit for its good performance with respect to accounts receivable for
private customers, which was maintained within less than two months of
billing from 1984 to 1990 (Annex 5).
5.9   Inventories during the period of project execution represented about
3 % of net assets in operation, a level that appears adequate. Furthermore, in
1991, UTE started to take actions to improve the management of inventories,
which was one of the issues detected during appraisal. However, UTE needs



- 8 -
to continue working in this area, because some deficiencies still remain.
This is one of the reasons for the qualified opinion on the 1991 audit issued
by external auditors.
5.10 Project Impact. The Project had a beneficial impact on UTE's
development. It strengthened its capacity to plan the operation and expansion
of the system. The resulting methodology is presently used to optimize the
operation of the hydro-thermal plants and prepare expansion plans for
generation. The methodology was successfully tested in the preparation of
the Rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra and the Power Modernization Projects,
subsequent operations financed by the Bank.
6.    Project Sustainability
6.1  It is expected that the institutional development fostered by the Project
will continue to produce adequate benefits for UTE. Management and staff
have become more conscious of the need to conduct the company as a
business-like institution.
7.    Bank Performance
7.1   Bank participation in the Project was satisfactory. The Bank made
positive contributions during project preparation by identifying the areas of
the UTE organization that required improvement. During the implementation
period, the Bank gave professional advice regarding UTE's engineering,
organization, and finances. The Bank was flexible in its approval of
additions to Project components (computers for UTE's data processing
center) and in accepting the Tribunal de Cuentas as UTE's external auditor.
8.    Lessons Learned
8.1   The principal lesson is summarized below:
At appraisal, the Bank should have reviewed carefully the
process to be followed for the selection of consultants, as well
as the procurement of goods by the Borrower. This would
have uncovered the convoluted procedures of Uruguayan
procurement laws, and might have expedited the process,
e.g. by preparing the documentation in advance and by issuing
standard bidding documents (as was done in subsequent
projects), or by establishing a more realistic implementation
schedule.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1   UTE's performnance during project implementation was good.
However, it was not diligent enough during project implementation, which
was delayed by about three and a half years. UTE also did not meet revenue



-9-
covenants; in some years, the utility was unable to cover its debt service with
internally generated funds, and power losses increased substantially. This
was mainly due to higher-than-expected inflation and devaluation, as well as
the drought that affected the country in 1988 and 1989. Likewise, the
company failed to submit the annual audit reports on a timely basis, and they
were generally issued with qualified opinions. However, in 1991, UTE
substantially reorganized the company and has been implementing an
institutional development program aimed at improving the overall efficiency
of its operations and strengthening its distribution and commercialization
activities. As a first step, UTE entered into a twinning contractual agreement
with a Spanish power utility to gain access to the commercial, administrative,
and engineering technology of a more developed utility. A new economic
and financial system is being implemented.
10.   Project Relationship
10.1 The Bank's relationship with the Government and UTE during the
Project was good.
11.   Consultant Services
11.1 Three consulting firms (one German and two French) participated in
the preparation of the distribution, operational planning, and feasibility study
of the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra Hydroplant. UTE rated the consultant
services as good. Bank staff, who supervised the Project, agreed with the
rating.
12.   Project Documentation and Data
12.1  The Loan Agreement was adequate for achieving Project objectives
and the Memorandum and Recommendation of the President (MOP) provided
a useful framework to both the Bank and UTE for review of Project
implementation. The Loan provided the flexibility necessary for introducing
changes in Project components.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE4
1.    Objectives Achieved and Not Achieved
1.1   UTE believes that the main objectives of the Project were achieved.
The studies included in the Project--operating system, the distribution and
rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra hydroplant--were completed, with some
delays.
1.2   The operation system study was intended:
(a)   to improve the policy of operation of the hydro and thermal
plants;
(b)   to improve the capacity to elaborate expansion plans for
electricity generation and feasibility studies of electric projects;
and
(c)   to estimate the marginal costs of the electricity service on an
on-going basis.
1.3   The Distribution study permitted:
(a)   elaboration on a pre-feasibility study of the load dispatch
distribution center;
(b)   development of basic criteria to evaluate the status of the
network, and to define the optimal level of tension, equipment
requirements, and works necessary to upgrade the grid; and
(c)   development of a methodology to estimate the level of
technical and non-technical system losses, evaluate the causes,
and determine the measures recommended to reduce them.
1.4   The study for the rehabilitation of Gabriel Terra Hydroplant
elaborated on the feasibility study for rehabilitating this plant. This study
becatne part of the technical and economic justification for the Power Plant
Rehabilitation Project financed by the Bank.
1.5   Even though UTE considers the studies fully successful, it also
believes that there are some aspects of the studies which could be improved.
For instance, the operation system study could be improved to make it more
flexible to represent long-term dry hydrological years, to handle imports and
exports of electricity involving more than one country, and to handle gas and
combined cycle turbines. UTE has continued improving these methodologies
and models, and considers that the capability to do this is one of the most
important gains it obtained from the Project, which is possible thanks to the
real transfer of technology that took place from the international consultants
in the process of elaborating the studies.
4     This Part has been summarized from the Project Completioa Report prepared by UTE.

2.    Problems Faced by the Project
2.1   There was about a three-year delay in completing the distribution
study. It was caused by the cancellation of the first bidding process because
of objections received from some of the bidders during the decision-to-award
phase. This required modification of the bidding documents and a call for
another bid. UTE considers that this delay affected its ability to undertake
works to renovate the networks and, consequently, to establish a basis for
implementing a program to reduce power losses. There was also a delay of
approximately three-and-a-half years in the purchasing and installation of
electrical meters. This was due to deficiencies in the bidding documents, and
some minor defects in the triple-tariff meters, which were remedied by
October 1992, and the double-tariff meters, which were remedied by
February 1993. The lags in delivery of the meters also delayed the plan for
implementation of the hourly tariff to large customers.
3.    Performance of Consultants and Suppliers
3.1   UTE considers the performance of the consultants and suppliers that
participated in the Projects good.
4.    Project Implementation Schedule
4.1   UTE considers the time scheduled for elaboration of the distribution
study too short, given the volume and complexity of the work. Moreover, at
that time, UTE did not have all the required information, making it necessary
to work intensively to prepare the basic data from different areas of
Montevideo.
