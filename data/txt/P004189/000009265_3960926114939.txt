MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF 7HE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC FOR A SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the Lao
People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for SDR 11.1 million (US$14.1 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, and help finance a Southern
Transport Project.
2.        Background.  The high costs of movement along Lao PDR's severely de-
teriorated road system is a major impediment to the development of this very
poor country. Lao PDR has allocated as much as 7.5% of its GDP (and 30% of
its investment budget) to transport, but until recently has given priority to
the construction of new roads. In part influenced by IDA' . transport sector
review (Report No. 6419-LA, dated September 1986), the Government now intends
to give major emphasis to the rehabilitation and urgently needed maintenance
of its existing network. This st:ategy is also being supported by other do-
nors, including the Asian Development Bank. Route 13 is the most important
road to support development of the economy of Lao PDR. It is the sole trans-
port artery linking the country from Luang Prabang in the north to the river
port of Veune Kham in the south, a dist:ance of about 1,500 km.  This road was
built several decades ago to asphalt pavement standards, but is now beyond its
econumic life. In addition, due to the lack of maintenance, it is now in ex-
tremely poor condition. The part of Route 13 from Savannakhet Province to
Champassak Province (270 km) connects cities and agricultural areas and could
be used to carry agriculture surpluses from the southern provinces to the de-
ficit areas in the north. Currently, transport of goods is extremely diffi-
cult and costly because the road section is in a state if severe disrepair.
Extensive spot repairs, regraveling, drainage and localized improvements will
be required to render it readily passable by vehicies at all times.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is prim-rily intended to
support improvements to an economically critical road section and to strengt-
hen capabilities for planning and executing road maintenance on a continuing
basis. It is designed to: (a) carry out a program of needed repairs and
maintenance on Route 13 between Savannakhet and Champassak Provinces;
(b) strengthen the maintenance capacity of Road and Bridge Maintenance
Societies (RBMSs) working in Savannakhet, Saravane, and Champassak provinces;
and (c) carry out a series of transport improvement and project preparation
studies. The project is also intended to enhance benefits expected to accrue
from the Association-financed Agriculture Rehabilitation and Development Proj-
ect (Credit 1197-LA of 1982 for US$15 million) by improving roads to facili-
tate the movement of goods in the project area.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project will include:  (a) spot
improvements of the existing pavement and drainage systems on about 270 km of
Route 13 in Savannakhet, Saravane and Champassak provinces; (b) procurement of
road maintenance and mechanical workshop equipment, bridge panels and con-
struction materials; and (c) consultant services through a Technical Support
Team to assist in procurement and project implementation and also to carry out
the transport studies. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project



-2-
processing events and the status of Association operations in Lao PDR are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6753-LA dated August 31, 1987, is being distributed
separately.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involv6ment.  Discussions in the context of the
preparation of the Country Economic Memorandum (No. 6070-LA, July 1986) and
the Transport Sector Note (No. 6419-LA, September 1986) indtLcated that the
Government had increased the capacity of the provinces to carry out the main-
tenance on the heaviest travelled sections of Route 13, which connect cities
and agricultural areas, by providing more resources. This measure was in line
with the strategy identified by the Association for the sector. It is now
appropriate for the Association to assist the Government in removing major
transport bottlenecks, thereby encouraging increases in production and move-
ment of goods that would stimulate economic development. This assistance will
constitute the first IDA-financed transport project in Lao PDR.
6.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement was obtained from the Government during
negotiations on the folliwing: (a) selection of the consultants for the
Technical Support Team as a condition of credit effectiveness; (b) execution
of annual traffic counts on Route 13 between Vientiane and Pakse and between
V'3entiane and Luang Prabang; (c) provision of adequate counterpart funds for
the project; (d) provision of maintenance funding to cover expenditure on
newly rehabilitated roads in the project provinces; and (e) improvement of the
project road in accordance with the appropriate design standards.
7.        Justification.  Quantifiable economic benefits from the project are
savings in vehicle operating costs and transport costs as a result of improve-
ments to the north/south road link in an area where the Mekong River is not
commercially navigable. The availability of a better road is expected to
stimulate increases in internal and external trade flows and to allow the
trucking industry to be more productive because trucks will be able to carry
full loads.
8.        Risks.  The major project risk involves possible delays in implemen-
tation due to the use of ICB. To minimize this risk, appropriate consultants
assistance is included in the project and IDA assistance and supervision will
also be provided at all stages. It is unlikely that traffic growth will be
lower than estimated since road transport is at such an early stage of devel-
opment in Lao PDR and also because there is no better transport alternative in
the project area. The risk is, therefore, very low that the rate of return
will fall below the estimate.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
