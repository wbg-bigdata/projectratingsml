IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT (Credit no. 1846-LA)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Southern Transport Project in Lao P.D.R.
for which Credit No. 1846-LA in the amount of SDR 11.1 mnillion (US$14.1 million equivalent) was approved on
December 18, 1987 and made effective on June 22, 1988.
The credit was closed on December 31, 1994, three years beyond the original closing date of December 1991.
The final disbursement took place on January 5, 1995 at which time the remaining balance of US$ 99,453.32
was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Ephrem Asebe, Consultant, EAIIN, Iffrastructure Operations Division of
the East Asia & Pacific Region, Country Departnent I and reviewed by Vineet Nayyar, Infiastructure Division
C hief and the Acting Project Adviser, Mr. Mohammad Farhandi. The borrower provided comments that are
included in the appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was initiated during the Bank's completion mission in February 1995. It is based
on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the ICR by contributing views
reflected in the mission's aide-memoire, preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and comunenting
on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT
(Credit No. 1846-LA)
Introduction:
i.     The Southem Transport Project (STP) was the first Intemational Development Association (IDA)
financed transport sector operation in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (P.D.R.). STP was initiated as a
result of the dialogue between IDA and Lao P.D.R. Government concerning transport policy irnprovements in the
context of the preparation of the Economic Memorandum (Report No. 6070-La of 1986) and the Transport
Sector Note (Report No. 6419-La of 1986) which facilitated appropriate sector analysis and identification of high
priority projects.
ii.    In 1986, at about the time of the identification phase of the STP, the Govemment of Lao P.D.R.
launched its economic reform knownn as the New Economic Mechanism (NEM). NEM was designed to give a
greater role to market forces to allocate resources and encourage private sector development to further economic
development; liberalization of inter-provincial trade and increase its agricultural productivity. The STP rationale
was, therefore, supporting the NEM.
Objectives
iii.    The project was designed to: a) carry out repairs and maintenance of 1hghwav 13 in the provinces of
Savannakhet, Saravanne and Champassak; b) strengthen the maintenance capacity of the three provincial Road
and Bnrdge Maintenance Societies (RBMSs); and c) complete studies for future transport development.
Specifically, the project consisted of: (i) spoL improvements to the existing pavement and drainage systems,
including bnrdges on about 270 km of Route 13 between Savannakhet and Pakse in Savannakhet, Saravane, and
Champassak provinces; (ii) procurement of road maintenance and workshop equipment, and road and bridges
construction materials, and (iii) provision of consulting services to assist in procurement, project implementation,
and also to carry out a senres of transport improvement and project preparation studies. Following substantial
fulfillment of the original objectives, the Association and the Government agreed to utilize the balance of the
credit for procurement of additional equipment and to provide bituminous surface treatment on about 20 km of
the previously improved road. About half of the remaining unpaved section of the road will be upgraded to a
bituminous surface standard under the Second Highway Improvement Project (Cr. 2606-LA).
iv.    The objectives of the STP were focused, realistic and m line with the Association's Country Assistance
Strategy and the country's priorities. The timing also coincided wvith the Government reforms under NEM which
IDA had been encouraging in its macro-economic dialogue with the government. The establishment of a Project
Implementation Office (PIO) consisting of a project manager, as well as the Technical Support Team (TST)
consisting of experienced engineers was helpful during project implementation. The project objectives were also
supported by the National Transport Study (NTS), financed by United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
with the Association serving as executive agency. This study helped lay the foundation for future IDA
involvement in the sector.



11i
Implementation Experience and Results
v.     The project has substantially achieved its overall objectives and in some areas exceeded them
significantly, despite initial unfamiliarity of Government With Bank procurement procedures and subsequent
postponement of its closing date by three years as a result of the expanded scope of the rehabilitation works. On
balance, there is strong evidence that the project is likely to be sustainable as the Ministry of Communuications,
Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) has been able to benefit from the experience gained and replicate the
works on a nationwide basis. This commitment has been further demonstrated in the preparation of the Second
Highway Improvement Project (Credit 2606-LA) which also focuses on road maintenance and rehabilitation. The
country's macro-economic policy environment also favors the sustainabilitv of the road project. Lao P.D.R. under
its NEM reform program has achieved remarkable success in stabilizing its economy, and in shifting from central
planning to a market based growth strategy. However, fiscal constraints and shortage of trained and experienced
local manpower and institutional capacity are likely to remain constraints on effective planning and execution of
projects in the road sector for the medium term.
vi.    The project's cost as estimated at appraisal was US$15.1 million of which the US$14.1 million
equivalent (SDR   11. I million) was to be financed by IDA and the US$ 1.1 million by the Government. The initial
closing date was set at December 3 1, 1991. However, due to a number of factors, by the initial closing date only
72% of the credit amount had been disbursed. The key factors which affected timely achievement of the
development objectives included initial delays in credit effectiveness, equipment procurement, local purchases,
and delays caused by rains and flood which destroved two key bridges, extension of the agreement to carry out
pilot projects, and shortages of local funds, including salaries for the Road and Bridges Socicties.
vii.    The Associatijn has performed satisfactorily, given its initial limited experience in Lao P.D.R.'s
transport sector institutions. The identification phase of the project was carried out in a very satisfactory manner.
However, during the preparation phase, the Association underestimated the Borrower's lack of understanding of
Association procedures, particularly with respect to International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The appraisal also
underestimated traffic volumes, which became apparent after a first program of spot improvements and after
about 53 km of roads had been regravelled during the first quarter of 1990. During this penrod traffic on the
maintained road had nrsen to 200 vehicles per day of which about 50% were trucks, a level of traffic originally
anticipated to occur only in 1996. Howvever, the appraisal wvas correct in stating that traffic growth wvould not be
lower than estimated. Overall supervision was highly satisfactorv, being handled principallv by an expenrenced
highway engineer, wIth occasional support from an economist. Relations with the Borrower and consultants were
cordial and productive.
vii.   Given that this was the first IDA financed project in the sector, the Borrower has generally performed
satisfactorily. Government had identified the project as a high pnronrtv for implementation during its five-year
Plan (1986/90). Through changes in the legal status of the Road and Bnrdges Maintenance Societies (RBMSs),
the Borrower transformed the scope of those provincial maintenance units (RBMSs), first to participate
throughout the country, and subsequently to be combined into one, with the ultimate objective of forming a semi-
autonomous enterpnse. The Borrower carried out the NTS study to serve as a starting point in the development
of a national transport sector strategy, and established a Transportation Planning Unit (TPU) in Ministry of
Communications, Transport, Post and Communications (MCTPC) from among its staff *vho had participated in
the study.



iv
ix.    On balance, the project outcome can be considered as satisfactorv. The post implementation economic
rate of return (ERR) was estimated to be 72% compared to 18% at appraisal. Procurement of the planned
equipment was carried out at about 80% of the estimated basic cost, and the level of improvement was upgraded
to gravel standard, rather that the originally planned spot improvements.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key lessons Learned
x.     Despite conscious efforts and considerable resource outlays to minimize risks and assure timely
implementation of the project, the project implementation was extended for three years. The original scope was
substantially completed within schedule, though the Government subsequently requested the Association to
consider providing a bituminous surface to the road due to the increasing volumes of traffic and the high cost of
maintenance on the newly graveled road. As mentioned earlier, the onrginalv planned spot improvements were
expanded to include much more regravelling and this combined with the preparations to carry out bituminous
surfacing required three extensions to the closing date.
xi.    The Project's future operation plan is to continue with the program  of spot improvements and
maintenance as an interim solution while the national network is being reconstructed mostly with foreign
assistance. This strategy is being followed under the ongoing Highwav Improvement and Second H-ighwvay
Improvement Projects. Under these projects, the plan is to provide the following over a five year-period: (a)
continuous upgrading of the capacity for and execution of a maintenance program on the arterial road network; b)
training and development programs for the commercialization of the State Enterprise (SE) created under the
Second Highway Improvement Project; c) improvement, including bituminous surfacing, over a five year penrod
of about 135 km of the Savannakhet-Pakse road, and the rehabilitation of temporary bridges; and d) technical
assistance to MCTPC; and training of MCTPC staff..
xii.   The main lessons to be drawn from the experience of implementation of the project are:
a)   that the complex and time consuming government administrative and procurement procedures
involved with ICB procurement should have been anticipated and that technical assistance should
have been considered to supplement the Borrower's weak institutional capacity.
b)   that more authority should be delegated to the line ministry to manage the project, particularly
with regard to disbursement matters.
c)   that the implementation process helped to evolvq a prototype of an acceptable and possibly a
sustainable approach to privatization of the construction sector in Lao P.D.R.; and
d)   that the basis of future cumulative progress in the sector should be based on careful planning of
the next phase, based on a clear asscssment of what is absorbed by those involved in the
implementation process.






LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT (CREDIT 1846-LA)
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION REPORT
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.     Background and Statement of Objectives: The Lao People's Democratic Republic is a landlocked
developing country in Indochina, stretching about 1700 km north to south and 100 to 400 km east to west. Lao
P.D.R., with a population of about 4 million and an area of some 236,800 square kilometer, has a very low
population density of about 16 persons per square kilometer. The country is 80% rugged terrain and 20% flood
prone lowland plains, and the adjacent flat-to-gently undulated uplands have heavy rainfall. The Mekong River
flows through the entire north-south of the country, while some ten small rivers flow east to west. Settlement is
disbursed in about 11,000 villages. Per capita income is about US$ 230. Its economy is small and lacks
diversification, with agriculture providing some 56% of GDP.
2.     These physical and socio-economic factors have made the provision of internal and external
communications difficult and costly. In 1993 the transport system of Lao P.D.R. comprised some 5,918 paved,
4,622 graveled, and 5,943 earth roads; 1,190 km of navigable section of the Mekong River including three major
river ports, a small gasoline supply pipeline from Vietnam, a number of smaller provincial and municipal ports,
one international airport, and some 12 small airfields. Road transport awcounts for about 90% of the freight
traffic (ton-km) and 85% of the passenger-km and river transport carries about 10% of both ton-km and
passenger-km. Air transport handles about 5% of the passenger-km.
3.     The Southem Transport Project was the first IDA financed project in the transport sector. The project
evolved as a result of the Association's dialogue with the Lao P.D.R. Government concerning transport policy
improvements in the context of preparation of the Country Economic Memorandum (Report No. 6070-LA of
July 1986) and a Transport Sector Note (Report No. 6419-LA of September 1986). The Transport Sector Note
identified the Association's strategy for the transport sector and the most important links in the road network to be
routes 13 and 9.
4.     In 1986, at abcut the time of the identification phase of STP, the Govemment of Lao P.D.R. launched its
economic reform known as the New Economic Mechanism. NEM Nwas designed to give a greater role to market
forces to allocate resources and encourage the private sector to further economic development, liberalization of
inter-provincial trade and increase agricultural productivity. STP had, therefore, its rationale of supporting these
overall objectives.
5.     The objectives of the project were to: a) carry out repairs and maintenance of Highway 13 between the
cities of Savannakhet and Pakse traversing the provinces of Savannakhet, Saravanne and Champassak; b)
strengthen the maintenance capacity of the three provincial Road and Bridge Maintenance Societies; and c)
complete studies for future transport development. In addition to achieving these objectives, the project was also
intended to enhance benefits expected to accrue from the Association-financed Agriculture Rehabilitation and
Development Project (Credit 1197-LA of 1982 for US$15.0 million) by improving the roads to facilitate the
movement of goods in the project arca. More specifically, the project consisted of: (i) spot improvements to the
existing pavement and drainage systems including bridges on about 270 km of Route 13 in Savannakhet,
Saravane and Champassak provinces. (ii) procurement of road maintenance and workshop equipment, and road
and bridge construction matenrals; and (iii) provision of consulting services to assist in procurement, project
implementation, and to carry out transport improvement and project preparation studies.



2
6.     Following substantial fulfillment of the original objective, vwith under utilized balances resulting from
cost savings in the equipment procurement, the Association and the Government agreed to utilize the balance of
the credit to finance the procurement of additional equipment, upgrading of the road to gravel standard and
provided a bituminous surface treatment on about 20 km of the road as a pilot project for further improvement
under a subsequent project.
7.     Evaluation of Objectives - The objectives of the STP wvere focused, realistic and in line with the
Association's assistance strategy as fornulated at the time . The project attempted to improve traffic flows on one
of the country's most important export-import road links. The project was also responsive to the development
prionies of the country. The objectives basically corresponded with the Government priorities, as identified in its
Second Five-Year Development Plan (1986-1990), which included: maintain ng the key stretches of Route 13 and
other roads linking agricultural surplus areas with deficit regions; b) rehabilitating and constructing rural access
roads in agriculture areas; imnproving the maintenance capability of the central and provincial organizations; and
improving selected ports on the Mekong River to handle increasing cargo volumes. The timing also coincided
with the Government embarking on its market oriented reforns under NEM, which IDA had been supporting.
The establishment of a Project Implementation Office (PIO) consisting of a project manager, as well as the
technical support team compnrsed of experienced engineers was helpful. In anticipation of future needs, the
project objectives supported the execution of a National Transport Study (NTS) study, financed by UNDP, wlith
the Association servmg as executive agency.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
8.     The project has substantially achieved its overall objectives, and in some areas cxceeded them
significantly, in spite of problems encountered during implementations and subsequent extensions of its closing
date by three years.
9.     Civil works objective - The upgrading of the Savannakhet-Pakse road has won the satisfaction of the
population and the Government. Travel time has been reduced from 15 hours or two days to 4 hours between the
two cities. Instead of the planned spot improvement works, the road has been re-surfaced with gravel along most
of its length. The road continues to receive routine maintenance so that a travel speed of 90 km per hour can be
maintained. Also, about 20 km of Double Bituminous Surface Treatment (DBST) has been constructed in Pakse
and Savannakhet, on the basis of a pilot program of DBST surfacing planned under a follow-up operations. The
recalculated ERR is 72% compared to 18% at appraisal.
10.    Procurement of equipment and workshop objectives - The objective of strengthcning the maintenance
capacity of RBMSs through the procurement of road maintenance and mechanical workshop equipment, and
road and bridge construction materials was executed with substantial savings from the initial estimates, but with
five month delays. Most of the equipment and vehicles are still in good working order and have been extensivcly
used during the last five years. Additional surfacing equipment was procured to equip the construction enterprise
in Savannakhet to undertake the pilot paving component, and to be equipped to carry out further upgrading of
Route 13 South under a follow-up project.
11.    Consultants Services - In addition to the techmcal assistance for project implementation, the project as
originally conceived included a series of transport improvement and project preparation studies. However, after
the project was approved, Government was able to obtain grant funds from the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) to carry out a National Transport Study (NTS), therebv obviating the need for the senes of
studies referred to as the National Transport Improvement Studies in the staff appraisal report. Funds available
under this category were used for the preparation of follow-up projects including the feasibility and design of the
Namkading-Savannakhet road which formed the basis of the Highway Improvement Project approved in March



3
1991. The National Transport Study was successfully completed and the study team has been constituted into a
permnanent Transport Planning Unit (TPU) wvithin the MCTPC Nwith technical assistance financed by the
Association under the First and Second Highway Improvement Projects, (Credits 2218 and 2606-LA). The
Technical Support Team that provided assistance to the Enterprises in execution of the road works successfully
completed its contract for road rehabilitation and installation of the three equipment maintenance workshops.
12.   In addition to the aforementioned explicitly stated objectives, whose performance indicators in the SAR
are in terms of ERR (%). implementation cost and time, the project has also contributed to the achievement of the
following objectives of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
13.    Sector Policy -  The National Transport Study (NTS) study provided a framework for policy
formulation and implementation, institutional development, planning and implementation, determining priority
investment needs, defining a detailed investment, and operation and maintenance program for 1991-1995;
formulated an outline of a  development program for 1996-2000, formulated efficient sector policies, and
identified projects for foreign financing. An internal review of the implementation of the action plans proposed
under NTS showed that they have served as a basis of policy guidance and that significant progress has been
achieved, principally where external assistance had been available.
14.   Institutional Policy - There was also substantial achievement in the area of institutional policy following
the establishment of the TPU within the MCTPC. In addition, the RBMSs were first transformed into semi-
autonomous enterprises able to contract nationwide and the three project RBMSs are being incorporated into one
state construction enterprise to operate on a commercial basis. Finally, job training was provided to equipment
operators and mechanics working for the RBMS.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
15.    There were several factors which resulted in project delays and postponement of the closing date by three
years. First, there were delays in meeting credit effectiveness due to Government's delays in submitting a Legal
Opinion and in selecting consultants for technical assistance. In addition, delays resulted from Government's
unfamilian'ty with Bank ICB procedures. This was compounded by unusual rains and flooding at the start of the
project. Initial delays in project start-up can be attributed partially to government administrative procedures, and
to the implementing agencies lack of understanding of international competitive bidding procurement procedures.
The impact of these initial delays was felt throughout the entire project execution phase as it was impossible to
catch-up the time lost. Initially, the issuance of bidding documents and invitations to bid for equipment and
materials resulted in delays of five months (September 1987 to February 1I88). Because equipment had arrived
in May 1988, instead of December 1987 as planned, the result was the practical loss of the 1988 dry season
(October/November to May/June). As a result, full operation did not occur until 1989. The extension, to
undertake a pilot project on about 20 km of DBST works required procuring additional equipment for the newly
consolidated construction enterprise. Here too, similar delays were experienced. Procurement delays are not,
however, limited to international procurement. Lack of timely procurement and delivery of locally procured spare
parts for equipment, diesel oil and construction material such as cement were also causes for work stoppage.
Allocation of inadequate funds to pay local salaries and/or delays in payments to RBMSs were frequent and also
contributing factors.
16.    Frequent heavy rains which sometimes arrived or stopped late in the season and the severe flood at the
end of 1991 wst season, which demolished two large bridges at Sei Bang Hung and Sei Bay Naune, respectively
were also contributing factors. Because of the emergency works to rebuild the bridges, the re-gravelling required
on the final 50 km of the road had to be postponed until the next dry season.



4
17.    On the positive side, the price of equipment was below the appraised estimates, and the Technical
Support Team (TST), specifically the mechanical engineer, whose performance in training the mechanics and
equipment operators contributed to reduced breakdowns and extending the life of the road equipment.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
18.    On balance, the evidence is that the project is likely to be sustainable. The Government has shown a
strong commitment to continuing the effort begun under the project anld the incentive to maintain and upgrade
Route 13 remains strong both economically and politically as it is a link considered vital to the country, linking
the agriculturally rich south to the deficit north. As it was realized that traffic volumes on the project road had
more than doubled after the initial improvement in 1989, Government seriously considered upgrading the road to
bituminous standard. The justification has been clearly demonstrated and a follow-up project to finance the
bitumninous surfacing of 135 km of the 270 km of the original project length has been included under the Second
Highway Improvement Project (Cr. 2606-LA) approved in 1994.
19.    The country's policy environment also favors the sustainability of the road project. Lao P.D.R. under its
NEM reform program has achieved remarkable success in stabilizing its economy, and in shifting from central
planning to a market based growth strategy. Inflation has been reduced to single digit levels; the exchange rate has
been stable for the last five years, foreign direct investment is positive, and export growvth has exceeded
expectations. All these factors favor the probability of maintaining the achieved standard of travel speed on the
road achieved through the rehabilitation under the project.
20.    However, there are at least two probable conditions which may limit the government's capacity to assure
sustainability.  The first relates to fiscal constraints. During the project implementation period when the
Government's contribution in local costs was limited to only about 15% of the project, timely funding of local
salaries was often a problem, and the Association had to intervene on behalf of the RBMSs. Moreover, the main
source of growth of the economy is agriculture with 56% of GDP. And the vulnerability of agriculture to the
vagaries of the weather may limit the government's financial capacity. Second, a shortage of trained and
experienced local manpower and institutional capacity is likely to remain a constraint on effective planning and
execution of projects in the road sector for some time. Despite these potential and real problems, the overall
judgment is that the project will most likely be sustainable.
E. ASSOCIATION PERFORMANCE
21.    Identification - The Association's identification of the project wvas highly satisfactory. The Government
considers National Route 13 to be the backbone of the country's road network. It connects the agricultural
surplus producing southern part of the country with the deficit north. It is vital to trade with Thailand and
Vietnam. The Bank's mission as defined in its Transport Sector Note (September 1986) identified the major
issues and constraints in the Lao P.D.R. transport to be rooted in more general macroeconomic constraints, the
most important being: extremely low levels of the urbanization and commercialization and the related problems of
efficiencies related to small scale activities in the sectors; limited domestic savings; limited foreign exchange for
investments; and limited domestic implementation capacity because of skills shortages. Accordingly, the main
area for IDA support in the transport sector were identified to be (i) road maintenance (ii) equipment
maintenance: (iii) road rehabilitation and construction; (iv) distribution of major commodities; and (v) river
transport. Contemporaneously, the Government had announced its NEM reform. Thus, the Association's
justification for involvement in Lao P.D.R.'s macroeconomy and transport sector was based on the government
moving in the direction of its NEM reform. Accordingly, IDA's strategy and the country's priorities were



5
consistent and the Association's contribution in the project identification phase of the project cycle wvas highly
satisfactory.
22.    Preparation - The risk of dclays in implementation due to the use of ICB was anticipated and teclhical
assistance was provided. In spite of this recognition, it tumed out that the implementation schedule under
estimated the time required to carry out procurement procedures according to loosely defined Government
procedures. Issuance of bidding documents were delayed, which in tum postponed project commencement until
well into the rainy season. The critical loss of the dry season hindered construction activities to such a degree,
that project implementation was delayed by at least a year; preparation othenvise wvas satisfactor,.
23.    Appraisal - There was underestimation in forecasting traffic, though overall, the appraisal was
satisfactory. After carrying out the initial spot improvement program and re-gravelling on about 53 km of road
during the first quarter of 1990, it become apparent that traffic on the maintained road had risen to about 200
vehicles per day of which 50% were trucks. This level exceeded the traffic forecast for 1996. The appraisal was
coiTect in stating that traffic growth would not be lower than estimated, though the margin of error was on the
high side. The MCPTC was advised that with over 200 vehicles per day, maintaining a satisfactorv level of
service with gravel roads could only be achieved with a high and costly' level of maintenance, otherwise a
bituminous surfacing was warranted. While work proceeded as initially planned, the idea of adding a bituminous
surface to the road was suggested, leading ultimately to its inclusion as a pilot project for some 20 km of road.
Again, the delay in timely procurement of eqwupment contributed to implementation delays. Thus, at least, two of
the three year postponements could partially be attributed to shortcomings in the assumptions made about the
institutional capacity of tne borrowver during the preparation and appraisal phase of the project cycle.
24.    The indicators used for the project appraisal were adequate. Besides the ERR (%/o), the other main
performance and implementation indicators reported during supervision were traffic counts, length of roads re-
graveled, speed of travel, maintenance expenditures, and timely submission of studies and audit reports.
25.    Supervision - Overall the supervision by the Association was highly successful in assistmg the Borrower
fulfill its obligations under the project, having been handled principally by an experienced highway engineer
supported occasionally by an economist. IDA procurement and disbursement procedures were followed and the
scope of the project did not change materially except for the increase in regraveling works which was allowed as
the traffic volumes increased. Relations with the Borrower and consultants were cordial and productive.
26.    Project supervision was adequatelv reported. Specifically, attention was paid to the development impact
of the project. For example, wvhen unanticipated traffic growtth wvas observed, maintenance requirements were
identified and the option of bituminous surfacing was presented as an altemative. When the RBMSs were not
paid salaries in a timely fashion or locally procured items were not made available, concerns were expressed to
the Ministry of Finance and MCTPC. Discussions within the country department of the Association werc
initiated, a request was made for rectification and followed through until the particular situation was corrected.
To cite a third example, when the poor quality of crushed aggregate was affecting the overall quality of road
works, Bank supervision missions insisted that only materials which met specification be used.
27.    Another strong aspect of IDA supervision was the timing. Although the available time was sometimes
inadequate to fully review all project sites, the supervision missions were generally scheduled at the start of the
construction season, (September/October), and again at about half-way through the construction season
(February/March) or toward the end of the construction season. This helped to identifv potential problems
regarding the upcoming construction season, to assess progress and to suggest remedial measures dunng
construction.

F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28.    Except for its institutional weakness, particularly its working knowledge of the Bank's procedures,
overall implementation by the Borrower was satisfactory and demonstrated a strong commitment to the
achievement of the project objectives. It had identified the project as its priority for implementation in its five-year
Plan (1990/95). While the Borrower had maintained a stable mnacroeconomic policy environment, this sometimes
meant provision of counterpart funds were delayed fbr the project. The Borrower undertook the NTS study, as a
basis for its national transport strategy, and the establishment of TPU as a follow-on to the study. Through
changes in the legal status of the RBMS's unit, the Borrower transformed the scope of these provincial
maintenance units, first to participate in works throughout the country, and eventually to function as commercial
enterprises. Implementation of the project was the responsibility of the Project Implementation Office (PIO). The
PIO carried out the day to day management of the project such as procurement, allocation of plant and
equipment, vehicles, and quality control of field work. The technical support team (TST) for most of the time,
was comprised of a highway engineer (team leader) and a mechanical engineer; for the DBST work, a quality
control engineer was also retained.
29.    With respect to compliance with legal covenants, on balance it was satisfactory, specifically considering
that the Borrower was also undertaling structural adjustment programs supported by the Association. The main
problems were the administrative constraints with processing international bidding documents and the frequent
delays experienced in the allocation of funds to the RBMSs to pay local salaries and buy locally procured items.
There were also some delays in producing audit reports acceptable to the Association. This was due in part by
the fact that the concept of audits did not exist in Lao P.D.R at the time and that the Ministry did not have
accounting staff capable of maintaining a proper system of accounts.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
30.    On balance, the project outcome is considered satisfactory, as it has exceeded all of its major objectives.
Also, it has already achieved substantial development results. The travel time has been reduced from two days to
4 hours. Instead of spot improvements, the road has been upgraded to gravel standard. Procurement of the
planned equipment was carried out at about 80% of the estimated basic cost. After five years of usc most of the
equipment remains in good condition. The National Transport Study was successfully completed and is
contributing to the country's transport development strategy and policy implementation. The RBMS's have gained
experiences in management of equipment and construction works. The post implementation ERR was estimated
to be 72% compared to the 18% at appraisal.
31.    However, there were also shortcomings. Project implementation was slower than anticipated duc to
Government administrative procedures and difficulties with Bank procurement procedures. Traffic forecasts
underestimated actual volumes by a wide margin, thereby making upgrading to bituminous standard necessarv,
prior to the planned date for full accrual of benefits from the initial planned improvement. Accordingly, about
135 km of the road section will be upgraded to bituminous standard under the Second Highway Improvement
(Credit 2606-LA) before the end of expected useful life of the original investment
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
32.    Operational Plan - The Project's future plan of operation basically is the follow-on project Second
Highway Improvement Project (Cr. 2606-LA), which the Association approved on March 16, 1994. Over a five
year , the plan will: a) continue to upgrade the capacity for and execution of a maintenance program on the
arterial road network through (i) financing of a three-year program of contracts targeting spot improvements and



7
periodic maintenance; (ii) providing a three year program of routine maintenance, to be financed by the local
budget; (iii) supplying the technical assistance necessary for the organization and execution of the arterial road
maintenance program; b) establish a training and development program for the SE commercialization. These
activities will be accomplished by the merger of the three state enterprises that carried out the works under the
STP. which will support the project objectives. During the initial two year period, the capacity of the new
enterprise in areas such as financial management and costing, and project equipment management will be
developed. This enterprise would be assisted by two expatriate technical specialists with experience in managing
contracting activities; c) further improvements, over 5 years, will include the bituminous surfacing of
approximately 135 km of the Savannakhet-Pakse road, and the rehabilitation of temporary bridges; and, d)
provide technical assistance to MCTPC and the training of MCTPC staff.
33.    Performance Indicators - The monitoring of the maintenance capacity under the spot improvements
program and the performance of periodic and routine maintenance will be determined by the physical road
conditions and financial progress; while time, speed and traffic counts will indicate the quality of road
maintenance. The viability of the State Enterprise will be monitored, subject to its cost effectiveness, timeliness of
projects completed and the management of its construction equipment and workshops. Training monitoring, will
be based upon the comparison of the progress of implementation with the agreed program. Finally, progress on
the improvement of Route 13 South will be monitored on the basis of physical quantities of works executed and
their financial value.
34.    Follow up by the Association - The Association will be monitoring the outcome of the project as part of
the Second Highway Improvement Project supervision. The scope of supervision can be expanded to provide
special attention to maintenance of the non-bituminous section of the road. However, Lao P.D.R. is a developing
country with limited human resources and, would therefore require technical assistance to systematically execute
such tasks.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED:
35.           The main lessons to be drawn from the experience of implementation of the project are:
a)    Technical Assistance - that the complex and time consuming government administrative and
procurement procedures involved with ICB procurement should have been anticipated and that
technical assistance should have been considered to supplement the Borrower's weak institutional
capacity.
b)    Delegation of Authority - that more authority should be delegated to the line ministry to manage
the project, particularly with regard to disbursement matters.
c)    Future Privatization Possibilities - that the implementation process helped to evolve a prototype
of an acceptable and possibly a sustainable approach to privatization of the construction sector in
Lao P.D.R., and
d)    Learning Curve & Cumulative Progress - that the basis of future cumulative progress in the
sector should be based on careful planning of the next phase, based on a clear assessment of what
is absorbed by those involved in the implementation process.

LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
SOUTHERN TRANSPORT PROJECT (Credit No.1846-LA)
Implementation Completion Mission
AIDE MEMOIRE
The Southern Transport Project (Credit No. 1846-LA) was approved by the Board on 10/06/87
and declared effective on 06/22/8 8. The closing date was originally planned for 12/3 1/91. Unfortunately
due to a number of factors, the project implementation was extended three times and was finally closed on
12/31/94.
A World Bank Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission visited the Lao P.D.R. from
Februarv 26 to March 4, 1995, to solicit the views of the borrower and implementing agencies; to provide
advice and support to the government's effort to make its own contnrbution to the ICR; and to collect
additional data for the preparation of the ICR. The mission is grateful for the cooperation extended to it by
Ministry of Communication Transport Post & Construction.
During the mission the objectives of the newly introduced ICR format were explained to a team
designated by the Government to undertake the task of organizing and overseeing the preparation of the
ICR. The mission solicited the views of the government's representatives and those responsible for the
follow-up of the project implementation. The mission encouraged the team to focus on: a) an assessment of
the project objectives, design, implementation and operation experience; b) an evaluation of the
Government's and the Bank's performance during the implementation phase of the project with the objective
of drawing appropriate lessons from the implementation and operation experiences. The team appreciated
the guidance and support offered by the mission in preparing the ICR.
The Southern Highway Project (Credit No. 1846-LA) was the first Bank financed road project in
Lao P.D.R. Project implementation was of considerable challenge for several reasons. Specifically, the
implementing agencies were unfamiliar with ICB procurement procedures. Moreover, there were several
procurement packages to execute. Also, the principles behind special account were not well understood at
first. The Government's existent procurement control mechanism was cumbersome and time consuming.
Subsequently. the tendering committee took more time to process the equipment purchases than was
anticipated; equipment did not arrive until April 1989, and the actual work program then began in mid-
May 1989. It was these factors which caused critical delays in the timely completion of the project.
Moreover, as the country was operating on a centralized planning principle, the project implementation was
essentially designed on a force accounting basis. The wage fund of the designated enterprises (Road and
Bridges Maintenance Societies) was centrally financed. It was not always adequately available to take
advantage of the dry season.
Dcspitc difficulties associated with the ICB procurement management, the shortage of local wage
funds and the long rainy season which made operation difficult, the overall outcome of the project was
satisfactory. By the initial closing datc on Deccmber 31, 1991, with only US$5.64 million of US$14.1
million cquivalcnt of the original credit disbursed, most of the plarlned objectives and components of the
projcct werc substantially achieved. Out of a total of 270 km of planned road work, 220 km had been
complctely rcsurfaced with gravel, rather than just spot improvements.



33
By the actual closing date. December 31, 1994, the original objectives of the project were achieved
at a qualitatively higher standard. The equipment purchased under the project is still in good condition.
Additionally, following agreement reached between IDA and the Government, the balance of the credit was
used to finance two sets of equipment for surface treatment, and to construct about 20 km equivalent of
DBST on route I I and 13 in Savannakhet and Pakse.
Economic rates of return recalculated turned out to be much higher than estimated at appraisal.
Under the unexpected high traffic increase, assuring the sustainability of the Savannakhet-Pakse has
become high priority. The government is, therefore, upgrading a section of the road from gravel to asphalt
under the Second Highway Improvement Project financed by the Bank.
Project implementation was satisfactory. However, the progress on overall development objectives
has been highly satisfactory. The impact of the road improvement is visible. The road from Savannakhet to
Pakse is in very good condition, this is supported by the fact that speeds averaging about 90 Km per hour
are easily attainable. The travel time has been reduced from two days to approximately four hours, thereby
-2ducing transport costs substantially. Inter-provincial trade has revived, signs of regional specialization in
- nluction and changes in the consumption patterns are observed from the emerging traffic pattern.
ln.<. :~d activities in the production and construction of improved houses along the road have also been
obscix ed.
Tentative lessons, that have been drawn from the experience of implementation of the project are: First,
the complex and unnecessarily time consuming government procurement process need s simplification to enhance
timely completion of projects in the future. Second, the implementation process helped to evolve what appears to
be a prototype of an acceptable and possibly a sustainable approach to privatization of the construction sector in
Lao P.D.R. To remedy the organizational limitations of the three state enterprises (RBMSs), the three RBMSs
are being merged into one contracting company (SRBCC). In the future, the contracting company can become
fully privatized enterprises; owning and operating their own equipment. Third, a transition from one system to
another always requires learning, and learning takes time and patience. The basis of future cumulative progress in
this sector, therefore, may be based upon careful planning of the next phase, incorporating a clear assessment of
what has been absorbed by those involved in the implementation process.
The Government's contribution to the Southern Transport Project ICR will be formally made
available to the Bank by March 31, 1995.

The Southern Transport Project (Cr. 1846-LA) was closed on December 31,
1994. The attached brief ICR gives the MLnistiy's view on the Project.
Being that this is the first World Bank Credit to close, the Ministiy of
C'ommunication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) responsible for
the implementation of the project was not famniliar with the ICR procedures.
Some of the persons who have been involved in the project has left for other
duties. The Consultants came from Myanmar and are no longer in the Lao
PDR.

Implementation Completion Report for                            26/4 -95
LAO PDR: Southern Transport Project, Cr. 1846-LA.
Background:
The Southem Transport Project (Credit No 1846-LA) is based on findings of an IDA
mission to Lao PDR in March 1987. The loan agreement from December 1987 was
11.1 million "SDR Equivalent" or approximately US$ 14.'million. The original
agreement stated a finalization of the project by June -91, but after three extensions the
credit was finally closed on December 31, 1994.
Proiect Design:
The project was divided into three parts.
a.  Strengthening the maintenance implementation capacity in Savannakhet, Saravane
and Champassak provinces through the provision of additional road maintenance
equipment including spare parts and workshop equipment.
b. Spot regravelling, drainage and bridge improvements along road 13 Parkse -
Savannakhet including consultant assistance and on-the-job training.
c. Consultant services to carry out a National Transport Improvement Study.
The total cost was estimated to US$ 15.1 million.
Progress:
a) Procurement of equipment: The project started up in November -88 and most of
the equipment was available in April -89. This is three - four months later than
anticipated in the appraisal report. The costs for equipment became about 20% lower
than calculated. The lower costs made it possible to include additional equipment in
the project and the spot improvement could be extended.
b) Improvement of the Parkse - Savannakhet road: Due to the delay in equipment
support the start of the road works was delayed almost one year, taking the rainy
season into consideration.
In the loan agreement the project was scheduled to be finalized in June 1991. By the
end of 1991 most-of the emergency repair of the road were finalized. Other works like
bridge improvements were still ongoing. Three times extension of the project resulted
in a completion by the end of 1994. By then, most of the road had been regravelled and
it was in good condition. It had been agreed that two sections, in Parkse and in
Savannakhet should be give surface treatment.
The consultants were in Lao PDR partly during November 1988 to December 1991
and June 1993 to December 1994.



36
c) National Transport Improvement Study: This study was funded through UND]'
with the World Bank as executing agency. The Consultants worked for two years and
the Final Report was submitted in March 1991. They had used 50 manmonths
compared to the estimated 80 manmonths in the appraisal.
Evaluation of the result:
a) Procurement of machines: This part of the project has been very successfuL The
machines were bought at much lower cost than anticipated in the loan agreement. This
made it possible to increase the amount of equipment provided within the project. By
1995 the machines have been in extensive use for more than 5 years and most of them
are still in good working order thanks to satisfactory operation and maintenance. The
high level of technology transfer in equipment and workshop management to
mechanical engineering staff will ensure future high level of maintenance of the
equipment. The Lao PDR road network will get maximum benefit of the provided
equipment.
b) Improvement of the Parkse - Savannakhet road: The road between Parkse and
Savannakhet was 1987 in very bad condition. Spot improvement should be carried out
along the whole road (270 km). This part of the program was finalized by the end of
1991 at lower costs than estimated. Decision was taken to improve the whole section
through regravelling and to put Bitumen Surface on 13 km at Parkse and Savannakhet.
TIhe "new" road generated much more traffic than the feasibility study had anticipated.
The increase was about 50%. With the increased traffic volume an upgrading of the
road to bitumen standard is motivated. Funds for this are provided in the 2:nd
Highway Improvement Project from IDA. The improvement in the first loan will serve
as a stage construction of the new road.
The traveling time from Parkse to Savannakhet (270 km) has been reduced from 2
days to 4 hours. Thank-s to this and to the increased traffic the IRR of the first loan is
much higher than the feasibility study indicated.
c) National Transport Inprovement Study: There was a need to establish priorities in
the road and the transport sector and to develop a more systematic approach to
planning and prioritizing in line with the rapid growth and the changing economic
system
The Study and the Report has served as an important source of information for the
Government, the Ministry and the donor community. The recommendations have in
many instances been implemented. The proposed investment programme has largely
been followed with changes mainly reflecting financing problems or security concerns.
The Study has been followed by instituting the Transport Planning Unit which has
received Technical Assistance through subsequent IDA Credits.



37
Final conclusion;
All parts of the Project have been successfuL
More equipment than anticipated has been bought through the loan thanks to low
costs. Most of the machinery is still in good condition in spite of intensive use thanks
to adequate maintenance.
The road improvement could within the available resources be extended to regravelling
of the whole section and to bitumen surfacing of two sections. Proof of the need of the
improvement has been given by the increased traffic. Decision has been taken to
continue the improvement to bitumen surface standard along the whole project road.
The improvement up to now can be seen as a stage construction.
The National Transport (Improvement) Study has provided a useful and necessary base
for the coming development of the road and transport system in Lao PDR
Looking at the performance of different parties involved and relations between them,
most contacts seems to have been without major problems. The Lao PDR authorities
have had limited experience from loan administration. The delay of this ICR-report is
depending on this lack of experience.
The reasons for the time extension of the project from originally 3 years to the double,
6 years, depend on as well extended work thanks to savings in costs for equipment as
slow performance in the field and misjudgment of required time in the appraisal phase,
specially as Lao PDR was "new" as a borrowing country.
Comments:
One conclusion from studying the consultants report is that the mobilization of a new
project takes in most cases more time than expected.
Another experience from this project, as well as other projects, is that in the planning
of the project the rainy season has not been given enough consideration. The activity
has to be reduced during this period and by the beginning of the dry season should the
contractor and other involved be fMlly mobilized.
