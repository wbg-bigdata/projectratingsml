Grading Terminology
For the purposes of this report, a standard grading terminology is used,
viz., Grades 1-6 for primary and Grades 7-13 for secondary schools, the grade
number referring to the year of schooling reached at tha-t point. Jamaica is
now beginning to use this terminology.
Schools
Senior Department             : Grades 7-9 attached to primary schools for
those primary school graduates who fail to
gain entry into secondary schools.
High School                   : A secondary school for Grades 7-11/13,
(first and second cycle secordary). Entry
into Grade 7 is selective.
Junior Secondary School       : A secondary school for Grades 7-9 only,
(first cycle secondary).
Comprehensive (high) School  : A secondary school for Grades 7-11/13 or
Grades 10-11/13. It accepts all pupils from
a given catchment area into Grade 7 on a non-
selective basis and into Grade 10 on a
selective basis. It offers a broad curriculuin
which includes practical and academic subjects.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        A major constraint to economic development in Jamaica is the
inadequacy of the education system to supply the labor market with skilled
or readily trainable middle level manpower and the higher education system
with the quantity and quality of intake to meet professional and sub-
professional manpower needs.
ii.       This report appraises a second education project to support the
improvement and expansion of secondary education, teacher training and
vocational training, and improved services for primary and out-of-school
education. The project derives from the second phase of a long-term
education development plan as did the first IBRD education project (Loan
No. 468-JM) from the first phase.
iii.      The proposed project comprises:
(a) construction and equipment of:
- two new and additions to 26 comprehensive secondary schools;
- twelve new junior secondary schools;
- one new and additions to one teacher training college;
- one new technical teacher training department in the
College of Arts, Science and Technology (CAST);
- two new vocational training centers;
- an instructional television (ITV) and education materials
and aids center;
(b) technical assistance for educational planning and specialists'
services for the above-mentioned items and the project unit.
iv.       Enrollment capacity of the 45 project schools would be increased
by 19,300 new places.  About 50% of new places would be at second cycle
secondary level where, as a result of the new curricula, this output would
be better prepared for higher studies, employment or on-the-job training.
v.        The proposed project would support the strategy developed to
achieve a better match between educational output and the manpower needs
of the economy. Expansion would be accompanied by (a) gradual elimination
of the ineffective post-primary departments of primary schools and transfer
of their students to junior secondary schools; (b) introduction of broad



- ii -
curricula in comprehensive secondary schools with options in industrial,
agricultural, commercial, craft and home economics subjects; (c) improvement
of education services and teacher training; and (d) expansion of vocational
training. Further educational expansion should be preceded by a manpower
study and a review of the education plan.
vi.       Adequate intake for the project schools is assured, as is also
the teacher supply, although initially some teachers for the technical
subjects of the comprehensive schools may have to be expatriates. Cur-
ricula are satisfactory. The technical assistance component would provide
specialists to assist with educational planning, establishing testing
procedures, training Jamaicans in administering comprehensive schools,
upgrading teacher-trainers, improving the ITV program and strengthening
the Project Unit.
vii.      Schedules of accommodation, equipment and furnitute Are economical
and appropriate. Costs are reasonable. Buildings would be designed by
firms of consulting architects. Contracts for construction and procurement
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. The
project would be executed by the Project Unit established under the first
IBRD education project but suitably reinforced.
viii.     The estimated total project cost is US$28.2 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component estimated at US$12.5 million equivalent
(excluding interest and commitment charges during construction). The pro-
posed loan of US$13.5 million would finance all foreign exchange Costa,
estimated at US$12.5 million (93% of the proposed loan) and interest and
commitment charges during construction estimated at US$1 million (7% of the
loan). Disbursement would be over four years, the anticipated period of
construction.
ix.       During negotiations, the government has provided assurances as set
out in para. 7.01. The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$13.5
million equivalent to Jamaica for a period of 25 years including a 10 year
grace period.



I. INTRODUCTION
The Request
1.01      The Jamaican Government, with Unesco assistance, prepared a long-
term education plan for 1966-1980, the earlier portion of which was trans-
lated into two project-oriented programs. The first was assisted by a Bank
loan of US$9.5 million made in 1966 (468-JM) and by Canada. Under the first
Bank loan the Government established 50 junior secondary schools and ex-
panded teacher, agricultural, industrial and commercial training. This
project, after initial delays, is now making satisfactory progress and
should be completed by December, 1971. Its educational objectives of expand-
ing and improving junior secondary education and indirectly primary educa-
tion are being achieved. A cost overrun of about US$9.4 million (borne by
the Government) over the 1966 estimate of total cost of US$19.4 million is
expected. The major causes of this were: increased costs of labor and
materials beyond the earlier forecasts, site problems, larger school areas
and initial cost underestimates. More effective project management might
have led to better results.
1.02      In January, 1970, Jamaica requested Bank financing for a second
education project, prepared with Unesco assistance. Th,e proposed project
was appraised in May, 1970, by a mission consisting of Messrs. S. Z. Sung
(technical educator), G. Naleppa (architect), and U. Richter (economist) of
the Bank and C. L. Germanacos (education planner, consultant), assisted by
Messrs. C. P. van Dijk (economist) and Mr. S. Futagami (ITV Specialist).
1.03      As modified after the appraisal, the proposed project would
comprise:
(a)  Construction, furniture and equipment for:
- two new and additions to 26 comprehensive high schools;
- twelve new junior secondary schools;
- one new and additions to one teacher training college;
- one new technical teacher training department in CAST;
- two new vocational training centers; and
- a center for ITV and education materials and aids.
(b)  Twenty-three man-years of specialists' services and 20 man-
years of fellowships.
1.04      Modifications to the request resulted in a reduction of places,
mainly junior secondary, from the requested 39,000 to 19,300, and more
effective utilization of existing facilities in the schools to be expanded.
The coat of the modified project is estimated at US$28.2 million exclusive
of interest and commitment charges during construction.

Social and Economic Backgrud
1.05      In an area of 4,400 sq mi, of which 60% is cultivable, Jamaica
supports almost two million people, with more than 30% in the urban area
of Kingston and St. Andrew. The greater part of the remainder, because of
the mountainous terrain and smallholding land system, are widely spread
throughout the rural areas. The natural growth rate of population, 2.7%
at present, is expected to decline to 1.8% by 1980. Some 45% of the pop-
ulation is under 15 years of age. The demographic pressures have found an
outlet in emigration in recent years, mainly to the U.S. and Canada.
1.06      In the last decade, GDP (Annex 1) has increased by about 5% an-
nually in real terms and amounted to US$994 million in 1969. GNP per cap-
ita was US$548 in 1969. The main sources of economic growth have been
bauxite and alumina production, tourism and manufacturing.
1.07      Jamaica's labor force consisted in 1968 of approximately 720,000
persons of whom nearly 37% were employed in agriculture. The most dynamic
sectors of the economy are mining, refining and quarrying but employ only
a small part (1.6%) of the labor force. The percentage of the total labor
force employed has fallen between 1960 and 1969 from 14.7% to 11.6% in
manufacturing and from 8.2% to 6.4% in construction, despite above-average
growth in these sectors.
1.08      There is much unemployment among the untrained sectors of the
labor force, estimated at nearly 18% of the labor force with higher rates
among the females. It is particularly high among school-leavers without
vocational training. At the same time, there is a great demand for skills
at all levels. The government is trying to remedy this situation through
labor-intensive public work programs and intensification of technical and
vocational training. The "skill constraint" could remain a major deter-
minant of Jamaica's social and economic development.
II. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
The Administration of Education (Chart 1)
2.01      The Ministry of Education has been considerably strengthened to
handle the expanded system and the curricular reforms following upon the
first Bank education project. Supervisory services have been re-organized
and reinforced; primary and junior secondary school curricula have been
developed and tested; a re-organized education materials and aids division
is making textbooks, supplementary materials and teacher guides available
to primary and junior secondary schools. The government proposes to
create a new division to ensure more effective co-ordination and develop-
ment of technical education.



-3-
The Education System (Chart 2)
2.02      The main features of the structure are:
(1) primary education of five years, now changing
to a 6-year course (Grades 1-5/6);
(ii)  3-year first cycle secondary education (Grades 7-9);
(iii) 2-year second cycle secondary (Grades 10-11), with
an additional two years (Grades 12-13) for university
entrance preparation;
(iv)  higher education:  (a) 2-3 years post-secondary
training after Grade 11, and (b) university education
after Grade 13.
Six technical schools (Grades 8-11) and five vocational training centers
provide skill training. CAST and the Jamaica School of Agriculture (JSA)
train technicians.
2.03      At primary level, quality has suffered from poor accommodation,
overcrowding, equipment shortages and untralne(2 teachers. Improvement will
result from pupil transfers fron, the senior departments to new junior
secondary schools; a growing supply of trained teachers; curriculum reform;
and increased provision of teaching materials.  Enrollments (Chart 3 and
Annex 2) of 299,000 represent 86.4% of the relevant age group. Primary
enrollment in private schools represents less than 11% of the total.
2.04      In 1968, of the 116,000 students in first-cycle secondary (80%
of the relevant age group), 82,600 are ian "senior departments" of primary
schools and about 33,000 in junior secondary or high schools. The first
Bank project is adding a further 33,000 new junior secondary school places,
providing an improved education compared with thAat in the primary school
senior departments. At second cycle secondary level, the enrollment of
15,200 is 9.3% of the relevant age group. Enrollments in private secondary
schools are about 5% of the total secondary Level enrollment.
2.05      Except in the case of two pilot comprelhensive high schools and
the technical schools, the secondary schools' curriculum has been tradition-
ally oriented toward the academic subjects of the U.K. General Certificate
of Education (G.C.E.). Recently, the high schools, despite limited re-
sources, have been broadening the curriculum by the inclusion of commercial
and technical subjects but lack facilities and teachers.
2.06      Output from second-cycle secordary education is inadequate to
meet the demands of the econorny and the needs of higlher education establish-
ments. As a result, the post-secondary institutions recruit students with
lower academic qualifications than the regulation requirement,



- 4 -
2.07      The teacher-student ratio (1:19) in high schools is over-generous.
About 60% of the teachers are academically qualified but few are profession-
ally trained; the University of the West Indies (U.W.I.) Faculty of Educa-
tion is now expanding its in-service teacher-training programs. A high
turnover of staff occurs, both of nationals who are attracted to the USA,
Canada and the UK, and of contracted expatriates who still form about 10%
of the teaching force.
2.08      The technical high schools, in particular, find difficulties in
recruiting teachers since there are no provisions for technical teacher
training in the country, except for a limited number of teachers of commer-
cial subjects. With the proposed broadening of the curricula of all high
schools to include technical subjects, the country will have to rely heav-
ily on expatriate teachers until such time as national institutions begin
to meet the needs.
2.09      Enrollments in higher education (4,600) represent 7% of the age-
group 19-22. One third attend university courses, including non-degree
courses. Six teacher training colleges, four of which have been assisted
by the first Bank project, now have an annual output of 1,000 primary and
junior secondary school teachers. Technicians are trained at CAST and JSA.
These two institutions are now being expanded within the first Bank educa-
tion project to increase output to 245 and 140 respectively from the day-
time courses.
2.10      The regional U.W.I. is the main source of higher level manpower
with 1,762 Jamaican students (1969) taking degree courses in agriculture,
engineering, medicine, sciences, arts and social studies. Education
(teaching and administration) courses are followed by only 41 but the
teacher supply for secondary schools is supplemented by graduates of the
arts, social sciences and natural sciences faculties.
2.11      Since 1964, instructional television programs have been transmit-
ted to about 350 of the 800 senior departments and junior secondary schools.
The government intends to expand the system in the first place by increas-
ing the ITV program coverage to include the first three grades of primary
school, with concentration on the basic skills of language and number.
Education and Training outside the Formal Education System
2.12      To supplement the limited output of the secondary high schools,
correspondence courses are organized for senior department and junior
secondary school-leavers leading to a Jamaica Certificate of Education of
a standard lower than the external G.C.E. "O" Level. This, for the time
being, allows holders to sit the primary teacher training college entrance
examinations. In 1968 about 9,500 students enrolled in the correspondence
courses, attending neighborhood schools after school hours.
2.13      A small apprenticeship program with 540 apprentices undergoing
training gives an output of 120 annually. In addition, 25 youths are sent
overseas each year for apprenticeship training. These figures are quite



- 5 -
inadequate even when supplemented by the output of about 480 from the two
vocational schools and three Ministry of Education trade training centers.
Consequently, the Ministry of Labor has recently established, with ILO
technical assistance, nine vocational training centers with an enrollment
of 1,060 in day and evening courses in various trades. It is planned to
construct three more and use all on a double shift basis.  Two Youth Camps
provide a variety of short-term training courses for out-of-school youths:
the level of skill acquired is rudimentary. The Ministry of Trade and
Industry runs a small training school for tourism industry personnel.
The graduates of all these training courses readily find employment as
the total annual output of less than 3,000 falls short of the estimated
need of 7,600.
Educational Development Strategy
2.14      Development  Strategy:  An outline education plan for 1966-1980
serves as the basis for short-term education programs. The development
strategy is, while controlling expansion, to re-orient and improve the
content of education and to make the system more efficient and productive,
and more closely related to economic and social developmental needs.
Fundamental and interacting policy objectives are to equalize educational
opportunity, ensure by 1980 an appropriate education for 97% of the 6-14
years age group, and ensure an adequate supply of qualified output from
second cycle secondary institutions to meet the demands of the economy and
higher education.
2.15      The Quantitative Targets:  The targets for enrollment and qualified
teacher requirements (Annex 3) are summarized below:
1967-1968                       1980-1981

/2   Public schools only; some of these are in the senior departments.
7    Only university graduates in all types of secondary schools.



- 6 -
2.16      The major thrust of the present plan is the complete transfer of
students from the senior departments of primary schools to the more
appropriate first-cycle secondary schools and the expansion of second-
cycle secondary education.
III. EDUCATION FINANCE
Financing of Education
3.01      Public education is financed through the budget of the central
government, most of it directly but a small part in the form of transfers
to local authorities. The Ministry of Education budget provides for public
primary and secondary schools, teacher training colleges, CAST and JSA; and
it assists "grant-aided" schools 1/ and provides scholarships fot university
students. The Ministry of Finance and Planning budget covers Jamaica's
contribution to the U.W.I. and is also responsible for the in-service
training of civil servants. Other Ministries finance relevant specialized
training.
3.02      Private expenditure amounted to approximately 0.6% of G.N.P.
between 1964 and 1969. Most is in the form of private school fees.
Private industry, in particular the bauxite companies, contribute in the
form of in-plant training, donations to schools and scholarship funds.
Total Expenditure on Education
3.03      Public expenditure on education and training (Annex 4) increased
at an average rate of nearly 16% per year between 1964 and 1969. Such
expenditure, amounting to J$39.1 million in 1969, is 19.1% of total gov-
ernment expenditure in that year and constitutes the largest single item
in the central budget; the percentage share of education expenditure in
GNP is 4.4% (5.0% including private expenditure). In particular, capital
expenditure showed a rapid increase after 1967 due to the construction of
junior secondary schools and post-secondary facilities.
Recurrent Expenditure
3.04      Public recurrent expenditure on education increased from J$16.4
million in 1964 to J$30.2 million in 1969, slightly higher than the growth
rate of total public recurrent expenditure. The percentage share remained
virtually unchanged at about 20% (Annex 4).
3.05      The share of primary education is falling, due to the creation
of junior secondary schools in 1966 which absorbed those students formerly
1/   Private schools with approximately the same fees and salary scales
as government schools and receiving direct public financial assistance
to the extent that they are classified as public schools.

in the senior departments of primary schools. This factor also explains
the rapid rise in spending on secondary education which now claims a
substantial part of the education budget. The proportion spent on tech-
nical education and vocational training is small (4% in 1969-1970) but the
annual growth rate of about 24% in the last five years is high.
3.06      Annual recurrent costs per student at US$35 in primary education,
US$228 for second-cycle secondary education, US$726 and US$782 for post-
secondary technical education and teacher training, and about US$1,450 for
higher education are reasonable. (Annex 5 compares these figures with
those in certain other countries).
Capital Expenditure
3.07      Public capital expenditure on education rose from J$1.9 million
in 1964 to J$8.8 in 1969, or from 5.3% to 14.2% of total public capital
expenditure. This percentage is expected to increase to 15.9% in 1970
(Annex 4).
Foreign Assistance
3.08      Assistance to education has been provided by IBRD (for construc-
tion of junior secondary schools and post-secondary training institutions),
the Government of Canada (for construction of primary schools), and USAID
(for instructional television). Some technical assistance on educational
planning, teacher training and in-service training has aLlso been received
from other sources, with UN and Canadian technical assistance alone amount-
ing to approximately J$0.8 million in 1970/71. The UK, Canada and the US
provide teachers for primary and secondary schools, post-secondary insti-
tutions and the U.W.I. The same countries and Germany have sent technical
instructors to Jamaica. The ILO is assisting the goverrment in setting up
a centralized agency for industrial and vocational trairLing.
Projections of Future Education Expenditure
3.09      Public expenditure on education in constant prices is likely to
rise at a rate of about 12% annually up to 1975. The proportion of this
to total government expenditure would remain around 20% in this period
but the percentage to GNP would rise from 4.4% in 1969 to 5.6% in 1975
(Annex 6).
3.10      Recurrent expenditure on education is expected to reach about
24% of the government's recurrent budget in 1975 (Annex 6). This is high
by international standards and further increases need to be effectively
controlled. The recurrent expenditures generated by the proposed second
Bank project amount to about J$5.7 million, taking up about 9% of total
recurrent expenditures on education by 1975.

IV. T_E NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Manpower Needs for Economic Growth
4.01      A manpower requirement survey in 1967 gave the Jamaican labor
force as 707,000 persons, of whom 598,000 (85%) were actually employed
(Annex 7). Only establishments with at least 10 employees were included
so that actual employment figures are higher. In consequence, projections
of the labor force based on the 1967 stock as shown in Annex 7 are con-
sidered as minimum requirements.
4.02      The survey showed a high rate of unemployment (20%) among the
semi-skilled and unskilled group and a shortage of about 2% in the pro-
fessional and technical workers' group. These findings were reinforced by
another survey in 1968 covering 591,000 employed persons. Unemployment
was highest (24%) among persons with no formal schooling or only primary
education. Unemploymnent rates among the more highly educated was reduced
in part due to female non-participation in the labor force.
4.03      Emigration of about 9,000 economically-active people per annum has
occurred mostly among the professional and technical workers (13%), sales
personnel (11%) and craftsmen (10%); that is, the very occupations for
which manpower needs are greatest and for which the highest number of work
permits is issued to foreign workers. Given the continuation of income
differentials between Jamaica and the high-income countries, the drain on
Jamaican skills is likely to continue. Comparing the stock of
professional personnel in 1967 with work permits in force that year for
foreign workers, professionals on work permit accounted for 12% of the
stock of doctors, 75% of engineers, 58% of architects, 60% of quantity
surveyors, 20% of accountants and 30% of university graduate teachers in
secondary schools. These figures emphasize the existing shortages in the
professional and technical occupations.
4.04      They also reflect the two persistent manpower problems confronting
Jamaica - a shortage of skilled manpower and a labor surplus of unskilled
workers in both urban and rural areas. The shortages of skills are mostly
in the sub-professional categories - technicians for industry, commerce and
agriculture, para-medicals and craftsmen. In addition, the percentage of
employed persons not performing efficiently, due to inadequate education
and training, is high, especially among craftsmen and clerical workers.
4.05      To meet these shortages, the education system should provide a
greater output at secondary level of education, the source for higher edu-
cation inputs and for middle-level job intake; diversify the upper cycle
secondary education in accordance with manpower needs, and improve the
quality of the output in terms of educational and skill levels.



-9-
4.06      Assuming that the economy will grow annually by 6% during 1967-
1980 and a labor productivity growth rate of between 2% and 3%, the labor
force will increase to about 774,000 by 1980. Allowing for a higher
relative rise of professional, technical, managerial, executive and
administrative staff and of clerical and sales personnel, the combined
participation rate of these groups would be 22.5% by 1480 as compared
with 18.2% in 1967.
4.07      On these assumptions and based on a cross claLssification of occu-
pations with educational levels derived from the manpower survey, the esti-
mated additional requirements of the labor market by education level outputs
are (Annex 8):
1967-75         1975-80    Total
Output Education Level                       (compounded)   (compounded)
Degree or equivalent                            5,830            5,620      11,450
Completed secondary education (Grade 11)    18,180              18,670      36,850
Completed Grade 11 without certificate         11,560           11,810      23,370
Sub-total Secondary Grade 11              29,740           30,480      60,220
Below Grade 11                                 24,230           21,990      46,220
4.08      To achieve these outputs, enrollments in the education system at
second cycle and higher education should be as shown in Annex 3 (see also
para. 2.15 above). The critical shortage is -'n second cycle secondary edu-
cation where the total enrollment in 1967/68 was 15,200 (Annexes 2 and 9),
inadequate to meet the total demand for entrants to higher education insti-
tutions and the labor market; the government target is to expand by 1980
to 49,800. However, on the basis of the minimum required outputs in the
period 1967-1980 a target of 34,000 seems adequate on present evidence to
meet the purely manpower and higher education needs at this level (Annex
10). The proposed expansion to 34,000 by 1980 would give a cumulative
output of about 64,800 with completed secondary education to meet the pro-
jected labor market requirements of about 60,000 (para. 4.07). However,
allowing for dropouts, the 34,000 enrollment target is a minimum requirement,
which may have to be revised upward with new evidence.
4.09      A manpower survey and a review of the education plan is desirable
at this time, to ensure that proposed enrollment targets are in conformity
with the needs of Jamaica for economic development. Technical assistance
from bilateral sources will provide the manpower survey specialists.  The
proposed project includes technical assistance for edticational planning
whlich would be based on up-to-date statistics and projections from the
survey. Such a survey and review of the education plan is also essential
prior to further major investment in education.

Needs of Educational System
4.10      Primary and junior secondary teacher training facilities need
about 500 more places if they are to improve by 1980 the qualified teacher
percentage, meet expansion needs, and permit reducing the pupil-teacher
ratio in primary and first-cycle secondary schools from 52:1 and 35:1
to 40:1 and 30:1, respectively (Annex 11 Part A).
4.11      At second-cycle level (Annex 11 Part B), outputs from the U.W.I.
Faculties of Sciences, Arts and Education should suffice for second-cycle
secondary school demands for teachers of academic subjects, provide a
leavening of university graduates in the junior secondary schools and reduce
substantially the proportion of expatriate teachers. There is, however,
an urgent need to assure the supply of technical subjects' teachers if
the schools are to offer a more comprehensive curriculum. The course for
agricultural subjects' teachers should be operating at JSA as formulated
in the first Bank education project. In addition, it is necessary to
create a technical teacher training institution. The government is
awarding over 100 "teacher" scholarships a year to ensure an adequate
teacher supply. A greater proportion of these should be awarded to
students desirous of qualifying as teachers of technical, mathematics and
science subjects. The government has given assurances during negotiations
that an adequate provision for technical teacher training will be made.
4.12      The government intends to maintain the specialist committees
which are developing curricula for the primary and junior secondary
schools, and to increase the supply of suitable textbooks and supplementary
materials to these schools. Special attention is to be paid to materials
in support of the ITV and correspondence programs. Additional resources
for preparation and production of these books and materials will be needed.
To introduce new material and techniques into a larger number of primary
schools, the ITV programs are to be increased and this entails additional
production facilities.
4.13      Curricula for the second-cycle secondary schools are largely
determined by the requirements of external examinations. This need not
prevent the development of good curricula consistent with the needs of
Jamaica, as has already been partially done in a number of cases, and
recognized by external examination authorities. The government has given
assurances during negotiations that curriculum committees for this purpose
will be set up and appropriate curricula will be developed within two years
of signing the proposed loan. Jamaica has its own resources and can draw
upon the U.W.I. Faculty of Education and specialists from bilateral sources
to carry out this work.
4.14      As the number of comprehensive schools increases, school adminis-
trators and supervisors will need management training. Technical assistance
will be required for this purpose. The Government has given assurances
during negotiations that such training will be made available within eighteen
months of signing the loan.

V. THE PROJECT
A. General
5.01      The proposed project, at a total estimated cost of US$28.2 million
(Annex 12), would comprise the following:
(a) Secondary Level Schools. Construction and equipment of:
- extensions to 17 existing high schools for conversion
to comprehensive schools, adding 1,600 first-cycle
and 5,090 second-cycle places;
- addition of comprehensive type second-cycle faLcilities
at 9 existing junior secondary schools, adding 3,620
second-cycle places;
- two new secondary comprehensive schools for 960 first-
cycle and 800 second-cycle places; and
- twelve new junior secondary schools for 6,240 first-
cycle places.
(b) Teacher Training. Construction and equipment of:
- a new primary teacher training college for an enrollment
of 300 and boarding facilities for 300;
- additions to an existing teacher training college for
an additional enrollment of 200 junior secondary school
teacher trainees and boarding facilities for 200; and
- additions to CAST to establish a Technical Teacher
Training Department with an enrollment of 300 and output
of 80 annually.
(c) Vocational Training. Construction and equipment of two new
vocational training centers for an enrollment and output
of 160.
(d) Quality Improvements to Primary Education. Construction and
equipment of an ITV and Education Materials and Aids Center.
(e) Technical Assistance. Fourteen man-years of specialists and
20 man-years of fellowships to provide assistance on educa-
tional planning, establish suitable testing procedures for
selection and guidance of students into the second-cycle
secondary system and support (a), (b) and (d) above (Appen-
dix).



- 12 -
(f)  Project Unit.  Nine man-yoar.~ of specialists to reinforce the
Project Unit.
B. Elements of t e Project
Secondary Level Schools (Annex 12, Items Al-A40)
5.02      The project secondary schools would assist the government to
achieve the main objectives for education development within the framework
of the 1966-1980 plan, adding about 18,300 places to the secondary system.
5.03      With 8,800 places added in first-cycle secondary and 9,500 in the
second-cycle, or over 50% of the new places, emphasis is on the second
cycle in order to meet urgent needs. The number of first-cycle places
has been substantially reduced because of financial and managerial con-
straints. The project schools are located to fill gaps in the planned
school network in conformity with population distribution.
5.04      Entry into the first-cycle is on a non-selective basis, each
school serving a group of primary feeder schools. Entry into the second-
cycle will be selective since only 25% of first-cycle leavers would enter
the second-cycle. Sufficiency of intake into the proposed schools is as-
sured. The government has given assurances during negotiations that with-
in two years of signing the loan, suitable testing procedures will be
established for the selection and guidance of students into the second-
cycle system. For this, technical assistance has been included in the
proposed project.
5.05      The first-cycle curriculum will include industrial arts, agri-
culture, and home economics. The second-cycle curriculum will allow great-
er emphasis on mathematics and science and provide pre-vocational courses
in industrial, commercial, home economics and agricultural subjects (Annex
13). Students can thus obtain adequate qualifications for further studies
and will be better prepared for on-the-job training.
5.06      Grades 12 and 13 facilities would be available in only a limited
number of schools to ensure economic-sized classes at that level. The
output at Grade 11/13 in 1975 is estimated at about 11,000 (Annex 10), an
increase of 5,200 over the 1968 output. This will ensure adequate intake
into higher education levels and also meet employment needs.
5.07      Teachers will be provided for project first-cycle schools by the
training program established under the first Bank project. Teachers for
the technical programs of the comprehensive second-cycle, however, will
need some external technical assistance and/or contracted expatriates
(para. 2.08 and Annex 14). Based on a more realistic teacher/student
ratio of about 1:25 in average, the total number of teachers required in
all the project secondary schools is about 1,500. The government has



- 13 -
given assurances during negotiations that (a) by the closing date of the
loan, the new teacher/student ratio of approximately 1:25 will be estab-
lished and maintained thereafter for the comprehensive schools in the
project and of approximately 1:30 for the junior secondary schools in the
project; (b) all project institutions will be staffed at all times with
suitably qualified administrators, teachers and instructors in adequate
numbers.
Teacher Training (Annex 12, Items Bl-B3)
5.08      Provision for one new primary teacher training college and expan-
sion of an existing college (Mandeville) would raise the proportion of
trained teachers in primary schools from 52% to 80%, and provide all first-
cycle secondary schools with qualified staff by 1980. The government in-
tends to expand another of the existing primary teacher training colleges
(Bethlehem) from its own resources.
5.09      Adequate intake is assured although initially all entrants are
unlikely to be of the academic standard desired (para 2.06). With the
application of a more economical teacher-student ratio (1:15), no difficulty
is envisaged in staffing the proposed colleges but fellowships are needed
for upgrading some of the existing personnel and training prospective
teacher trainers; provision would be made under the proposed loan for
this purpose.
5.10      The new primary teacher college would be in the relatively
densely populated area of Savannah la Mar with adequate primary and
Junior secondary schools in the area for teaching practice purposes.
Staff housing is required to attract and retain teacher-trainers. Full
boarding facilities are also needed.
5.11      Diversification of the second-cycle secondary curriculum with
the lntroduction of a number of practical courses calls for an annual
supply of about 80 teachers of technical subjects.  The proposed Technical
Teacher Training Department at CAST is designed to meet this demand and
provide teacher training in the mechanical, electrical and building trades
and in commerce, home economics and agriculture. (For agriculture, courses
would be held at JSA for the subject matter, with CAST providing pedagogical
training.)  The 20 teacher trainers required will be obtained by the Gov-
ernment from bilateral sources, mainly from Canada.
Vocational Training Centers (Annex 12 - Items Cl and C2)
5.12      The two vocational training centers, with a capacLty of 160 (and
possibly 320 under double usage), would partially fill the need for craft
training. The shortage of trained instructors precludes greater expansion
as the UNDP/ILO-sponsored instructor training scheme has not yet gained
momentum. Applicants are likely to outnumber vacancies. Each center would
offer 6 to 12-month courses in four trades - welding, pipe fitting, elec-
trical installation and millwright fitting at Savannah la Mar, and electri-
cal maintenance, heavy duty mechanics, plumbing and welding at St. Ann's Bay.

Quality Improvements to Primary Education (Annex 12, Item DI)
5.13      ITV and Education Materials and Aids Center.  At present, ITV is
limited to the transmission of 29 programs per week, inclduing 13 new ones,
all directed at senior departments of primary schools. Teachers have con-
firmed the effectiveness of ITV in those schools where picture quality is
acceptable. The local commercial station is available during mornings
only for transmission; studio space and equipment is rented for four
mornings weekly, all that is available.
5.14      The project would extend the programs into the primary schools to
improve English and mathematics teaching and produce specific programs to
serve the correspondence course students. For this, additional transmis-
sion and production facilities are required to allow the preparation and
weekly transmission of 21 new programs and expanded production of teaching
materials and aids. The government has given assurances during negotiations
that by the completion of this part of the project and subject to existing
television capacity, about three hours fifty minutes of ITV programs will
be broadcast each school day between 9:10 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. over the
national television network. Technical assistance has been provided in
the project to ensure improved ITV program production and better educa-
tional materials and aids, including better picture quality, and on-the-
job and overseas training for technical personnel (Schedule to Appendix).
Technical Assistance (Appendix)
5.15      The proposed project provides for a total of 23 man-years of
specialists and 20 man-years of fellowships at an estimated cost of US$1.1
million as follows:
(a)  4 man-years of an educational planner and a statistician
to carry out the review of the education plan (para. 4.09);
(b)  5 man-years of specialists and 2-1/2 man-years of fellow-
ships to assist in the development and training programs
of the comprehensive school and the establishment of suit-
able testing procedures for selection and guidance of
students to the second-cycle secondary educational system
(paras. 4.14 and 5.04);
(c)  15-1/2 man-years of fellowships to support the teacher-
training programs (para 5.09);
(d)  5 man-years of specialists and 2 man-years of fellowships to
improve the ITV services (para 5.14); and
(e)  9 man-years of an architect, a quantity surveyor and an
equipment specialist to strengthen the project unit (para
6.02).



- 15 -
The specialists are likely to be expatriates. The above requirements take
into account international and bilateral technical assistance available to
Jamaica.

5.18      These estimates are based on January 1971 prices, with due regard
to the experience under the first Bank education project. They reflect a
high utilization of accommodation and austere standards of construction,
furnishing and equipment but are consistent with functional requirements.
Construction costs for academic, communal and boarding facilities are esti-
mated at J$8.60 per square foot (US$10.32 per sq ft ).
5.19      Construction costs have risen by about 50% over the last four
years. It is expected that, during project implementation, an average cost
escalation of about 10% per annum on local currency component and 6% per an-
num on foreign exchange component for civil works will occur. To cover price
increases and unforeseen expenditures, a contingency provision for site de-
velopment, civil works, professional services, furniture, equipment and tech-
nical assistance has been included in the total project cost (Annex 15); it
would be equivalent to 19.9% of the total project cost, or 24.8% of the total
without contingencies.



- 17 -
5.20      The foreign exchange component (Annex 12) amounting to US$12.5
million, excluding about US$1.0 million interest and other charges during
the construction period, equivalent to 44.2% of the estimated total proj-
ect cost of US$28.2 million, has been calculated as follows: (a) site de-
velopment and building at 36%, (b) furniture 40%, (c) equipment 95%, (d)
professional services 20% and (e) technical assistance 80W.
5.21      For new schools, estimated costs per student place at US$685 for
comprehensive schools, US$654 for junior secondary schools, US$1,412 for
teacher training college, and US$1,997 for trade training centers are reason-
able. Comparable figures in neighboring countries are shown in Annex 16.
5.22      When operating at full capacity, the project would add about
J$5.7 million annually, to the Ministry of Education's 1975 recurrent bud-
get, corresponding to 9% of the total.
5.23      The project would not include financial provision for the con-
struction and equipment of the Technical Teacher Training Department at
CAST for which the government is now considering an offer of aid from
Canada. The government has, in any case, given assurances during nego-
tiations that an adequate provision for technical teacher training will
be made.
VI. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENTS
6.01      General.  The Jamaican building industry can cope with a large
expansion program in school building. Capacity for local manufacture of
basic school furniture is also sufficient. There are several private ar-
chitectural firms in Jamaica able to handle large and complex architectural
work. Tendering procedures in the country are satisfactory.
6.02      Project Administration.  The Project Unit in the Ministry of Edu-
cation in charge of implementing the first education project would be re-
sponsible for the second project.  The government has given assurances that
the Project Unit established under Loan Agreement 468-JM will administer
the proposed project with the same functions and under the! same conditions
set out in that agreement, together with an additional requirement that the
Project Unit will develop a satisfactory maintenance scheme for all project
schools. However, in the interest of closer cost control and because of
the complexity of the second project, th-e Project Unit requires strengthen-
ing. The proposed project, therefore, includes provision for an architect,
a quantity surveyor and an equipment specialist, for a total of 9 man-years.
The government has given assurances that these three posts will be included
in the Project Unit and agreed that appointment of the architect and quan-
tity surveyor under terms an(d conditions acceptable to the Bank will be a
condition of effectiveness of the loan. The government has also agreed to
establish and maintain a coordination committee, which shall include repre-



-18-
sentatives of the Mitistry of Education, the Mlinistry of Finance and Plan-
ning and the Ministry of Labor, to coordinate the Project work and to pro-
vide advice and guidance to the Project Unit.
6.03      Professional Fees and Supervision.  Design and supervision of con-
struction for new project sclools and large extensionswould be carried out
by private architects. Similar services for smaller extensions and conver-
sions would be done by the Project Unit's own technical staff.  The govern-
ment has given assurances during negotiations that architectural and engineer-
ing consultants and civil work contractors for the project would be accept-
able to the Bank and be employed upon terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank. Space requirements, building standards, designs and construction
drawings used in the first project should be applied wherever feasible in
the second project for economy in professional fees and speed in implement-
ation. Based on the experience of the first project, the government intends
that architectural and supervisory fees will be made independent of cost in-
creases.
6.04      Site Selection and Acquisition.  Land required for the expansion
and conversion of existing schools is available.  All the sites for new
project schools have been selected but not yet all acquired. The government
has given assurances during negotiations that all sites will be available
for the construction included in the project within one year of the signing
of the loan.
6.05      Contracts and Procurement.  Construction contracts for the
project will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
by pre-qualified contractors. Bids would be invited in groups of schools
or in single units to allow tendering by both international and Jamaican
contractors on one single unit or several schools within the group of
schools in each bid invitation. All civil works contracts are likely to
be won by local firms.
6.06      Furniture and equipment estimates were reviewed for all project
items; detailed lists with itemized costs will be compiled during design
stages and submitted for Bank review. Contracts for the supply of equip-
ment and furniture would be awarded under international competitive bid-
ding. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to form sizeable
bid packages to encourage such competition. Domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be accorded as a margin of preference the
existing rate of customs applicable to competing imports or 15% of the
c.i.f. price, wlichever is the lower. Imports of teaching equipment are
duty-free.
6.07      Implementation Period.  The proposed project would be completed
within four years of signing the loan (Chart 4).
6.08      Disbursement.  The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed to
finance the foreign exchange component of the project including the interest
and other charges during construction. It is assumed that equipment and



- 19 -
technical assistance will be obtained abroad and the remaining goods and
services for the project will be procured locally. In view of this, the
foreign exchange component of the various expenditures is estimated as
follows: site development and construction, 36%; furniture, 40%; equip-
ment, 95%; professional services, 20%; and technical assistance, 80%. The
proposed allocation of loan funds is indicated in paragraph 5.17. The
disbursement forecast is shown in Chart 5. Undisbursed amounts would be
cancelled.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) the development of curricula for the comprehensive schools
and selection procedures for entry into second-cycle;
training programs for school administrators and technical
teachers (paras. 4.11, 4.13, 4.14, 5.04 and 5.23);
(b) average student/teacher ratios for the comprehensive
schools and the junior secondary schools (para 5.07);
(c) increased broadcasting hours for instructional televi-
sion (para 5.14);
(d) the use of the present Project Unit, as expanded to
include additional specialists, and the appointment
of a coordination committee to advise the Project
Unit (para. 6.02); and
(e) the availability of school sites (para. 6.04).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan would be the appointment
of an architect and quantity surveyor for the Project Unit (para. 6.02).
7.03      The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$13.5 million equivalent to Jamaica for a term of 25 years including
a grace period of 10 years.
