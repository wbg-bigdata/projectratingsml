FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summarv'
Borrower               Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiaries:         The five State Commercial Banks (SCBs) - Bank Bumi Days
(BBD), Bank Dagang Negara (BDN), Bank Ekapor Impor
Indonesia (BankExim), Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) and
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI); and Bank Indonesia (BI).
Amount:                $307 million equivalent
Terms:                 Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. The Borrower
will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the five SCBs as
interest-free loans repayable over 15 years, including 5
years of grace, to be subsequently converted into equity
($300 million), and to BI as a grant ($7 million).
Proiect Description:  The financial sector has been opened to broad based
private sector participat.on as a result of the 19J3-91
deregulation measures. There are now over 180 private
banks (including joint ventures with foreign banks) in
Indonesia, accounting for 45 percent of total deposit
money bank assets. This trend is likely to continue in
the future since, as a result of the new Banking Law,
the SCBs are now subject to the same rules and
regulations as the private banks.
In this new environment, the Government's primary
concern is to promote a sound financial system,
encourage competiticn, at the same time, taking
appropriate steps to ensure stability. The new Banking
Law, approved by Parliamant in March 1992, provides for
49 percent privatization of the SCBs through the issuing
of shar q on the stock marKet.
The project supports the Government of Indonesia's
(GOI's) obJective of enhancing the efficiency of
resource allocation in the banking sector which requires
changing past practices in credit allocation that have
handicapped competitive forces not only in the financial
sector itself, but in the real sector as well, based on:
(i)   strengthening prudential banking regulations and
BI's bank supervision, and improving credit
information systems and staff skills. These
measures would complement other recent GOI's

initiatives undertaken with bilateral and multi-
lateral assistance to further develop the money
and capital markets, and improving commercial law
in order to facilitate and support an increased
level of private businaes transactions and
investment opportunities; and
(1i) promoting the competitiveness and efficiency of
the SCBs by subjecting them to the same rules as
the private sector (i.e., as provided under the
new Banking Law, Bl's new prudential regulations
and the 8CB's new legal charters). This will
allow greater autonomy to the managements of the
8CBa. The 8CDs have been corporatized through a
change In their legal charters. The SCBs' balance
sheets would be restructured and capital bases
strengthened, and they would be subjected to the
play of market forces.
The project comprises three components: (a) technical
assistance to BI for Improving existing systems and/or
designing new ones for bank supervision and credit
Information, and trainitg of BI staff to implement
effectively these systems; (b) a line of credit to the
five SCBs for the provision of subloans to private
enterprises for the carrying out of investment projects;
and (c) the recapitalization of the SCBs. As part of
the recapitalisation, and to achieve the project's
policy objectives, the Bank funds onlent by the Borrower
to the SCB. would be converted by the GOI into equity
upon confirmation of compliance of the SCBs with their
respective Plans of Action, on the basis of BI's
Independent asset quality reviews and new prudential
banking regulations.
With Government's firm commitment not to inject
additional equity Into the SCBs after they have been
brought into compliance by December 1994 with prudential
regulationa, the SCBs will have to divest by raising
future equity needs for asset expansion through the
Issuance of shares In the capital market.
Benefits and Riskst   The policy agenda underlying the project is expected to
lead to substantial efficiency gains in resource use
through the development of a stable, market-oriented,
well-diversified financial system based on sound
finmbial institutions operating competitively under a
transparent legal, regulatory and supervisory system.
The main risk is that the 8CBo may be slower than
expected In developing into efficient financial
lintitutions due mostly to opposition from vested
Interests (since changes in the ways the SCBs do



financial business in the future will effect business
reaationev requiring adjustments in the real sector)
and/or an unexp.cted deterioration in overall
macroeconomic conditi'ns leading to difficulties for the
SCBs in upgrading the qAality of their earning assets.
These risks are mitigated, however, by the GOI's
mauifested determination through recent actions,
undertaken within the framework of the project, to
change the operating environment of the SCBe and to
subject them to compliance vith performance improvement
Plans of Action, as well as by its established track
record of sound macroeconomic management evident in
recent rapid growth.

FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.1       The financial sector of Indonesia has undergone a dramatic
transformation to a competitive, market-based system since the otnset of
financial reforme in 1983. The reforms were introduced in stages and in
conjunction with comprehensive real sector reforms. Consequently, in spite of
experiencing external shocks no less severe than those endured by many other
developing countries, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has been far rIore
successful in containing inflationary pressures, preventing capital flight and
mobilizing financial resources. The reforms in the financial sector
complemented prudent and timely macroeconomic policies, and a broad range of
adjustment measures which led to a strong revival of private sector
investment, non-oil export growth, improvements in the efficiency of capital
use and accelerated economic growth. (Selected economic indicators since 1975
are provided in Annex 1.)
1.2       In the early 1960s, financial sector policies in Indonesia vere
generally subordinated to the needs of funding large government budget
deficits. After a period of economic stagnation and hyperinflation, the
stabilization program of 1966 marked the beginning of a period of
unprecedented growth. The restoration of stability was the result of:
(a) greater control of the money supply; (b) the return to a more market-
oriented economy; (c) enhancing the attractiveness of holding financial assets
through positive real interest rates; and (d) undertaking foreign exchange
reforms through devaluing and unifying the exchange rate. The M2/GDP ratio
inereased from 6 percent in 1968 to 13 percent in 1972. In the 1970s, oil/LNG
export earnings provided the impetus to the rapid growth of the economy,
exceeding 7 percent a year.
1.3       However, by the mid-1970s, financial development began to be
constrained by the imposition of interest rate and credit ceilings on banks.
Relatively high inflation rates contributed to the appreciation of the real
effective exchange rate. The period also saw a sharp expansion in subsidized
credit channeled through comercial banks by Bank Indonesia (BI) by means of
refinancing programs, embodying a multitude of interest rates and refinancing
proportions. Directed credit programs remained an important part of the
Government's overall development strategy, especially as the need to present a
domestic "balanced budget" and to recycle large government revenues from
oil/LNG exports provided a powerful stimulus to the growth of extra-budgetary
lending. The crunch came in the early-1980s when the oil price boom abated
and, in its wake, external payments and fiscal deficits widened considerably.
Inflationary pressures were also aggravated. The decline in oil revenues and
a consequent deterioration of the balance of payments lea to the shrinkage of



-2-
resources of both the Government and the private sector. The mobilization of
domestic resources thus became a matter of utmost urgency.
B. The 1983-90 Reforms
1.4       At the outset of the reforms, the formal financial system in
Indonesia consisted of:  the central bank (Bank Indonesia); the banking
system, comprising deposit money banks, nonbank financial institutions
(NBFIs), savings banks and development banks; leasing and insurance companies;
and a large number of other small credit institutions. The value of the
banking system's assets as a ratio to GDP was relatively small, only
33 percent in 1982. The stock market was completely dormant; market
capitalization of listed equities amounted to only Rp 100 billion. The
deposit money banks, along with BI, dominated the financial system with a
share in total assets of over 95 percent. Among the deposit money banks, the
five state commercial banks (SCBs) had a dominant position accounting for
about three-fourths of total assets. The ratio of M2/GDP still was only
18 percent, having i-r.creased slowly from a mere 13 percent in 1972.
The June 1983 Reforms
1.5       In June 1983, the Government initiated a major financial sector
reform consisting of: (a) deregulation of SCB deposit rates; (b) replacement
of credit ceilings with a system of reserve money management; and
(c) rationalization of the subsidized directed credit program. In order to
engage in reserve money management, BI, in February 1984, issued its own debt
certificate, Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (SBI); in February 1985, B. introduced
as part of its open market operations, a facility to discount trade bills,
bankers acceptances, and promissory notes issued by banks and NBFIs - Surat
Berharga Pasar Uang (SBPU).
1.6       The motivation for the deregulation of 1983 was concern about the
tighter resource position resulting from the weakening of oil prices. By
allowing greater flexibility in deposit interest rates, the deregulation
measures significantly increased the volume of resources mobilized through the
financial system. However, success in other areas -was limited and several
issues remained. First, despite the reform, competition remained weak due to
regulatory restrictions on operations, branching and entry barriers. Lack of
compet'ion was reflec--d in relatively high intermediation costs.  Second,
the P  >, which accounted for three-fourths of the total assets of the deposit
mor,  .Janks, contirued to dominate the banking system due to preferential
tri:o Sent on branching, capital and loan-loss provision requirements, and
ar..e-ss to deposits from public enterprises (which were restricted from dealing
with private financial institutions). Third, the expansion of directed credit
lending further fragmented the financial market and adversely affected
long-term fund mobilization. Fourth, the ability of SCBs to refinance a
substantial proportion of their loans with BI at subsidized rates and liberal
credit insurance provisions for these loans resulted in perfunctory credit
analysis which led to weak portfolio performance of some of these banks.
Finally, the legal, information and regulatory framework for the financial
sector remained weak and the pace of financial innovation was slow.

The OctobernjDecembev 1988 Reforms
1.7       During October-December 1988, the Governmcnt introduced a
comprehensive set of reform measures to further enhance financial sector
efficiency, by encouraging competition, and to increase the availability of
long-term finance; by promoting the development of capital markets. The
specific measures i.ncluded: (a) permitting the entry of new private banks,
including joint ventures with foreign banks; (b) allowing domestic banks to
open branches throughout Indonesia, and NBFIs and foreign banks to set up
offices in seven major cities; (c) permitting new rural banks to be
established in districts outside the capital; (d) easing the requirements for
a bank permitted to transact foreigr. exchange; (e) allowing state enterprises
to place up to 50 percent of their bank diposits with private banks and NBFIs;
(f) allowing NBFIs to issue -r f$icates of deposits; (g) stipulating loan
concentration ratios for baL.   nd "iBFIs that limited lending to a eingle
borrower or group; (h) specifying 4inimum capital requirements for banks and
NBFIs, and solvency ratios for instu.ance companies; (i) eliminating
differential reserve requirements for ban) by establishing a uniform and
lower rate of 2 percent and rnmoving restrictions on interbank borrowings;
(j) extending the maturities of SBIs and SBPUs, and taking steps to develop a
secondary market for them; (k) determining the swap premiums on the interest
rate differentials between domestic and international markets; (1) reducing
the discrimination against the public holding securities market instruments as
compared to holding tvrm deposits with the banks; (m) establishing an
over-the-counter (OTC) market to enable smaller firms to issue shares;
(n) allowing the private sector to operate stock exchanges in Jakarta and
other major cities; (oj' permitting banks and NBFIs to raise capital from the
securities market; (p) allowing banks to have subsidiaries that were multi-
service financial companies providing leasing, factoring, consumer finance and
venture capital facilities; and (q) permitting foreign investors to buy up to
49 percent of the shares in each nonfinancial company listed on the stock
exchange.
1.8       In contrast to the 1975-82 period, when growth in financial assets
stagnated as a result of high inflation, deposit rate ceilings and adverse
foreign exchange expectations, the 1988 reforms had a strong positive impact
on the diversification of the country's financial structure. The reforms had
a pro ounced impact on resource mobilization, competition and financial
intermediation efficiency (paras. 1.13-1.17). However, the GOI's directed
subsidized credit programs kept the financial market fragmented, as
characterized by large differences in access to credit and its cost for
individual borrowers, adversely affected long-term funds mobilization,
contributed to distortions in the use of financial resources, reduced
transparency and weakened financial discipline. Following a deceleration in
i983/84, resulting from the June 1983 reforms, directed credits increased
rapidly. However, because total domest'c credit rose even more rapidly over
the period, the share of directed crediit declined, from around 50 percent of
total domestic credit in 1982 to about 28 percent in 1989. The bulk of
directed credit, about 95 percent, was in the form of BI liquidity credits
(KLBI). Under this system, BI refinances, on predominantly concessional
terms, a large share of commercial bank credit to designated categories of
borrowers. About 80 percent of total KLBI has been channeled through



-4-
state-owned banks (the five SCBs, the national development bank and the
housing bank).
The January 1990 Reforms
1.9       The distortions created by the liquidity credits prompted the  OI to
initiate a far-reaching reform of directed credit progpams on January 29,
1990. The number of programs eligible for BI refinancitng facilities was
reduced from 37 to only four, and the interest rates on these programo war
moved closer to market rates: (a) investment and working capital credits to
members of rural and primary cooperatives; (b) one-year credits to rural
cooperatives to finance procurement and other productive activities;
(c) credits to BULOG, the national food buffer stock maintenance company; and
(d) investment credits of minimum five-year maturity by development banks and
plantation credits through commercial banks. No interest rate limits were set
for the five-year plus maturity investment and plantation credits; interest
rates charged to final beneficiaries under the ither three programs were
raised to 16 percent. In addition, credit insurance for liquidity credits,
which previously had been mandatory at artificially low premiums, was made
optional with premia to be determined on a market-basis. In May 1990, BI
discontinued new liquidity credits for plantations.
1.10      The reform of the subsidized directed credit system is particularly
important for its resource allocation effects and for the conduct of monetary
policy. The stock of outstanding liquidity credits declined by 20 percent to
Rp 14.0 trillion by October 1991, and their share in total domestic credit
declined from 28.4 percent in 1989 to 12.6 percent in 1991. This share is
expected to decline further as the existing stock of liquidity credits matures
in the coming years. This will facilitate BI's ability to influence the
reserve money needs of a growing economy through open market operations.
1.11      Because of concerns that small firms had been relatively
unsuccessful in taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the trade and
financial liberalization and deregulation, the January 1990 reforms also
required all nationally-owned commercial banks to lend at least 20 percent of
their portfolio to small enterprises, defined as firms with fixed assets
(excluding land) not exceeding Rp 600 million and loan amounts not exceeding
Rp 200 million. Banks are free to select borrowers and to set interest rates.
While no formal penalties --re specified, BI stated that it would take
noncompliance into consideration in its classification of the soundness of
banks. The 20 percent rule is an attempt on the part of the GOI to solicit a
supply response so as to correct an apparent market failure in the financial
system.
1.12      In addition to the reform of the subsidized directed credit
programs, the G01, in January 1990, also announced its Intention to privatize
the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSE) and to divest the Capital Market Supervisory
Agency (BAPEPAM) of its operational and promotional functions, in order for it
to concentrate on the supervision of trading activities.

C. Structure and Growth of the Financial System
1.13      The 1983-90 financial sector reforms had a profound effect on the
financial system. Gross assets of the formal financial sector increased
six-fold, at an annual average nominal growth rate of over 25 percent during
the period (Table 1.1 below). The value of banking system's assets as a
ratio to GDP doubled to 66 percent during the same period. The
financialization of savings also progressed very rapidly; financial
savings-currency, demand deposits, quasi money and securities-equalled
62 percent of gross domestic savings in 1990. The ratio of V_/GDP increased
sharply from 18 percent in 1982 to 42 percent in 1990. (Monetary survey data
is provided in Annex 2.)
1.14      The growth of the financial sector was also reflected in the
increased number of new banks and other financial institutions. Following the
elimination of entry barriers in October 1988, the number of deposit money
banks increased by end-1990 by 55, including 15 new joint venture banks;
insurance companies by 11; and rural credit institutions by over 200. The
number of bank branches also more than doubled to 3,500 in less than two
years. Much of the growth in the financial system was attributed to private
sector activity. Private banks grew twice as fast as state banks. Their
share of total deposit money bank assets increased from 18.4 percent ina 182
to 43.6 percent in 1990; the share of the SCBs declined from 73.6 percent to
48.7 percent during the same period. By November 1991, the share of the SCBs
had declined further to 45.8 percent while that of the private banks increased
to 44.8 percent.
1.15      The reforms also sparked major innovations in financial products and
services available to borrowers and savers. In addition to the securities
market, other new products and services included domestically syndicated
loans, mortgage and consumer loans, convertible and floating rate notes
(bonds), mutual funds, and a variety of savings schemes.
1.16      The hitherto dormant securities market also experienced a rapid
revival following the reform measures as summarized in Table 1.2 below. The
number of listed companies on the JSE, which had stood at 24 since 1984,
surged to 132 by December 1990. In addition, 23 companies issued bonds in
1990, compared to only three in 1987. Overall, market capitalization jumped
800 percent in 1989 and a further 200 percent in 1990. At the end of 1990,
market capitalization amounted to the equivalent of $7.2 billion, or over
7 percent of GDP. This is roughly 17 percent of the increase in bank credits
during the same period. Thus, in a very short time, the stock market became
an important source of long-term funding for the economy. Foreign investments
in the stock market played a large role in the market's growth.
1.17      The predominant influence of financial reforms was felt on the level
of real deposit rates, which turned strongly positive as the spread betweei,
rates offered by the state banks and other banks narrowed substantially (see
Table 1.3 below). The reforms increased competition among banks, and the
interest spread-the difference between interest earned and interest paid, as a
proportion of assets-declined. While growing competitive pressures have
reduced banking profit margins, it has also resulted in increased cost
efficiency. Noninterest operating costs (excluding provisioning expenses)

have dropped from about 3.8 percent of total assets in 1982 to just under
2.0 percent in 1990. This decline has occurred despite the increase in bank
offices and the attendant overhead expenses these entail. The decline
resulting from economies of scale is especially strong for the private banks.
1.18      In spite of increased cost efficiency and competition, r. l interest
rates have remained high in Indonesia compared to international levels.
Although the Government would like to influence domestic interest rates and
hence real sector development, the close integration of the domestic financial
sector with international markets, given an open capital account, has meant
that international interest rates and the expected exchange rate risk (along
with a country risk premium) has tended to provide an effective floor to
domestic deposit rates.   Monetary policy has little influence on interest
rate determination in the longer term. Expansionary monetary policies to
lower interest rates below this floor would lead to a loss in reserves through
capital outflows (interest rate arbitrage would also be expected to set a
ceiling on domestic interest rates through capital inflows). In other words,
the domestic deposit rate equals LIBOR plus expectations about devaluation and
a small margin for the high risk of holding financial assets in Indonesia as
compared to, for example, Singapore. In the past, strong rumors of devaluation
have often resulted in large capital outflows; sharp increases in domestic
interest rates have been necessary to reverse the flow of capital and, thus,
to counteract pressure on the rupiah.
1.19      The expansionary monetary policy followed during 1988-90, led to
higher inflation, capital outflows and balance of payments difficulties. The
tight monetary policy stance adopted since mid-1990, resulted in a sharp rise
in real interest rates (domestic deposit rates increased by 840 base points
from 16.3 percent to 24.7 percent between June 1990 and June 1991) and a quick
recovery in international reserves as a result of large capital inflows. Past
experience indicates that the combination of an open capital account, a
balanced domestic budget law, and financial sector deregulation, including the

phasing out of liquidity credits, allows monetary authorities only l-iited
control on domestic liquidity. The appropriate role of monetary policy is
controlling domestic inflationary pressures and maintaining a prudent level of
reserves. In recognition of this, BI in 1990/91 used open market operations
much more actively than in the past; it also acted to limit the net open
position of banks in foreign exchange liabilities from 25 percent of capital
to 20 percent, limited the use of swap facilities and reduced the amount of
permitted offshore borrowing by banks to 30 percent of capital. The change in
regulations limited commercial banks' options in sourcing funds from abroad.
These policies have since resulted in a marked slowdown in domestic credit
growth. However, money supply growth remains endogenous to the system due to
the still small size of money market, the absence of domestic Government paper
(a consequence of the domestic balanced budget rule) and an open capital
account. Past experience also indicates that lower domestic interest rates
can only be sustained through coordinated monetary and fiscal policies that
result in lower inflation and dampen expectations of exchange rate



depreciation, thereby reducing the margin between domestic and international
interest rates.
1.20      Corrective monetary adjustment measures followed during most of 1991
to keep the balance of payments position manageable, resulted in a marked
slowdown in the growth of the financial sector. Total assets of the deposit
money banks increased by only 11 percent during the first eleven months of
1991, compared to 45 percent per annum growth in the preceding two years.
Some slowdown was to be expected as banks consolidated their positions after a
period of very rapid growth. In addition, the need to comply with the new
prudential banking regulations, including minimum capital requirements
effective March 31, 1992, had an impact on the pace of asset expansion. After
the initial spurt, the stock market also collapsed and the share price index
declined by 60 percent between mid-1990 and September 1991. The decline in
the stock market activity is attributed to both structural deficiencies and
other factors, including the tight monetary policy pursued by the GOI since
May 1990, leading to a very sharp rise in domestic deposit rates, a delay in
the introduction of much needed market regulations regarding listings and
disclosure requirements, and market corrections in view of unrealistically
high offering prices (the price-earning ratio averaged over 39 in 1989). The
market has recovered somewhat since November 1991 after BAPEPAM issued new
regulations on October 5, 1991.
1.21      The rapid expansion of bank balance sheets was not matched by a
lengthening of deposit and credit maturities, and, in fact, the maturity
mismatch has increased since 1986, when the average deposit maturity reached a
peak of 8.6 months. This has increased the exposure of banks to interest rate
risk, even though this risk is to some extent hedged by the increasing use of
variable interest rate pricing. Expectations of a large devaluation in 1991,
reflected in a flat/downward sloping yield curve, led to a further shortening
of deposit maturities.
1.22      The present financial structure of the Indonesian market has the
following characteristics: the financial system comprises a large number and
variety of institutions-commercial, savings, development and
investment/merchant bank., insurance and leasing companies, and several
specialized intermediaries. However, despite recent growth, the financial
system is underdeveloped and the range of instruments available for savings
and risk dispersion is still limited. Given the low level of development of
the money and capital markets, there is a tendency for institutions, includ'ng
contractual savings institutions, and investors to deal at the shorter end of
the markets. There have been some recent innovations in the development of
sale-and-lease back arrangements for buildings and the domestic syndication of
credit and leases. The deposit money banks have increased their domination of
the financial structure of Indonesia; other nonbank financial intermediaries,
though proliferating over the years, are much less important in terms of both
resource mobilization and financing of economic activity.

D. Key Sector Issues and Government Strategv
1.23      As a result of the 1983-1991 financial sector deregulation, most of
the policies needed to develop a more robust and balanced financial structure
are now in place: interest rates have been deregulated; credit ceilings
abolished; entry barriers lowered; subsidized directed credits drastically
reduced; and steps taken to develop capital markets. These reform
initiatives, combined with an open capital account and the GOI's policy of
refraining from domestic financing of budget deficits (the domestic balanced
budget rule), have made Indonesia's financial sector one of the most
deregulated and market-based financial systems in the developing world.
1.24      Key Issues.  While the deregulation initiatives have yielded
substantial positive results (for example, enhanced competition, market-
determined interest rates, profitable investment opportunities and increased
savings mobilization), they have also led to the concentration of credit (and
as a consequence, ownership of the real sector) among a few large business
groups, and engenderea new challenges. In the past, the GOI exercised direct
control over productive activities through large public investments. It also
influenced real sector activities in the private sector through its control
over financial flows. As a consequence, the adequacy of prudential
regulations and supervision, commercial laws and their enforcement, and the
financial performance and condition of state-owned financial institutions were
not considered critical to the stability and growth of the financial system.
Rapid private sector-led growth since deregulatLon has exposed several
weaknesses in the financial sector; it has also increased the risk of
financial instability, in the absence of an effective government legal,
regulatory and supervisory apparatus.
1.25      Direct government intervention to serve government's economic goals
meant that supervision of the financial sector was directed mainly towards
monitoring compliance with its numerous economic regulations, especially under
the many officially directed credit programs. With the development of
Indonesia's market-oriented financial system, a primary objective of the
Government's supervisory role has become that of ensuring the safety and
soundness of banks, in order to make them both efficient instruments in
financing econom4c activities and effective savings mobilizers. At the same
time, the mushrooming of financial products and institutions in recent years
is straining the capacity of authorities to supervise and regulate properly
the markets.
1.26      Rapid private sector-led growth since 1985 has also exposed serious
weaknesses in the country's existing economic and commercial laws, including:
the substance of existing laws and regulations; the means by which new laws
and regulations are developed; the dissemination of laws, regulations and
related information; and interpretation and enforcement. Reliable information
based on clearly defined accounting and auditing requirements, which is a
critical prerequisite for the assessment and transparency of financial risk,
improved credit allocation and efficient intermediation, is also difficult to
obtain. This has resulted in increasing costs and unpredictable outcomes in
private business transactions as well as limited the flow of credit towards
new and small businesses. The establishment and enforcement of a
comprehensive legal framework is required in the interest of efficient



- 11 -
intermediation and improving the overall allocation of resources in the
economy.
1.27      In spite of the 1983-1991 deregulation, the SCBs continued to
operate (prior to early 1992) outside the purview of the Banking Law; they
have received differential treatment with respect to banking regulations and
have had disproportionate access to cheap and captive sources of funds. Not
only did the SCBs benefit from their privileged position, but so did a number
of individual and group borrowers because of their easy access to credit from
the SCBs. All the SCBs, to varying degrees, are in violation of legal lending
limits. The earlier deregulation therefore needs to be complemented with a
second stage set of measures so as to establish a genuine level playing field
for the SCBs (which still account for close to one-half of the assets of the
deposit money banks in Indonesia) and private banks. However, unless the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) as the owner and BI as the regulator, promote and
enforce a major change in the SCBs' operations (including eliminating their
past privileges and subjecting them- to the same rules and regulation as the
private banks), further development of an efficient financial service industry
could not be attained.
1.28      Despite recent growth, the financial system remains underdeveloped;
funding the economy is substantially through debt instruments and important
gaps remain at the long end of the market, particularly in the availability of
equity and equity-type instruments. Partly due to the domestic balanced
budget rule, today there is a dearth of financial paper and a lack of
benchmark financial prices; market determined reference rates for both short-
term (interbank and money markets) and long-term (bond market) are absent. In
addition, real interest rates remain high compared to international levels;
this is partly attributed to weaknesses in the financial system (which
increase the cost and risk of doing business in Indonesia) and partly to the
limited effectiveness of monetary policy in an open capital account and a
deregulated financial system. Following the very substantial deregulation of
the financial sector during 1983-1991 and its integration with international
financial markets, the Government has now embarked on a second phase of
regulatory and institutional reform to obtain a high degree of efficiency in
intermediation.
1.29      Government Strategy.  The GOI recognizes that an open capital
account and a deregulated financial system impose a stricter discipline on
macroeconomic management, making macroeconomic stability critical to
successful and sustainable financial sector development and long-term growth.
To this end, the Government is emphasizing coordination of monetary, fiscal
and exchange rate policies. The GOI economic reform program is designed to
improve the incentive framework and to simplify economic regulations, which
will also promote increased efficiency in public enterprises. The
Government's role has been gradually shifting from one of direct control of
productive activities towards that of facilitating the development of markets
and competition. Developing a sound and robust financial system for efficient
resource allocation is a core element in this strategy. It requires a
regulatory and institutional framework that addresses market failures while
retaining competitive pressures in the industry in order to lower the risk of
financial instability and to reduce the economy-wide costs of capital
formation.



- 12 -
1.30      The GOI's second-stage reform program to improve the efficiency of
resource allocation and to reduce transaction costs focusses on:
(a) strengthening the weak institutional infrastructure (legal and
prudential); (b) changing the ways the SCBs have conducted financial business
in the past; and (c) further developing the money and capital markets. To
pursue these objectives, the GOI has Initiated a number of steps to update
and/or introduce new logislation, to strengthen prudential regulations and
effective supervision of the banking sector and capital markets, and to
provide the SCBs' managments with increased autonomy and subject them to the
play of market forces, thus preparing them for partial privatization through
dilution of government equity In the near future.
Institutional Infrastructure
1.31      The efficiency and robustness of a financial system depends on the
quality of the Institutional lnfrastructure, both regulatory and legal.
Financial discipline and timly enforcement of contracts are predicated on a
system of laws and regulations that are unambiguous about the rights and
obligations of contracting parties. Efficient intermediation requires access
to reliable information on borrowers, which in turn necessitates clearly
defined accounting standards and auditing arrangements. The Indonesian system
at present falls short on several of these requirements.
1.32      Prujential Control and Sunervision. With the deregulation of the
financial system, the viability of financial institutions, the safety of
deposits, and the efficieny and integrity of the banking system in Indonesia
has become increasingly important. Some formal bank supervision has existed
in BI since 1977 when a quantitatively-based bank rating system, partially
modelled after the U.S. system (commonly known by its acronym CAMEL, in that
capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity constitute
the main areas of evaluation) wao introduced. After the 1988 reform package,
BI broadened its approach to prudential control, reorganized its Bank
Supervision Department (BSD), added new staff, and requested and received a
six-month technical assistance from the IMF for designing a new off-site
monitoring system, Bank Indonesia Supervisory Monitoring System (BISMS).
These measures notwithstanding, much more still needs to be accomplished. The
sheer number and size of banking institutions (coupled with the task of
redefining prudential control norms, implementation of those norms and the
training of staff to handle these new responsibilities) pose a major challenge
to the supervisory authorities.
1.33     While a consensus to strengthen prudential regulations and
superviaion has existed since the announcement of the 1988 reform package, an
increased sense of urgency has resulted from the disclosure (in September
1990) of massive losses of a largo private bank, primarily from foreign
exchange operations.  While BI took swift action in response to the
disclosures (including a change In the bank's management), the failure of BI
to identify this problem through its routine supervision process has only
underscored the need for improved bank supervision.
1.34      BI, with the assistance of the Bank under a Project Preparation
Facility (PPF No. P-162), hos Identified the needs for technical assistance in
addressing the following (detailed In Section B of Chapter III and Annex 3 of



- 13-
the SAR) weaknessess (a) the effectiveness of BI's off-site surveillance is
severely hampered by weak accounting standards as vell as inadequate reporting
formats (which are geared more towards monetary polic:? aspects for BI's
research department rather than for bank supervision purposes); (b) BI's
ability to evaluate banks' asset quality, and ultimately solvency, is limited
by its reliance on quantitative data on loan quality submitted by banks. BI
needs to upgrade the skills needed to determine effectively asset quality
through on-site examinationas (c) BI staff have only limited expertise in
specialized areas of bank supervision, including foreign exchange activities,
asset and liability management, off-balance sheet risks, electronic data
processing systems of banks and capital market-related activities; and (d) BI
does not as yet have the expertise to evaluate the quality of bank management.
A broad view of a bank's soundness, including its financial condition and
performance, as well as more qualitative factors such as depth and succession,
adequacy of policies and internal controls, and compliance with lawp.
regulations and supervisory requirements, needs to be incorporated 1.. any bank
evaluation; (e) BI has not prioritized its supervisory efforts towards
institutions and aspects where risk to the banking sector is greatest; and
(f) efficiency within BI's bank supervision is hampered by an outdated manual-
based administrative system.
1.35      As a first step in its strategy to strengthen its prudential
control, BI issued new banking regulations on February 28, 1991 (see Annex 4).
Of particular importance are the regulations related to loan loss provisioning
and minimum capital requirements, both of which break new ground in Indonesia.
Previously, there were no minimum capital adequacy standards, and loan loss
provisioning was done on a relatively subjective basis as well as arbitrarily
restricted on tax grounds. The new regulations now derive loan loss
provisioning from a qualitative assessment of a bank's earning assets (both on
and off-balance sheet) based on objective evaluation criteria, including the
analysis of the repayment capacity of the projects/activities for which funds
were borrowed. Minimum capital requirements follow the guidelines established
by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) for the G-10 countries
(para. 3.12). All banking regulations are to be applied uniformly to all
banks, public and private, thus bringing the state-owned banks fully under the
purview of BI. The more important of the newly announced regulations include:
legal lending limits; bank guarantees concerning off-shore borrowings; bank
activities in the capital market; foreign exchange transactions concerning
margin trading and net open position; financial reporting requirements and
publication of banks' financial statements in newspapers; bank rating system;
and sanctions. This adoption of international banking standards will
strengthen domestic banks and also enhance their credibility vis-a-vis their
offshore relationships.
1.36      Legal Zramework.  With each successive reform in the 1980s,
Indonesia's laws governing the financial sector became increasingly antiquated
and inadequate. The 1967 Banking Law, passed at a time when the financial
system (and the economy) were tightly controlled, had become unsuited to the
needs of a deregulated financial system. The law was unclear on licensing,
and, on the powers of BI. BI's ability to take corrective action by imposing
fines, removing management and restricting dividends was limited and not
clearly defined. Similarly, Indonesia's Company Law has remained unchanged
during the past 50 years; it deals inadequately with such fundamental issues



- 14 -
as limited liability, shareholders' duties and rights, standards of conduct
for directors, safeguards for minority lnveetors, and financial reporting and
auditing requirements. In addition to the Company Law, laws pertaining to
credit and security interests are important in a modern financial system.
Because credit and security agreements frequently are unenforceable in
Indonesia, the net result is often higher interest rates and over-
coliateralization; lenders also seek personal guarantees even though
transactions may have been fully collateralized. This practice reduces
liquidity and leverage, and also discriminates against new and small
businesses. There are also notable gaps in the legal and accounting framework
for financial transactions. Because of a lack of institutional arrangements
for collateral registration. and of legal uncertainties and impediments to
land ownership, collateral-based loan transactions are insufficiently
developed. Legal uncertainties have intensified the traditional aversion to
dilution of corporate ownership and hindered a balanced development of debt
and equity finance. Similarly, the operations of mutual funds, issuance of
acceptances, negotiability of instruments, insurance companies and pension
funds, and the like, we- hased on executive decrees rather than on legal
codes.
1.37      In order for the legal framework to keep pace with the rapidly
changing financial sector, the GOI prepared revised Banking Legislation as
well as new legislation for insurance companies and pension funds during 1991.
These laws were approved by the Parliament during February-March 1992. The
Banking Legislation provides BI with a sound legal framework to promote the
safety and soundness of banks. It empowers BI to set provisions concerning
the maximum amount of credit, guarantees and investment in debt securities or
any other asset that a bank may extend to a single borrower or a group of
related borrowers, including affiliates of the bank. BI has also been given a
key role in approving new licenses; the licensing policy itself has been
clarified in che legislation and includes legal form, initial capital
requirements, qualification of senior management, ownership and establishment
of branch offices. The legislation gives broad legal powers to BI to regulate
the soundness of banks, to seek information and documentation from banks, to
carry out examinations at any time deemed necessary, and to take prompt and
effective action vis-a-vis probiem banks (including requiring shareholders to
contribute more capital, to replace management, to write-off bad debt, and to
merge with another bank, as well as revoking a bank's license and/or
recommending bankruptcy procedures). In addition, the existing NBFIs, which
are hybrid finance companies/securities firms, w411 be converted into either
commercial banks or brokerages within one year.
1.38      The change in the legal status of NBFIs has been prompted by
prudential concerns given the volatility of the Indonesian securities market.
The legislation provides for two types of banks: general (commercial banks)
and peoples' credit (rural credit institutions). Peoples' credit banks are
prohibited from accepting demand deposits and conducting foreign exchange
activities. A commercial bank may be chartered either as a company, a
regional-owned enterprise, a limited liability company or a cooperative. The
shares of commercial banks that are in the form of limited liability companies
may only be issued as registered shares. Foreign citizens and foreign legal
entities will be permitted to purchase shares of commercial banks as
stipulated by the Government (previously, foreigners were allowed to purchase



- 15 -
up to 49 percent of the shares listed on the stock exchange for nonfinancial
companies only). Banks will be required to publish in the local press their
quarterly audited balance sheets and income statements. Under the new Banking
Law, the Minister of Finance (and not the President of the Republic of
Indonesia) ie empowered to appoint the senior management of state-owned
financial institutions. Finally, financial Jnstitutions will have the freedom
to hire expatriate staff.
1.39      The Bank, through its sector work in 1990 (Corporate Legal Framework
Study), assisted the GOI in analyzing priorities for commercial law reforms in
Indonesia.  In 1991, the GOI requested the assistance of USAID J: order to
improve the country's economic and commercial laws governing the rising level
of private transactions and investments, while also helping to foster more
equitable treatment for all firms and individuals. Under its Economic Laws
and Improved Procurement Systems Project, USAID will provide the services of
consultants to assist the GOI in the preparation of new and/or improved
commercial laws, regulations, procedureo, systems and institutional
structures. Priority would be accorded to: contract law, including provision
for credit, collateral and consumer protection; company law, including
provision for accounting, auditing and capital market regulation; alternative
forms of dispute resolution (for example, arbitration); improvements in
accessibility to information on commercial laws and related regulations; and
training for law school faculty and government legal bureau personnel within
the judiciary.
State Commercial Banks
1.40      Within the financial system of Indonesia, the five SCBs, i.e., Bank
Bumi Daya (BBD), Bank Dagang Negara (BDN), Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia
(BankExim), Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 (BNI) and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI),
traditionally have dominated the banking sector. (Refer Annex 5 for an
overview of the five SCBs.) The evolution of the SCBs was strongly influenced
by the role and policies of BI which set deposit and lending rates,
established credit ceilings and guided the allocation of credit through the
liquidity credit mechanism. BI's refinancing facilities were the most
important source of funds for the SCBs. The SCBs also benefited from
privileged access to business with Government agencies, providing them with
captive and cheap sources of funds (for example, demand and time deposits held
by public enterprises), and preferential treatment with respect to banking
regul ions (for example, loan loss provisioning and branching), which
themselves were relatively weak. This effectively insulated the SCBs from
competition and diminished the stimulus for these banks to pursue
opportunities for improving operational efficiencies. The SCBes' managements
thus could not be held accountable for performance, and the Government exerted
little pressure on them to improve results.
1.41      The deregulation of the banking sectcor, by removing controls on the
SCBes' deposit and lending rates, and the discontinuation of most of the
special directed credit programs, provided the SCB managements with increased
autonomy and necessitated a change towards a more business-oriented approach.
One of the positive aspects of the SCBes' participation in the priority credit
programs of BI, however, was that BI prompted and supported the SCBs in
establishing term-lending appraisal capabilities and internal loan review



- 16 -
procedures. (Although formats vary among the SCBs, the information,
documentation and analysis required is basically the same. Loan applications
are evaluated on the basis of standard creditworthiness criteria, including
the capability of the entrepreneur, the financial position of the enteL-prise,
market prospects and collateral. For investment loans exceedlig Rp 500
million, audited financial etatements and a feasibility study are normally
required as part of the client's loan application.) After the 1983 reforms,
the SCBs had to mobilize resources for lending purposes directly from the
public and were forced to focus attention on operating more efficiently in an
increasingly competitive environment. The SCBs have moved forward to meet
this challenge and their new role.
1.42      Financial Position.  At the end of 1983, total SCB assets (excluding
administrative accounts) amounted to Rp 17.4 trillion. Total assets doubled
during the next three years, reached Rp 36.2 trillion by the end of 1986, and
continued to mushroom after that, totaling Rp 90.5 trillion at the end of
1990-an average annual growth of almost 26 percent for the seven-year period.
Average annual growth rates for the individual SCBs approximated the
aggregated average, ranging from 22 percent for BNI to 30 percent for
BankExim. Aggregated financial positions and performance indicators ior the
five SCBs during the period 1985-91 are summarized in Table 1.4 below.
(Detailed operational and financial data, including performance indicators, on
the individual SCBs during the same period are provided in the Attachments to
Annex 5.] As already noted, a significant portion of the SCBs' increase in
assets during this period was directly attributable to their successful
domestic resource mobilization efforts. Customer deposits (l.e., demand, time
and savings) steadily increased from Rp 18.9 trillion at end-1985 to Rp 56.4
trillion at end-1990. This increase in deposits resulted in satisfactory
liquidity for all the SCBs during this period, and was largely reflected in
significant levels of short-term placements (by 1989 and 1990, loan portfolio
to total assets had stabilized at 66 percent, ranging from around 50 percent
for BankExim to about 78 percent for BBD). During the same period, BI
liquidity credits and other 001 borrowings also increased in absolute terms
(i.e., from Rp 8.3 trillion to Rp 16.9 trillion), although modestly in
comparison to customer deposits. As of end-19909 adjusting for BI liquidity
funds and other Government loans, the SCBs' aggregated loan-to-deposit ratio
was satisfactory at 77 percent (although the range among the individual SCBs
was 56 percent for BankExim to 99 percent for BRI). Seventy percent of total
SCB assets and 78 percent of liabilities were short-term, resulting in an
assot and liability/equity structure that was reasonably well-matched.
1.43      However, during 1991, the rapid growth of the previous years came to
an abrupt end. The SCBs' total assets increased by less than 6 percent.
While BBD and BDN experienced growth rates of 16 and 14 percent, respectively,
BRI grew by only 7 percent while BankExim experienced no growth and BNI
experienced PSn actual decline in total assets of 7 percent. With the
announced retrenchment in early 1990 of liquidity credits (paras. 1.9 and
1.10), the SCBs have also become more reliant on funding for their lending
operations from their respective deposit bases. By end-1991, loans accounted
for almost 72 percent of total assets (ranging from 56 percent for BankExim to
79 percent for BBD), and the adjusted loan-to-deposit ratio had reached
89 percent (ranging from satisfactory levels of 68 and 76 percent for BankExim
and BNI, respectively, to unsatisfactory levels of 95, 98 and 106 percent for

BRI, BBD and BDN respectively). All five SCBs are underc.}pitalized
(para. 1.48)-paid-in capital amounts to only .03 percent of total assets. As
a result of the new Banking Legislation (para. 1.37 and 3.20), the SCBs will
now be capitalized at appropriate levels as required under BI's prudential
regulations (para. 3.12).
1.44      Financial Performance.  Based on audited financial statements,
profitability indicators for the five SCBs during the period 1986-1990 were
satisfactory. Annual profits before tax average around 1.1 percent of ave.Tage
total assets (ranging between 0.8 percent for BBD to 2.0 for BankExim).
Substantial progress has been made in reducing personnel expenses. As a
percentage of average total assets, they declined by about 0.4 percent (total
SCB employees between 1983 and 1990 increased by only 13 percent, while total
assets during the same period increased five-fold; during 1991, total SCB
staffing declined by clmost 5 percent-although BBD and BankExim expanded by 13
and 9 percent, respectively). These gains, however, have been somewhat offset
by increases in other administrative expenses of About 0.3 percent. Recent
lending margins (i.e., the difference between income from lending as a percent
of average loan portfolio less financial expenses as a percentage of average
borrowings) for the five SCBs remained rather stable (between 3.8 percent and
4.2 percent), until it dropped sharply to 3.2 percent in 1991-reflecting in
large part, the lag between rapidly rising deposit rates beginning in late
1990 and subsequent increases in onlending rates (although the declining
margins for all the SCBs also appears to reflect an increase in arrears
experienced by them during 1991). Between 1986 and 1990, average net profits
(after taxes-income tax rate of 35 percent) for the SCBs remained very stable
at around 0.7 percent; however, this return also dropped sharply in 1991,
ranging from 0.3 percent for BBD and BDN to 0.5 percent for BankExim.
1.45      While the above discussion suggests that, overall, the performance
of the SCBs has been generally satisfactory, the results of the BI's asset
quality reviews undertaken in 1991 (paras. 3.16 and 3.28) indicate that
provisioning expenses may have been understated in the past, thus effectively
overstating profitability. In fact, a review of actual provisioning done by
the individual SCBs during the past seven years suggest that the level of
annual provisions were made at a level (much like a belancing item) that would
still enable each bank to show a reasonable profit. This becomes particularly
evident in 1986-a year in which all the SCBs received substantial windfall
profits resulting from the September devaluation-when provisions were greatly
increased; likewise, in 1991, with all the SCBs experiencing huge decline in
profitability, provisions were at about half of their previous years' levels.
Bl's new regulations regarding provisioning will not only result in statements
that more accurately reflect the actual financial cc.tdition of Indonesian
banks, but will require the banks to adopt appropriate and timely pricing of
their loans, including prudent margins to provide for risk.
1.46      Future Agenda for the SCBs. The deregulation packages did not,
however, properly address the weaknesses of the SCBs; in turn, the SCBs have
varied in their respective efforts to initiate corporate changes in order to
meet the challenges arising from a deregulated environment. Two SCBs (BNI and
BRI) have completed major institutional reform programs, with the assistance
of international consulting firms under multi-year contracts, to improve their
organizational structures, banking policies, and management guidelines, as



- 19 -
well as to streamline their lending processes. They also have implemented
staff reductions in order to Improve efficiency and profitability. On a
smaller scale, BDN implemented recently an organizational and systems
improvement program, while both BBD and BankExim have recently engaged the
long-term services of international consulting firms to help them improve
their respective operations.
1.47      Nonetheless, in order for the SCBs to achieve further efficiencies,
the GOI, as the owner, has to redefine the rules of the game in terms of
managements' autonomy and accountability. Establishing a level playing field
for all banks requires that the Government formulate a comprehensive policy
with respect to public financial institutions. The relationship between the
banks' owners and management should be such as to provide incentives for
efficient and effective management. Low levels of management accountability
and quasi-automatic replenishment of financial resources, when required, would
continue to create a financial culture that is not conducive to improving the
performance of the financial services industry. Similarly, introduction of
competition in a deregulated environment requires simultaneous actions to
restructure the SCBs' balance sheets; otherwise, the existence of bad loans
(reflecting not only past poor loan decisions and unexpected shifts in
relative prices, but also high-risk directed credits and favorable terms to
non-arms length borrowers) in the SCBs' portfolios will constitute a
continuing drag on their profits.
1.48      The paid-in capital of the SCBs was fixed under their respective
laws of incorporation of 1967/68; additional infusions of equity required
amendments to their respective legal charters, further requiring the approval
of the Parliament. In addition, the SCBs were required to appropriate
45 percent of their annual after-tax profits to the Government as dividends,
thus severely restricting their ability to increase capital reserves through
retained earnings. The growth of the SCBs' assets in the last 25 years was
not matched by a corresponding increase in their respective capital; the SCBs
are thus grossly undercapitalized, especially in light of the new prudential
regulations on loan loss provisioning and minimum capital requirements.
1.49      For further development and efficient growth of the financial
system, the GOI has proceeded to reorient the way the SCBs have conducted
financial business in the past. Henceforth, the SCBs will be subjected to the
same rules and regulations that govern private banks; efficiency and
profitability will determine each SCB's future operations and market share.
The GOI will exercise only strategic control through appointment of
accountable chief executive officers and Boards of Directors, compensation and
incentives for their senior managers, and performance monitoring. SCB
managers will be given a free hand to evolve appropriate internal systems and
practices. The responsibility for performance monitoring and evaluation would
transfer from the MOF to BI. An arms-length relationship and the
clarification of the respective roles and relations between the GOI and the
SCBs, will help ensure proper balance between accountability and autonomy.
1.50      As part of this initiative to provide the SCBs with a level playing
field, the GOI has proposed to clean the books of the SCBs, recapitalize them
in accordance with the new prudential banking regulations, provide the SCBs'
managements with increased autonomy while holding them accountable for the



- 20 _
resulta, and let competition in the market place determine their future
growth. Specific measures towards developing the SCBs into efficient, modern,
full-service, commercial operations have and/or will include the following:
(a) Level Plaving Field:
(i)  the new Banking Law overrides the existing laws of
incorporation of the SCBs and thus eliminates the distinction
between state-owned banks and private banks.  This will permit
BI to apply prudential banking regulations uniformly to all
banks, irrespective of ownership;
(ii)  once fully recapitalized by December 1994, the SCBs would have
to support future asset expansion through corresponding growth
in their respective capital bases by retaining a higher
proportion of their after-tax profits and by issuing shares in
the capital market. In addition, it was agreed during
negotiations that unlike the past, the GOI will no longer
automatically appropriate as dividends 45 percent of the SCBs'
after-tax profits. The SCBs' FY92 scheduled dividends (for
which the GOI has already made provision in its FY93/94 budget)
would be returned to the SCBs as equity infusions.
Furthermore, there would be no dividends appropriated in FY93
and 94; at least 80 percent of the SCBs' FY93 and 94 after-tax
profits would be converted into equity. Beginning in 1995,
dividends would be determined on the basis of overall financial
soundness and performance. The GOI currently holds 100 percent
of shares in each SCB; after the SCBs are fully capitalized,
they would have to raise additional equity through the issuance
of shares until each SCB has been partially privatized to the
extent of 49 percent. The GOI would not inject additional
equity into the SCBs for asset growth, except to retain its
maximum 51 percent of shareholding in each SCB;
(lii) a commitment (under ADB's Second Financial Sector Program Loan)
to remove by July 1993 the requirement that public enterprises
have to place a minimum of 50 percent of their deposits with
the state-owned banks; and
(iv)  independent asset quality reviews of the SCBs by BI (with the
assistance of consultants under the PPF), in order to determine
respective shortfalls in loan loss provisions and additional
capital required to bring them into compliance with the new
prudential banking regulations. These asset quality reviews
were initiated in February 1991 and completed in September
1991, using internationally accepted principles on asset
classification and loan loss provisioning, the BIS guidelines
on minimum capital requirements, and other prudential
regulations of BI, viz, legal lending limits.



- 21 -
(b) Autonomy and Accountability:
(i)  a change in the legal status of state-owned banks into limited
liability companies (PERSEROs or PTs). The use of
profitability as a performance criterion is implicit in the
:tatus of PERSEROs in Indonesia. As PT., the SCBs will have
autonomy in their operations, including the retention of after-
tax profits and staffing decisions. The capital of each
PERSERO will be in the form of ordinary shares and issued as
registered shares. As PTs, the SCBs can issue shares up to a
maximum of 49 percent in the capital market in order to raise
additional equity for future growth. The new Banking Law
permits foreign citizens and foreign entities to purchase up to
49 percent of the shares of financial institutions listed on
the stock exchange;
(ii)  the preparation of a "Plan of Action" for each SCB, based on
the deficiencies identified in BI's examination of the asset
quality of each SCB. The Plans of Action include timebound
programs for improving the quality of earning assets, bringing
the SCBs into compliance with the legal lending limits for
individual and group exposures, improving the security of
collateral, updating financial information on borrowers,
improving credit policies and lending procedures, and
identifying other measures for efficiency improvements.
CoLpliance by the SCBs with their respective Plans of Action
would be linked to disbursements under the proposed loan;
(iii)  a change in senior managements and Boards of Directors of the
SCBs. The GOI has also increased substantially the salaries of
SCBs' senior management to bring them closer to those
prevailing in the private sector;
(iv)  freezing the risk weighted assets of two of the five SCBs (BBD
and BDN) in relatively weak financial positions, at their
current respective levell through December 1994, in order for
these SCBs to accord priority to consolidating and improving
the quality of their risk assets, and freezing the large
borrowers portfolio of BRI at its current level through
December 1994 while it prepares and implements an institutional
reorganization plan aimed at streamlining its organizational
structure;
(v)  in cases where the Government would wish to channel funds for
its future directed credit programs through the SCBs, such
transfers would be treated on a managed-fund basis whereby the
SCBa are given a fee for administering such loans on behalf of
the government, but without assuming any credit risk. This was
agreed during negotiations; and
(vi)  a change in the criteria for evaluating the performance of the
SCBs and determining annual bonuses of the members of the Board
of Directors. In the past, the SCBs automatically retained



- 22 -
7.5 percent of after-tax profits for bonuses and pay increases;
the performance of the SCBs will now be evaluated by the MOF on
the basis of well-defined, transparent criteria-BI'I Bank
Rating System, and the annual bonus will then be determined on
the basis of a SCB's overall soundness classification. This
was agreed during negotiations.
1.51      In a broad sense, the GOI's 1983-1991 reform program has privatized
the financial sector-there currently are low entry barriers, minimum directed
credit, no interest rate controls, and uniform rules and regulations for all
financial institutions. The new Banking Law, approved by the Parliament in
March 1992, provides for the GOI to retain majority shareholding in each
state-owned bank. The Parliament, during its deliberations, also amended the
draft Banking Law to exclude the banks from private placement of shares. The
GOI strategy, within the constraints imposed by the Banking Law, is to pursue
a gradual process of increasing private sector ownership in the SCBs by first
corporatizing the banks and subjecting them to the play of market forces.
This strategy is justified for the following reasons: (i) the banking sector
may come under distress in the near future, since the financial sector
deregulation has moved much faster than the development of legal and other
infrastructure, and the capacity of the authorities to supervise financial
institutions. Moreover, in the absence of a deposit insurance scheme, the
public has greater confidence in the SCBs due to implicit guarantees of the
Government; (ii) the political environment is not considered conducive to
immediate privatization, since the Government is concerned with the increase
in economic concentration as result of deregulation of the economy over the
last several years; (iii) the stock market is in its infancy and cannot
accommodate large-scale privatization of public enterprises; and (iv) the
proposed project would prepare the SCBs for entry into the capital markets, by
restructuring their balance sheets and recapitalizing them. This would
substantially reduce the advantages to the SCBs of implicit government
guarantees that depositors perceive at the present. The GOI wants to wait
with the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme until sufficient
experience is gained with the recently introduced regulatory and supervisory
system.
1.52      The actions already ta-:en by the GOI and/or agreed to be undertaken
under the project should, by delinking the relationship that now exists
between the SCBs and a relatively small number of borrowers, lead to a
significant improvement in the efficiency of resource allocation in Indonesia.
Streamlining business practices of the SCBs, which requires recapitalization
as an essential step, is a foresighted action by the Government. The changes
in the incentives faced by the SCBs' managements should curb economic
concentration (by subjecting conglomerates to constraints imposed by the legal
lending limits and by holding management responsible for performance) and
should also promote competition in the real sector. This is likely to alter
drastically the way financial business is done in Indonesia. These measures
should promote more prudent and commercially oriented banking practices within
each SCB. In addition to leading to a more efficient distribution of credit,
these measures should also generate improvements in the SCBs' financial
performance.

Money and Calital Markets
1.53      In Indonesia, the liquidity credit schemes were not intended, but
evolved, to fill a gap in the financial sector. Given the GOI's balanced
budget rule, liquidity credits provided BI with a vehicle for acquiring credit
claims on Indonesian financial intermediaries as a backing for rupiah reserve
money. In the past, BI did not actively engage in open market operations;
instead, the open market instruments-the SBI and the SBPU-were utilized to
target interest rates rather than monetary aggregates. The absence of a
government bill market has made open market operations difficult, and the
MOF/BI have in the past (for example, in 1991) relied on public enterprise
deposits with the banking system to control base money. In 1989, new
regulations were issued that assigned to some financial institutions the
functions of market makers and brokers, with the objective of increasing the
volume of money market securities trading in primary and secondary markets.
However, the money market is still very small in relation to the needs of the
economy.
1.54      Contractual savings institutions (insurance companies and pension
funds) play an important role in the development of the markets for long-term
funds and securities in the more developed financial systems. However, in
indonesia, these institutions have not developed as significant sources of
long-term finance for a number of reasons, including lack of both a
comprehensive legal framework and the separation of these schemes from the
operations of the sponsoring employers. Other factors inhibiting capital
market development include, risk-return considerations (which diminish the
relative attractiveness of long-term investments in corporate securities
compared to highly liquid and high-return deposits with banks), weak
disclosure requirements (that have eroded the public's confidence in the
financial projections of the issuing companies), poor liquidity due to
underdeveloped secondary markets and the lack of a credit rating agency. The
investable resources of Indonesian insurance and pension funds Lave increased
many-fold during 1982-1990, and currently account for 6-7 percent of the
financial sector's assets. Given the predictable and long-term nature of
their liabilities, investment funds are in a unique position to contribute to
the growth of the capital market. Insurance companies and pension funds need
to be induced gradually to expand the share of their investment portfolios
represented by corporate bonds and equity of nonaffili3ted issuers.
1.55      The GOI has followed up on its intention, announced in January 1990,
to privatize the JSE (para. 1.12). In a decree dated December 4, 1990,
effective January 2, 1991, BAPEPAM was converted into a Securities and
Exchange Commission. BAPEPAM's main responsibilities are restricted to
monitoring and regulating the securities market, and establishing technical
rules with respect to the capital market. PT Bursa Efek Jakarta (BEJ) will
administer the exchange. The BEJ has over 200 members and paid-up capital of
Rp 7.5 billion. The President of BEJ has been selected and brokers, including
joint-venture brokers, have been invited to become shareholders. The BEJ was
licensed in January 1992, and took over day-to-day operations in April 1992.
A new centralized, electronic clearing and settlement system is expected to be
installed soon. The OTC market will continue to be managed by the Association
of Securities and Money Traders until a new private stock exchange is
licensed. The GOI also issued new rulings on licensing requirements for stock



- 24 -
brokers, underwriters, stock exchange operators, investment trust funds, trust
fund managers, clearing and settlement agencies, custodians, trustee agents
and other capital market support institutions and professionals. The new
measures also stipulate the minimum capitalization of underwriting companies,
brokerage and securities houses, and elaborate provisions regarding insider
trading. The measures also allow the establishment of new investment trust
companies, currently the monopoly of the state-owned PT DANAREKSA. PT
DANMREKSA's operations will be restructured, since under the new ruling it
cannot operate as both an investment trust company and a securities house.
1.56      Under its Financial Markets Project, the USAID is providing
financing for an international consulting firm, which is assisting the
MOF/BAPPEPAM in: (i) institutionalizing a capacity to develop, implement, and
continuously modernize internationally-accepted supervisory standards and
practices that are consistent with self-regulatory and disclosure-based
methods of capital market supervision; (ii) developing a self-sustaining,
efficient and liquid market for equities, bonds and other financial
instrument; and (iiI) developing a cadre of knowledgeable and skilled
financial market participants through institutionalizing capital market
training programs. Similarly, under its Second Financial Sector Program Loan,
the ADB is supporting the GOI's efforts to provide among others, regulatory
frameworks and prudential safeguards for insurance companies and pension
funds, financial reporting and disclosure requirements based on
internationally accepted principles, guidelines for investment funds and
venture capital, the establishment of a credit rating agency and the
development of a market-based interbank reference rate.
1.57      The new capital market decrees and lqgislation pertaining to
insurance companies and pension funds should not only broaden the capital
market, but also facilitate greater integration of short- and long-term
markets. The revitalization of the primary market for stock issues should
increase the equitV financing of projects, thus helping to ensure acceptable
debt-equity levels. The development of a more active bond market would foster
the emergence of a positive yield curve on financial assets, and demand should
react positively to a policy of term-related interest differentials. An
effective secondary market would mitigate the effects of long-term risk
exposure and provide adequate assurance of the liquidity savers expect when
undertaking long-term commitments. Under technical assistance from a large
multinational bank, the scope of BI's open market operations would be further
improved; this will assist in the deepening of the money market and the
development of a transparent reference rate for variable rate lending by the
banks.
S. Bank Stra ey
1.58      The Bank actively supports the GOI's objectives and its priorities
for the further development and efficient growth of the financial sector, a
necessary condition for continued vigorous development of the economy. Over
the last several years, the Bank has been involved in policy dialogue with the
GOX through sector and economic reports, informal policy notes and discussions
on specific issues. The Bank has also supported the GOI's policy reform
Initiatives through adjustment loans. The Bank, in its more recent studies



- 25 -
(e.g., Trade Policy, Financial Sector and Corporate Legal Framework), has
highlighted the need to strengthen the weak institutional infrastructure for
formal finance and to further improve the incentive regime. The Accountancy
Development Project (Loan 2940-IND) aims to assist the GOI in improving
accounting practices in both the public and private sectors. Priority issues
identified in the Corporate Legal Framework Study are now being detailed for
implementation in the near future with the assistance of USAT.D.
1.59      The proposed project would assist in strengthening prudential
regulations and effective supervision of banks, in developing further the
credit information system, and in assisting the GOI in the important task of
transforming the SCBs into sound and effective financial intermediaries in a
competitive environment. The financial support to the GOI for recapitalization
of the SCBs under the project is considered the critical component for
improving the efficiency of resource allocation for the whole banking sector.
By providing the SCBs' managements with increased autonomy and a level playing
field, and preparing them for raising future capital needs from the market,
the project would assist in changing practices in the financial system that
have handicapped competitive forces not only in the financial sector, but also
in the real sector. In the future, the Bank's assistance in further deepening
of the money and capital markets is anticipated.
1.60      It is envisaged that the subsector-specific targeted lending, which
has been characteristic of the Bank's financial sector lending operations to
date, will be phased out as the policy environment for resource allocation
improves further and the financial system becomes increasingly competitive and
sophisticated. As a transitional measure, however, the Bank will continue to
support the efficient delivery of general credit and technical assistance to
small enterprises, whose access is at present constrained due to market
failures in the legal and information framework. Through such credit lines,
the Bank would support the market mechanism in allocating credit resources,
meet the technical assistance needs of small enterprises, improve the
responsiveness of financial institutions in servicing these enterprises, and
support the GOI in achieving the twin objectives of improvements in income
distribution and generation of employment on the one hand, and enhanced
industrial organizational efficiency and broadly based entrepreneurial
development on the other.

II. BANK LENDING EXPERIENCE IN FINANCIAL SECTOR OPERATIONS
2.1       Bank lending for financial sector operations (project loans designed
to create or strengthen financial institutions, and loans intended primarily
to channel resources to other sectors through local financial institutions)
amounted to over $20.0 billion during FY81-90, approximately 12 percent of
total lending to all countries. Most of these funds have been onlent for
promoting real sector activity-agriculture, industry, housing-through a
variety of financial intermediaries, both state-owned and private credit
institutions, commercial banks and NBFIs. The Bank Task Force on Financial
Sector Operations, in its report dated April 26, 1991, concluded that
government policy-makers and Bank operations using the financial sector to
pursue real sector objectives have frequently given little consideration to
the impact of these operations on financial sector development. Under the new
Operational Directive on Financial Sector Operations (OD No. 8.30, dated
February 28, 1992), all Bank operations and policy advice related to the
financial sector have to be consistent with, and supportive of, a coherent
country strategy for financial sector development.  More specifically,
financial intermediary loans should be made as part of a well-articulated and
time-bound program for financial policy and institutional reforms that is
expected to bring about the following reforms or where the following
conditions apply: (a) minimum distortions in economic incentives and
sufficient macroeconomic stability so that financial signals driving
investment are consistent with economically sound allocation of credit;
(b) conducive financial sector policies-market-determined interest rates,
little directed credit, low level of subsidized credit, use of neutral and
efficient monetary control instruments, and evenhanded taxation of the sector,
financial institutions and instruments-should be in place or are being
pursued; (c) effective accounting and auditing systems, and acceptable
prudential regulation and competent supervision of the banking system; and
(d) satisfactory management of financial intermediaries, including sound
financial structure and adequate financial performance, and autonomy in their
lending policy and decisions.
2.2       The Bank has also made 15 financial sector adjustment loans/credits
(FSALs) totalling $3,250 million through June 30, 1990. A preliminary
assessment of the Bank's experience with such operations 1/ concludes that
financial reforms should include: (a) elimination of financial repression
(i.e., liberalization of interest rates, reduced level of financial taxation
and reduced level of directed credits); (b) institutional rehabilitation
(i.e., dealing with the problem of delinquent loan portfolios and excessive
intermediation costs); and (c) strengthening of accounting and legal
arrangements, and improving the system of banks and securities industry
supervision and prudential regulation. The report recommends that: (a) the
strategy for FSALs should include significant reforms in each of the above
three areas of policy reforms, and a country without significant problems in
its financial sector should not receive a FSAL; (b) full liberalization of
interest rates should not be pushed, especially in countries experiencing
I/ A Preliminary Assessment of the Bank's Experience with Financial Sector
Adjustment Lending (November 1990).



- 27 -
macroeconomic instability; (c) implications for fiscal policy and the budget
should be taken account of in financial sector reform programs; (d) before
taking extensive liberalization of financial sector, reforms in the real
sector should be well advanced; and (e) because of the longer period needed to
put most financial sector reforms in place, and to ensure that envisaged
reforms are actually implemented, a series of operations disbursed over a much
longer period is desirable.
2.3       In Indonesia, the Bank Group has, to date, approved a total of
$1,613.1 million in 17 operations for financing investments through financial
intermediaries. The general focus of loans made prior to the onset of the
GOI's financial reform program in 1983 reflected the Bank's traditional
DFC-lending focus on single financial intermediaries with emphasis on
institution-building. These projects comprised two credits and four loans to
the state development bank (BAPINDO-$367.4 million), and two lending
operations to the Private Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI-$25
million). The Bank Group's participation in the three Small Enterprise
Development Projects (SEDPs-$350.7 million) supported the development of
Indonesia's small-scale enterprises through BI. The Bank's Rural Credit
Project ($30 million) supported BRI's institutional deve: pment and term
lending in selected geographical areas for a range of agricultural activities.
2.4       The most recent Proiect Performance Audit Report (PPAR) No. 6403,
covering the Bank Group's relationship with BAPINDO over 1979-83 (Loans
1054-IND, 1437-IND and 1703-IND), noted that, while BAPINDO had made some
progress in terms of institutional development, its achievements fell short of
mutual expectations and BAPINDO continued to face substantial problems. The
PPAR made a number of recommendstions for improvements in future operations.
Subsequently, during implementation of Loan 2277-IND (BAPINDO V), BAPINDO
undertook a comprehensive portfolio review, carried out a reorganization and
strengthened its capital base through an infusion of equity from the GOI.2/
PPAR No. 3862 on the second PDFCI project (Loan 1363-IND) found that, although
Bank loan proceeds were transferred to sound industrial projects, performance
towards institutional and policy goals was disappointing, primarily because of
the restrictive macro-policy environment prior to the 1983 reforms.
2.5       The three SEDPs (Credit 785-IND, Loan 2011-IND and Loan 2430-IND)
were in support of BI's KIK/KMKP program.3/ This program was funded through
liquidity credits and provided subsidized loans to end-users. As highlighted
in the two Proiect Completion Reports (PCRs) on these lending operations, the
SEDPs met their objectives of generating jobs and training bank staff;
however, as credit operations they failed to achieve their policy and
institutional development objectives due to several factors: poor borrower
selection criteria; subsidized interest rates; insufficient spreads to
intermediaries; and overly generous credit insurance. This combination
2/ The PCR for Loan 2277-IND concluded that overall the project appears to
have helped BAPINDO to make progress towards becoming a more
operationally efficient, financially viable and sustainable institution.
3/   Kredit Investasi Kecil (KIK-small investment credit) and Kredit Modal
Kerja Permanen (KMKP-smallworking capital credit).



- 28 -
resulted in poor collection rates and high arrears. Despite the attainment of
onlending targets under the Rural Credit Project (Credit 827-IND), the PCR
indicated shortcomings in loan collections and the inability of the financial
intermediary to sustain its long-term 1ending momentum. In addition to its
financial sector lending, the Bank has also supported a number of subsector-
specific operations in the agricultural sector, including nucleus estates and
smallholders projects, smallholder tree crop projects, as well as irrigation
and fisheries schemes, which have channeled credit through various financial
institutions and Government agencies. Success in meeting the project
objectives of these operations has been mixed. Under ongoing tree crop
projects, problems relate to ineligible participants, substandard plantings,
delayed issuance of land titles, inadequate financial incentives for the banks
and inadequate policies governing loan conversions; these projects provided
subsidized funds to the participating financial intermediaries and below
market onlending interest rates to the end-users, required low equity
contributions, extended loan insurance coverage and/or reduced risk exposure
for the banks, and directed credit to specific activities/target groups.
2.6       Following the 1983 reforms and in light of its previous experience,
the Bank made two significant shifts in the mid-1980s in its approach to
financial sector lending operations. One, it moved away from subsidized
lending; and two, it limited significantly single beneficiary lending, thus
enabling end-users to have greater access to the Bank's term resources through
a large number of competing financial intermediaries. Recent projects (i.e.,
the Export Development Projects-Loans 2702-IND and 2979-IND for $229.5
million, the Industrial Restructuring Project -Loan 3040-IND for $284 million,
the Small and Medium Industrial Enterprises Project-Loan 3041-IND for $100
million, and the Agricultural Financing Project-Loan 3402-IND for $106.1
million) have incorporated an increasing number of participating financial
institutions (from three under Loan 2702-IND to 13 under Loan 3041-IND).
While specific target groups continue to benefit from the Bank's lending
activities so as to redress market failures either in the availability of
long-term credit or in the access to such credit for specific group of
borrowers, all loan proceeds are passed on to the financial intermediaries at
variable, market-determined interest rates; these funds, in turn, are onlent
to qualifying enterprises at competitive and prevailing market rates as
determined by the individual intermediaries. Increasing emphasis on
environmental concerns has also been incorporated in recent financial
intermediation operations. Under Loan 3Q40-IND, 3041-IND and 3402-IND, the
assessment of environmental impact and the identification of appropriate
environmental safeguards are formal requirements in the subproject review
process provided under these loans. The BRI/KUPEDES Small Credit Projects
(Loans 2800-IND and 3249-IND for $101.5 and $125 million, respectively) have
the objective of helping promote the development of a market-based,
financially viable, nationwide rural banking network; the major design flaws
that were identified as having contributed to the partial failure of the
earlier SEDPs were avoided in designing this small, and primarily rural,
credit scheme. These projects are ongoing and implementation has proceeded
satisfactorily.
2.7       To summarize, both the very substantial reforms of the financial
system, which will lead increasingly to the allocation of credit according to
competitive market signals, and the lessons from past project loan/credit

operations, which have demonstrated the ineffectiveneso of supporting
subsidized, directed credit programs, will guide the Bank's further
involvement in credit operations. Indonesia is a country where distortions in
the financial sector have now been substintially reduced; yet, the need for
Bank assistance is still significant. The proposed project, while being cast
as an investment project, has as overriding objective to support the GOI's
efforts in strengthening the institutional infrastructure for formal finance
and the rehabilitation of financial institutions, the main recommended areas
for FSALs.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale. Objectives and Description
3.1       Proiect Rationale and Objectives.  The comprehensive reforms
undertaken by the GOI during 1983-1991 have fostered strong growth in
financial assets, and allowed financial institutions increasing freedom to
allocate resources in line with market signals. At the same time, new
challenges are being posed by the mushrooming of financial assets, and the
increasing number of financial intermediaries and new financial products; this
is straining the capacity of authorities to supervise adequately and to
regulate markets appropriately. Experience in some of the high-income
countries shows that competitive financial markets, although efficient at
mobilizing and allocating funds, can also lead to imbalances and, if not
properly checked, inefficient resource allocation. In addition, rapid growth
in Indonesia has placed severe strains on the firancial system to intermediate
efficiently, at-ributed to inadequacies in the existing legal and information
framework as well as in the operations of the SCBa. In principle, the GOI's
policy of deregulation was intended to promote rapid economic development
while also helping to ensure equitable distribution of development gains.
However, existing weaknesses have resulted in unequal access to credit and
thus de facto limited competition in the real sectors of the economy, with
many of the benefits of deregulation accruing to a few influential business
groups.
3.2       In response to these new challenges, the GOI is pushing the reform
process forward through: the updating of laws governiag financial
institutions; announcement of new prudential regulations 'including the
adoption of the BIS guidelines on minimum capital requirements); initiation of
steps to strengthen the supervisory apparatus for the banking and securities
industry; ani changing the ways in which the SCBs have conducted business in
the past, including their conversion into limited liability companies
(PERSEROs). The project's primary objective is to assist the GOI in changing
past practices in the financial system regarding credit allocation that have
handicapped competitive forces not only in the financial sector, but also in
the real sector. Such changes would foster improvements in the efficiency of
resource allocation in the economy and more equitable treatment for all firms
and individuals. The project would support and reinforce the GOI's efforts to
promote the development of an efficient, stable and sound financial sector by:
(i) strengthening prudential banking regulations; (ii) enforcing prudential
regulations by strengthening BI's bank supervision, and improving credit
information systems and staff skills; and (iii) promoting the competitiveness
and efficiency of the SCBs by subjecting them to the same rules as the private
sector (i.e., as provided under the new Banking Law, BI's new prudential
regulations and the SCB's new legal charters). This will allow greater
autonomy to the management of the SCBs. In line with the changes in their
legal charters, the SCBs balance sheets would be restructured and capital
bases strengthened, and they will be subjected to the play of market forces.
With Government's firm commitment not to inject additional equity after the
SCBs have come into compliance with the new prudential regulation on minimum
capital adequacy, the SCBs would have to raise future equity needs for asset
expansion through the issuance of shares in the stock markets.



- 31 -
3.3       The proposed project was developed over a period of almost two
years, following completion of a Financial Sector Study in May 1990. Its
preparation, for which two advances under a PPF 4/ were approved, required
extensive work and analysis on the part of the GOI in a number of related
areas-new Banking Legislation, improved prudential banking regulations and
supervision, detailed asset quality reviews of each SCB, implementation of
international banking norms related to loan loss provisioning and minimum
capital requirements, new legal charters for the SCBs and preparation of a
detailed Plan of Action for each SCB. It also required great determination
and foresight on the part of the GOI to design appropriate measures relating
to the future operations and business practices of the SCBs. The project also
required coordination with bilateral and multilateral agencies to ensure
consistency in their respective objectives and to avoid duplication of
efforts.
3.4       Proiect Description.  The project comprises three components:
(a) technical assistance (TA) to BI for (i) improving existing systems and/or
designing new ones for bank supervision and credit information, and iii)
training BI staff to implement effectively these systems; (b) a line of credit
to the five SCBs for the provision of subloans to private enterprises for the
carrying out of investment projects; and (c) the recapitalization of the SCBs.
In order to achieve the project's policy objectives, the Bank funds onlent by
the Borrower to the SCBs (as well as disbursed and outstanding amounts under
prior Bank loans to the GOI onlent to the SCBs) would be subsequently
converted (periodically) by the GOI into equity, subject to the Bank's prior
approval and upon confirmation of the SCBs' compliance with agreed annual
portfolio improvement performance targets set forth in their respective Plans
of Action.
B. Technical Assistance to Bank Indonesia Component
3.5       Technical assistance under the proposed project comprises two
components: (i) strengthening BI's Bank Supervision Department; and
(ii) developing BI's Credit Information System. A detailed discussion of this
TA is provided in Annex 3 and summarized below. Table 3.1 below su=marizes,
by specialist and staff-months, the expertise to be provided under the TA.
The timetable for implementation of the TA component, finalized at
nc.,otiations, is given in Annex 6.
3.6       Bank SuDervision.  The TA to BI for bank supervision has two
objectives. The first is to improve existing systems and/or design new ones.
The second is to train BI staff to implement effectively these new or improved
systems. Achieving these objectives is expected to require a multi-faceted
A/   A first advance (PPF No. P-162-0), in the amount of $300,000, was
approved by the Bank on September 26, 1990. A second advance (PPF No. P-
162-1), in the amount of $700,000, became effective on December 19, 1991;
the purpose of this second advance was to enable BI, due to delays in
processing the proposed project, to recruit additional consultants and to
extend the services of consultants already assigned to its Bank
Supervision Department.

Note: An off-site monitoring specialist, for improving and Implementing the
BISMS early yarning system, is also viewed as an essential element of
the project. This task is assigned to an IMF-placed expert on bank
supervision, who began his assignment in October 1990. While his
efforts will be fully coordinated and integrated Into the project, his
staff-monthe are not included in the TA component.
program of TA over a period of approximatel  three years, consisting of three
partos
(a) a resident team of banking specialists to cover priority areas of
supervision as identified by BI under the PPF (pars. 1.34).  Thi'
team is expected to bring to the project a broad range of skills in
bank supervision, thus enabling 8I to meet the challenge of an
expanding financial sector. The team would be composed of experts
who have extensive bank supervision backgrounds, Including



- 33 -
experience in on-site examinations, off-site surveillance, financial
analysis of banks and techniques of supervising problem banks;
(b) seminars and training courses to be held within Indonesia for
training of BI bank supervision staff. These will be organized and
presented by consultants financed under the project with the
cooperation of foreign agencies suc. as the Bank of England and the
Federal Reserve Board; and
(c) secondment of selected BI staff, for both classroom training and
practical attachments, to major foreign banking supervision
agencies.
3.7       The main thrust of the program will emanate from the resident team
of specialists working directly within BI and reporting to BI management on
project progress. The team will be headed by a project coordinator with an
extensive range of bank supervision experience, including experience in
developing countries.
3.8       The areas of priority for strengthening bank supervision include:
(a) refinement and improvement of the BISMS "early warning system";
(b) formulation of a qualitative approach to determining a bank's asset
quality; (c) development and implementation of new on-site and off-site
systems with regards to foreign exchange, treasury operations and
asset/liability management; (d) revision of accounting standards and
disclosure by banks to conform with internationally-accepted norms;
(e) methods of evaluation of a bank's management; (f) a risk-based system for
establishing supervision priorities; (f) improved techniques for examining a
bank's electronic data processing (EDP) systems; (g) computerization of all
bank supervision activities within BI; (h) formulation of new Central Bank
legislation; (i) developing policies and procedures for supervising problem
and failed banks; and (j) training of BI staff, including the establishment of
a training system to serve BI's long-term needs. Training is considered
crucial to the overall success of the project's TA component; thus, this high
priority area is intended to be addressed in several ways, including training
within Indonesia consisting of seminars for senior BI staff as well as courses
for junior and mid-level staff, and secondment of selected BI staff to
aupervisory agencies in other countries in order to provide a combination of
tiheoretical training through bank supervision courses and practical
application from participation in on-site examinations. It was agraed at
negotiations that BI shall prepare and forward to the Bank by March 31, 1993,
for its approval, a proposed program for carrying out this training in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.
3.9       Credit Information System.  In Indonesia, the provision of
irformation relevant to financial decision-making is inadequate. With the
ur.certainties attached to legal recourse regarding financial claims, as well
as che insufficient development of loan collateral instruments and
registration arrangements, the significance of reliable information on past
credit performance for the development of formal finance can hardly b.e
exaggerated. Improving the transparency of risk concentration among banks
would lead to more prudent lending by banks. It would also lead to better
supervision by BI. After the 1988 financial sector reforms, BI, with the



- 34 -
assistance of a consulting firm, embarked on a program to design a credible
credit information system. Under the proposed project, financing will be
provided to further develop this credit information system,; the main
objectives are to: (a) collate credit, financial and other relevant
information (e.g., loan and security information, director/shareholder
information) from various available sources on borrowers of financial
institutions; (b) consolidate such information; and (c) furnish such
information on request to participating financial institutions. TA provided to
BI'a Credit Department under the proposed project (as summarized in Table 3.1
above) would include the services of: (i) a computer system development
manager; (ii) a computer programming specialist; (iii) a hardware/software
evaluation specialist; and (iv) a trainingidocumentation specialist.
C. Line of Credit Component
3.10      The project's investment component would comprise a $300 million
line of credit to the five SCBs to meet long-term capital investment financing
needs of private sector enterprises in the industry, agriculture and service
sectors. Details on relending terms, loan allocation, and other
administrative arrangements are discussed in Section F below.
3.11      Suborolect/Subloan Processing.  The following criteria for the
selection and processing of subborrowers and subprojects under the proposed
project were agreed at negotiations:
(a) Subproject Eligibilitv. All subprojects appraised by the SCBs to be
financially viable, as well as technically and environmentally
sound, would be eligible for financing. These investments would
generate incremental value added through an annual stream of sales
revenue on a demonstrated sustainable basis. Overall, the
subproject appraisal and credit evaluation procedures of the SCBs
are acceptable to the Bank and will apply to subprojects financed by
the proposed Bank loan (para. 1.41). In order to ensure that only
economically viable investments are financed under the proposed
project, activities in which the effective rate of protection
exceeds 40 percent would be excluded. At least 30 percent of a
subproject's total investment cost (fixed assets, including land
acquired for the purposes of the investment, as well as permanent
working capital requirements), would be financed with the project
sponsor's own funds; and
(b) Free Limits. Individual Subloan Limits and Suboroiect Review. In
view of the SCBs' satisfactory appraisal performance to date under
completed and ongoing financial intermediary lending operations, the
amount of the proceeds of the loan to finance a free-limit subloan
will not exceed $3.0 million for any investment project. The
maximum subloan for any investment project would also be $3.0
million--this would ensure not only a larger number and
diversification of activities being financed with Bank loan
proceeds, but also that the SCBs actively pursue other sources of
project term-financing, especially for larger-sized investments. A



- 35 -
summary appraisal report (refer Annex 7 for format) would be
submitted to the Bank for autthorization of each subloan.
D. SCB Recapitalization Compwonent
3.12      The recapitalization of the five SCBs will be undertaken in
accordance with Bl's new prudential regulation on capital adequacy (issued in
February 1991) that establishes minimum levels of capital in relation to risk
assets to be applied unJ.formly to all banks in Indonesia. This regulation is
aimed at strengthening the soundness and stability of the banking system in
the country. It incorporates the BIS guidelines, which provide an agreed
framework for measuring capital adequacy and which the national supervisory
authorities of the G-10 countries are already implementing in their respactive
countries. Capital adequacy of banks is defined as a ratio in which capita3
is related to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposure,
weighted according to broad categories of relative risk. Capital is defined
in two tiers: "Tier I" constitutes core capital (i.e., equity capital);
"Tier II" constitutes supplementary capital (e.g., revaluation reserves,
general loan loss provisions, hybrid debt capital instruments and subordinated
term debt). The maximum supplementary capital for purposes of meeting total
capital requirements cannot exceed an amount equal to that of core capital.
Eligible loan-loss provisions cannot exceed 1.25 percent of risk weighted
assets (RWAs), and subordinated term debt is limited to one-half of core
capital. BI set the standard ratio of capital to RWAs at 8 percent, the same
as the BIS guidelines adopted by the G-10 countries, to be reached by December
31, 1993, thus providing banks a transitional period of some two years and ten
months to build up progressively their capital levels. Banks are required to
reach a minimum 5 percent capital adequacy ratio (CAR) by end-March 1992,
increasing to 7 percent by end-March 1993 and 8 percent by December 31, 1993.
3.13      However, under the instructions issued by BI to banks for
establishing adequate loan loss reserves, they are required to set aside only
3 percent of substandard assets. This 3 percent provision for substandard
assets is considered very low by international banking standards (minimum of
10 percent). In addition, and more importantly, the present regulation on
loan loss provisioning is not directly linked to the regulation on capital
adequacy, i.e., shortfalls in loan loss provisioning are not reflected in a
corresponding reduction of Tier I capital for purposes of computing capital
adequacy. This drawback in tLe regulation has the potential of leading to a
substantial overstatement of capital in the case of those banks which are not
adequately provisioned.
3.14      Since an important objective of the GOI'a recapitalization program
is to put the SCBs on sound financial footing, it was accepted by the GOI that
for the purpose of determining the SCBes' minimum capital requirements, the
methodology for establishing adequate loan loss reserves would be consistent
with BI's annual asset quality reviews and as per international norms,
including its direct linkage with capital adequacy. This was agreed at
negotiations. However, in view of the larger amounts of capital that would be
needed as a result of applying these norms and the relatively short period
provided in which to meet the minimum 8 percent CAR (i.e., by December 31,
1993), the GOI recently extended by one year the period during which the SCBs



- 36 -
would be brought into compliance. To ensure a level playing field, it was
agreed during negotiations that BI would, by April 1, 1994, issue a revised
regulation requiring that all banks in Indonesia, in calculating their capital
adequacy, be in compliance by no later than March 31, 1996, with minimum
provisioning levels in line with internationally accepted norms rather than as
presently prescribed by BI. Therefore, while all the banks in Indonesia would
have to comply with international norms by no later than March 31, 1996, the
SCBs would have to meet this requirement by December 31, 1994.
3.15      SCB Asset Quality Reviews.  In the preparation of the proposed
project, the GOI requested, in part to assist BI in applying its new
regulations on capital adequacy to each of the state-owned financial
institutions, a PPF. This assistance to BI included: (a) the ser ices of a
bank supervision expert to coordinate the preparation (and subsequent
implementation) of TA to be provided by the Bank as well as other bi- and
multilateral organizations; and (b) the services of two credit experts to
undertake a qualitative evaluation of each of the five SCBs. Annex 8 provides
the terms of reference for the specialists who were recruited under the PPF;
both had extensive experience in bank examinations and credit risk management.
This exercise, begun in February 1991, was completed in September 1991 and
formed the basis for subsequent internal GOI discussions as well as for
recapitalization discussions between the Bank and the GOI.
3.16      Four of the individual reviews were based on the SCBs' March 31,
1991 financial positions; the other SCB review (i.e., the first one done) was
based on its December 31, 1990 position. Asset categories were weighted by
risk, consistent with BIS guidelines and BI decrees. The reviews quantified
the amount of "standard", "substandard", "doubtful" and "loss" assets, using
definitions based on internationally accepted accounting principles; an
adequate loan loss reserve was then calculated, i.e., to cover 1 percent of
all earning assets, 10 percent of substandard assets, 50 percent of doubtful
and 100 percent of loss. Applying these coverage requirements to the findings
of the individual asset quality reviews, it was determined whether existing
loan loss provisions were adequate. Shortfalls were indicated for all five
SCBes, ranging from Rp 31 billion for BNI to almost Rp 800 billion for BDN.
Once adequate reserve levels were established, minimum capital requirements
were determined by applying the appropriate CAR to the SCBs' respective RWAs.
As summarized in Table 3.2 below, the additional capital required to achieve
an 8 percent CAR (i.e., the minimum level required by December 31, 1994),
computed on the basis of March 31, 1991 financial positions (after adjustment
for provisions) was Rp 4.5 trillion. A detailed breakdown of calculations is
provided in Annex 9.
3.17      Prior to negotiations, the SCBs in consultations with BI's Bank
Supervision Department, undertook internal asset quality assessments as of
their respective provisional March 31, 1992 financial positions, following
guidelines established by BI at the time of its March 31, 1991 asset quality
reviews. The results of these assessments were reviewed during negotiationst
it was agreed that for purposes of the recapitalization component under the
proposed project, these updated figures (summarized in Annex 10) provided a
more approprl.ate base from which to proceed.

3.18       Having established the shortfalls in loan loss reserves for each
SCB, i.e., as of March 31, 1992, and applying certain assumptions regarding
growth in each SCB's RWAs and asset quality through December 31, 1994,
additional capital needed in order for each SCB to be brought into compliance
with minimum CARs was eetermined. It was agreed at negotiations that the RWA
of two SCBs (BankExim and BNI), who have generally followed more prudent
lending policies and procedures, would grow by approximately 15 percent per
annum during this period; this is consistent with the Government's financial
program (annual credit expansion of between 15 to 20 percent during the next
three years). It was further agreed that the RWAs of BBD and BDN would not
increase from current provisional levels (i.e., of Rp 2).5 trillion for BBD
and Rp 18 trillion for BDN), since these banks present.y have weak financial
positions and need to accord priority to consolidating and improving the
quality of their risk assets rather than expanding them. In the case of the
fifth SCB (BRI), it was agreed that its large borrowers portfolio would be
frozen at its current level (i.e., of Rp 5.7 trillion) and only RWAs related
to its small and medium borrowers portfolio would increase at an average



- 38 -
annual rate of 15 percent.5/ In establishing future capital requirements,
it was also assumed that the relative quality of each SCB's earning assets
would improve in line with corrective measures and performance targets set
forth in the agreed Plans of Action (para. 3.29).
3.19      Additional capital needed to bring the five SCBs into compliance
with an 8 percent CAR, based on provisional March 31, 1992 financial and
operational data, and providing for a reasonable level of growth in risk
assets through December 1994, as discussed in para. 3.18 above and
incorporated in the SCBes' respective Plans of Action, is estimated at
Rp 6.6 trillion (approximately $3.3 billion equivalent)-ranging from Rp 0.65
trillion for BankExim to Rp 2.1 trillion for BRI. The timing of this required
additional equity is summarized in Table 3.3 below (with detailed computations
given in Annex 11). Future growth (i.e., after 1994) of the SCBs, following
the proposed recapitalization by the GOI under the project, would be supported
through corresponding increases in capital through retained earnings and the
issuance of shares in the market. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the GOI that it would not inject additional equity for purposes of asset
expansion after the current recapitalization exercise is completed (i.e.,
December 31, 1994).6/
3.20      With the approval of the new Banking Legislation by the Parliament
in March 1992, the GOI initiated the legal steps needed under Indonesian law
to establish the five SCBs as limited liability companies owned by the
Government (PERSEROs). The relevant laws and regulations provide that the
S/   The substantial deterioration in BRI's assets from that of March 31,
1991, as reflected in its provisional March 31, 1992 assessment (and as
detailed in BRI's Plan of Actions), i.e., the shortfall in provisions
having increased from Rp 0.1 to Rp 1.1 trillion, is attributed largely to
BRI's role in the past as the main conduit of the GOI's subsidized
directed credit programs. The reform of the liquidity credit programs in
1990 and the subsequent withdrawal of BI's refinancing facilities has
created an especially difficult financial situation for BRI. Since BRI
has been and continues to be the main financier of the agricultural
sector and of small-sized enterprises, restricting arbitrarily future
growth to financially sound clients and bankable investments would
adversely impact growth of the rural economy. Therefore, in addition to
its Plan of Actions for improving the quality of its assets during
project implementation (like that for each of the other SCBs), it was
also agreed at negotiations that BRI shall, no later than March 31, 1993,
prepare and furnish to the Bank, for its approval, an institutional
reorganization plan aimed at enhancing BRI's operational efficiency.
Particular emphasis would be placed on remedies for addressing BRI's
relatively high overhead costs, caused in great part to its large branch
network in rural areas, many branches that appear unjusuifLed on
financial grounds.
/ Except to maintain the GOI's 51 percent share of paid-in capital. As
PERSEROs (paras. 1.50(b)(i) and 3.20], the SCBs can raise capital from
the market through the issuance of up to 49 percent of their respective
total shares.

shareholders of a limited liability company must furnish to the Department of
Justice (DOJ), for its approval, Articles of Association executed in notarial
form. Upon approval of said Articles by the DOJ, the deed of incorporation
and the approval thereof must be registered in the public register established
for such purposes at the offices of the competent district court; thereafter,
the Articles of Association must be published in the supplementary official
gazette. In the case of PERSEROs, a Government Regulation must also be issued
providing, inter alia, the amounts of authorized, subscribed and paid-in
capital of the PERSERO. The capital of each PERSERO will be in th. form of
ordinary shares and issued as registered shares. Authorized, subscribed
(minimum of 20 percent of authorized) and paid-in (minimum 10 percent of
authorized) for each SCB will be established by the GOI. During negotiations,
agreement was reached on draft A:-icles of Association for the five SCBs.
While the conversion of the SCBe into PERSEROo was effected on September 11,
1992, the published Articles conflict with the new Banking Law which requires
that the SCBs have the authority to raise equity through the issuance of
shares in the stock market. The Articles, as presently executed, do not
provide for this authority. The GOI has prepared amendments to the Articles
that correct this omission; these amendments have been approved by the DOJ and
are now awaiting publication in the official Gazette. Publication of these
amendments, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.

E. Project Cost Estimates and Financina Plan
3.21      Total project cost, including price contingencies,7/ is estimated
at $3.58 billion as summarized in Table 3.4 below. The estimated total
project cost is exclusive of direct duties and taxes, which are negligible.
The foreign exchange component is estimated at $0.91 billion, or about
25 percent of the total.8/
3.22      The financing plan for the proposed project, agreed at negotiations,
is sumarized in Table 3.5 below. The proposed Bank loan, 8.6 percent of the
project's estimated total financing requirements, will finance 33.7 percent of
the project's direct foreign exchange costs.
3.23      The primary sources for financing the recapitalization component,
based on growth assumptions discussed in para. 3-18 above, are:
(a)  incremental retained earnings generated by the SCBs of Rp 0.9
trillion (or approximately $450 million equivalent), inclusive of
FY93 and FY94 after-tax profits amounts that will not be
appropriated to the Government as dividends, as was automatically
dove in the past (para. 1.50(a)(ii));
(b)  additi-tnal Tier II capital resulting from incremental general loan
loss provisioning of about Rp 0.2 trillion (or almost $120 million
equivalent); and
(c)  the SCBs' respective outstanding long-term liabilities comprising
official borrowings from the GOI. These constitute funds, onlent by
the GOI to the SCBs under subsidiary/onlending agreements entered
into between the GOI and the respective SCBs, under both completed
and ongoing financial intermediary lending operations financed by
7/   Cost estimates for specialists to be engaged under the TA component are
based on the actual staff-month cost of consultants recruited to date
under the PPF. Price contingencies on the TA component (calculated on
the basis of estimated annual increases in local and foreign prices of
6.0 and 3.7 percent, respectively, during 1992-94) are insignificant,
since most of the consultants provided under the proposed project are
expected to be recruited by early 1993 at latest; the recapitalization
component does not include any contingencies.
8_/  The project's total estimate foreign excnange cost of $903 million for
the recapitalization component represents approximately 50 percent of the
cost of individual subproject investments that would be financed under
ongoing official loans (and subsequently converted into equity under the
proposed project) that were undisbursed as of December 31, 1991 (in the
amount of $603 million), and $300.0 million from the proposed Bank loan.
Of the remaining 50 percent of these individual subproject investment
costs, based on the experience-to-date under the Bank's financial
intermediary operations, 30 percent would be financed by the project
sponsors from their own resources and approximately 20 percent by the
SCBs from their own other financing resources.

3.24       Because the SCBs historically have been severely undercapitalized
(para. 1.48), almost three-quarters of Rp 6.6 trillion (or Rp 5.3 trillion)
would have been needed by March 31, 1992, to meet, per BIS guidelines, the
5 percent CAR (refer para. 3.19 and Table 3.3 above); another Rp 0.55 trillion
would then be needed to meet the 6 percent CAR by March 31, 1993; another

a final Rp 0. , rillion needed by end-1994 to meet an 8 percent CAR.121
Taking into ac ,aunt (between December 31, 1991, and December 31, 1994)
incremental profits, additional Tier II capital (resulting from expanded loan
loss provisioning) and the proposed t;onversion into equity of the outstanding
balance of bi- and multilateral borrowings, i.e., as of March 31, 1993, March
31, 1994, and December 31, 1994 (and/or equivalent contribution of Tier I
equity by the GOI, if not converted), net additional Tier I and Tier II
capital required through December 31, 1994, is still Rp 2.5 trillion, as
summarized in Table 3.6 below.
3.25      Because of the large amount of net additional capitai that would
have been needed to reach the minimum 5 percent CAR by March 31, 1992 (i.e.,
of Rp. 3.6 trillion, after taking into account the conversion into equity of
outstanding official borrowings) and the burden this would have placed on the
GOI given its tight budgetary situation, the recapitalization of the SCBs will
be phased over the 33 months of the proposed exercise. This phased-in
approach for bringing the SCBE into compliance with a minimum 8 percent CAR by
December 31, 1994, reflecting internationally accepted provisioning
guidelines, while at the same time allowing the SCBs to meet BI's existing
regulations regarding minimum capital adequacy requirements (para. 3.12), was
agreed at negotiations. The proposed phasing is summarized in Table 3.7
below; total additional capital needed of slightly more than Rp 3.0 trillion
(Annex 13) would be met as follows: (i) new capital equity infusions from the
OI, i.e., direct budgetary allocations of about Rp 1.51 trillion (or $755
million); (ii) subordinated debt which could be included as Tier II capital
(i.e., outstanding KLBI approved by the GOI/BI for such inclusion) of Rp 0.93
trillion (or $450 million); and (iii) the proposed IBRD loan of $300
million.13/ One SCB (BBD) required an immediate infusion of additional
capital of Rp 267 billion (approximately $134 million) in order to be brought
into compliance with the minimum 5 percent CAR by March 31, 1992 (as per BI'.
current regulation); the Government has confirmed that this amount was made
available to BBD (Rp 200 billion as Tier I paid-in capital and the remaining
Rp 67 billion comprising KLBI subordinated debt included as Tier II capital).
12/ Due to timing implications of these minimum CAR requirements, these
figures do not add up to overall requirement of Rp 6.6 trillion that
represents the absolute difference based on the beginning equity
positions (i.e., March 31, 1992) and ending equity positions (i.e.,
December 31, 1994).
13/ The agreed amount of direct GOI equity infusions reflects the consensus
that the SCBs have (and will continue to have in the near future) limited
access to independent sources of subordinated debt for purposes of Tier
II capital. Furthermore, since the reduction of outstanding KLBI is
important from a monetary policy point of view, the inclusion of such for
purposes of Tier II capital should be kept to a prudent minimum.
Therefore, new capital equity infusions from the GOI, for each SCB, were
calculated by taking (before adjusting for capital shortfalls resulting
from application of BI's existing prudential regulations) 75 percent of
the Tier II shortfall and adding it to the shortfall in Tier I capital
(less the GOI's reinvestment of the FY92 dividend and one-fifth of the
proposed IBRD loan, i.e., Rp 120 billion).

3.26      Each SCB's need for additional capital during the recapitalization
period is a function of its current financial position and projected asset
growth. Actual requirements will depend upon changes in RWAs and the quality
of earning assets. It was therefore agreed at negotiations that BI annually
undertake, ex-gost, an internal asset quality review of each SCB through on-
site examinations in order to ensure that each SCB is in compliance with the
minimum capital ratio (i.e., as of March 31, 1993, March 31, 1994, and
December 31, 1994). It was also agreed at negotiations that BI undertake and
complete independent reviews within three months of the submission to BI of
consolidated accounts by the SCBs. Considering that it normally takes banks
up to three months to submit these consolidated accounts, BI's updated asset
quality reviews would be completed by September 30, 1993, September 30, 1994,
and June 30, 1995. During negotiation, it was agreed that any capital
shortfalls as established in these reviews, and not covered by resources as
identified in the financing plan, would be met by the GOI no later than
October 31, 1993, October 31, 1994, and July 31, 1995, respectively. These
independent reviews would also be used to monitor compliance by the SCBs with
their respective Plans of Action as agreed during negotiat:Dns (para. 3.29).
During negotiations, agreement also was reached with the GOI that in order to
help ensure that these reviews are undertaken in a timely manner, BI would
retain at least one credit expert under the project's TA component at all
times during project implementation. Engagement of a credit expert would be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
3.27      Conversion of Bank loans under completea and ongoing projects (as
identified in Footnote 10 and Annex 12) would be done within the context of
the proposed project (para. 3.23). The necessary draft amendments to the
respective prior Bank loan documents and Subsidiary Loan Agreements needed to
effect the conversion were discussed and agreed at negotiations. The amended
Subsidiary Loan Agreements, signed by the parties thereto and satisfactory to
the Bank, would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Conversion into equity of amounts disbursed and outstanding as of December 31,
1991, would also be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan; undrawn
balances under these loans wozld continue to disburse, as provided under the
projects' respective legal agreements. Amounts subsequently disbursed (i.e.,
January 1, 1992-March 31, 1993; April 1, 1993-March 31, 1994; and April 1-
December 31, 1994) would be converted into equity subject to and upon
confirmation by BI (and approval by the Bank) of each SCB's compliance with
the agreed Plans of Action, considered necessary to improve their financial
performance and conditions. If any SCB is found, in light of BI's annual
asset quality reviews as provided under the proposed project (para. 3.26), not
to be in compliance, the Bank would reserve the right not to convert into
equity its previous year's annual disbursements under ongoing projects.
3.28      SCB Plans of Action.  Bl's independent asset quality reviews,
conducted with the assistance of coniultants recruited under the PPF (paras.
3.15 and 3.16), revealed wide variations among the five SCBs in the quality of
their earning assets and consequently in their financial positions.
Classified assets to total assets as of March 31, 1991, varied from a low of
10 percent to a high of 30 percent. All five SCBs were found to be in
violation of legal lending limits. Some SCBs had allowed concentrations of
expisures to a small number of influential business groups to develop beyond



- 47 -
prudential limits, without adequate collateral and/or proper scrutiny of the
borrowers and their projects. Under the guidance of BI and MOF, each SCB
prepared a draft Plan of Action for improving its financial position and
performance.
3.29      Plans of Action for all five SCBs were finalized and agreed during
negotiations. These Plans of Action, based on the deficiencies identified in
BI's asset quality reviews, include timebound programs for improving the
quality of earning assets, compliance with legal lending limits for individual
and group exposures, and other measures for improvements in the financial
position and overall efficien:y (e.g., collection of arrears, compliance with
net open position, improving the security of collateral, updating financial
information on borrowers, strengthening credit policies and lending
procedures, and staff training). Adoption of these agreed Plans of Action by
the SCBs9 respective Boards of Directors would be a condition of loan
effectiveness. In addition, conversion into equity of Bank funds disbursed
during the course of project implementation would be conditional on SCBs'
compliance with annual targets in the following areas, considered critical for
improving their financial performance:
(a) each SCB would be required to achieve agreed annual reductions in
the proportion of classified assets to total assets in its
portfolio. It is proposed to reduce this ratio from a present range
of 18-30 percent for four of the five SCBs to a range of
11-13 percent (the ratio of the fifth bank is at present around
ten percent and would be reduced to below 5 percent) by December 31,
1994. At any rate, improvements in the quality of SCB portfolios
would lower the proportion of classified assets to below the cut-off
point of 15.5 percent as provided in BI's bank rating system (banks
are given credit if the ratio is below 15.5 percent); and
(b)  all five SCBs would be required to meet agreed annual reductions in
their individual and group exposures so as to comply with BI's legal
lending limits by December 31, 1994. The new Banking Law gives
banks in Indonesia five years to comply with the new legal lending
limits (20 and 30 percent of capital for individual and group
exposures, respectively). Reductions in large exposures would be
accomplished through syndication of loans as well as repayments by
borrowers.
3.30      The above targets are considered reasonable in view of the projected
performance of the Indonesian economy during the next three years. They allow
sufficient time for adjustments by the SCBs' respective managements, who now
have full autonomy in operational matters. Improvements in the quality of
earning assets are expected to translate into savings of about $750 million in
additional capital requirements of the SCBs through December 1994. Sharp and
unexpected deterioration in the overall macroeconomic conditions during the
next three years, which could lead to difficulties for the SCBs in upgrading
the quality of their earning assets, would be taken into consideration when
their compliance with these agreed Plans of Action is periodically reviewed.
3.31      Impact of Recapitalization on the Budget.  The recapitalization of
SCBs represent a significant expenditure by the Government in the next three



- 48 -
years, almost 3.5 percent of 1990 GDP. A very large proportion of the
additional capital requirements stem from two factors: (i) the GOI did not
inject new equity into the SCBs during the last 25 year., while appropriating
45 percent of the SCBs' after-tax profits as dividendsl and (ii) the adoption
of new prudential regulations related, for the first time, to loan loss
provisioning and minimum capital requirements based upon international norms.
The main components of the GOI's recapitalization plan luclude conversion of
subordinated debt into equity (Tier I capital) as wvll as treatment of part of
outstanding liquidity credits as subordinated debt (Tier II capital) and fresh
infusions of equity from the budget (including the proceeds of the proposed
Bank loan). The effect on the Central Government budget is dependent upon the
changes in cash flows that the recapitalization generates.
3.32      The conversion of subordinated debt is the least-cost option
available to the GOI. Because of limits to official assistance,
recapitalization of the SCBs through external conmercial borrowings would be
significantly more expensive to the government because of the shorter maturity
and higher interest rates attached to such borrowings. This component of the
recapitalization plan swaps a debt service stream (payments on the
subordinated loans from the SCBs to the Government) for a dividend stream from
the SCBs. The debt service foregone in converting completed and ongoing loans
is roughly Rp 300 to Rp 400 billion per year over the next ten years. With
the conversion of subordinated debt into equity, the corresponding elimination
of interest would increase SCB profits. The debt restructuring will not be
the only factor affecting SCB profits. With improved management and
incentives, profits should increase beyond the interest Income on two-step
loans. The lost revenue would be partly compensated as the profits of the
SCBs increase in the medium term, leading to higher dividends as well as
higher tax collections for the government.
3.33      There would be no budgetary effect from the subordination of
liquidity credits, an important element for Tier II capital. Unlike the
conversion of subordinated debt, BI would not forego a debt service stream
since the terms of the conver_.ed liquidity credits would roughly match those
of the original contracts. The conversion of either subordinated debt into
Tier I capital or inclusion of liquidity credits as part of Tier II capital
has no effect on the consolidated public sector. The conversion only affects
which government entity is required to honor the debts, not the amounts of the
debts, nor the likelihood of repayments.
3.34      Recapitalization has macroeconomic effects beyond the need for
raising additional resources from domestic or external sources. The
recapitalization has the fiscal virtue of being a budget expenditure with
little effect on aggregate demand. In today's environment in which a fiscal
surplus (in an economic sense) is needed to ensure overall macroeconomic
balance, recapitalization provides an important option for creating the needed
fiscal surplus. This is because, though every rupiah of recapitalization is
recorded as a budgetary expenditure, most of those rupiah will not create
additional demand for goods and services. They will only support the existing
amount of lending already carried out by the SCBs. Some expansion of earning
assets is accommodated in the recapitalization plan, thereby supporting an
expansion of aggi3gate demand. The fiscal impact of recapitalization is
therefore clearly contractionary. The monetary impact through credit creation



- 49 -
ie consistent with the Government's financial program and would not undermine
the macroeconomic rationale for recapitalization. The annual average growth
in the SCBs' aggregated assets through December 1994 is projected at about
10 percent, compared to the GOI's target of credit expansion of between
15-20 percent. The slack in SCBs' lending activities is expected to be picked
up by the private banks without creating a scarcity of credit required to
support economic growth.
P. Feature of the Loan
Lending Arrangements
3.35      The proposed Bank loan of $307 million would be lent to the Republic
of Indonesia for 20 years, including a grace period of five years, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate. The Borrower would also be charged the
Bank's standard commitment fee on the undisbursed balance of the loan. The
MOF will act as the Government's agent. For the TA component, the proceeds of
the proposed Bank loan would be madL available by the MOF to BI as a grant,
through a Financial Agreement with BI. BI would maintain a separate account
to record utilization of these proceeds. For the recapitalization component,
Bank loan proceeds would be onlent to the SCBs in the form of interest free
loans repayable over 15 years, including 5 years of grace from the MOP through
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with each institution; a separate project account
would be established at BI (on behalf of the MOP) to record the channelling of
funds to the individual SCBs. The proceeds of the Bank loan, along with any
supplementary financing out of the SCBs' own resources, would be onlent to
final borrowers by the SCBs at market rates, currently around 22 percent.
Draft Subsidiary Loan Agreements and Financial Agreement were finalized and
agreed during negotiations. BI and each SCB will sign a Project Agreement
with the Bank outlining its obligations in implementing the proposed project.
Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements and Financial Agreement (on terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank) will be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
Loan Administration
3.36      Based upon the financial position of each SCB as of March 31, 1992,
all five SCBs required additional capital to meet minimum capital requirements
(para.   16).  The $300 million line of credit would be preallocated equally
among the five SCBs (i.e., $20 million for each SCB for each of the three
phases of the recapitalization exercise: April 1, 1992-March 31, 1993; April
1, 1993-March 31, 1994; and April I-December 31, 1994). Loan proceeds would
be disbursed against eligible expenditures as per the Bank's standard two-step
lending operations (paras. 3.11, 3.37 and 3.38).
3.37      Procurement.  Efficient procurement in the private sector in
Indonesia is ensured through the highly competitive market operating in an
open economy where sophisticated commercial purchasers solicit various bids to
obtain reasonable quotes. Although the SCBs do not have formal procurement
requirements, they do require clients to justify their procurement decisions,
requiring them to provide comparative price quotations. These procedures have
been applied satisfactorily by the SCBs under ongoing Bank-financed projects
in which they are implementing agencies. Under the proposed project, the SCBs



- so -
would require qualified enterprises to demonstrate that the procurement
procedures adopted by them are appropriate. They would ensure that the goods
and services would be purchased at a reasonable price, account being taken
also of other relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency and
reliability of goods, their suitability for the proposed investments and the
availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts, and, in the case of
services, of their quality and the competence of the parties rendering them.
These procedures are consistent with principles for Bank financing through
financial intermediaries and ensure that procurement is economic and
efficient. Contracts in the amount of $5.0 million equivalent or more, if
any, will be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB). All
contracts procured under ICB will be subject to Bank prior review.  Local
bidders competing under ICB for supply of goods will be granted a price
preference of 15 percent of the CIF price of imported goods or the applicable
custom and import duties, whichever is lower. Each subproject appraisal
summary would discuss how the proposed investment's goods and services are to
be procured and confirm that these procedures are acceptable to the SCBs.
Consultants to be financed under the proposed loan for the BI TA would be
selected in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency." Terms of
reference and the appointment of all consultants financed by the Bank under
the project would be subject to prior Bank approval.
3.38      Disbursements.  For the TA component, disbursements would be against
100 percent of consultant contract costs (exclusive of local administrative
and support services, which will be mec by BI) against standard documentation
and 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures for overseas training. For
the line of credit component, the Bank loan would be disbursed against
eligible subproject expenditures: (a) for civil works, 50 percent of
expenditures; (b) for goods, 100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures,
100 percent of expenditures for lccally manufactured items (ex-factory cost),
and 60 percent of expenditures for other locally procured items; and (c) for
services, 100 percent of expenditures. Disbursements for the subloan
component would be made against eligible expenditures incurred up to 90 days
prior to receipt by the Bank of a SCB's respective authorization request for
such expenditures. Statement of expenditures (SOEs) would be used for subloan
expenditures made under contracts in the amount of less than $5.0 million
equivalent; full supporting documentation would be retained by the SCBs and
made available for Bank inspection during supervision.
3.39      Due to the complexities involved in finalizing the recapitalization
component (including establishment of the appropriate policy framework within
which to implement it) and corresponding delays in processing the project
(specifically, preparation of the financing plan and Plans of Action for the
SCBs), retroactive financing is provided under the proposed project in an
amount of up to 10 percent of the Bank loan. Retroactive financing will
enable the Bank to contribute fully towards financing the first phase of the
recapitalization exercise that began on April 1, 1992, and ends on March 31,
1993. Eligible subproject expenditures incurred after March 31, 1992, would
be eligible for such financing, provided that procurement is consistent with
agreed arrangements under the project and that the respective authorization
requests for these subprojects are received by the Bank within 90 days after
loan signing; however, the aggregate amount for disbursements in respect of
eligible expenditures made before the date of loan signing will be limited to



- 51 -
10 percent of the SCBs' respective allocations. Retroactive financing will
also keep the momentum generated during project processing. Likewise, in
order to ensure that there is no disruption in the TA initiated under the PPF
and to minimize any delays in implementing the TA component, similar
retroactive financing will be provided for the TA financed by the Bank loan.
Withdrawal applications will be aggregated in amounts of $100,000 equivalent
or more, prior to submission to the Bank.
3.40      Amounts disbursed under the line of credit component during each
phase of the recapitalization exercise (para. 3.36) would be converted into
equity effective at the end of each phase (i.e., March 31, 1993; March 31,
19941 and December 31, 1994), subject to each SCB's compliance with its agreed
Plan of Action (para. 3.29) and with the approval of the Bank. If any SCB ie
found, in light of BI's annual independent asset quality reviews as provided
under the proposed project (para. 3.26), not to be in compliance, the Bank
would reserve the right: (a) not to convert into equity the loan amount
disbursed to such SCB(s) during the phase under review; and (b) to suspend
further disbursements, in whole or exclusively to the same SCB(s) until full
compliance with the requirements of the relevant Plan of Action is
established. In addition, disbursements against the individual SCBs'
respective second and third phase allocations of loan proceeds under the
proposed project, would be subject to having satisfactorily complied with
their agreed Plans of Action during the previous first and second phases,
respectively, of the recapitalization exercise. These disbursement conditions
and remedies were agreed at negotiations.
3.41      Based on the recapitalization schedule and given that the SCBs are
familiar with and well-versed in project processing procedures, the line of
credit component is expected to be committed by September 30, 1994, and to be
disbursed by end-1994. The TA component is expected to be completed by
September 30, 1995 (Annex 14). Therefore, the closing date for the loan would
be March 31, 1996.
3.42      Environment.  The basic legal framework for environmental management
is now in place in Indonesia. The major and more difficult challenge is to
develop the institutional capacity to enforce the rules and regulations
established by GOI, especially in the area of occupational safety and health
hazard regulations. Since the Government has designated the sensitive areas
where environmental analysis is required, it would be the responsibility of
the individual subborrower to comply with Government guidelines and undertake
an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the subproject in environmentally
sensitive subsectors (e.g., textile finishing, leather tanning and metal
plating). The responsibility of the SCBs would be to ensure compliance by the
subborrower with GOI rules and regulations, to ensure that all EIAs are
satisfactory and to ensure that appropriate measures (if required to prevent
environmental degradation under the project) are incorporated into proposals
subsequently financed. Subprojects with adverse environmental impact would
not be eligible for financing under the project unless satisfactory remedial
measures are taken, the cost of which would be eligible for financing under
the project.
3.43      Auditing and Reporting.  The SCBs' respective financial accounts and
SOE documentation, as well as SOE documentation for BI's TA component, would
be audited by the Government's Financial and Development Supervisory Board



- 52 -
(BPKP), which is acceptable to the Bank. In the case of SOEs, the audit
report should contain a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the
statements of expenditure submitted during the fiscal year, together with the
procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied
upon to support the related withdrawals. The reports of the external
auditors, in English, would be submitted to the Bank annually and no later
than nine months after the end of the SCBs' fiscal year (i.e., no later than
September 30). Audit submissions under previous Bank projects have been
satisfactory, although the SCBs' audited accounts generally have been
two-to-three months late. To help address this problem, the SCBs would
provide to the Bank copies of their respective unaudited accounts (in English)
at the same time they are submitted to BPKP, but no later than six months
after the close of their fiscal year. The SCBs would also be required to
submit semi-annual progress reports (within three months after the end of each
reporting period) covering their respective subloans financed under the
Project. These audit and reporting arrangements were agreed at negotiations.
3.44      Supervision Strategy.  It is envisaged that six supervision missions
would be needed over the life of the project (Annex 15). The supervision
missions would be scheduled to coincide with BI's ex-post evaluations of each
SCB's asset quality review in order to ensure each SCB's compliance with
prudential banking regulations as well as with the agreed Plans of Action.
During supervision, the overall performance and financial conditions of the
SCBs would be monitored closely, and a strategy for the future of the state-
owned banke would be prepared for discussions with the Government. This
strategy is likely to include possible mergers among the state-owned banks and
accelerated privatization (i.e., beyond what is perceived at present) of some
of the banks through issuance of shares in the capital market. The
supervision missions would also monitor the progress of the TA component and
the need to fine-tune banking regulations in order to further strengthen the
banking sector.
G. Project Benefits and Risks
3.45      The policy agenda underlying the project is expected to lead to
substantial efficiency gains in resource use in Indonesia. The delinking of
the relationship that now exists between the SCBs and a relatively small
number of industrial group borrowers should curb economic concentration. By
changing past practices in credit allocation that have handicapped competitive
forces not only in the financial sector, but in the real sector as well, the
project would promote competition in the real sector through more equitable
treatment for all firms and individuals. The project supports the various
initiatives undertaken by the GOI to strengthen basic institutional
infrastructure-banking legislation, reliable credit information system,
prudential regulations and effective supervision-for a stable and efficient
banking sector. These initiatives complement the GOI's other recent actions
undertaken with bilateral and multilateral assistance In furthering
development of the money and capital markets, and Improving commercial law in
order to facilitate and support an increased level of private business
transactions.
3.46      There are risks in that the SCBs may be slower than expected in
developing into efficient financial institutions due mostly to opposition from



- 53 -
vested interests (since changes in the ways SCBs do financial business in the
future will affect existing business relations, requiring adjustments in the
real sector) and/or unexpected deterioration in overall macroeconomic
conditions leading to difficulties for the SCBs in upgreding the quality of
their earning assets. These risks are considered moderate, however, because
of the 001's demonstrated determination to promulgate legislation that will
require, within the framework of the project, changes in the SCBs' past
practices as well as the G01's track record of sound economic management.

FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Assistance to Bank Indonesia for
Bank Supervision and Credit Inforrition System
Bank Supervision
1.        The comprehensive reforms undertaken by the Government of Indonesia
(GOI) during 1983-91 have led to a mushrooming of financial assets, financial
institutions and new financial products. A primary objective of the
government's supervisory role in a market-oriented financial system is to
ensure safety and soundness of banks, in order both to make them efficient
instruments in financing economic activities and effective savings mobilizers,
and to protect the interests of the depositors. Strengthening and improving
the system of bank supervision and prudential regulation has assumed now
importance in Indonesia.
2.        During 1988 and again in 1991, Bank Indonesia (BI) initiated a
series of changes to redefine prudential banking norms and controls. It also
reorganized its Bank Supervision Department, added new staff and requested and
received a six month technical assistance program in 1989 from the IMP to
design a new off-site monitoring system. In October 1990, the Fund peovided
the services of a bank supervision expert for an additional 24-month period.
3.        Bl's present method of bank supervision consists of three components
which form elements c o on to most systems of bank supervision: (a) a
quantitatively based bank rating system, partially modelled after the U.S.
bank rating system, commonly known by its acronym CAMEL (capital adequacy,
asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity form the main areas of
evaluation); this system was further reinforced in 1989 with a new off-site
surveillance system known as Bank Indonesia Supervisory Monitoring System
(BISMS); (b) on-site examinations primarily for the purposes of a more in-
depth analysis of the banks' financial condition and determination of the
accuracy of data submitted by banks; and (c) ensuring banks' adherence to BI
regulations regarding legal lending limits, open foreign exchange position,
minimum liquidity requirments, etc.
4.        There are a number of weaknesses in BI's present method of bank
supervision which need to be addressed:
(a)  the effectiveness of BI's off-site surveillance is severely hampered
by lack of ac:counting standards within Indonesia as well as the
present design of reports, which is geared towards monetary policy
aspects for Bl's research department. Also, BI staff are not well
trained in the financial analysis skills needed to utilize the new
BISMS model;
(b) BI's ability to determine banks' asset quality, and ultimately bank
solvency, is limited by its reliance on quantitative data on loan



-60-                               Annex 3
Pao! 2 of 10
quality jeollectibility) presently submitted by banks. With its
staff largely untrained in credit analysis, BI lacks skills to
effectively determine true asset quality through on-site
examinations;
(c) BI's staff lacks expertise in specialized areas of banking,
including foreign exchange, asset and liability management, risks
arising from off the balance sheet, EDP operations of banks, and
other specialized activities. Effective supervision requires
expertise in specialized areas and problems detected ac an early
stage;
(d) BI does not as yet have any methodology in place to evaluate bank
management. Such an evaluation should take into account a broad
view of bank soundness, including its financial condition and
performance, as well as more qualitative factors such. as management
depth and succession, adequacy of policies and internal controls,
and compliance with laws, regulations, and supervisory requirements;
(e) BI has not been able, to date, to prioritize its supervisory efforts
toward institutions and aspects where risk to the banking sector is
greatest. Such an approach ia considered essential given that BI
responsibilities now include numerous small rural financial
institutions as well as vast branch network within many major banks;
and
(f) efficiency within BI's bank supervision itself is hampered by an
outdated manual system of excessive files and records kept by hand.
Computerization of B1's administrative aspects and all data will
result in significant gains in efficiency.
5.        The proposed technical assistance (TA) would assist BI in addressing
the above weaknesses. The TA has two overall objectives: First, to improve
existing systems and/or design new ones for bank supervision, The second is
to train BI staff to effectively implement these new and/or improved system.
Achieving these objectives is expected to require a multi-faceted program of
technical assistance for approximately three years. To this effect, the TA
will be composed of three components: (i) a resident team of technical
advisors to cover priority areas of supervieion as listed below; (ii) seminars
and training courses held within Indonesia for training of BI bank supervision
staff; and (iii) secondments of selected BI staff for both classroom training
and practical attachments.
6.        The following areas have been identified as areas of priority for
strengthening bank supervision:
(a) Refinement and Improvement of BISMS "Early Warning System." This
system was introduced in 1989 through IKF-provided technical
assistance. This off-site surveillance system employs a series of
prudential ratios derived irom periodic reports submitted by banks
to determine trends in such financial variables as capital, asset
quality, management, profitability and liquidity, and to undertake
peer group analysis. This system also provides BI examiners with a



- 61 -                              Annex 3
Page 3 of 10
series of questionnaires to be completed on-site in financial areas
as well as in qualitative areas such as management, ownership and
internal controls. BI has, to a large extent, automated the data
and has begun conducting special BISMS examinations using the
questionnaires. The system however needs additional work in the
areas of determining the accuracy of data submitted, potential
revisions to existing reports, and improving the financial analysis
skills of BI staff.
(b)  Qualitative Approach to Determine a Bank's Asset Oualitv.  A
cornerstone of any bank supervision system is the qualitative review
of asset quality through on-site examinations. These reviews cover
all areas of credit risk, both on the balance sheet (loans, leases)
and off-balance sheet (guarantees, letters of credit). Presently,
BI's evaluation of asset quality stops with its quantitative
collectibility system which directs banks to report monthly the
total of loans that have fallen into problem status. This system is
inadequate for a true and precise judgement of asset quality. While
design of a system for qualitative review of asset quality should be
straightforward, a sizeable training effort for BI staff in credit
analysis and on-site examination technique in all aspects of credit
risk is noeded.
(c) New On-site and Off-site Systems with ReRards to Foreifn Exchanae.
Treasury Onerations. and Asset/Liabilitv Manaaement (ALM). While
credit risk is the most traditional and well known risk involved in
banking, bank supervisors must be alert to and knowledgeable about
risks in treasury operations, i.e., currency risk (foreign
exchange), contingency risk (off-balance sheet), and liquidity and
interest rate risks (both concerning ALM). The importance of
treasury operations has increased significantly with the
deregulation of the financial sector; foreign exchange operations
have expanded, interest rates are largely determined by market
forces, liquidity must be managed as regulations are relaxed, and
new financislL products (many off the balance sheet) are offered.
(d) Methods of Evaluation of a Bank's Manaaement. Bank supervisors view
good management as the most vital aspect of sound banking. Their
appraisal of management, usually at the end of an on-site
examination takes into account both performance factors (level of
profits, adequacy of capital, quality of assets and sufficiency of
liquidity) and more qualitative areas (management depth and
succession, adequacy of policies, controls, and reporting systems,
and adherence to laws and regulations) which require examiner
judgement. While evaluation of bank management is not viewed as a
speciality, unlike other highly specialized areas, BI needs to
improve its ability to evaluate bank management.
(e) A Risk Driven System for Establishing Sugervision Priorities. Bl's
overall task of bank supervision is vast given the large number of
financial institutions it must supervise and the large branch
network many banks operate. BI is well aware that it cannot look at
every aspect of every institution on a frequent basis. Thus, it



- 62 -                              Annex 3
Page 4 of 10
wishes to develop A risk driven approach which will systematically
focus on supervisory priorities, established on the basis of risks
to the overall financial system and take into account large banks,
problem banks, and banks with high risk or specialized activities.
As with evaluation of bank management, this is also reviewed as a
general area. Within the proposed TA, an analysis will be done as
to how BI allocates its resources and how such allocation might be
improved with regard to risk driven priorities.
(f)  Improved Techniques for Examining a Bank's Electronic Data
Processing (EDP) Systems. Bank supervision in several countries
have recognized that computer operations in banks are a specialized
activity. As a result, aspects of EDP operations including
effectiveness of computer systems, adequacy of controls, ?revention
from fraud, and management of bank information systems are included
within the scope of EDP examinations. BI first set up a group of
EDP examiners in 1986 and has made satisfactory progress in "around
the computer" aspects which primarily concern adequate controls.
However, there is a need for "through the computer" systems and
training to enable examiners to actually test the effectiveness of
computer software.
(g) Computerization of all Bank Supervision Activities within BIe
With the size of the financial sector it is responsible for, B3's
bank supervision contains a massive amount of information on both
the financial institutions it supervises and its own administrative
aspects. At present, muih of Bl's data is maintained manually, and
the computerized data that is kept within its various departments
(bank supervision ie comprised of three departments and one bureau)
is not standardized. There is a need to improve Bl's
computerization both with regard to automating data presently kept
on manual basis and standardizing computer systems used by different
departments.
(h)  Training of BI Staff, includina Establishing a Training System to
Serve Bl's Long-Term Needs. The training aspect is considered
crucial to the success of the TA program. This high priority area
is intended to be addressed in several ways. First, the team of
resident advisors will include a training specialist, who, working
closely with the project coordinator and each specialist, will
ensure training programs for BI staff resu't in effective
implementation of the new or improved systems. To support this
effort, two components are built within the scope directly
concerning training. The first is training within Indonesia
consisting of seminars for senior BI staff and training courses for
junior and mid-level staff. Such seminars and courses will draw
upon the resident team of advisors as well as outside speakers and
lecturers. The second component will be secondment of selected BI
staff to provide a combination of theoretical training through bank
supervision courses and practical application from participation in
on-site examinations through attachment with other supervisory
authorities. These would likely involve the SEACAN group for Asian
bank supervisors and one or more of the three U.S. bank supervision



-63 -                               Annex 3
Page5 of 10
agencies:  The Federal Reserve, Comptroller of Currency, and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The training effort would
also include design of a new system of training for BI'. bank
supervision staff in the long-term to ensure that effective training
will continue well after the present TA ends. As such, a major task
of the training specialist will be to review present training
methods within BI and tu put forward an improved system which would
include work with BI's own training functions to ensure effective
implementation.
7.        While these training programs will enhance Bl's efforts to improve
its bank supervision effectiveness, the core work of bank supervision systems
and training of BI staff in these systems will be performed by a team of
technical advisors. The team is expected to bring to this project a broad
range of skills in bank supervision to enable BI to meet its challenge of a
rapidly expanding and developing financial sector. Of the total team, a
majority will have extensive bank supervision backgrounds, including
experience in: on-site examinations, off-site surveillance, financial
analysis of banks, and techniques of supervision for problem financial
institutions. The team will be headed by a project coordinator with an
extensive range of bank supervision experience, including experience with
developing countries. The primary task of the project coordinator will be to
direct the team of technical advisors under him to ensure all phases of TA are
coordinated and the objectives of BI are met. This would involve all
specialized areas as well as more general topics BI considers priorities. The
latter includes how to evaluate bank management and how to establish risk
driven priorities for bank supervision.
8.        The remaining technical advisors reporting to the project
coordinator will all be viewed as specialists bringing needed expertise to the
project. The specialists for the team are as follows:
(a) two credit experts to focus on asset quality aspects, primarily
concerning on-site examinations. While their skill mix will contain
well rounded backgrounds in all phases of bank supervision, they
will be particularly well-versed in all aspects of financial
analysis for credit risk existing both on and off the balance sheet.
These skills include familiarity with: adequate lending policies
and significant controls within credit functions, proper accounting
methods particularly with regard to interest accrual on problem
loans, analysis of credit facilities, techniques of classification
of problem assets, analysis of the adequacy of loan loss provisions,
and corrective measures for banks' showing weaknesses in assfat
quality. These two specialists will be responsible for desi3ning a
revised system for Bl's supervisory approach to bank asset quality;
they will built upon on BI's existing quantitative method but
primarily shift emphasis to qualitative on-site reviews, which call
for examiner judgement and skills in determining credit quality.
These specialists will also work closely with the team's training
specialist regarding course material on asset quality and practical
on the job training aspects, intended to improve BI examiners' skill
level in this vital component of effective bank supervision;

(b)  tvo forsian exchanjeltreasurv specialists to focus on a variety of
interrelated functions, including: foreign exchange dealing, money
market operations in banke, specialized off-balance sheet activities
not relating to credit risk, and aspects of asset and liability
management including liquidity, interest rate risk (GAP), and
pricing of loans and deposits. Each specialist will be familiar
with:   examination and/or audit techniques for foreign exchange
dealings, money market activities, other treasury or dealings-
related functions, and ALM. Within these topics would be included:
familiarity with adequate policies in these areas, internal
controls, and prudential safeguards, including various limits on
positions taken. These specialists will help BI in designing new
systems to effoectively supervise dealing activities and their risks
both through on-site examinations and off-site surveillance. They
will also coordinate closely with the training specialist regarding
applicable course materials and practical on-the-job coaching
aspects to improve examiners' skill level;
(a) an off-site surveillance specialist to refine and improve the
effectiveness of Bl's BISNS "early warning system". The task will
include: a determination of the accuracy of data submitted by
financial institutions, potential revisions to existing reports, and
improving the financial analysis skills of BI staff. This task has
been initially assigned to the now IMF bank supervision expert who
began a 24-month assignment in October 1990. This specialist is
considered as part of the team for all practical purposes;
sd) an on-site examination expert to assist BI in strengthening its on-
site examination capabilities. Specific responsibilities will
include: the development of recommendations concerning examination
planning, examination procedures and methodologies, the form and
content of the examination report, processing of the examination
report, and related follow-up activities. In addition, the expert
will be expected to develop, together with BI staff, the business
requirements for automated applications related to on-site
examination;
(e) an EDP examinations specialist to review Bl's existing EDP
examination functions, design improvements to it, and implement such
improvements particularly in improving BI's capacity to conduct
"through the computer" examinations which primarily test a bank's
computer software. The specialist will coordinate with the training
specialist to ensure BI examiners have the necessary skills for
improved EDP examinations;
(f)  a bank accountina exeert to review existing accounting standards and
principles for banks, and reeommend revisions needed to ensure
conformity with international best practice. The expert would
review existing financial reports and recommend revised formats for
the presentation of financial statements by banks -ufficiently
detailed so as to permit adequate disclosure for the public to make
informed decisions. The expert would also review existing auditing
standards for banks and propbse specific recommendations for the

minimum scope, content and format of an audit program for banks,
including minimum professional qualifications for external and
internal bank auditors and the need for a new or revised legislation
as appropriate, to enhance the quality and professionalism of bank
audits;
(g) a central bank law exDert to assist BI in formulating a new central
bank law. Specific responsibilities would include recommendations
regarding the powers of BI, including its role vis-a-vis other
financial sector regulators such as MOF and BAPEPAM, and on how to
deal with troubled and failed institutions:
(h) a problem bank specialist to assist BI in developing policies and
procedures for supervising problem and failed banks. Specific
responsibilities will include: the development of policies related
to increased supervisory monitoring, enforcement actions, closure
and liquidation or restructuring of insolvent institutions,
caretaker management, mergers, disposition of assets, and other
related activities;
(i)  a comouter oroaraminin  specialist whose efforts will focus on
computerization of all aspects of BI's bank supervision. The
present heavy reliance on manual recordkeeping and excessive files
has made BI's bank supervision less efficient. Also, there is a
need to standardize the computerization for all supervision
departments. This specialist will help facilitate full and
compatible automation for all bank supervision activities and to
ensure BI staff are sufficiently trained in the newly computerized
system; and
(j) a training specialist well versed in both formal classroom training
and practical on-the-job training methods. This specialist will be
responsible for organizing all training aspects for BI staff,
including the aforementioned seminars, training courses, and
secondments. Such responsibility will include: preparation and/or
coordination of training materials, assigning appropriate
instructors, and coordinating all administrative aspects of such
courses. In addition, this specialist will work to design coaching
programs to enhance practical on-the-job application of new concepts
taught. The training specialist will closely interact with the
project coordinator and all other specialists on the team to ensure
each new or improved system for BI's bank sutpervision effort is
clearly understood and being effectively implemented. Finally, the
training specialist will work on designing a long-term training
system for BI to enable effective training to continue after
completion of the proposecd TA program.
Credit Information System
9.        The need for a reliable credit information system in Indonesia was
recognized as early as 1969. Initial attempts to set up such a system in BI
were not very successful as the system was operated manually by maintaining



- 66 -                              Annex 3
Page 8 of 10
debtor cards, leading to a huge backlog of data and unprocessed requests from
financial institutions. Efforts to computerize the system in 1982 also failed
to meet the primary objective of assisting the financial institutions in their
lending decisions due to the poor quality of data. With the deregulation of
the banking sector, BI, with short-term assistance from a consulting firm,
embarked on a program to establish a credible credit information system. This
system now needs to be further developed in order to meet the information
requirements in a coherent manner as well as to built the flexibility to
accomodate future information requirements. The services of the following
experts would be provided to BI credit department under the technical
assistance component:
(a) a comPuter system development manager to: assess and document to
what extent the current system satisfies the requirements for a new
system; develop a data conversion plan from the current system to
the proposed system where the assessment of the current system
satisfies the requirements of a new system; write detailed system
and program specifications, which will serve as both documentation
and directives for programming supports; lead additional analysis
and design efforts for anticipated new requirements and applications
of the proposed system; monitor and evaluate the implemented new
system as to how the actual results conform to the anticipated
results for the satisfaction of the proposed information
requirements; and manage other technical aspects of the project;
(b) a computer programming snecialist to: develop both batch and on-
line programs as specified in the design of the credit information
system, to be developed in a 4 GL programming language for a
relational database environment implemented on both a mid-range
computer and personal computers; working from detailed
specifications, code programs which satisfy the requirements of the
system and allow for the flexibility of future maintenance and
enhancements; unit and system test all programs within a base case
environment that includes all combinations of positive and negative
results; document all programs, the system as a whole and operating
procedures; prepare both a conversion and implementation plan; and
involve the programming staff of the credit department in order to
ensure a complete transfer of knowledge and participate in the
writing of the user manuals required to utilize the system;
(c) a hardware/software evaluation specialist to: be responsible for
selecting an optimal technical platform for the implementation of
the credit information system; assess the current hardware and
software environment of the credit department as to the limitations
and restrictions currently being experienced; determine the
anticipated volume of data to be stored and accessed; determine the
anticipated processing requirements including, on-line reporting and
response time, batch reporting and turn around time, communications
linkage with the member banks and other BI departments; and develop
a vendor short list for both hardware and software and facilitate
vendor proposals; and

(d)   a trainina/documentation snec1alist to:  prepare the manuals
necessary to use the features of the credit information system;
determine the users of the system and document the specific needs of
each user level; develop formal course materials for instruction on
the use of the system by credit dopartment staff and by member
banks; train credit department staff in the use of the credit
information system; and train credit department training instructors
in the methods required for using the system at member baiks.
10.       The total estimated cost of the TA program is summarized below,
including the services of consultants provided under the Project Preparation
Facility (No. P-162).

INDONESIA
FINffACIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Overview of the Five State Commercial Banks
1.        Within Indonesia's financial system, the five state-owned
commercial banks (SCBs), i.e., Bank Bumi Days (BBD). Bank Dagang Ne8ara (BDN),
Bank Ekepor Impor Indonesia (Bankixim), Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 (BNI 1946)
and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BhlI), continue to dominate the country's commercial
banking sector, albeit domination that has steadily declined since the June
1983 financial sector reforms. As of end-1990, these five SCBs accounted for
less than 50 percent of total assets of deposit money banks (compared to
almost three-fourths as of end-1982).
2.        Background and Develonment.  Among the five SCBs, BRI, founded in
1895, is the oldest while the remaining four were established in post-
independence Indonesia. Until their conversion into PERSEROs, as provided
under the Banking Legislation approved by Parliament in February 1992, they
operated under the guidelines of the Banking Act of 1967 and a number of other
legislative measure enacted in 1967/68 that established the SCBs in their
present form. All were assigned the objective of furthering national economic
development and allowed to operate in most sectors of economic activity.
Moreover, each was assigned a particular sector, or sectors, to which it was
to give priority: BDN-mining and industry; BNI 1946-industry;
BRI-agricultural and rural credit; BBD-estates and forestry; and
BankExim-trade financing.  However, this sectoral specialization was difficult
to implement because of customers' reluctance to change banks. Increasingly,
therefore, the SCBs have competed among themselves and with other banks for
both loans and deposits, and have concentrated on efforts to diversify their
respective lending operations.
3.        The evolution of the SCBs has been strongly influenced by the role
and policies of BI. While the 1967 Banking Act delegated to BI responsibility
for the guidance, control and supervision of all financial Institutions, the
role of BI in the Indonesian economy historically has been much broader than
that of a traditional central bank. It has taken the lead in furthering
national development by directly financing public enterprises and by promoting
special credit programs (providing refinancing facilities) to banks, thus
enabling them to Uinance investments in priority sectors. In this way, SI
became a very important source of funds to the commercial banks, particularly
the SCBs, which (until the June 1983 financial sector reforms) had
unrestricted access to all BI facilities. Under these policies, the SCBs were
encouraged to develop term-lending and improve their credit evaluation
capacities. In this, they were strongly supported by BI, which set up a
project appraisal department to monitor the appraisal quality of the
individual banks and helped provide training programs on project evaluation.
However, the preferred position of the SCBs, particularly their access to BI
funding and BI's regulation of most of the interest rates they could charge
(until 1983), effectively insulated them from competition and diminished the
stimulus for these banks to emphasize operational efficiencies. With the June



- 74-                            ADLe  5
Page 2 of 5
1983 reforms, the SCBs were suddenly called uron to mobilize substantial
resources for lending purposes directly from the public and to operate
efficiently and profitably In an Increasingly competitive and expanding
market. Since then, they have been In an ongoing pro,:ese of reviewing their
respective strategies, operational policies, and internal management and
information systems, in an effort to become more efficient. With the
Increased autonomy that will be provided to them as P'%RSEROs, the SCBo are
expected to take the necessary initiatives and actions that will enable them
to improve further their respective financial performance and positions.
4.        Organizational Structure. Each of the five SCBs has its head
office in Jakarta and operates an extensive branch network. As shown in Table
1 below, these banks together had 926 branches at the end-1991, ranging from
123 for BDN to 320 for BRI. Total employees numbered almost 51,400-ranging
from slightly less than 5,500 for BankExim to almost 189200 for BRI.1/ All
five SCBe have at least one representative office overseas.

5.        The organizational structure for each SCB im basically the sama.
Each 8CR has a Supervisory Board consisting of three membero appointed by the
President of Indonesia upon the recommendation of tha HOP. In additions each
SCB has a Board of Directors which consists of five senior bankers (a
President and four Managing Directors) appointed In t:  same maner, usually
from vithin the senior ranks of the SCBt' respective managements.
Appointments are for a five-year renewable term. (However, once the SCBs
become PERSEROs, senior management will be Jppointed directly by the Minist6r
of Finance.) The President is the bank's Chief Executive Officer. These
Boards are responsible for ensuring compliance with established banking
policies and regulations. Board members are typically responoible for areas
of functional specialization within the bank such as credit and planning.
Thus, th- conduct day-to-day management in addition to having Board level
1/   Exclusive of BRI's 3,210 Unit Desas (village subbranch system) which
employs some 15,550 people. This "autonomous" profit center deals
:c'lusively with the bank's small credi;. program. (Refer Secgnd
JAI/IUPEDES Small Credit Prolect, SAR Mo. 8644-IND datee July 10, 1990.)



- 75 -                           "n-ex L
Page 3 of i
responsibility for overall supervision of bank performance, credit quality and
soundness. While the autonomy of the SCBs' respective managements in
establishing credit policies and procedures has increased, as the government
role in funding priority programs and allocating credit has diminished with
the liberalization of the financial sector, the SCBs are expected to exercise
greater independence from external pressures that may in part have influenced
lending decisions.
6.        Aside from administrative and human resource type units (e.g.,
departments for administration, personnel, organization planning, public
relations, logSistics, electronicldata processing and training), the operations
of the SCBs are drawn along similar functional units. While terminology
differs from SCB to SCB, these units include: (a) credit management;
(b) accounting and audit; (c) international banking; (d) geographic
administration; and (e) research and development. Extensive institutional
efforts aimed at improving operational efficiency have been initiated during
the past several years by all five SCBs. BNI 1946 and BRI (vith TA provided
under Lns. 2430-IND and 2800-IND) have completed major organizational reform
programs to improve their organizational structure (especially in terms of
reducing their respective staffing lvels, as shown in Table L above), banking
policies, management guidelines, and to streamline the credit process. On a
smaller scale, BDN also implemented recently an organizational and systems
improvement program while both BBD and Bankzixm have recently engaged the
long-term services of international consultant firms under multi-million
dollar contracts to help them improve their respective operations. These
efforts reflect a strong commitment on the part of the SCBs towards developing
modern, full-service commercial operations, and are encouraging. However, as
reflected in the findings of BI's recently completed asset quality reviews
(para. 3.30 of the SAR), greater emphasis by the SCBo' respective managements
need to be placed on quality control in credit evaluation, loan processing and
supervision procedures in order to eusure that their internal policies and
guidelines are implemented accordingly.
7.        Financial Poseiti2.  Until the June 1983 financial sector reforme,
the evolution of the SCBs was primarily Influenced by the role and policies of
BI, v*Taich was also the main source of funds for the SCBs. After the 1983
reforms, the SCBs had to mobilize resources for lending purposes directly from
the public and were forced to focue attention on operating more efficiently in
an increasingly competitive environment. The SCBs have moved forward to meet
this challenge and their new role. In the discussion that follows, the reader
is referred to Attachments 1-24, providing datalled operational and financial
data on the SCBe for the period 1985-91. Attachments 1-4 provide aggregated
SCB (i) audited income statements, (it) audited balance sheots, (tll) summary
of lending and borrowing *perations, and (iv) indicators of financial position
and performance, respectively; Attachments 5-24 provide these same sets of
data for BBD (i.e., 5-8), BDN (i.e., 9-12), Bankxzim (i.e., 13-16), BNI (i.e.,
17-20), and BRI (i.e., 21-24).
8.        Since the 1983 reform package, the SCBs have grown rapidly.  At the
end of 1983, total SCB assets (excluding administrative accounts) amounted to
Rp 17.4 trillion. Total assets doubled during the next three years, reaching
36.2 trillion by the end of 1986, ani continued to mushroom after that,
totaling 90.5 trillion at the end of 1990-an average annual growth of almost



- 76 -                           Annex 5
Page 4 of 5
26 percent for the seven-year period. Average annual growth rates for the
individual SCBs approximated the aggregated average, ranging from 22 percent
for BNI to 30 percent for BankExim. As already noted, a significant portion
of the SCBEs' increase in assets during this period was directly attributable
to their successful domestic resource mobilization efforts. Customer deposits
(i.e., demand, time and savings) eteadily Increased from Rp 15.9 trillion at
end-1985 to 56.4 trillion at ond-1990. This increase in deposits resulted in
satisfactory liquidity for all the SCBs during this period, and was largely
reflected in significant levels of short-term placemonts (by 1989 and 1990,
loan portfolio to total assots had stabilized at 66 percent, ranging from
around 50 percent for BankExm to about 78 percent for BBD). During this same
period, BI liquidity credits and other OI borrowings also increased in
absolute terms (i.e., from Rp 8.3 to 16.9 trillion), although modestly in
comparison to customer deposits. As of end-1990, adjusting for BI liquidity
funds and other Government loano, the SCBs' aggregated loan-to-deposit ratio
was satisfactory at 77 percent (although the range among the individual SCBs
was 56 percent for BankExim, to 99 percent for BRI). Seventy percent of total
SCR assets and 78 percent of liabilities were short-term, resulting in an
asset and liability/equity structure that was reasonably well-matched.
9.        However, during 1991, the rapid growth of the previous years came
to an abrupt end. The SCBs' total assets Increased by less than 6 percent.
While BBD and BDN experienced growth rates of 16 and 14 percent, respectively,
BRI grew by only 7 percent while Bankixim experienced no growth and BNI
experienced an actual decline in total assets of 7 percent. With the
announced retrenchment in early IS90 of liquidity credits (para. 1.10 of the
SAR), the SCBs have also become more reliant on funding for its lending
operations from their respective deposit bases. By end-1991, loans accounted
for almost 72 percent of total assets (ranging from 56 percent for BankExim to
79 percent for BBD), and the loan-to-deposit (adjusted) ratio had reached 89
percent (ranging from satisfactory levels of 68 and 76 percent for BankExim
s-i BNI, respectively, to unsatisfactory levels of 95, 98 and 106 percent for
LRI, BBD and BDN respectively). All five 8CBs are undercapitalized (refer
paras. 1.48 and 3.14 of the SAR)-paid-in capital amounts to only 0.03 percent
of total assets. As a result of the new banking legislation (para. 3.18 of
the SAR), the SCBs will now be capitalized at appropriate levels as required
under BI's prudential regulations (para. 3.9 of the SAR).
10.       Financial Performance.  Based on audited financial statements,
profitability indicators for the five SCBs during the period 1986-1990 were
satisfactory. Annual profits before tax averaged around 1.1 percent of
average total assets (ranging between 0.8 percent for BID to 2.0 for
BankExim). Substantial progress has been made In reducing personnel expenses.
As a percentage of average total asseta, they declined by about 0.4 percent
[as shown in Table I above, total SCB employees between 1983 and 1990
increased by only 13 percent, while total assets during that same period
increased five-fold; during 1991, total SCB staffing declined by almost 5
percent-although BBD and BankIXim expanded by 13 and 9 percent, respectively].
These gains, however, were somewhat offset by increases la other
administrative expenses of about 0.3 percent. Recent lending margins (i.e.,
the difference between income from lending as a percentage of average loan
portfolio less financial expenses as a percentage of average borrowings) for
the five SCBs remained rather stable (between 3.8 and 4.2 percent), until it



- 77-                          A"93L 5
Page 5 of 5
dropped sharply to 3.2 In 1991,-reflectingin large part, the lag between
rapidly rising deposit rites beginning In late 1990 and subsequent increases
in onlending rates (although the declining margins for all the SCBs also
appears to reflect an increase In arrears experienced by them during 1991).
Between 1986 and 1990, average net profits (after taxes-income tax rate of 35
percent) for the SCBs remained very stable at around 0.7 percents however,
this return also dropped sharply In 1991, ranging from 0.3 percent for BBD and
BDN to 0.5 percent for BankExim.
11.       While the saove Indicators suggest that, ovorall, the performance
of the SCBs has been generally satisfactory, the results of the BI's asset
quality reviews undertaken in 1991 Indicate that provisioning expenses may
have been understated in the past (para. 12 below), thus effectively
overstating profitability. In fact, a review of actual provisioning done by
the individual SCBs during the past seven years (refer respective Attachments)
suggest that the level of anmual provisions were made at a level (such like a
balancing item) that would still enable each bank to show a reasonable profit.
This becomes particularly evident In 1986-a year In which all the SCBs
received substantial windfall profits resulting from the September rupiah
devaluation-when provisions were greatly increased; likewise, In 1991, with
all the SCBs experiencing huge declines in profitability, provisions were at
about half their previous years' levels. BI's new regulations regarding
provisioning will not only result in statements that more accurately reflect
the actual financial condition of Indonesian banks, but wtll require the banks
to adopt appropriate and timely pricing of their loans, including prudent
margins to provide for risk.
12.       Portfolio lgalltv.  Until February 1991, the five SCB. (as well ao
other financial institutions in Indonesia) classified their respective loan
portfolios, as required by BI, on the basis of collectibility (i.e., regular,
often late, special attention and liquidation). However, since the criteria
used in classifying accounts were not clearly specified, the classification of
accounts had become, in large part, a relatively subjective exercise. While
all the SCBs have In the past set aside provisions to cover losses on their
loan portfolio (the maximum percentage permitted for loan loss provisions to
be tax deductible is 6 percent of average loans outstanding, excluding loan.
guaranteed by the Government) and periodically have written off bad debts,
such provisions and write-offs have routinely been in amounts such that each
SCB was able to show a reasonable annual profit, rather than in amounts that
reflected the true quality of their respective portfolios. BI'o new
prudential regulations on capital adequacy and loan lose provisioning
announced in February 1991, If monitored and supervised accordingly, represent
a major accomplishment in Introducing an appropriate regulatory framework that
should help promote the incentives and disciplin needed to improve portfolio
quality.

FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Terms of Reference for SCB Asset Qualitv Reviews
1.        As an expert in credit risk management and/or bank examination, you
have been selected to provide assistance to Bank Indonesia in the performance
of special asset quality reviews of the following banks:
*    Bank Negara Indonesia 1946
*    Bank Rakyat Indonesia
*    Bank Bumi Daya
*    Bank Dagang Negara
*    Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia
Oblectives
2.        The objectives of the special asset quality reviews are to:
(a) determine the overall quality of assets, with a particular emphasis
on the quality of each bank's loan portfolio, and to relate that
determination to the overall financial condition and soundness of
the bank;
(b) determine the amount of provisions necessary to establish adequate
reserves for actual and potential losses existing within each bank's
portfolio of assets and off-balance sheet contingencies;
(c)  determine the amount of capital required to meet the minimum
risk-weighted capital adequacy guidelines issued by BI, after taking
into account guidelines issued by BI and after taking into account
the smount of provisions and other adjustments to profit and loss
quantified during your reviews;
(d) assess each bank's policies and procedures for managirg and
administering its loan portfolio and other risk assets, and ensuring
the adequacy of loss reserves; and to recommend improvements in
those areas requiring strengthening;
(e) strengthen and further develop Bank Indonesia's examination
procedures for evaluating the quality of assets and determining the
adequacy of reserves for loan losses and other valuation reserves;
and
(f) enhance the knowledge of BI bank supervision staff in modern asset
evaluation techniques, credit principles, and loan review skills.
3.        Given the size and complexity of the institutions involved, you are
expected to rely heavily on the participation of BI bank supervision staff
working under your guidance. In this regard, after first determining the



- 114 -
Page 2 of 6
scope of the special asset quality reviews and assessing the complexities of
the banks involved, you should propose a work program that identifies the
number of staff, and their skills, required to ensure completion of the
assigned tasks within the duration of your engagement.
Scone and Detail of The Asset Ouality Reviews
4.        The scope of the special asset quality reviews should cover the
following:
(a) An assessment of lending policies and practices and management's
overall administration of its loan and investment portfolios. In
this regard, you should evaluate policies and procedures related to
the granting of credit, including procedures for approving creditl
obtaining and analyzing financial information; establishing and
enforcing repayment programs; rescheduling, extending, modifying, or
otherwise refinancing problem credits; collecting past due loans;
provisioning for actual and potential losses; writing off bad
assets; ensuring appropriate diversification; and managing related
off-balance sheet risks;
(b) An evaluation of asset I/ quality. This evaluation should assess
and classify them according to criteria for other assets especially
mentioned, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories (or in accord
with an alternative recognized and acceptable classification
scheme). Actual and potential losses should be clearly identified.
It is expected that the sample of loans selected for review should
not be less than sixty to seventy percent, by value, of the
portfolio outstanding;
(c) An opinion on the adequacy of loss reserves. If reserves are
inadequate, you should recommend an appropriate level of reserves
and a methodology for ensuring that adequate reserves are
maintained. The methodology used to determine the level of reserves
considered as adequate should be clearly demonstrated in your final
report;
(d) An opinion on the adequacy of capital. If capital is inadequate,
you should determine the amount of additional capital required using
Bank Indonesia's risk-weighted capital adequacy formula. The
calculation using this formula should be clearly demonstrated in the
final report;
(e) The identification and quantification of concentrations of credit
and large exposures representing 25 percent or more of capital
funds. These concentrations may result from credit (in the form of
loans, investments, or other instruments) extended to a single
borrower or related group, an economic or industrial sector, a
political jurisdiction or geographic area, bank insiders or
1/   Including miscellaneous asset categories and off-balance sheet
comitments and contingencies.

connected parties, or assets dependent upon a single factor that
could affect repayment prospects for the entire group of assets
(such as a group of borrowers dependent upon the price of a single
commodity such as oil);
(f) For banks which accrue interest income, an evaluation of the bank's
practices for accruing interest on nonperforming assets. You should
determine whether the bank has an appropriate policy for designating
nonperforming assets and suspending the accrual of interest. If
interest continues to be accrued on nonperforming or seriously
delinquent credits, you should determine the amount of such interest
credited to the profit and loss account as income and recommend
appropriate adjustments;
(g) An assessment of internal controls in the lending area. This
assessment should also address the adequacy and effectiveness of the
bank's internal management information and reporting systems for
these areas; and
(h) An assessment of the quality of lending management and board
supervision over the lending and investment functions.
5.        In devising the plan of work under the special asset quality
reviews, you should take into consideration the effectiveness and reliability
of administrative systems and internal controls in order to determine the
degree of reliance to be placed upon them, and the extent of testing and
verification that needs to be performed by Bank Indonesia staff.
Re2orf '.    Prepared by the Consultant
6.        A report containing your findings will be prepared for each bank in
English. At a minimum, the final report should include the following
information. However, you are encouraged to submit additional information
relevant to your findings which will serve to inform Bank Indonesia of
significant issues not otherwise covered by these forms of reference.
(a) A description of the criteria used for selecting the samples of
loans, investments, and other assets for review and a statement as

or other relevant breakdown; reporting relationships; lending
authorities; a flow chart of the credit approval process; and other
information considered necessary to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the bank's credit process and lending activities;

sampling cutoff amount. In the case of loans, these written
comments should provide a brief description of the credit including
the history of the indebtedness, the repayment plan and actual
perforuance, a brief analysis of the financial statements, a
description of the collateral and/or guarantees (if any), and the
reasons the loan is classified. For investments and other assets,
you should provide a description of the asset, its outstanding
balance, and a summary of the factors leading to its classification.

to coordinate your activities closely with other consultants and to agree upon
the standards to be used in evaluating the quality of assets and assessing the
adequacy of reserves. In this regard, you should agree on common definitions
