MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM
FOR A POPULATION AND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed development credit to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for SDR 33.6 million, on
standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity and 10 years grace, to help finance a Population
and Family Health Project.
2.           Country/Sector Background. After several decades of war, Viet Nam was
unified under socialism in 1975. In 1989, Government launched a successful program of
adjustment and reform, aimed at macroeconomic liberalization and stabilization. Real annual
GDP growth has averaged 7%, and exports have grown more than 30% per annum to become
a leading sector in the economy. Prospects for the coming decade are bright. However Viet
Nam is still one of the world's poorest countries, at a per capita GNP of under US$200. One
quarter of the population is too poor to afford an adequate daily food intake and over half of
young children are stunted. A combination of broad-based economic growth with continued
access for the poor to basic social services will be essential for long-term economic
development and poverty reduction.
3.           Reduction of population growth will make a vital contribution. Viet Nam's
population is now 73 million, the second largest in Southeast Asia. Pressure on agricultural
and forest land is acute and dependency ratios are still high, resulting in heavy education and
child health care costs relative to productive capacity. Despite recent declines, the total fertility
rate (TFR) is still above 3 births per woman, much above replacement level. Because of Viet
Nam's very low mortality, annual population growth is still over 2%, sufficient to double the
population within 33 years.
4.           Viet Nam's family planning program has had a successful initial stage, reaching
a contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for modem methods of 44% in 1994. The small family
norm is well entrenched, with preferred family size among young women close to replacement
level at 2.3. The total CPR stands at 65%, indicating that couples are translating their desire
for small families into action. However Viet Nam's program is no longer fully responding to
their needs, as evidenced by little recent change in modem-method prevalence, high rates of
pregnancy termination, and a rise in use of less-effective traditional methods (now at a CPR of
21%) whose failures contribute significantly to the demand for pregnancy termination. The
major problem is the program's failure to provide short-term and reversible modem methods as
alternatives to the IUD and sterilization, both methods with only limited acceptability in Viet
Nam.
5.           At the same time, progress in women's health has lagged far behind. Matemal
mortality is anomalously high, at over 200 per 100,000 live births. The prevalence of anaemia
and reproductive tract infections (RTIs) is very high, possibly linked to the high rates of IUD
use and pregnancy termination. The deterioration of Viet Nam's primary health care system,



- 2 -
through which most FP and reproductive health services are delivered in a highly cost-effective
manner, is another concem. Though comprehensive and well utilized in the past, its resources
have dwindled with decollectivization and pressure on public expenditures. Quality and
utilization rates have fallen, and substantial investment is needed to restore effective
functioning.
6.          In response to these concems, Govemment has formulated a broader approach
as set out in its Cairo International Conference on Population and Development statement. The
principles include: voluntary participation in family planning; recognition of the right to
reproductive health care; integration of family planning with matemal and child health care; and
recognition of the need to reduce the incidence of pregnancy termination through improved FP
services. The project is designed within this policy framework.
7.           Project Goals and Objectives. The objectives of the Project are to assist
Government in improving the health of the population of Viet Nam and achieving further
reductions in fertility and population growth through: (a) an improved and increased utilization
of family planning and related family health services; (b) enhancing NCPFP's management,
planning and policy formulation capabilities; and (c) expanding the knowledge base upon
which NCPFP and MOH policy and technical guidelines are to be formulated.
8.          Within the framework of these broad goals, ten key indicators will measure
project impact and achievement, related to specific objectives for the year 2002 as follows: (1)
a decline in the TFR to around 2.2; (2) an increase in the CPR for modem methods to 56%; (3)
a decline of 30% in the total abortion rate (TAR); (4) a decline in the infant mortality rate to 25;
(5) an increase in the share of short-term methods in the contraceptive method mix to 25%; (6)
improved access to an adequate range of family planning services; (7) improved utilization of
commune health centre facilities for pre-natal care in the 15 project provinces; (8) improvement
in the met need for life-saving obstetric care in the 15 project provinces; (9) an increase in the
percent of infants fully immunized in the 15 project provinces; (10) an improvement in the
management information score. Specific values for objectives (6)-(10) will be set after a
baseline survey.
9.           Project Description. The major project components will be: (1) upgrading of
primary health care service delivery (US$74.9 million or 57.8% of total project cost) at the
commune, district and provincial level, to provide selected facility renovation, equipment,
essential drug supplies, refresher training and support to outreach in 15 provinces in order to
strengthen services for (i) family planning, (ii) matemal care including pre- and post-natal
care, safe delivery, and tetanus toxoid immunization and micronutrient supplementation in
pregnancy, (iii) reproductive tract infections and (iv) other primary health care including child
health and minor curative care; (2) strengthening of information, education and communication
(US$16.8 million or 13.0%) to improve awareness and demand for FP and family health
services; (3) provision of contraceptive supplies (US$25.3 million or 19.5%) to support
increased contraceptive use and a widened method mix; (4) development of the management,
planning and policy formulation capabilities of NCPFP and its subsidiary committee network
(US$6.7 million or 5.2%) by providing management training for FP program staff and
strengthening management information systems; (5) strengthening of the capacity and quality
of FP and family health service delivery (US$6.0 million or 4.6%) through studies and piloting



-3 -
cf new approaches in private sector development, services for ethnic minorities, community-
based outreach, and quality issues in treatment of reproductive tract infections and other
reproductive health care.
10.          Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$129.6
million equivalent including taxes, or US$125.3 million excluding taxes with a foreign
exchange component of US$68.6 million (53% of project cost). The proposed credit of
SDR33.6 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) will finance about 38.6% of the total project
costs net of taxes. The remainder will be financed by an ADF concessionary loan from the
Asian Development Bank of US$41.0 million, a grant from KfW of DM30 million
(approximately US$20 million) and a Government contribution of US$18.6 million. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of the project's key processing steps and the status of Bank Group operations in Viet
Nam are shown in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR No.
14966 VN dated December 22, 1995) is being distributed separately.
11.          Project Implementation. The project will be implemented over a seven year
period by the NCPFP and the local governments of the project provinces, in close coordination
vith the Ministry of Health and provincial health bureaus. Day-to-day project management will
be the responsibility of a Project Management Unit within NCPFP reporting to the Chairman,
NCPFP, and corresponding Provincial Project Management Units in the 15 project provinces.
Overall guidance for the project will be provided by a ministerial-level Project Steering
Committee including the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank
of Viet Nam and Ministry of Finance. Technical implementation of national family planning
components will be the responsibility of corresponding departments in NCPFP under an
Executive Committee.
12.         Project Sustainability. For the strengthening of provincial PHC services,
no issues of sustainability arise. The incremental cost burden generated by the project's
upgrading package, comprising maintenance and essential drug costs for 15 provinces, would
amount to well under 1% of the projected national health budget at project completion in 2002.
Even the simultaneous upgrading of a further 15 provinces under the National Health Support
Project, and any possible extension under Government funding to the rest of the country, could
be sustained through earmarking of no more than 3% of the health budget. Under the National
Health Support Project, issues of health financing and sustainability will be examined further
and revisited at mid-term review. For the strengthening of the national FP program, the
major issue is the increased volume and cost of contraceptive supplies generated by the
project's investment in increasing contraceptive prevalence and the use of short-term
commodity-based methods. The net increase in recurrent costs generated by the project is
projected at around US$5 million per annum, and the total cost burden for contraceptive
commodities would reach about US$7.5 million, or 13% of the projected national FP budget.
This allocation for contraceptives is not excessive by world standards, and should be affordable
even if Government were obliged to finance the entire amount. In practice, however, an
increasing share of costs is likely to be bome through private sector services and charges for
contraceptives in the public program. Substantial donor contributions are also expected to
continue. The expanded FP program should therefore be financially sustainable. Institutional



-4 -
sustainability of both upgraded provincial health services and the family planning program
should not be an issue. No staff are being added, organizational structures and tasks are not
changing, and there is ample spare capacity in the current systems to handle the increased
workload generated by the project.
13.          Lessons from Previous Bank Experience. IDA has experience with only
one social sector project in Viet Nam, the Primary Education Project (Credit 2548-VN). A key
lesson from early implementation has been the need to invest heavily in advance training of
implementation agency staff in IDA procedures, and to provide follow-up assistance during the
initial project period. Early preparation of first-year implementation plans would also be
essential. In these respects, a PHRD grant to prepare the project has been of great value.
Though executed by IDA, all local expenditures were handled through the Resident Mission in
close partnership with the NCPFP Project Unit, which gained valuable experience in IDA
procedures.
14.         Rationale For Bank Involvement. IDA's goal in Viet Nam, as outlined in the
Country Assistance Strategy (discussed by the Board on November 21, 1995), is to promote
broad-based economic development and to combat poverty. A key element of this strategy is
to assist in developing sustainable social sector delivery systems as the basis for human capital
accumulation and national social protection. The project contributes to the poverty alleviation
strategy through: (a) development of effective and sustainable family health and FP systems;
(b) targeting to particularly vulnerable groups; and (c) assistance to reducing rapid population
growth.
15.         The project will use IDA's comparative advantage in addressing population
issues in the context of a broad sectoral dialogue with Government based on the Cairo
conference consensus. It will build on and complement work done for the PHN Sector
Review, the Poverty Assessment and Strategy Report and the National Health Support Project,
by sharpening sectoral priorities and broadening the scope of assistance to the PHN sector. In
addition, it complements the Primary Education Project by reinforcing investment in female
education through investment in women's health. By reducing population growth, it will also
contribute to sustainable use of natural resources.
16.         A number of donors, notably UNFPA, UNICEF and GTZ, have been active in
the population and family health sectors in Viet Nam for some time, and have made very
valuable contributions. However IDA is uniquely able to provide a comprehensive national
package of technical and financial resources for the core investments needed to strengthen and
redirect the population sector in Viet Nam.
17.         Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the following principal agreements
were reached with Government: (a) selected key indicators will be used to monitor and
evaluate implementation progress and project impact (see para.8); (b) baseline and final
surveys and a Mid-term Review will be carried out, with contents linked to key indicators and
project objectives; (c) an annual review of the project workplan and budget for the next fiscal
year will be carried out with IDA; (d) all facilities upgraded under the project will be
adequately maintained during the life of the project; (e) a study of the acceptability and impact
of charges for contraceptives supplied through the public program will be carried out and its



- 5 -
results used to implement an appropriate phased program of charges; (f) proposals for all
activities under the service delivery model initiatives component will be submitted to IDA for
prior review and approval; (g) Government policy and implementation guidelines for cost
recovery for essential drugs and medical supplies provided under the project, including an
exemption for remote and mountainous communes, will be reviewed with IDA early in the
project and implemented thereafter. As a condition of credit effectiveness, the Project Steering
Committee, the Executive Committee, the Project Management Unit, and the Provincial Project
Management Units would be established and key staff appointed.
18.         Poverty Category. Viet Nam's GNP per capita of less than US$200 per
capita ranks it as one of the poorest countries of the world. The project aims to improve family
health and FP services at the grassroots through public sector programs. Hence it contributes
to poverty alleviation and is self-targeted towards the rural poor. It also aims to improve access
to services for disadvantaged and isolated ethnic minorities, who are among the poorest and
most underserved groups in Viet Nam. The project is therefore poverty-focused and falls
under the category "Program of Targeted Interventions"
19.          Environmental Aspects. The project has been ranked "C" for environmental
assessment purposes. In the long-term, an effective PHC system which includes adequate
provision of FP and family health services will lower fertility and reduce environmental
pressures associated with rapid population growth.
20.          Program Objective Categories. The project will invest in improvements in
FP and basic health services in provinces selected for unfavorable health and fertility indicators,
with a particular focus on improved health services for women and children. These are not
only least-cost and highly cost-effective public health interventions but will also support
poverty alleviation and enhance the participation of women in development.
21.          Participatory Approach. Through the PHRD grant, NCPFP worked closely
with provincial, district and commune Population and Family Planning committees, as well as
local health bureaus and staff, in the design, planning and detailed preparation of the project.
Provincial project management units will be set up in the 15 project provinces. In addition,
participatory studies were carried out among ethnic minority communities, and their findings
used to design a strategy for improving family health and FP services for disadvantaged
minorities.
22.          Project Benefits. By strengthening the FP program and integrating it into
family health, the project will generate a range of benefits. Nationally, smaller family sizes,
and reduced population growth would be achieved through improved knowledge of FP
methods, a wider choice of methods and better quality FP services. Individually, women,
children and families, including an average 7 million contracepting couples annually, would
benefit from improved matemal, child and reproductive health and family welfare. Additional
benefits to the economy and society of Viet Nam (82 million people by 2002) will include the
reduction of pressure on natural resources and the environment, and of the need for social
services.
23.          At the provincial level, upgraded PHC services should produce a number of
least-cost and cost-effective health benefits to the entire community (currently 21 million



- 6 -
people). Core beneficiaries (women needing maternal care, children under three years of age
and contraceptors) would amount to 5.4 million annually. In addition, if the package of inputs
provided by the project, and by the National Health Support Project, is successful in
revitalizing the PHC system, it should provide a powerful stimulus and model for similar
upgrading in the remaining third of the country.
24.          Without the project (and the National Health Support Project), Government
probably could not mobilize sufficient domestic or external funding for major upgrading of
either the family planning program or provincial health services. Lacking such investment, the
family planning program is likely to stagnate at current usage levels and method mix, driving
couples to still greater use of ineffective traditional methods. Fertility decline could be slowed
and abortion rates would remain undesirably high. The primary health care system would
probably deteriorate still further, reducing coverage and quality of core public health
interventions and risking increases in disease and death rates such as have been observed
elsewhere in similar circumstances. In neither case is the private sector likely to substitute
adequately for public services within the foreseeable future.
25.          Risks. The technical packages of FP and PHC interventions to be delivered
under the project present little risk. They are well-tested world-wide, and Viet Nam's ability to
implement them efficiently and with commitment is not in doubt. However the project carries
three major risks. First, as regards provincial PHC services, utilization rates have dropped
because of deteriorating service quality. It has been assumed that they would recover as the
result of the project's investments. There is a risk that it may be too late to retrieve public
confidence even if services are dramatically upgraded. However experience elsewhere has
shown that public systems continue to be attractive, particularly to the very poor, if access and
quality of services can be assured. This risk will be minimized by providing a comprehensive
package of inputs that should achieve good access and quality.
26.          Second, as regards the national FP program, there is a risk that despite high-
level commitment and the project's fresh inputs, the expected broadening of the method mix,
and shift to a client-oriented approach, may not be achieved as rapidly as projected. It may
prove difficult to change attitudes and practices among program managers and providers, to
correct client misperceptions, and to shift client preferences towards less familiar methods.
These risks will be minimized by: intensive information, education and communication
activities; extensive training in counseling for providers and motivators; management
strengthening to promote fresh thinking; and the use of findings from studies and pilot
interventions to support new strategic approaches.
27.          Third, there is a general risk that project implementation may be slow and
unsatisfactory because of Viet Nam's inexperience with IDA and ADB project procedures,
coupled with limited NCPFP management capabilities. This risk will be minimized by
management upgrading under the project. Extensive training in IDA and ADB procedures is
also planned prior to implementation. The positive experience of NCPFP's use of PHRD
funds, combined with Viet Nam's past successful management of PHC and FP programs,
suggests that this risk is not unduly high.
