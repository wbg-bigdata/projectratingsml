Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
Tourism is Jordan's second largest generator of foreign exchange after remittances. With the advent of the
peace process, tourism has increased significantly. In 1996, 1.1 million tourists visited Jordan (as measured by
accommodation arrivals), resulting in foreign exchange revenues of over US$750 million equivalent, or
approximately 10 percent of GNP. In addition, tourism has been an important employment generator, currently
employing more than 8,000 persons directly, and far more in view of links to other sectors. The actual tourism
potential of the Kingdom is even greater; capturing this potential, however, will require Jordan to develop the sector
in a coherent manner to ensure its economic, social and environmental sustainability. To this end, the Government,
with Bank assistance, is formulating a medium- to long-term Tourism Development Program; the proposed Second
Tourism Development Project would finance Phase I investments of the Program.
The project's development objectives are to: (a) create the conditions for an increase in sustainable and
environmentally sound tourism in Petra, Wadi Rum, Jerash and Karak; and (b) realize tourism-related employment
and income-generation potential at project sites. Criteria for evaluating the achievement of the first objective are: (a)
approval of a long-term tourism sector strategy and accompanying investment, institutional restructuring and
regulatory reform programs by September 1999; (b) improved infrastructure, environmental protection and site
management at the two primary project sites of Wadi Rum and Petra; and (c) growth of tourism by 75 percent at
Wadi Rum. Achievement of the second development objective would be indicated by a 100 percent increase in
tourism-related employment at Wadi Rum.
2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):

3. Benefits and target population
The project would prevent further degradation of historical and ecological sites, thus ensuring their
sustainability for future generations. Urban regeneration, including the delivery of better infrastructure, coupled
with enforcement of land use plans, would improve not only the experience for tourists but also the quality of life for
the local population at Petra (about 20,000), Wadi Rum (about 2,000), Karak (28,000) and Jerash (21,000). The
Jordanian economy in general would benefit from increased tourism earnings as well as increased employment. The
project would support income-generation opportunities for women through the establishment of the Bedouin
Women's Handicraft Center at Wadi Rum. And finally, the project would help lay the foundation for coherent
development of tourism in the Kingdom through the formulation of (a) an improved legislative and regulatory
framework to facilitate tourism flows and an increased role for the private sector; (b) a longer-term sector strategy
and priority investment program that can send the proper signals to the private sector, as well as channel donor funds
to priority investments; and (c) a more effective and efficient institutional structure that can support implementation
of the strategy.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Implementation period. The project would be implemented over a period of 63 months.
Executing agencies (see Chart I below)
* The Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MOTA) would have overall project implementation coordination
responsibility and direct executive responsibility for the Sector Development Support and the Karak and
Jerash Tourism Development Pilot Program components.
* The Petra Region Planning Council (PRC), under the guidance of MOTA, would be the implementing
agency for the Petra component, with the exception of the Petra Region access road rehabilitation projects.
* The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) would be the implementing agency for the Petra
Region access road rehabilitation projects.
* The Aqaba Region Authority (ARA) would implement the Wadi Rum component.
Project coordination. A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been established at MOTA with the mandate
for overall project management and monitoring and to serve as focal point for all communication with the Bank.
Project oversight. The Higher Council for Tourism, headed by the Prime Minister and enlarged to include
additional representatives of concerned Government agencies (Chart 1), would facilitate coordination, provide policy
guidance, and oversee implementation. The PMU would regularly submit progress reports to the Council based on
monitoring indicators.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements. Project accounts: MOTA, ARA and
MPWH would establish and maintain project accounts in formats acceptable to the Bank and have them audited each
fiscal year in accordance with Bank guidelines by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. MOTA would
ensure that all the audited project accounts are prepared in English and furnished to the Bank within six months of
the end of each fiscal year, in such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request. Special Accounts: To
facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government would open two Special Accounts in the
Central Bank, to be operated, respectively, by MOTA and ARA, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
Administrative details of the Special Accounts are included in Annex 6. The Special Accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to the
Bank for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, it was agreed
that documented administrative procedures and financial regulations denoting staffing, responsibilities, organization
chart and accounting manual for the Project accounts and Special Accounts will be implemented at project outset by
the executing agencies.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements. The Project Management Unit would be responsible for
monitoring progress against agreed-upon performance monitoring indicators specified in Annex 1. MOTA, PRC,
ARA and MPWH would furnish the PMU with detailed quarterly reports for bank review summarizing project
operations and the utilization of project funds. The standardized format for the reports would be finalized during the
Project Launch Workshop. They would cover implementation status; deviations, if any, from the Implementation
Plan; problems and constraints and corrective actions being taken; and updated disbursement and commitment
tables. The PMU would prepare a detailed mid-term report to serve as the basis for a mid-term project review,
scheduled for the last quarter of 1999. The PMU will also prepare and submit an Implementation Completion
Report to the Bank within six months of the closing date of the Bank loan.

8. Strategic choices and project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
The objective of the project is to establish a basis for environmentally sustainable tourism development that
also benefits the local population. To reach this objective the following alternatives were considered:
Multiple site v. single. In order to broaden the tourism base of the country (i.e., the number of sites that are
adequately developed for positive tourism experience), it was decided to adopt a multiple site strategy. This approach
would have the benefit of (a) spreading tourism benefits to a larger population, (b) increasing the number of attractions
in the country to encourage tourists to stay longer (and spend more), and (c) reducing the current overload on Petra and
Amman.
MOTA v. municipalities as implementing agencies. The project opted against the use of municipalities as
implementing agencies because of the very weak capacity of Jordanian municipalities, which arises primarily from
budgetary constraints (i.e., lack of revenue-generating authority). Involvement of municipalities as implementing
agencies at this stage would therefore be premature. However, the project recognizes the important role of local
entities in tourism development. To develop the capacity to play this role, initial support would be given to the
municipalities of Jerash and Karak by MOTA to carry out feasibility studies. Furthermore, the project would initiate
the process of retention by concerned local entities of all or a portion of admission fees to Wadi Rum and Petra
tourism sites. In a follow-up project, the issue of revenue base in Karak and Jerash would be addressed in order to
ensure the sustainability of tourism-related municipal investments at those sites.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
The Petra component addresses many of the issues highlighted in the Petra Sanctuary Management Plan study
prepared by UNESCO (1994-1995), primarily the urban and environmental management deficiencies in the area
surrounding the archeological sanctuary and lack of visitor management within the sanctuary. By strengthening the
project implementation and enforcement authority of the PRC, many of the other concerns are also addressed:
uncontrolled hotel construction and urban development, degradation of the sanctuary exit zone, and the lack of
additional tourism attractions to extend tourists' stay and encourage greater spending.
To date, most multilateral and donor investments have focused primarily on Petra. Investments in Petra and a
few other sites have not necessarily resulted in better management of sites, sustained maintenance, or the development
of the sector in accordance with a coherent plan that aims at developing other tourism sites. The proposed project
addresses these issues, in addition to restructuring the tourism institutional, policy and financing framework. The
Government has identified a broad framework for a longer-term tourism development strategy and associated
investment program, which would be further developed and fine-tuned under the project in consultation with the
relevant public agencies and the private sector. This would be accompanied by preparation of an appropriate policy
framework as well as a sector restructuring plan to strengthen the capacity of concerned public sector institutions and
to foster a more collaborative interface with the private sector. The strategy would be implemented in a phased
manner. The proposed project would represent the first phase and would set the foundation for subsequent projects.
A critical factor causing delays in implementation of previous projects has been weak institutional
arrangements. To ensure timely implementation of this project, the tendering of consultancy contracts with firms to
carry out design and engineering works and preparation of procurement documentation has been completed, as have
been the hiring of key personnel and the establishment of budget and operating procedures for the implementing
agencies.
Other lessons learned from past work in the sector that are incorporated into the project include: building
strong awareness and understanding of key sector issues and sector operation; planning successive operations that
build on one another; integrating tourism development with urban regeneration to help local populations benefit from
the "tourism dividend"; instituting mechanisms for effective coordination among the various agencies involved;
keeping the project flexible; ensuring that the project has realistic objectives, the achievement of which can be
measured against clear, monitorable targets; and ensuring the presence of clear budgetary mechanisms, including
allocation of local tourism revenues to implementing agencies.

11. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership
The Government recognizes that tourism is one of the country's primary engines of growth, and tourism
development is one of its highest priorities. Government economic programs and plans emphasize the importance of
investment in the sector and Government commitment to infrastructure improvements and environmental protection in
the context of tourism. Although in the past the Government invested directly in the sector, it has been gradually
retreating from this role, leaving investment in tourism-related projects to the private sector. For example, the
Government already has sold much of its interest in hotels and guest houses and lifted the monopoly of a tour bus
company. The following steps have also been taken:
* Recognizing the lack of capacity of the Petra Region municipalities, the Government has created the PRC
as an area authority with a mandate to enforce land-use plans, protect and manage the environment, and
coordinate with other Government and private sector entities.
* The Government has declared Wadi Rum a protected area with special regulations.
* MOTA has begun reviewing, modernizing, and consolidating the regulations governing tourism.
* For the sector as a whole, the Government has assigned the Higher Council for Tourism, comprised of
members of the Cabinet, to oversee project implementation, supervise implementation of tourism policy,
propose laws and regulations, approve the establishment of training centers and set up programs and
institutions for their operation, and establish licensing.
* As a major step toward ensuring proper coordination among MOTA, ARA, NGOs, the private sector and
the local population in the development of Wadi Rum, the Government has established a Steering
Committee with a clear oversight mandate.

12. Value added of Bank support
Value added of the Bank's participation in the Project comes through at least five contributions to its design
and implementation:
(a) The Bank is working with the Government through several related projects to promote opportunities for
the private sector (e.g., the Economic Reform and Development, Export Development, and Private Sector
Assessment projects). Therefore, the design of this project was done is such a way as to ensure overall
coordination with the policies and initiatives adopted in the ongoing projects and also to achieve
synergies wherever possible.
(b) The Bank's 15-year experience with Jordanian housing and urban development agencies under six urban
and municipal projects will help to ensure smooth implementation of the urban components of this Project
(particularly for the Petra, Karak and Jerash components).
(c) The Bank has extensive worldwide experience implementing projects in environmentally sensitive areas,
and this comparative advantage is reflected in the selection of project investments and safeguards for the
Petra and Wadi Rum areas. The Dana Wildlands Project in Jordan has provided a particularly useful
model.
(d) The project involves entities at the local, regional, and national level. The Bank is accustomed to working
across geographical, legislative, and regulatory boundaries under a single project framework, and thus can
design components and implementation strategies to help ensure the achievement of project objectives.
(e) The Bank has led the coordination among the Government and donors (USAID, JICA, and others)
working in the tourism sector, helping to ensure that resources used are consistent with a well-defined
strategy and related national policies.

As the second largest source of foreign exchange, tourism is vitally important to Jordan's economy. This
Project's primary objective is to provide the framework for a sustainable and environmentally sound expansion of
tourism in four of Jordan's most important tourist destinations. Benefits of the project include an unquantifiable
increase in tourism-based income and employment, enhanced environmental conditions, cultural and historical
preservation, and increased safety and attractiveness of public facilities related to major tourist destinations in the
Kingdom. The project cannot be directly linked to a specific increase in tourism over the medium term, and therefore
a cost-effectiveness methodology is used to justify project investments. Each project investment is examined in terms
of its appropriateness in the overall tourism strategy for the country, the effect of the investment on the individual
sites, and criteria for public sector investment. The two road rehabilitation subcomponents were evaluated using cost
benefit analysis and found to have economic rates of return between 16 and 17 percent. There are no major project
risks; moderate risks fall into three categories: (a) political stability in the region; (b) those concerning the
implementation capacity of Government authorities placed in charge of project components; and (c) lack of sustained
financing to maintain rehabilitated or new infrastructure. A detailed economic analysis is provided as Annex 4.
Fiscal impact. The Government will provide about US$12 million in counterpart funds under the project,
which is less than one percent of the country's total annual investment budget expenditures and should not pose any
fiscal constraint. There will be a slight increase in recurrent Government expenditures from the staffing and operation
of the PRC, but this entity is relatively small and will rely on short-term consultants to the extent possible. Increased
operations and maintenance costs resulting from new or rehabilitated infrastructure under the project are estimated at
about US$1.3 million per year including PRC, Wadi Rum Administration Unit, and site management operating costs
(see Annex 5 for additional details).
14. Financial assessment
IBRD and the Government would fully finance project investments. The Government's share of total costs
would not exceed US$3.6 million in any one year, easily accommodated within its annual capital investment budget of
about US$300 million. Financial sustainability was assured during negotiations, when the Government confirmed that
revenue from entrance fees at the individual sites will be allocated for operation and maintenance expenditures of the
sites. Funding for operations and maintenance has been secured through a Cabinet decision to retain 25 percent of
the admission fees for Petra (Cabinet Decision of May 31, 1997) and 100 percent of the admission fees for Wadi
Rum, in accordance with ARA Law No. 7 of 1987.

15. Technical assessment
The project is technically sound.  Extensive feasibility studies (engineering, environmental, and social
analysis) were performed during project preparation, from which project subcomponents were chosen. For each
project subcomponent, the recommendations were reviewed against appropriate standards, and costs were estimated
based on costs for similar infrastructure projects in the region. Preparation of the Petra Sanctuary subcomponent will
be completed during project implementation due to its late inclusion in the project. Initial preparation had been
performed under the USAID-funded JSTD/Sites project, and after that project was canceled, the component was
included under the proposed project. Additional review of the recommended tasks under the subcomponent will take
place prior to its implementation.

16. Institutional assessment
a. Executing agencies
Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MOTA). MOTA is the main governmental entity involved in the
tourism industry. Its mandate is to develop tourism by preserving and developing tourist sites; licensing and
classification of tourist professions; setting prices for services in the sector; marketing and promotion, encouraging
tourism investment; providing human resources and technical capabilities to raise standards of performance; and
preparing studies and specialized research for the development and growth of tourism. Because of the nature of the
sector, coordination with other ministries and local municipalities is vital to enable MOTA to influence the actions of
concerned line ministries, municipalities, and area authorities in areas related to tourism.



10                                                                              Jordan - Second Tourism Development Project
Petra Region Planning Council. The PRC is a new entity. The PRC was established by the Council of
Ministers on March 28, 1995 in response to the increasing need for control of urban growth in the Petra Region.
Created pursuant to the Law of Town Village and Building Planning (Law No. 79, 1966, as amended by Law No. 16,
1975), the PRC is empowered to prepare, approve, and enforce land-use plans within the area under its authority. Its
authority replaces that previously vested in the municipalities.
The PRC will be organized into four main units: (a) a Project Implementation Unit, responsible for executing
government and donor-financed projects; (b) a Tourism Development Unit, which would focus on developing tourism
products to create additional attractions, support initiatives in training services for tourism personnel, help market
Petra, and work closely with staff of the Department of Antiquities and tourism police; (c) a Development Control and
Planning Unit, responsible for all land-use planning, its enforcement, zoning, licensing, and the issuance of building
permits; and (d) an Environmental Management Unit, responsible for watershed management, including reforestation
and flood control, solid waste management, and urban landscaping.
Until the PRC has an independent budget ratified by the Cabinet, its budgets for recurrent expenditures and
capital investments for municipal and environmental projects will be given as separate line items in the MOTA budget,
and approval of all capital investment-related transactions will rest with MOTA.
Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH). The MPWH has established project implementation
capacity and procedures. It is responsible for the construction and maintenance of the main, secondary, and
rural/village road networks.
Aqaba Region  Authority  (ARA).   ARA  has established  urban  development control and  project
implementation capacity and procedures. It is assigned general governing responsibility for the Aqaba Region,
comprising approximately one-tenth of Jordan's land area including Jordan's Gulf of Aqaba. Through its Town
Planning and Regional Planning departments, the ARA takes the lead in commissioning or drafting the plans for new
neighborhood development and urban renewal projects as well as for industrial zones, road siting, and hotel and
residential development.
b. Project management
MOTA has limited experience in project management. Therefore, in addition to the Project Manager already
on board, the PMU will be staffed with an engineer, a systems analyst, a statistics analyst, a procurement specialist,
and an accountant, all of whom  will be recruited on  performance-based contracts.  Given the number of
implementing agencies involved in the project and the fact that PRC is a new entity with limited capacity, start-up
delays are a risk. To guard against it, the Government agreed that consulting firms would be contracted to prepare the
design and engineering and later carry out supervision for all projects of the Petra and Wadi Rum components. To
ensure clear definition of tasks, timetables, responsibilities, and expected outputs and outcomes, terms of reference for
key staff and detailed implementation plans, together with performance monitoring indicators, have been prepared
............................ ..........................................................................I.................................... ..................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment
In designing the project, a key focus was integrating tourism development with urban regeneration to ensure
that local population benefits from increased tourism and tourism-related investments. Moreover, the project has
strongly emphasized retaining and supporting the local lifestyle at project sites to ensure social sustainability as well as
to use the local culture as a tourism attraction. To this end, the project incorporates several aspects to retain and
support the local lifestyle at project sites. For example, in Wadi Rum, the local population requested and participated
directly in the design of the new village to allow use of the old village for tourism-related commercial activities, such
as a women's handicraft production, bed-and-breakfast facilities, etc. In Petra, the project would support construction
of a new "souq" to strengthen the businesses of local vendors. Also in the Petra Region, there has been extensive
consultation on land-use plans to ensure orderly urban development while protecting the environment.

18. Environmental assessment                        Environmental category        B
Environmental threats to the Petra Sanctuary have increased with the number of visitors to the site and are
exacerbated by lack of visitor management, interpretive materials, signage, and marked trails. Vendor activities
degrade both the visual impact of the sanctuary and the red stone of the monuments. The Petra Sanctuary sub-
component will directly address these deficiencies. In addition, uncontrolled development in the region poses
significant a threat to the surrounding of the Petra archeological site. Moreover, the surrounding environment is
threatened by extensive hotel development, which often disregards needed infrastructure and environment services.



Jordan - Second Tourism Development Project                                                                    11
Sewage and solid waste are already problematic and utility and municipal budgets are inadequate to address the
problems. All these problems are compounded by the lack of an adequate framework for environmental protection and
management.
The project would address these concerns and have a positive impact on the region's environment through the
development of environmental management and land-use plans, landscape improvements, strengthened site
management, and capacity building of the PRC. Environmental analyses have been prepared for each of the
infrastructure-related tasks.
The increasing popularity of Wadi Rum and the growth of Wadi Rum Village have resulted in adverse impacts
to the environment. Major environmentally related concerns include the prevalence of off-road driving, lack of
protection of ecological and archaeological sites, graffiti, heavy littering, uncontrolled growth of Rum Village beyond
legal boundaries, uncontrolled and indiscriminate hunting, damage from quarrying operations, and destruction of
natural vegetation from overgrazing. The proposed project addresses these issues through its tourism and protected
area management plan subcomponents. Other subcomponents that may have an impact on the local environment are
the development of a new settlement and construction of a new tourist access road and visitor center. Environmental
analyses were performed in the preparation of these subcomponents, possible environmental impacts identified, and
mitigation measures built into the design of the components. A mitigation action plan was also prepared for the
implementation of these components.
The proposed project is expected to have an overall positive environmental impact. Project components
include category C and B components.  The category B components would support enhancement of current
infrastructure in Petra, Wadi Rum, Jerash and Karak. The project's proposed plans for these components have been
subject to an environmental analysis, including mitigation measures where necessary, consistent with OD 4.01.
During the project, development of the infrastructure components (detailed engineering) would include all the findings
of the environmental analysis.

Preparation of the project has involved extensive and broad-based participation by representatives of national and
local governments, local populations, the private sector, and NGOs.
With respect to improvements to the Petra Visitor Center, the task team has and will continue to consult with
UNESCO to ensure that the final design is commensurate with the importance of the site. A working group to advise
on the design of the visitor center has been established with representatives from UNESCO, the Petra National Trust,
and other concerned NGOs. Consultations have been carried out with stakeholders with respect to the Petra Sanctuary
component, and during project implementation ongoing consultations are planned.
For the Wadi Rum component, Government officials and stakeholders agree that local involvement and
collaboration is key to successful implementation. Hence the institutional framework and the project implementation
mechanisms have been specifically devised to ensure local participation not only in the design but also the
implementation of the project.

20. Sustainability
Six aspects of the project would help promote sustainability:
(a) The multiple-site approach (described in paragraph 8) would increase beneficiary ownership by involving
local municipalities and populations.
(b) There would be a rigorous screening and appraisal of subprojects to be financed under the Karak and
Jerash Tourism Development Pilot Program to ensure that they are viable, will deliver the expected
benefits to the sector at least cost, and can be maintained at reasonable expense.
(c) During negotiations, it was confirmed that adequate funding for operations and maintenance has been
secured through a Cabinet decision to retain 25 percent of the admission fees for Petra and 100
percent of the admission fees for Wadi Rum, in accordance with ARA Law No. 7 of 1987.
(d) During negotiations, it was agreed that the sector's long-term strategy, institutional restructuring and
regulatory reform programs will receive Cabinet approval by September 1999.
(e) The project's monitoring and supervision program (including baseline and follow-up surveys and the
mid-term review provisions) will help to identify and respond to problems of sustainability at an early
stage when corrective action can still be taken.
(f)  Finally, the project would build institutional capacity for sustainability through: (i) its support of targeted
training and technical assistance to the PRC; (ii) the provision of funds for recruiting experienced
individuals on performance-based contracts to staff the MOTA-PMU and train MOTA staff how to
identify and implement appropriate projects for the sector; and (iii) its support of targeted training and
technical assistance to build technical and environmental protection capacity in the Wadi Rum
Administrative Unit of the ARA.

22. Possible controversial aspects
Possible controversial aspects of the proposed project are as follows:
Social
Petra: Wadi Musa land-use rezoning. A land-use plan study to ensure well-conceived and environmentally
sound development of the Petra Region was launched in February 1996, and the resulting land-use plans for the three
main urban areas of the Petra Region are expected to be approved by the PRC by October 31 and December 31, 1997
after completion of the required public consultation. They include the rezoning of selected environmentally sensitive
urban areas as protected areas, thereby constraining the development plans of the owners. Given local sensitivity
regarding land-use rights in Wadi Musa, particularly on the hill opposite the Movenpick hotel (Dara area), it was
agreed during negotiations that the Government will pursue the protection of the Dara area through changes in zoning
and special building regulations. The special regulations will preclude any residential construction and will provide
incentives to landowners to develop the area exclusively for light tourism activities and recreation in the form of a
traditional vernacular village, single story, flat-roofed, constructed in local stones with an overall ceiling of 25
percent for built-up areas.
Petra: vendor operations within the sanctuary. The sanctuary management component of the project may
result in the clustering of vending activities within the Petra Sanctuary in order to better serve the needs of tourists
while improving the marketing of handicrafts. Additional and ongoing social surveys and stakeholder discussions will
be held during the course of the project before any scheme to cluster the vendors is implemented.
Wadi Rum: new settlement. The largest part of the Wadi Rum component is to refurbish structures and
improve basic infrastructure within the existing village, and to provide alternative nearby (about three km) housing and
other facilities to accommodate fiiture growth and the needs of residents who want to undertake commercially related
activities within the existing village. Households taking advantage of the Government's offer for an additional house
would still retain ownership of their home in the traditional village. The risk of residents' not respecting agreed
building and growth controls has been mitigated through discussions with village inhabitants and agreement that
current residents of Rum village, should they desire it, will be given serviced plots at no charge within the new village
site.
Ecological
Wadi Rum: provision of a new settlement. The site for the development of a new settlement at Wadi Rum was
chosen on environmental and sociological grounds. In terms of the environmental impact of the site, it is an area
unaffected by flash floods, and design for surface water drainage and sewerage will take into consideration the risks of
erosion and the need to recharge the aquifer. In addition, no unique species or habitats for flora and fauna were
identified at the site, and the loss of grazing area is insignificant. Visual impact will be taken into consideration by
strict design guidelines for the village.
Wadi Rum: construction of a new tourist access road. The new access road will allow entrance of a larger
number of tourists without damaging the site and would enable tourists to experience pristine and dramatic desert
scenery on first entering the site. The environmental impact of the visitor access road will be minimal. The road will
be designed to be as narrow as possible (within safety standards) and follow existing ground contours, with the surface
at the existing ground level throughout. There will be no lighting or other infrastructure services along the road, and
the surface and edging will be designed to provide a natural appearance through the use of local red-colored surface
chippings and local stone edges. Routing avoids flash flood areas, and design will allow for surface water drainage to
avoid erosion and recharge of the aquifer. Ongoing consultations with NGOs active in Wadi Rum may result in new
points of discussion.
Governance
Competing levels of government (ARA/MOTA). As discussed elsewhere, MOTA is charged with formulating
tourism policies and overseeing tourism development, but major tourism sites are run by regional authorities and
municipalities. In terms of project implementation, there may be conflicts between the various executing agencies.
For implementation of the Wadi Rum component, the risk of conflicts of authority has been mitigated through the
Steering Committee for Wadi Rum, which was established by the Prime Minister, and through clear implementation
arrangements and responsibilities.

Competing levels of government (municipalities/PRC). The PRC, created pursuant to the Law of Town Village
and Building Planning, is empowered to prepare, approve, and enforce land-use plans within the area under its
authority. Its authority replaces that previously vested in the municipalities. There is a risk that municipalities will
resent the authority transferred to the PRC (which reports to MOTA); however, it is expected that the recent inclusion
(December 1996) of representatives from the municipal governments on the Board of the PRC will encourage the full
consideration of municipal concerns in PRC decision-making. The PRC is an evolving entity, and lessons learned
during the course of this project will be taken into consideration in any actions to further strengthen the PRC during
future projects.
Tourism sector: institutional restructuring and regulatory reform programs. The Sector Development
Component will focus on improving the sector's strategic, legislative/regulatory, and institutional frameworks through
the carrying out of three studies. In order for this component to be effective, however, the Government has to be
committed to developing and adopting the recommended reforms. The risk of this not being the case is relatively low,
and will be mitigated by agreement on the part of the Government to approve the reform proposals by September 1999
and to implement them by the end of the project.
Management Capacity
Implementation capacity of the implementing agencies. This risk of inadequate implementation capacity is
considered modest, and has been mitigated through the requirement to finalize certain steps toward implementation
prior to negotiations (i.e., finalization of tendering for detailed engineering and supervision contracts and completion
of detailed studies for first-year projects) and by hiring key staff members of the PMU and PRC.
Overall Degree of Potential Controversy
The overall degree of potential controversy as described above is moderate. This rating is based on the rating
assigned to individual factor headings, which are summarized in the table below. The degree of potential controversy
is rated on a five-point scale -ranging from high (5) to low (1).

Jordan: Second Tourism Development Project
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Total cost: US$27.4 million
Petra Region Infrastructure Development and Environmental Management
Introduction
1.    Petra is the most spectacular of Jordan's national treasures and one of its two UNESCO World
Heritage Sites, the other being Qasr Amra, recognized for its 7th century mosaics. Petra was the home of
the Nabateans, an industrious people who settled in the area over 2,000 years ago and carved out their
capital from the soft red sandstone of the area. The only entrance to the city was a narrow gorge (the
Siq) which afforded its residents a high degree of security. From this hidden city, the Nabateans
dominated the trade routes, levying tolls and sheltering caravans. The city, reflecting the architectural
styles of the Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, during its heyday was known for its refined culture,
massive architecture, and ingenious complex of dams and water channels. At its peak, Petra is thought to
have housed some 20,000 to 30,000 people. The city declined following an earthquake in 363 AD and a
shift in trade routes and was all but forgotten to the outside world for almost 300 years, from the 16th to
the 19th centuries. The Bedouin tribes of the area guarded it as their treasure from outsiders. Petra was
rediscovered by the outside world when a Swiss explorer, hearing of the city, was able to persuade a
Bedouin to guide him there in 1812. The residents of the area today belong to two major tribal groups:
the Layatne, who live in Wadi Musa and Taybeh; and the Amarine, who reside in Um Seyhun.
2.     Petra today faces a host of problems that, if not immediately addressed, will significantly
diminish the tourism experience and further exacerbate the adverse results of the uncontrolled growth of
Wadi Musa, the town at the entrance to Petra. The major problems in the Petra Region are: (a) pressure
on the monuments caused by lack of a visitor management plan; (b) uncontrolled urban growth; and (c)
lack of urban infrastructure.
3.    For most tourists visiting Jordan, Petra is the premier attraction. Due to its status as a World
Heritage Site and facilitated by the peace process, continued growth in visitor numbers to Petra can be
expected. It is therefore of crucial importance that (a) the site is preserved; (b) the experience of tourists
visiting the site is enhanced; and (c) the national and local economic benefits from tourism are
maximized.
4.    Pressure on the monuments and lack of a visitor management plan. The number of tourists
visiting Petra increased almost 70 percent in 1995 over the 1994 level, with a substantial number being
day visitors arriving in coaches from Israel. The rapid influx of tourists is severely taxing the capacity of
the site. All visitors enter Petra at the Siq, the narrow gorge leading to the sanctuary. Uncontrolled
visitor movement continues through the Siq to the Treasury, the first major monument of the sanctuary
and where severe visitor "bunching" occurs. After the Treasury, visitors tend to wander undirected
throughout the sanctuary - there is little access control and no signage to direct the visitor. The ultimate
result is monuments damaged by litter, graffiti, and erosion caused by inappropriate wear and tear.
5.    There are at least eight different organizations operating at the Petra Sanctuary, sometimes with
overlapping responsibilities: The DOA, the Tourism Office, Tourist Police, Desert Police, Civic Police,
Ministry of Health, a maintenance contractor, and the Governor's Office. Each has its own direct line of
authority from Amman. In addition, there is no uniform set of rules for the site, no regulations or
management policies or principles derived from a statement of the site's significance, and no guiding
mission for site managers. Approximately 100 people are employed in site protection and management
through the various organizations present at Petra, yet there is little coordination among the organizations



Annex 2
Page 2 of 21
and little authority accorded to managers. These deficiencies have resulted in inadequate archaeological
site protection and a visitor satisfaction rate that is much lower than might be reasonably expected of a
site with Petra's beauty and significance.
6.    Uncontrolled urban growth. Several new hotels are under construction. Total bed capacity had
quadrupled by end-1996, from 500 beds in 1994. Urban development is following suit. In the absence
of an updated land-use plan, the areas surrounding the sanctuary have grown in an unsightly and
uncontrolled manner, with significant adverse environmental impacts. As a quick reaction to the
unplanned construction boom, the local government has placed a ban on issuing building permits.
Although this has resulted in significant opposition from landowners and speculators, the Government is
taking a firm stand. It has asked the Bank to help prepare a land-use plan that would ensure well-
conceived and environmentally sound development of the Petra area and priority investments. The work
was launched in February 1996 under a Japan PHIRD grant and was completed in December 1996. The
land-use plans for the three main urban areas of the Petra Region are expected to be approved by the
Petra Region Planning Council (PRC) by October 31, 1997 after completion of the required consultation
with the public.
7.    Inadequate infrastructure. Hotel expansion and accompanying urban development in the towns
of Wadi Musa and Taybeh are putting pressure on existing infrastructure, which is already limited in
capacity and of low quality. The major infrastructure issues are water and wastewater services,
environmental degradation, traffic flows and road conditions, and the clear absence of any integration
between the town and the tourism activities at the Sanctuary. At present, there is no wastewater system
in the town, and a number of cesspits discharge directly into the wadis. Drinking water supply is
intermittent, and even then, hotels get priority over households. Unaccounted-for water is estimated at
around 50 percent. Environmental neglect and degradation have significantly affected the natural
landscape - there are periodic floods, loss of vegetation, and visual intrusion. Road conditions
throughout the town are poor, especially the spine road, which is congested through the town center as a
result of indiscriminate parking, absence of sidewalks, general clutter, and conflicting activities. The
access roads to Wadi Musa are generally not of an acceptable safety standard.
Subcomponents
8.    To address the above problems, the proposed project would concentrate on five areas: (a)
rehabilitating and improving two main access roads to the Petra Region; (b) developing and improving
urban infrastructure in the main urban areas; (c) improving visitor support infrastructure and services
at the Petra sanctuary (improving visitor flow patterns, developing proper signage and interpretation,
formalizing adhoc trails and parks through the sanctuary), and developing site management capacity;
(d) improving environmental management (reforestation, wadi terraces regeneration, flood protection,
solid waste management); and (e) building the capacity of the PRC to enforce controlled development
and environmental protection, implement urban development projects, and promote tourism. The
following is a description of the components to be funded under the project.
A.    Road rehabilitation and improvement
9.    The proposed investments for roads under the project would focus on improving the level of
service in the area, including traffic safety on two existing key access roads to the Petra Region,
specifically (a) the access road to Wadi Musa from the desert highway through Uzainah and Shobak (53
km); and (b) the scenic road from Wadi Musa to Little Petra (Baida) through Um Seyhun (7.5 km). For
these proposed road improvement projects, works would be related to increased road safety and the
construction of scenic viewpoints. The road improvements would be implemented within the existing



Annex 2
Page 3 of 21
right of ways and would not include significant widening which could have a negative impact on the
environment. In addition to initial design financed by the Government, the project would finance
additional detailed engineering studies and construction supervision services for these road projects.
B.    Urban iaifdastucture deveomet
10.   This subcomponent would support the implementation of urban infrastructure development and
improvement in the three main Petra Region urban areas: Wadi Musa, Taybeh and Um Seyhun.
11.    Wadi Musa urban infrastructure development. The proposed urban infrastructure investments in
Wadi Musa would focus on rehabilitating the existing key urban roads, including lighting, along with
enhancement works in Wadi Musa town center and the Tourist Park zone. Specifically, under this
subcomponent the following works would be implemented: (a) improvement of the Wadi Musa spine
road from the urban boundaries through the town center to the Tourist Park zone; (b) enhancement of the
Wadi Musa town center, where traffic would be diverted and streets upgraded and landscaped, and where
the adjacent abandoned traditional village houses (Elge old village) would be rehabilitated to attract
tourists for sightseeing and shopping; (c) development of the street layout of the Wadi Musa tourist
arrival area (Tourist Park zone, including the Promenade); (d) improvements to selected lengths of minor
urban collector roads in Wadi Musa to provide enhanced circulation patterns, thereby providing bypasses
around tourist and environmentally sensitive locations and reducing congestion; (e) improvement of
street lighting and street landscaping (including civic works, urban furniture and signing) with the
potential to benefit both tourists and the local economy; and (f) improvement of traffic management and
parking at points of visitor arrival and departure, including the Wadi Musa tourist area and town center.
12.   Tavbeh urban infrastructure development. The proposed urban infrastructure investments in
Taybeh would focus on rehabilitating the Taybeh town spine road (4 km) and improving street lighting
and street landscaping.
13.   Um Sevhun urban infrastructure development. The proposed urban infrastructure investments in
Um Seyhun would focus on rehabilitating the main spine road in Um Seyhun; improvement of traffic
management and parking at points of visitor arrival and departure, including the Sanctuary exit zone, and
development of a new coach parking/interchange area, and improving street lighting and landscaping,
civic works, urban furniture and signage.
14.   The project would finance detailed design engineering and construction supervision services for
the infrastructure development and improvement projects outlined above.
15.   The Second Tourism Development project does not address water and wastewater deficiencies in
the region. These infrastructure requirements are being addressed through an ongoing water supply,
wastewater collection and treatment project financed by USAID, France and Germany. Work on this
project would occur concurrently with the infrastructure development subcomponents of the Petra
component. Because the water and wastewater pipes would be laid within the right of way of the urban
road network, there would have to be a high degree of coordination between the two projects.
C      Visitor facilities and management at the Petra Sanctuar
16.   The objective of this subproject is to improve visitor support services at the Petra Sanctuary by:
(a) addressing the needs of tourists through the improvement of visitor flow patterns, the existing visitor
center, and rest and shopping areas; (b) enhancing the Sanctuary through the creation of paths and/or
trails and appropriate landscaping, including indigenous vegetation; and (c) improving tourism



Annex 2
Page 4 of 21
management through improvements in the presentation of the site through proper signage, explanatory
panels identifying monuments, and training for site management and guides.
17.    Visitor center and site entrance area. The project would support the design and implementation
of the redevelopment of the visitor center and the site entrance area. USAID, as part of the recently
canceled (for reasons unrelated to the project) Jordan Sustainable Tourism Development/Sites
(JSTD/Sites) project, has completed initial work in the form of drawings, reports and contract documents
for the visitor center, shopping and rest areas. The JSTD/Sites project proposed to remodel, but not
expand, the visitor center. The proposed project would support the establishment of a committee, with
membership from MOTA, UNESCO, and the Bank, to review the current design with respect to the
expected increase in visitors and determine whether to proceed with the proposed design or to expand the
center. In the event the latter is recommended, the project would support a competition for which the
terms of reference and evaluation criteria would be prepared by Jordanian officials and advisors from
UNESCO. The design of the shopping arcade and rest area would be linked to the decision regarding the
design of the visitor center.
18.   Sanctuarv enhancement. The proposed project would improve visitor support services by
improving visitor flow patterns, designing appropriate signage, formalizing the adhoc trails that lace the
Sanctuary and creating new paths and/or trails where appropriate, and providing soft landscaping with
plants and shrubs indigenous to the Sanctuary. Lack of information about the site is a major cause of
tourist dissatisfaction with the site - it is a major cause of visitor "bunching" at the Treasury and of lack
of visitor awareness of most of the other monuments within the Sanctuary. Undirected wandering results
in monuments being damaged by litter, graffiti, and erosion caused by inappropriate wear and tear. The
proposed project would fund the development of (a) a basic tour of the sanctuary, (b) trails through and
to the more remote monuments, and (c) interpretive material at the visitor center and along the
established routes to highlight the monuments.
19.   Site and visitor management. The proposed project would develop a visitor management plan
that would, within the limits of the site's carrying capacity, improve presentation of the site through
development of a visitor management plan and provision of training for site management staff and
guides. The visitor management plan would coordinate the development and presentation of information
about the site, visitor circulation plans, and site control and management. Technical assistance for the
above would be funded, as would the development of training materials for site management staff and
guides.
20.   The project would also fund site preparation and implementation services (detailed engineering
and supervision).
D.    Evironmealmanwgment
21.   In tandem with infrastructure development, investments would be made for environmental
protection and management in the Petra Region. These would include:
22.    Watershed management: Reforestation and wadi terraces regeneration. The proposed project
would include the creation of a vegetation belt area at Um Seyhun village, the reforestation of the upper
watershed along the scenic road, the development of a management plan for the Hisha Forest and the
implementation of a forest conservation pilot project the Wadi Musa area. In addition, the project would
support the regeneration of the wadi terraces and the design and implementation of landscape
improvements within dedicated areas of Wadi Musa and Wadi Sadr. This would include planting,
walkways, existing pathway and pedestrian access improvements; irrigation system upgrading; graphical,



Annex 2
Page 5 of 21
informational, and directional signage; and terrace wall and embankment repair. The investments would
respect local cultural values and complement traditional agricultural practices. The design would be
based on the recommendations, facilities, improvements, and configurations as contained in the Wadi
Valleys Master Plan (previously approved). The Ministry of Agriculture (Department of Reforestation)
would be associated with the design and implementation of these projects.
23.    Watershed management: Flood control and protection. Under this component, (a) embankments
would be protected; (b) obstructions in the Wadi beds removed; (c) soil erosion control measures taken;
and (d) bottlenecks, especially in the area approximately I km upstream of the Siq entrance, removed. In
addition, the project would fund technical assistance for a comprehensive study of flooding in the area
and the design of an appropriate flood protection system.
24.   Solid waste management.  The project would support monitoring of solid waste services
contracted out to a private operator. The PRC would supervise the management contract on behalf of the
municipalities of the project area. The private operator would be required to undertake: (a) the collection
of all solid wastes from the towns and rural settlements of the Petra Region; (b) street and market
cleaning for the principal towns of the Petra Region; (c) emergency cleaning and the removal of
unauthorized waste; (d) emptying of cesspools and septic tanks; (e) transportation of all refuse and waste
to the Ma'an regional landfill or other designated point of disposal. The concessionaire would be asked
to provide and manage the labor to operate the system and to maintain records on the volume of waste
collection and disposal. The project would also support supplementary solid waste management
activities such as the design and installation of additional garbage bins in tourist areas and the Wadi
Musa town center and a public awareness campaign.
E.    Develonig capacity of the Petra Region Planning Council (PRC)
25.   The PRC was established by the Council of Ministers in April 1995 in response to the increasing
need for control of urban growth in the Petra Region. Created pursuant to the Law of Town Village and
Building Planning (Law No. 79, 1966, as amended by Law No. 16, 1975), the PRC is empowered to
prepare, approve, and enforce land-use plans within the area under its authority. Its authority replaces
that previously vested in the municipalities. It is also empowered to implement development projects. It
is essential that the PRC be rapidly strengthened so that it can fulfill its mandate effectively. The area is
booming - recent hotel investments amount to US$70-80 million, tourism flows have more than doubled,
and, as proposed under the project, an investment program of several tens of millions of US dollars is to
be implemented - and the presence of a strong entity is vital. However, the PRC is not fully functional
and is currently unable to perform these tasks.
26.   A Board of Directors has been established to oversee the operations of the PRC. It is chaired by
the Minister of Tourism and Antiquities and includes the Secretaries General of the Ministry of
Municipal and Rural Affairs and Tourism and Antiquities, the Director of the Environmental Department
of the General Corporation for Environmental Protection, the Director of the Department of Antiquities,
the Secretary General for Roads, the Governor of Wadi Musa District, representatives of the Ministry of
Planning and the Petra National Trust, the Mayor of Wadi Musa, and two specialists appointed by the
Minister of Tourism.
27.   Technical assistance will be provided to the PRC to build the technical, management, and
implementation capacity necessary to carry out its mandate, including the effective implementation of
the proposed project. The PRC would be headed by a General Manager, assisted by directors of four
units: (a) a Development Control and Planning Unit, which would be responsible for all land-use
planning, its enforcement, zoning, licensing, and the issuance of building permits; (b) a Project



Annex 2
Page 6 of 21
Implementation Unit, which would be responsible for executing government and donor-financed
projects;  (c) an Environmental Management Unit, which would be responsible for watershed
management, including reforestation and flood control, solid waste management, and urban landscaping;
and (d) a Tourism Promotion Unit, which would focus on developing tourism products to create
additional attractions to enhance visitors' experience and motivate them to stay longer at Petra, support
initiatives in training services for tourism personnel, help promote Petra, and work closely with staff of
the Department of Antiquities and tourism police.
28.   The land-use plans for the Wadi Musa, Taybeh, Um Seyhun, and the Scenic Road to Taybeh
provide the basis for the work of the Development Control and Planning Unit. During the early project
implementation period, technical assistance would be provided to the planning unit to set up an
appropriate operating system, ensure that the implementation skills are effective, help further develop the
recently developed urban growth management tools, and help ensure satisfactory enforcement of the
land-use plans. The PRC unit would ensure proper protection of the following declared protected areas:
(a) new zoning regulations for the hill facing the Movenpick Hotel (Wadi Musa Dara area) would
preclude any residential construction and restrict development in this area exclusively to light tourism
activities and recreation in the form of a traditional vernacular village, single story, flat-roofed,
constructed in local stones with an overall ceiling of 25 percent regarding built-up areas; (b) all
existing wadis terraces in agricultural or garden use would be retained as open space and regenerated
with an appropriate watering system and replanted trees with the support of the project; (c) the Wadi
Musa-Taybeh scenic road, along which development would be allowed only in authorized zones within
the limits of the special building regulations approved by the PRC; and (d) the Wadi Musa-Um Seyhun
scenic road, along which development would not be allowed. With respect to Um Seyhun, which is
within the boundaries of the Petra National Park, any further growth would be proscribed.
29.   The Development Control and Planning Unit of the PRC would be responsible for the following
activities: (a) monitoring and managing the implementation of development in accordance with the land-
use plans and development controls and guidelines for Wadi Musa, Taybeh, Um Seyhun and other
existing villages; (b) assisting all applicants and assessing all applications for development within the
Petra Region and making recommendations to the PRC Board; (c) monitoring all new construction in the
Petra Region to ensure that planning permission has been granted and that actual development
corresponds with permissions; and (d) reviewing any necessary adjustments to the land-use plans when
exceptional circumstances occur and making recommendations to the PRC Board.
30.   To ensure implementation effectiveness, project supervision would be contracted out to
consultants, and specific training would be provided to the staff at the PRC Project Implementation Unit
in project management and monitoring. The project would also provide cars, computers, office
equipment and specialized software.
31.   The proposed project would support the creation and institutional strengthening of the PRC
Environmental Unit. The Unit's mandate would be to manage environment-related programs in the Petra
Region, including the main urban areas of Wadi Musa, Um Seyhun, Taybeh, Rajef, Baida, Al Hay and
Dalagha. The primary activities of the Unit would include: (a) participation in the development of
zoning and land-use plans for the Petra Region; (b) full implementation of environmental impact
assessment procedures for major development proposals; (c) solid waste management measures,
including development of inspection/enforcement procedures, and participation in the performance
review of private sector contracts for solid waste collection and disposal; (d) industrial pollution
prevention measures; (e) sewage management measures; (f) contract oversight for the removal of
construction debris, domestic garbage and discarded appliances and car parts from wadis and open
spaces; (i) participation in the planning and review of erosion and flood control measures to ensure that



Annex 2
Page 7 of 21
valued agricultural lands and vulnerable natural habitats are not damaged by new construction projects;
() development and implementation of guidelines for landscaping, agriculture, and soil erosion control
(in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture); (ix) regulation of livestock grazing in ecologically
sensitive areas; and (x) public education and awareness-building through classroom education, contact
with the local media, and coordination with NGOs efforts to promote environmental awareness. Initial
support for the unit would be recruited from the Royal Society for Conservation of Nature (RSCN).
32.    The Tourism Promotion Unit of the PRC would be responsible for the promotion of investment
in the tourism sector in the Petra Region and would act as a catalyst for private-sector investment. This
would involve (a) identification of tourism investment opportunities; (b) preparation of marketing and
feasibility studies; (c) coordination with Petra National Park management with respect to Park activities
and special events; (d) coordination with tourism professionals in the region to develop additional
attractions; (e) support for initiatives in training services for tourism personnel; and (f) provision a forum
for public/private sector interaction in the sector. Local and foreign experts with demonstrated creativity
and energy would be employed to direct this highly innovative undertaking.

Wadi Rum Development and Environmental Conservation
Itroducon
I.    Wadi Rum is one of Jordan's premier nature reserves and a site that will become a major
attraction for eco-tourism and a source of significant tourism revenue. Its unspoiled beauty and
tranquillity rank it among the world's best desert parks, and it is also an important preserve for the
region's desert biodiversity. It is a spectacular desert tourist destination of ecological (there are many
large desert mammals, as there are in the Dana Reserve), archaeological (prehistoric and Nabatean sites),
and historical importance. The massive sandstone crags and gorges, interspersed with rolling sand dunes
are the home of the Howeitat Bedouin, with whom T.E. Lawrence lived, and from where he attacked
Aqaba. Although only an hour by road from the town of Aqaba, the site was relatively unknown by
tourists until the late 1980s, when publication of a rock climber's guide was enough to attract the
attention of masses of tourists visiting Aqaba beaches. Uncontrolled mass tourism (500-1,000 people
each day during peak season), and associated unplanned urban developments, now constitute the major
threats to the site's ecological and aesthetic integrity. Increasing visitor use of Wadi Rum, if unmanaged,
will exacerbate the damage to the ecology and archaeology of the site.
2.    To date, there has been little focus on developing tourism at Wadi Rum while preserving it
environmentally. The result is an increasing problem with litter, archaeological sites damaged by
graffiti, unplanned vehicle tracks, and an unsightly village. The Rum Village (Bedouin community),
which only a few years ago contained just a few homes, now has more than 300 houses and is
experiencing an alarming rate of growth.  Current tourism  activities are poorly organized and
underfunded, there is little effort to promote regulations to preserve the site, and there is no proposal to
maximize the returns from tourism (the current admission fee is I JD). Wadi Rum is at an important
juncture, and steps must be taken to avoid further endangering the very fragile environmental balance
that makes it so attractive.
Subcomponen
3.    The Wadi Rum Development and Environmental Conservation component would support and
encourage tourism development that maximizes economic returns to local communities while protecting
and conserving the natural and cultural resources.  Main component activities, developed and
implemented in close collaboration with the local community, would include the following
subcomponents: (a) infrastructure development; (b) protected area and tourism management; and (c)
support for income-generating activities. The following is a description of the subcomponents to be
funded under the component.
A.    h&astructure develpment
4.    The majority of investments in Wadi Rum would be related to infrastructure development and
improvement.  Infrastructure investment would concentrate on four primary areas: (a) off-site
infrastructure, mainly a new access road of about 4.4 km from the Disi Road to the visitor reception area
and a new entrance gate; (b) development of new visitor facilities and administrative buildings; (c)
planning and development of a new village to accommodate increases in the local population; and (d)
improvements to the existing Rum village. In addition, the project would fund detailed engineering of
the proposed subcomponents and supervision of implementation.



Annex 2
Page 9 of 21
5.    Off site infrastructure: Construction Qf a new entrance road. a new entrance gate. and solid
waste management. A new one-way visitors' entrance road into Wadi Rum, beginning to the east of
Jebel al Quwaysa and curving back toward the existing road to Rum just before it passes over the hill,
would be built as part of the project. The route includes some of the most dramatic entrance views and
the panorama of the main Rum Valley and the Seven Pillars from the higher ground. It would start at a
new junction on the existing Disi Road located between the two wadis at a point approximately 1.7 km
east of the existing junction to Wadi Rum. The road would head southwards toward the foothills and
then along the eastern and southern edges of Jebel al Quwaysa to the proposed visitor parking and
reception area. The total length of the road is about 4.4 km.
6.    A new entrance gate to Wadi Rum would be located on the entrance road about 100m from the
junction. The access road would be designed for 2-way operation over this length only. From the
entrance gate to the visitor parking and reception area the road would be designed for one-way operation
with stopping/overtaking areas at regular intervals.
7.    The environmental impact of the visitor access road would be as small as possible. The road
would be designed as narrow as possible (within safety standards) and follow existing ground contours,
with the surface at the existing ground level throughout. There would be no lighting or other
infrastructure services along the road, and the surface and edging would be designed to provide as natural
an appearance as possible through the use of local red-colored surface chippings and local stone edges.
8.    The proposed project would fund solid waste management improvements. Current solid waste
disposal arrangements are inadequate. It is proposed that a collection system be instituted for Wadi Rum.
Funding for the purchase of hand-carts, brooms, and storage bins and/or areas would be provided, as well
as improvements to the current dump site at Disi.
9.     Visitor and administrative facilities. The objectives of the construction of the new visitor
facilities are to create a dramatic arrival that maximizes the experience of entering Wadi Rum and to
create a space for full interpretative facilities where the views of the landscape can be appreciated and
the impact of parking and interchange facilities minimized.
10.   The centerpiece of the project investments is the design and construction of a new visitor center
for Wadi Rum. The visitor center would include a comprehensive interpretation of the natural and
cultural history of the reserve, tourist shops, kiosks, and a cafe/restaurant for refreshments and
information on transportation and accommodation within Wadi Rum. The visitor center would serve as a
control on further access to Rum, and would house the offices of the area's administrative and
management staff.
11.   The visitor center would be located on the existing access road to Rum Village, situated on the
steeply sloping southern end of a low range of hills looking south. Visitors would approach the center as
they drive south along the new access road, leaving their car or coach in a parking area set in a landscape
of desert flora and boulders, and walking up a rising pedestrian route that climaxes at the summit of the
saddle with a dramatic elevated view. This view would be framed by stone towers forming the control
over movement along the road and the visitor center.
12.   The center would lead visitors through a series of display spaces interpreting the resources of
Wadi Rum. To one side the rocks of the hillside would emerge into the interior and could be used to
portray rock carvings and geological history. On the other side narrow openings would provide glimpses
of the great valley. Visitors would rise through the building to a final shaded terrace cafe where they
would be confronted with a dramatic view of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom. From this terrace a track



Annex 2
Page 10 of 21
would rise to the summit of the hill giving panoramic views of the desert. A return track, would lead to a
desert roof garden on the center and finally back to the entrance vestibule.
13.   Ranger and tourism police outposts and sanitary facilities for tourists within the park would be
also be provided.
14.   New Rum settlement. Because Rum Village has reached its full capacity for growth, consultation
with the local population led to the selection of a site within Wadi Rum for a new settlement that would
accommodate the population growth in the area resulting from greater opportunities in tourism. The site
is located in a bowl of land drained by three main wadis. The wadis are essential as stormwater channels
and are of visual and ecological interest, and are therefore used to divide the residential areas into four
small neighborhoods of varying size. These neighborhoods would be served and linked by two spine
roads running along the contours and joining the main Rum village road at the northern and southern
ends of the new village.
15.   All housing would be served off the two spine roads and would be based on a series of housing
cells, or clusters, each of 12-20 plots and served by a communal, central courtyard. The structure of
neighborhoods, spine roads and housing clusters would allow for the social development of the village
by extended families. The overall structure of the new village would allow for variation in plot density;
the lower, easterly band next to a corridor of nonresidential uses would be the highest density, averaging
2 plots per dunum. The central band, between the two spine roads, could be mixed densities of one and
two plots per dunum. The westerly band on the upper slope could be mixed densities with plots of one to
two dunums and may be favored by families keeping large numbers of livestock.
16.   The "public face" of the village along the Rum village road would be a stone wall set back from
the road. Its purpose would be to screen the village, particularly in the early years when buildings are
unfinished and plantings immature. The wall would not be continuous, but instead would have several
breaks along its length as well as several towers up to five meters high at some locations. The wall
would weave back and forth, with different widths at different locations. Specific possibilities for non-
residential uses of the wall include an open tower for crafts such as weaving; cafes and shops built into
the wall or using shade awnings suspended from it; the village mosque and minaret in a wall tower; and
other community buildings such as a post office, police station, clinic, village council and schools sited
along the corridor abutting the wall.
17.   Imrnovements to Rum  Village.  The main considerations built into the design of this
subcomponent were (a) the restriction of the growth of the village across the wadi and encouragement of
a distinctive village form; (b) enhancement of the appearance of the village by improvements to existing
buildings, walls, open spaces, etc.; (c) encouragement of redevelopment and changes in use to tourist
accommodations and facilities, craft manufacture and commercial activities; and (d) promotion of a more
attractive urban area that will encourage visitor contact and improve economic benefit for villagers.
18.   The project would establish boundaries to the present village, control growth within the village,
and enhance current buildings and land. The project would encourage rebuilding of plot walls in suitable
materials and/or rendering and painting; rendering unfinished houses and painting; tidying streets and
removing waste material; and landscaping - planting trees and desert bushes both on- and off-plot. The
project would also invest in utility improvements: water distribution, sanitation, and solid waste
disposal.
19.   A detailed land use plan for Wadi Rum would be prepared. The plan would focus on location,
layout and design of infrastructure and tourism facilities (accommodation, service facilities, parking,



Annex 2
Page 11 of 21
reserve headquarters and ranger posts), including possible uses of buildings within Rum village. Any
additional construction, such as accommodation, restaurants or shops, would be strictly based on the
land-use plan. The location of publicly funded community facilities, i.e., a health center, and
infrastructure improvements would follow the land-use plan as well.
B.    Protected area managementplan and to  I anaement plan
20.   Technical assistance. training. and consultancv services. There would be a wide range of
protected-area and tourism-management activities implemented as part of the project. They are intended
to encourage both the community and visitors to maintain Wadi Rum in the best state possible through
monetary incentives, enforcement, and education. The elements of the sub-component would include (a)
revising the entrance fee structure and overall reserve revenue allocation in order to maximize cost
recovery and reinvestment in tourism services and infrastructure; (b) designing and implementing a
community-based enforcement scheme focusing on hunting, littering, graffiti, fuelwood collection and
off-road driving; and (c) preparing and delivering public awareness and education programs for local
tour guides, the local community, non-local tour operators and resident military personnel. In addition, a
protected area management plan, based on a detailed baseline assessment of natural and cultural
resources, would identify management priorities and action plans for the protected area and buffer zone.
It would incorporate a visitor management plan that defines visitor flow and circulation patterns
according to the site carrying capacity, a conservation and recreation zoning plan, and grazing scheme.
Preparation of the management plan for the protected area would be the responsibility of ARA under the
oversight of the Wadi Rum Steering Committee and in close consultation with local residents, the
Jordanian scientific community, relevant national and international research institutions, and NGOs.
21.   The baseline assessment of natural and cultural resources would be carried out early in project
implementation. Under contractual arrangements with ARA, RSCN, in collaboration with associations
and universities, would compile all ecological, physical and demographic information of relevance to the
conservation of Wadi Rum in a geographical information system and ensure the timely preparation of
maps. This information would be used in the preparation of the subsequent plans described below.
22.   A study of Wadi Rum's carrying capacity would also be carried out early in project
implementation in order for its findings to be incorporated into the project's protected area management
plan. As defined, carrying capacity is the type and level of visitor use that can be accommodated while
sustaining the resource and social conditions that complement the purposes of the park and its
management objectives. The study would provide both maximum numbers of visitors and identify
potential management concerns.  This would provide useful information to determine the most
appropriate management strategy. Management reforms that take place over the life of the project would
allow changes in the carrying capacity, as greater management abilities would facilitate better visitor
movement and management.
23.   The components of the protected area management plan would be as follows:
24.   A preliminary zoning plan would include detailed maps and would identify the management
objectives and uses of each zone. For example, certain zones would be accessible only by foot or camel.
Baseline field surveys would also be designed and implemented to fill the information gaps, focusing
particularly on the presence and distribution of rare and endangered species.
25.   A visitor management plan would be prepared, determining visitor flow and circulation patterns
based on the site's ecological and archaeological carrying capacity.



Annex 2
Page 12 of 21
26.   A wildlife conservation program would be developed, including detailed habitat mapping,
species conservation and monitoring programs, and identification of priorities for further applied
research. It would identify the most ecologically sensitive areas and indicate the priorities for
biodiversity conservation. The feasibility of species reintroduction programs would also be addressed in
the plan.
27.   A cultural resources conservation program would also be developed. The program would
indicate priorities for the conservation of the reserve's cultural and archaeological resources, including
the history and culture of the contemporary Bedouin tribes, and the conservation of prehistoric and
historic remains.
28.   A livestock and rangeland management scheme would be prepared that will include a survey of
the numbers, movement patterns, and socio-economic dependencies of all groups of Bedouin pastoralists
using the wider Disi-Wadi Rum area. The scheme would provide the basis for a community-based
participatory rangeland management scheme aimed at promoting the sustainable use of natural resources.
29.   Finally, a community-based system of surveillance and enforcement of regulations would be
developed. The system would incorporate the concept of limited legalized rights to hunt within
acceptable guidelines and rights to royalties and fines in order to curb excessive illegal hunting.
30.    The project would also include the revision of the entrance fee structure and overall reserve
revenue allocation to maximize cost-recovery and reinvestment in the provision of tourism services and
infrastructure and in the preservation of the site's cultural and ecological value. A visitor reservation and
fee collection system would be devised. The proposed review would also include a system to re-allocate
reserve revenues (entrance fees, services and fines) to ensure adequate site management at all levels.
31.   The project would prepare and implement on-site professional training programs specifically
designed for Bedouin tour guides, local four-wheel-drive vehicle drivers and Tourist Police. The training
program would focus on the fragility of desert ecosystems and archaeological sites (i.e. the long-term
effect of off-road driving on vegetation, litter disposal, etc.); basic measures to minimize visitor impact
on the natural ecosystem and first-aid treatment. The program would also include English language
training.
32.    Ofjce equipment and computers. The project would fund the purchase of office equipment and
furniture for the administration of the protected area.
33.    Vehicles for tourism and protected area management. The project would fund the purchase of a
vehicle for tourism and protected-area management staff and tourism police.
C.    Income geeratig actividesfor the localgppulation
34.   The project would fund consultancy services focusing on two activities: strengthening the Rum
Tourism Cooperative and developing a Women's Handicraft Center.
35.   Strengthening the Rum Tourism Cooperative. Assistance would be directed to the Rum Tourism
Cooperative so that it is better able to (a) manage tourism services, (b) represent local community
interests with regard to site management and associated tourism developments to the Government
agencies involved, and (c) ensure that local communities derive maximum benefits from the
development of the site. Specifically, technical assistance would be directed toward improving the
efficiency and quality of services offered by the tourism cooperative, devising a transparent and reliable



Annex 2
Page 13 of 21
accounting system with separate accounts for each service, and devising equitable mechanisms to enable
all households to benefit from tourism in Wadi Rum. The organization and management of the
cooperative would be assessed, and measures towards their consolidation would be devised and
implemented including a more transparent accounting system.
36.   Developing a Women's Handicraft Center. A Women's Handicraft Center would be established
by the project in order to promote alternative income-generating mechanisms for women and to link
income generation with tourism. The project would first finance a market survey to determine existing
products, skills among the women at the site and potential market niches. The focus would be on the
development of production techniques that are compatible with the nomadic Bedouin way of life. Based
on the results of the market survey, a line of unique Wadi Rum natural products would be designed.
Handicrafts would be developed from locally available materials and be related to local traditions.
Finally, Bedouin women would be trained on site to produce, package and market the handicrafts.
Depending on the type of handicrafts, production would be home-based or based at the handicraft center
in Rum. Regardless of the production site, the handicraft center would serve as a base for the
distribution of inputs, gathering of final products, quality control, packaging and marketing. It is
anticipated that most product sales would be local, and in case production exceeds demand, could be
expanded to include Aqaba and other tourist destinations.
37.   Women's Handicraft Center equipment. The implementation of the handicraft center project
would entail recruitment and training of a local site manager and the provision of financial assistance for
the period during which women from the local community would be trained. In addition, the project
would fund the construction of the handicraft center and the purchase of office equipment and handicraft
center supplies.

Karak and Jerash Tourism Development Pilot Program
Introduction
1.    To support the Government's efforts to spread the heavy tourist concentration in Amman and
Petra to other historic sites, this component would: consist of a tourism development pilot program to (a)
carry out feasibility studies and land-use plans for implementation under a follow-up phase of the
Government's Tourism Development Project; and (b) enable the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities
(MOTA) to implement priority urban regeneration tourism-related projects and cultural heritage
conservation activities in Karak and Jerash.
Subcomponents
A.    Technical assistance-far-feaibilt studies
Technical assistance forfeasibility studies in Jerash
2.    Jerash, known as Gerasa in ancient times, is one of the most extensive and best preserved
provincial Roman cities in the Near East. Founded during the second century BC, it was a member of
the Decapolis, a commercial league of ten Greco-Roman cities. The site had been previously settled, but
Jerash was built on top of its predecessors and little evidence of them remains. Strategically located on
overland trading routes, the city flourished during the first century BC through the second century AD.
With the development of maritime trade routes and the decline in overland trade, Jerash declined.
Following a major earthquake in 747 AD, the city was left uninhabited, and a modem town was built by
Circassians on the eastern slope of the stream valley in what was once the residential area of the ancient
town. The site is relatively small but the entrance, dominated by the Triumphal Arch built to
commemorate Hadrian's visit in AD 129, is spectacular. Today, it is well known for the Jerash Festival,
an annual cultural event celebrating Jordanian handicrafts and performing arts, which draws performers
and visitors from throughout the region. The Jerash Festival was founded by Queen Noor in 1981. Under
the 1976 First Tourism Development Project, IDA financed the construction of a restaurant and visitors'
center, upgrading of a small site museum, preservation and restoration of major monuments, and
improvement of trails, interpretative materials and administrative facilities.
3.     The project would fund an integrated tourism and urban development study for Jerash, including
plans, programs, and priority action projects with necessary institutional and implementation guidance. Key
urban issues that would be addressed by the studies are:
* Traffic circulation and parking: Existing pressures resulting from visitor arrival and parking,
city center congestion, and circulation at the bus station and the possibility of closing part of the
Irbid through-road to provide pedestrian access to the center, require the presentation of
alternative traffic circulation plans, including a southern cross-town route, to be reviewed as
part of coordinated traffic management and circulation proposals for the city.
* Water supply and sewerage: At present there are severe local water supply shortages and low
pressures throughout the city. Only 22 percent of the houses are connected to the sewerage
system. Urgent investments are required to benefit the residents and are also essential for the
development of tourism facilities and accommodation.



Annex 2
Page 1S of 21
*  Solid waste collection and disposal: Improved collection of solid waste throughout the city is
required, as well as a review of current disposal methods; the existing surface landfill site is far
from the city and contaminates the underground water.
*  Municipal facilities: Sites at the edge of the city have been identified for future relocation of
the bus station, a wholesale market, a slaughterhouse and an industrial park. The suitability of
these locations and their impact needs to be reviewed as part of a coordinated plan for the city.
*  Municipal finance and management: An overall review of the institutional framework and
public finance system should be conducted, including the definition of responsibilities, skill
levels and training requirements, with particular attention given to project coordination,
operation, and cost recovery.
4.     The feasibility study would identify potential projects directly linked to tourism and that would
benefit the local population. These are likely to include:
-  restoration of the city walls and monuments, the East Baths, and lighting of the attractions;
-  rehabilitation of historic houses in the central area as a traditional souq;
-  selection of appropriate locations for tourist accommodations;
-  enhancement of the central area, the greening and reuse of the Wadi, and the creation of a
pedestrian link into the Decapolis; and
-  training in tourism-related skills and entrepreneurial advice.
5.     The identification of tourism-related and urban development projects would take into account the
following criteria:
-  tourism development opportunities: to increase visitor contact with the city; to lengthen visitor
stay and season; to improve presentation of attractions; and to enable the city's use as a regional
base for visitors.
-  economic development and employment: to support the economic regeneration of the city and
to ensure that tourism benefits local businesses; to improve urban services; and to encourage
private-sector investment.
-  urban conservation and planning: to protect and enhance the walled city -  the monuments,
historic buildings, and areas worthy of conservation; and to ensure new development is of
appropriate form and materials.
-  traffic management and parking: to resolve congestion and inadequate parking and improve
circulation and pedestrian movement.
-  urban infrastructure and services: to ensure suitable coverage is achieved at reasonable cost
using appropriate technologies, and suitable quality of services, operations and maintenance,
financial arrangements and environmental impact.
-  institutional and financial management improvements:  to ensure appropriate institutional
capacity for effective planning, finance and implementation.
-  private-sector participation:  to encourage and increase opportunities for private sector
investment and joint venture partnerships.
6.     The studies would be carried out in two stages: First, preparation of a preferred urban development
strategy, and second, a detailed urban development plan with a five-year project program and social and
environmental impact assessments. The first-phase urban development strategy would include an initial list
of capital-investment and institution-building projects that would be considered in detail in the second
phase.

7.     Karak  The historic hilltop city of Karak, with its ancient walls and crusader castle, has the
characteristics necessary to become a tourist destination and benefit the local population and economy.
In addition to the castle, the tourist attractions of Karak include the numerous historical buildings of the
city itself, authentic artisanal workshops, a dramatic landscape and views across steep valleys, and ease
of access to nearby archaeological and natural sites such as the Dead Sea. Despite these attractions,
Karak is not a significant destination for international tourists, and only a relatively small number visit
the castle.
8.     The project would fund an integrated tourism and urban development study for Karak, including
plans, programs, and priority action projects with the necessary institutional and implementation guidance.
Key urban issues that would be addressed by the studies are:
* Traffic circulation, public transport and parking: current levels of congestion has made visiting
Old Karak by vehicle increasingly difficult and pedestrian movement unpleasant.
* Urban enhancement: conservation of selected areas, pavement widening, the removal of signs
and the restoration of buildings of historic significance.
* Economic regeneration: opportunities to support local enterprises benefiting from increased
tourism and the retention of government services in the old city.
* Upgrading utilities and public services: ensuring necessary infrastructure is in place and
maintained to support the increasing requirements of the urban population.
* Technical assistance and training for the municipality and Government departments and
agencies to manage and promote investment and urban regeneration: particular concerns in
Karak are the lack of tourism experience, effective planning and building controls and private-
sector investment in tourism facilities.
* Development or upgrading of tourism facilities and attractions.
9.     The feasibility study would identify potential projects directly linked to tourism and that would
benefit the local population. These are likely to include:
- restoration of part of the castle and city wall;
- creation of a plaza area in front of the castle;
- development of visitor accommodations, including the possibility of using historic houses as
bed-and-breakfast facilities; and
- improvements to any nearby potential tourism or recreational sites outside Old Karak.
10.    The study would concentrate on investments and improvements to Old Karak with the
understanding of the impact of its setting in the region. Selected projects outside the old city may be
identified and included as essential actions to benefit tourism and urban regeneration, e.g., improvements to
the road link to the desert highway, development control and landscaping of the steep valleys around the
castle, or regional tourist attractions.
11.    The identification of tourism-related and urban development projects should take into account the
following criteria:
- tourism development opportunities to increase visitor contact with the city; to lengthen visitor
stay and season; to improve presentation of attractions; and to enable the city's use as a regional
base for visitors.

phase.
B.    Priori& tourism devlomenfRoEQcts
13.   The proposed project would fund the detailed engineering studies and implementation of priority
projects identified in the feasibility studies described above. The chosen projects would have a high
probability of (a) increasing the attractiveness of the respective city to international and domestic tourists;
(b) increasing tourism-related activities, facilities, and services in the respective city; (c) improving urban
infrastructure and/or services that benefit both tourists and the local community; and (d) encouraging
private-sector investment and participation in the tourism sector. The chosen projects would be an integral
part of the urban development strategy prepared as part of the above feasibility studies, and would constitute
a high-visibility and economically viable investment in the respective city.
14.   In anticipation of implementation of the priority projects to be identified by the feasibility studies,
the proposed project would fund the following two already-identified priority projects:
15.    raka:  Upgrading and pedestrianization Qf the castle plazas and rehabilitation Qf the
vernacular buildings. This project includes the upgrading and pedestrianization of two plazas and the
regeneration of their surrounding area and rehabilitation of selected buildings for tourism-related
activities. A new route from the main shopping street to the castle entrance would be created through a
parking square behind government offices down to the lower level plaza in front of the castle entrance.
This would require: (a) the removal of the parking facility; (b) landscaping; (c) the clearance of small
outbuildings; (d) the construction of a wide stair down to the lower plaza; (e) the renovation and reuse
for tourism activities of abandoned municipal buildings; and (f) the construction of stairs down into the
moat and clearance of rubble at the end of the moat. The goal of the project is to create an attractive
setting for the castle and new facilities for tourists, encouraging more visitors to walk into the town
center. The proposed project would fund surveys, detailed designs and necessary drawings, the
preparation of all contract documents, and implementation of the project.

16.   Jerash: Upgrading and pedestrianization of the urban space surrounding the Roman Baths and
rehabilitation of the traditional soug and the vernacular quarter. This project involves the creation of a
functional plan to revitalize and enhance the space as a visitor destination. This would require: (a) the
removal of the existing bus terminal; (b) provision of landscaping and urban furniture, including new
pavement, fountains, kiosks, and public restrooms. The proposed project would fund surveys, detailed
designs and necessary drawings, the preparation of all contract documents, and implementation of the
project.

Sector Development Support
Itroduction
1.    Under the current legal framework of the tourism sector, the Tourism Law (Law No. 20 of 1988)
grants MOTA the responsibility for four tasks: the preservation and development of tourism sites,
licensing and classification of tourist occupations, marketing, and the development of human resources.
However, except for licensing, the Tourism Law fails to grant MOTA the necessary specific powers to
carry out its responsibilities. Rather, it is expected to accomplish these critical tasks "in cooperation and
coordination with the concerned parties" (Preamble). Regarding the development of tourism sites, the
concerned parties are numerous and diverse, depending on the particular site. At the same time, these
concerned parties have divergent interests not always compatible with tourism sector policies.
2.     To date, except in the case of Petra (where the Petra Region Planning Council reports to MOTA),
MOTA has at best secondary authority in critical issues of land use, planning and site development, the
environment and safety matters at major tourist sites. In the current law MOTA's authority is not
spatially specific or primary in any one place. Rather, authoritative allocation of real resources (land,
water, and infrastructure) and regulation of such matters rest with the Jordan River Valley Authority, the
Aqaba Region Authority, or various municipal councils and prefectures ("muhafazat").
3.     Where MOTA is clearly empowered, as in the case of licensing, the exact scope of its
responsibilities and powers are poorly defined and dependent on outdated regulations and unnecessarily
complex, time-consuming procedures. This system is incoherent from a policy perspective and raises
transaction costs for the private sector. Still, the chief practical function of MOTA remains licensing.
The classification of establishments and, generally, the establishment and maintenance of quality
according to internationally accepted and known standards, does not yet exist. The price system for
hotels has not been shown to be essential in attracting tourists or in providing incentives for hotel
improvement. In this area complete reform is merited.
4.    In the case of marketing and promotion, the Jordan Tourism Board (JTB) efforts are considered
by the private sector and past studies (USAID, 1993, and WTO, 1995) to be ineffective, due in large part
to the difficulties of accomplishing marketing tasks with bureaucratic structures tied to Government
incentives.
5.     The development of human resources has been hampered largely by a lack of funds and the lack
of a nexus between the educational system and MOTA. The issues here are less legal than institutional
and financial. However, the Tourism Law and the institutional arrangements it creates are insufficient to
support efforts needed to achieve the policy goals.
6.     With recently changed circumstances, including the increased importance of tourism to the
economy as well as the clear need to preserve and protect Jordan's natural and cultural heritage, it is an
opportune time to rationalize, harmonize and strengthen the legal and institutional basis for achieving the
goals of tourism  policies and   removing unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles to private-sector
participation.

7.    Techical assistance and trainizZg. The Sector Development Support Component would focus on
improving the basis for strategic, policy, and institutional framework for the sector. Toward this end,
three studies would be conducted: (i) a longer-term tourism development strategy, with an associated and
prioritized investment program; (ii) a policy and regulatory study that identifies impediments to
increased private-sector participation and proposes measures for deregulation and for streamlining the
numerous regulations; and (iii) a restructuring plan for tourism sector public institutions, with a view
toward improving their effectiveness and coordination with related line ministries and the private sector
as well as toward rationalizing their role in tourism.
8.    The longer-term strategy would be the lead study, as both the policy and regulatory study and the
institutional restructuring plan would be formulated around the objectives set forth in the strategy. The
key objectives of the strategy would include the following:
(a) expand international tourism and, in particular, rather than aim at mass tourism, develop
tourism attractions in a manner to spread tourism flows around the country and encourage
longer visitor stays and higher spending;
(b) increase participation in regional tourism by entering into cooperative agreements with
neighbor countries;
(c) expand business, conference, incentive, and eco tourism;
(d) encourage and facilitate domestic tourism;
(e) establish the requisite mechanisms for coordination between tourism development and
conservation;
(f) develop and manage tourism in a manner to bring socio-economic benefits directly to local
communities, with community-based tourism projects as an important vehicle;
(g) develop and manage tourism in an environmentally, socially, and financially sustainable
basis to ensure that historical, cultural, and ecological assets are maintained indefinitely;
(h) optimize the economic benefits of tourism, including strengthening linkages between
tourism and other economic sectors;
(i) establish the requisite organizational mechanisms and policy framework to ensure close
coordination and cooperation among Government agencies involved in tourism and between
the public and private sectors;
(j) upgrade all existing tourism facilities, and for those to be developed, ensure that services
meet acceptable safety, comfort, sanitation and service standards;
(k) develop an effective education and training system, in close cooperation with the private
sector, for tourism sector personnel; and
(1) ensure the presence of appropriate institutional mechanisms to monitor the development of
the tourism sector and implementation of the strategy.
9.    MOTA would be responsible for the sector development support component. It would establish
a Tourism Task Force to prepare the three studies. The Task Force would be assisted by one long-term
and four short-term experts who would be financed by the proposed project.



Annex 2
Page 21 of 21
10.   The Task Force membership would include representation from MOTA, MPWH, the Ministries
of Water and Irrigation, Rural Affairs, Finance, Planning, and Industry and Trade, in addition to bankers,
legal experts, local representatives from concerned communities; the Jordanian Hotel Association, and
tour operators and tour guide associations. The Task Force would divide into sub-groups depending on
the subject under study. The draft study would be discussed with a wider group of concerned public and
private entities. The revised version would then be submitted to the Higher Council for Tourism for
endorsement and then to the Cabinet. The Phase II project to follow the proposed operation would help
the Government implement the proposed strategy, policy framework, and institutional structure.
11.   Terms of reference for the three studies are in the project files.
12.   The outputs of the studies would be incorporated into sector recommendations and policy for
Government approval by September 30, 1999.
13.   In addition, the project would fund technical assistance to MOTA for upgrading their system of
collecting and analyzing tourism-related statistics.
14.   Eg;ent purchase. The proposed project would fund the purchase of computers and vehicles
for MOTA.
15.   Technical assistance to the Project Management Unit. The proposed project would fund the
operating costs of the PMU for five years. PMU Staff would be hired on performance-based contracts.

Jordan: Second Tourism Development Project
Economic Analysis
Abstract. Tourism is Jordan's second largest earner of foreign exchange and one of its most
important exports. Given the importance of this sector to Jordan's GDP, the Project's primary
objective is to provide the framework for a sustainable and environmentally sound expansion of
tourism in four of Jordan's most important tourist destinations. Overall, the Project cannot be
directly linked to a specific increase in tourism over the medium term and, therefore, a cost
effectiveness methodology is used for most of the economic analysis. One component, road
rehabilitation, is examined using cost benefit analysis, and results show an ERR of between 16
and 17 percent.
Tourism: Jordan's Second Largest Export
1.    Tourism is Jordan's second largest generator of foreign exchange after remittances, surpassing
both potash and phosphates. Although a small country, Jordan is fortunate to have several world-class
tourist destinations that offer the potential for producing sustainable economic benefits. It has two
historic areas - Petra and Qasr Amra - designated as World Heritage sites, plus numerous other
historically important attractions that represent the long span of history from ancient Greek influence to
the modern Hashemite dynasty.
2.    As a result of the peace process, Jordan has enjoyed a rapid growth in tourism and the earnings
accruing from this sector. Between 1989 and 1995, annual tourist arrivals increased by 50 percent, from
about 650,000 to over one million. According to the central bank and Ministry of Tourism and
Antiquities (MOTA), estimated 1996 foreign exchange revenues associated with tourism account for ten
percent of the county's GNP (US$750 million equivalent). The sector directly provides approximately
8,000 jobs. Economic gains from tourism are still not fully exploited, and the Government is
increasingly aware that it must make selected strategic investments and policy changes in order to
preserve the sector's potential over the long term.
Project Objectives
3.    Given the importance of the sector as described above, the primary objective of the Second
Tourism Development Project is to provide the framework for a sustainable and environmentally sound
expansion of tourism in four of Jordan's world-class tourism destinations. These sites include the area
immediately surrounding Petra (a World Heritage Site), Wadi Rum (a premier desert wilderness), Karak
(an ancient hilltop crusader city) and Jerash (one of the Middle East's best preserved examples of a
Roman provincial town). Framework, in this context, would includes the setting of policies, institutional
development, and a program of investments.
4.     The project's secondary objective is to provide employment through tourism-related activities
and through income-generation schemes located at the tourist destinations. These activities are generally
not infrastructure related and involve the organization and training of indigenous people living at, or in
proximity to, the project sites.
Link to Country Assistance Strategy and Sector Work
5.    The project is fully consistent with the latest country assistance strategy (CAS), dated October
24, 1995 (Report No. 14999-JO). The CAS discusses the importance of tourism to the national economy,
the need for providing essential infrastructure and encouraging the private sector in the tourism industry.
It also states that an essential part of the tourism strategy will be to protect historical and natural
attractions from environmental threats.  The provision of essential infrastructure and appropriate



Annex 4
Page 2 of 15
regulatory frameworks (such as those provided under the project) are stated in the CAS to be strategic
objectives of the Bank's overall assistance program. In addition, lending in the tourism sector is
specifically identified as a priority instrument to address these strategic objectives.
6.     The Bank's last sector work for tourism in Jordan, completed in 1991 (Tourism Sector Note),
was done to assess the sector's potential at the end of the Gulf War. In this report, Jerash, Karak and
Wadi Rum were all highlighted for their tourism potential, as were environmental concerns for the
country's fragile tourist destinations. Promising regions recommended for more analysis in this study
were the south Aqaba coast and the Dead Sea. Six years later in 1997, both of these areas are being
developed by the private sector, with the public sector role limited to the provision of basic infrastructure
and regulation.
7.     A main recommendation in the Tourism Sector Note was to develop a comprehensive sector
strategy. Following up on this suggestion, in 1995 and 1996, JICA assisted MOTA in undertaking a
comprehensive sector analysis and formulating the overall tourism  strategy.  The Bank has been
informnally consulted on this work during its preparation and has reviewed interim reports. The Bank has
also reviewed the final report, dated February 1996. For this reason, the Bank has not undertaken any
recent sector work on tourism, preferring instead to conserve its Economic and Sector Work resources to
examine other parts of the economy.
Benefits of the project
8.     First, the project will have positive environmental effects in the sensitive areas immediately
adjacent to Petra in Wadi Musa and in Wadi Rum. In Wadi Musa, these benefits include flood
prevention through reforestation, embankment protection, soil stabilization measures, wadi restoration,
motor vehicle traffic organization, and solid waste management. In Wadi Rum, positive environmental
effects will be realized through the designation of the zone as a protected area with special regulations,
the definition and subsequent enforcement of a tourist carrying capacity for the protected area,
preparation of a wildlife conservation program, preparation of a livestock and range land management
scheme, and development of a solid waste management system.
9.     Next, the Project will prevent further degradation of historical and cultural sites, thus ensuring
their preservation for future generations. In Wadi Musa, the project will bring order to currently un-
controlled urban growth through the establishment of a Petra Region Planning Council (PRC). This body
would be vested with the powers necessary to enforce urban land use planning, the implementation of
development projects, and supervision of regional solid waste services. The project will also improve
visitor support services and circulation patterns at the Petra sanctuary, redesign and upgrade the Petra
Visitor Center and improve infrastructure immediately adjacent to the Visitor Center and Sanctuary
entrance.  In Wadi Rum, a cultural resources conservation program would be developed, as would
complimentary regulations and police capacity. An existing village inside the Reserve will be upgraded
using local materials and traditional designs to recover its past harmony with the surrounding landscape.
10.    Not undertaking the project would result in: (a) environmental degradation; (b) destruction of
sensitive cultural sites and landscapes; and (c) the irretrievable loss of tourist revenues. Because the
project would be working in environmentally sensitive areas that are susceptible to permanent damage
solely from overuse (in addition to occasional destructive behavior), one of the major consequences not
undertaking the project would be the slow destruction of the very attributes that made the sites attractive
in the first place.  This is particularly the case for the pristine Wadi Rum  area, which is very
environmentally sensitive, has a low carrying capacity, and is urgently in need of protective measures.



Annex 4
Page 3 of 15
11.    Similarly, many of the cultural sites that tourists find attractive in these areas are very old and
either made of, or carved or painted on, natural structures. These natural "canvases" (if one may define
them as such) are subject to rapid deterioration from human contact, automobile pollution and erosion
caused by heavy traffic. Leaving these cultural attractions and sites unprotected would doom them to
rapid extinction.
12.    Finally, if there were nothing left to see, or if the sites were in such poor condition that they were
no longer special, then tourist would have no interest in visiting and tourism revenues would fall. If this
happened to Petra, Wadi Rum, Jerash or Karak it would be a devastating loss to Jordan, threatening not
only estimated annual foreign exchange earnings of over US$750 million, but also some 8,000 jobs
associated with the tourism industry. This project is not sufficient, in itself, to ensure that this scenario
does not materialize - many other actions and policies would also have to be implemented (e.g., the
planned water and wastewater infrastructure in Wadi Musa, restoration and preservation of archeological
sites at Jerash and Karak, or development of a long-range tourism strategy). However, the project is a
necessary component in the country's comprehensive strategy to prevent such a decline and preserve
these assets for prosperity. In addition, the project should provide the basis for a rational expansion of
the tourism industry in an environmentally responsible and sustainable fashion.
Economic Analysis Methodology
13.    With the exception of the road rehabilitation component, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is not
appropriate for this project. This is because there is no realistic way to predict the increase in the number
of tourists visiting Jordan as a result of the project, and hence the benefit of tourism to the economy. At
the same time, it is just as difficult to estimate the decrease in tourism (over the medium term) if the
project is not implemented. For those reasons, the benefits cannot be quantified monetarily and a cost
effectiveness methodology has been used for the economic analysis.
14.   In this context, the following section, Choice of Investments, presents the case that the selected
investments are the most cost-effective alternative to meeting the project's objectives. Following that
discussion, the Public vs. Private Issues section demonstrates that all components are also appropriate
for the public sector to undertake.
Choice of Investments
15.    The project's planned investments are shown in Annex 3.  The biggest component,
approximately 29 percent (about US$10.5 million of total base cost) concerns improvements to existing
access roads to Petra. As the project's main objective is to permit a sustainable expansion of tourism
activities, and as the only way (beside using a helicopter) to arrive at Petra is by motor vehicle, safe
roads with a reasonable carrying capacity are needed. Expenditures under this component seek to
address three concerns: safety, longevity and a reduction in vehicle operating costs. By widening the
paved portion of the main access roads from 6 to 7 meters, the roads will be made safer for the large
number of high-capacity tourist buses that use them. Similarly, selected road sections will be realigned
to better accommodate navigation by these large buses. Both of these measures should reduce accidents.
While the widening is undertaken, certain technical steps will also be accomplished that will strengthen
the roads, thereby lengthening their useful life. This rehabilitation will also decrease vehicle operating
costs through smoother surfaces and faster traveling times. The road rehabilitation design, and the
sections to be realigned, were extensively discussed with the Government. As a result, the standards and
work plan adopted are considered to be the minimum possible while still remaining consistent with
safety and longevity concerns as well as cost. The construction standards are, therefore, considered to be
the technically optimal choice for the project.



Annex 4
Page 4 of 15
16.    The economic analysis of the access road rehabilitation components is subject to CBA, described
beginning at paragraph 49. In sum, the overall base case ERR is about 17 percent for the Wadi Musa -
Um Seyhun - Little Petra road (7.5 kilometers), and about 16 percent for the Unaizah - Shobak - Wadi
Musa road (53.3 kilometers).  A sensitivity analysis for this component was also performed, and
switching values calculated (see description starting at paragraph 51). In sum, the base case ERR for this
component is quite robust and there is a fairly high degree of certainty that the NPV would remain above
zero at a 12 percent discount rate.
17.    About 20 percent of total base costs ($7.3 million) would be used to upgrade urban infrastructure
in Wadi Musa, Taybeh and Um Seyhun. The majority of this cost ($4.6 million) will go for the
upgrading of the principal spine roads in the three communities (about 3.0, 4.0 and 0.5 kms,
respectively), plus some collector roads in Wadi Musa. For these urban roads, use of the HDM model is
not appropriate because of the low vehicle speeds, congestion caused by non-road condition factors and
the short distances involved. Justification for their rehabilitation, as well as the rest of the urban
infrastructure upgrading, is based on pedestrian safety, minimum appearance standards for city centers,
and externalities involving the promotion and growth of urban businesses and services. Most of these
externalities are a direct result of tourism activities that the project seeks to sustain and help grow. Given
the already established nature of the infrastructure to be upgraded, no other investments were considered
to be as cost effective.
18.    Six percent (about US$2.0 million of total base cost) of the project's investments would be made
with the objective of improving visitor support services at the Petra sanctuary. This component directly
addresses the issue of the preservation of Jordan's principal cultural heritage site.  This site is
irreplaceable, and therefore investments are needed to prevent further damage from inappropriate use or
overuse. Additional investment in the visitor center at the entrance of the site are necessary to improve
the "tourist friendliness" of the site, i.e., to introduce visitors to the wealth of Petra and provide
information about its history. Currently, there is inadequate archaeological site protection within the
Sanctuary (resulting in unnecessary damage to the site caused by inappropriate pedestrian traffic), and
lack of information about Petra is a major cause of tourist dissatisfaction, as is visitor "bunching" at the
major monuments. To address these concerns, the project would fund the design and implementation of
the redevelopment of the visitor center and the entrance area, improve visitor support services through
better visitor flow patterns, more appropriate signage, formalizing the adhoc trails that lace the Sanctuary
and creation of new paths and/or trails where appropriate, providing landscaping with indigenous plants
and shrubs, and developing a visitor management plan and training for site management staff and guides.
19.    Another 16 percent (about US$5.7 million of total base cost) concerns reorganizing, or providing
new, infrastructure for Wadi Rum. Here, the objective is to better manage tourist flows, better control
access to the park, and modify infrastructure to be consistent with the natural setting and tourism
activities. The largest part of this component (about US$2 million) is to make the existing village less
visually intrusive, refurbish structures, and improve basic infrastructure. Alternatives considered were to
raze the village and relocate the people, redraw the park boundary to put the village outside the park,
leave it the way it is now, or revamp the village and provide alternative space for villagers who wanted to
pursue activities not consistent with the park's use (e.g., small industry or vehicle repair). Leaving the
village as it is now is not desirable because of negative externalities that come from its present condition.
Redrawing the park boundary was rejected because the village sits in a magnificent site surrounded by
the tall cliffs that, better than any other aspect, define Wadi Rum. Razing the village and relocating the
people had two drawbacks: first, it would seem to be rather draconian considering that for many people
this is their ancestral home; and second, for a small marginal cost the existing structures could be
modified to add value to the park. Thus, in consultation with the community and with its support, it was
decided that the best course of action was to upgrade the village and provide alternative housing and



Annex 4
Page 5 of 15
other facilities nearby (three kilometers away) for those people who wanted to undertake commercial and
related activities from their home. Households taking advantage of the Government's offer for an
additional house at the new village site would still retain ownership of their home in the traditional
village.
20.    Fourteen percent (US$5.0 million of total base cost) of the project has to do with the
development of Karak and Jerash as tourism destinations. These two cities have substantial undeveloped
potential for tourism and, therefore, this component is fully consistent with developing a sustainable
increase in tourism and expanding tourism-related employment. Under this component, investments that
would enhance tourism potential would be identified (through feasibility studies) and implemented. This
strategy is considered by the Bank and Government as the best alternative for developing tourism
potential in the two cities. The cost of this component was discussed with the Government and the
amount decided based on the likely potential of these two cities to attract tourists over the near term. To
reduce the risk brought about by the lack of information while at the same time permitting promising
investments to proceed quickly once they are identified, pilot projects to be funded under the component
would be chosen on the basis of: (a) increasing the attractiveness of the city to international and domestic
tourists; (b) increasing tourism-related activities, facilities, and services in the city; (c) improving urban
infrastructure and/or services that benefit both tourists and the local community; and (d) encouraging
private-sector investments and participation in the tourism sector.
21.   The remaining 15 percent of the project's costs (about US$5.7 million of base costs) mainly has
to do with the following three investments:
(a) environmental management and improvements to small structures;
(b) developing income opportunities for women in Wadi Rum; and
(c) technical assistance to MOTA and the PRC to improve their capacity and efficiency.
22.    Examples of the first of these are measures for flood control in the Wadi Musa wadis,
reforestation, regeneration of wadi terraces, and the refurbishing of trails and existing traditional small
buildings. Because of topography or the small scale of the structures involved, alternative courses of
action are limited for technical reasons.
23.    Developing a cottage handicraft industry for the women of Wadi Rum appears to be the best
possible income generation activity for the area. First, most women in Wadi Rum Village have a low
education level and, therefore, pursuing higher valued added activities would not be appropriate under
this Project. Second, producing traditional and indigenous goods for sale to tourists is entirely consistent
with the nature of the Wadi Rum Park, which emphasizes the natural environment and a unique
experience.
24.    Finally, MOTA and the PRC are both in need of equipment and technical assistance to help carry
out their mandates. Under the project, MOTA will conduct three studies considered to be priorities for
the development of the sector. These studies (fully described in Annex 2 of the PAD) would cover the
development of a long-term strategy and investment plan for the sector, policy and regulatory matters
(with an emphasis on increasing private sector opportunities in the sector), and rationalizing the
Government's activities in the sector. Concerning the PRC, the project would address the priority areas
of staff strengthening and implementation capacity through the provision of relevant technical experts on
short-term assignments, office technology and vehicles. There may be alternative uses of these funds at
the margins, but overall the priorities appear logical and appropriate.



Annex 4
Page 6 of 15
Alternative Investments Examined
25.   In addition to the investments described above, the Bank and MOTA also examined several
additional investment choices to accomplish the project's main objectives. All investment alternatives
were under the multi-site approach described in the PAD (Section 8) and, therefore, deal mainly with
specific locations for project components. One of these alternative sites was Aqaba, where the project
team examined possible investments to assist in: (a) relocating port facilities to accomplish a more
homogeneous use of the coast for tourism activities; and (b) upgrading specific urban areas lying close to
existing tourist infrastructure. After discussion with the relevant port authorities and the Ministry of
Planning, it was determined that changing the layout of the port was too big a task for a tourism project.
In addition, this proposal would have necessitated a lengthy discussion with several ministries, and the
time required for this process was considered too long to meet MOTA's desire for quick action on other
project components. The urban upgrading investment was also rejected because it did not well address
the project's objectives.
26.    Several other villages and towns were also examined as potential sites for investmnent. These
included Qasr El-Hallabat, Azraq, Qasr Amra, Qasr Kharanah, Hemmeh, Um Qais, Pella, villages at the
Dead Sea, Madaba, and Mount Nebo (see June/July 1994 aide memoire for this project for a full
description of these alternative sites). All of these sites were considered to be too small and not
important enough tourist destinations to justify giving them investment priority over those sites
ultimately selected.
27.    The project originally considered funding part of the potable water and wastewater system
upgrading and expansion project in Wadi Musa. The investment fit well with the project's objectives,
but was subsequently financed by USAID (on a grant basis), France and Germany, and MOTA requested
that it be removed from the Bank's project (see PAD Section 9). Another environmentally important
investment originally considered was a comprehensive solid waste collection service in Wadi Musa. It
was originally conceived that the project would support the initial investments and recurrent costs of a
private sector operator and then withdraw its involvement over two or three years. However, the private
sector subsequently assumed full responsibility for this service. Thus, this investment was also not
included in the project.
28.    There are three major donors in the tourism sector in Jordan: the Bank, USAID and JICA.
Therefore, any investments already identified for JICA or USAID financing were not considered for the
Project.
29.    Finally, the weak implementation capacity of MOTA and the relevant municipalities influenced
the decision to steer a large part of the project's investments to roads, urban management, housing
facilities and other buildings. Such infrastructure will meet the project's objectives and will be
implemented by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing. As described in the PAD (Section 9), the
MPWH has an established implementation capacity and procedures, and project implementation capacity
will likely be enhanced where it is involved. Thus, the project team and Government could have directed
more resources to Karak or Jerash or even another smaller town, but with the doubts about
implementation capacity in the municipalities (or MOTA's ability to effectively intervene at this level),
this emphasis was rejected in favor of components that stood a better chance of being implemented in a
timely manner and making an immediate contribution to the sector.



Annex 4

Public v. Private Issues
30.    Tourism, by it very nature, should be mostly a private sector activity, with the role of the public
sector confined to the design and implementation of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework. This
is because, at the microeconomic level, there is usually no market failure and the public sector has little
or no justification for intervention. The other common grounds for public sector participation, equity
and efficiency, also usually do not generally apply to tourism projects. Thus, the public sector should not
be involved in running hotels or tour companies, or providing employment at tourist destinations.
31.    Given the role of the public sector in the project, the list of investments was examined during the
design phase to ensure that they are appropriate. The results of this review are illustrated in Table 4. As
shown there, none of the components presents a strong case for private sector participation. For
example, about 64 percent of the project represents an investment in public goods where there is a
market failure. Included here are road and town center investments and the undefined investments to be
made in Karak and Jerash. These latter investments are, however, likely to be basic infrastructure (e.g.,
roads, sidewalks, street lighting, public transport areas, etc.), and therefore will also have public good
characteristics.
32.    Another 25 percent of the Project results in externalities for which, without Government
intervention, too little of the good would be provided. For example, most of these costs are for
infrastructure inside the parks of Petra and Wadi Rum, or for costs associated with the protection of these
two areas. Because the private sector would have few, if any, opportunities to charge for these goods,
they would not be interested in providing them.
33.    On the other hand, these investments do preserve the natural environment in Petra and Wadi
Rum and produce significant environmental benefits, thus making them appropriate for public sector
support. For example, the Rum Village enhancement effort is designed to bring an existing village,
located just inside Wadi Rum Park, into harmony with the surrounding landscape. The village houses
and associated compound walls will be resurfaced with indigenous materials and the color schemes
modified to reflect traditional patterns. The buildings will be upgraded and minimum services provided
where they do not now exist. The size of village will be limited to the existing number of buildings, with
no new structures permitted. The eventual use of these houses would be decided by the current residents
and ARA to decide, but many of them will likely become tourist overnight accommodations (following
the precedent of a similar scheme in Taybeh - the Taybeh Zamman Hotel'). The overall effect will be
to make what is now an inconsistency in the landscape appear to be natural and pleasing and an
opportunity for appropriate revenue generation.
34.    The remaining 15 percent of the project is split between public goods where exclusion is
undesirable (e.g., street lighting), areas where the Government is intervening because of a lack of
information (feasibility studies), where there are equity (redistribution) concerns (developing income
opportunities for indigent women), or investments in an area reserved for the public sector (e.g.,
MOTA's regulatory function). Details can be seen in Table 4.
Taybet Zamman was an abandoned village near Taybeh that was transformed into a hotel. Extraordinary care
was taken to preserve the original architecture and layout of the village and the original houses. The resulting
hotel truly exhibits the one-of-a-kind results that come from the use of traditional buildings to meet modem
needs.



Annex 4
Page 8 of 15
Beneficiaries of the project
35.   Beneficiaries from this project include: MOTA, PRC, the Aqaba Region Authority (ARA), the
towns of Wadi Musa, Taybeh and Um Seyhun, and the parks of Petra and Wadi Rum. It is also likely
that the cities of Karak and Jerash will be gainers under the project, but this cannot be confirmed until the
feasibility studies financed under the project are completed.
36.   The Project will have a positive impact on poverty. Women and their families living in Wadi
Rum would benefit through the project's income generating activities. Some residents of Wadi Rum
(typically without a regular source of income) will also have increased income opportunities through the
conversion of their existing homes into accommodations for tourists. To the extent that the poor are
involved in selling souvenirs to tourists, they are also likely to benefit from the expansion in tourism that
the project helps to support. All of these groups are likely to support the project and its implementation.
37.   Strong support for project implementation should also come from MOTA, the PRC, ARA and
the Rum Tourism Cooperative, because each of these will receive technical assistance and equipment. In
addition, their authority for their respective areas will be increased, which should also provide an
incentive for implementation.
38.   However, there are some parties that will likely lose influence and power under the Project. The
most important of these are those private sector interests that wish to increase their activities inside or
adjacent to Petra and Wadi Rum without regulatory restriction. Pressure is especially likely to be
brought on the PRC by these groups, because the private sector is in the midst of a major development
effort in this location. Limiting uncontrolled growth will be a challenge for the PRC and may effect the
project's sustainability over time. The influence of these groups is discussed in the Project Risks section
below (starting at paragraph 44).
39.   The existing residents of Wadi Rum village will have an incentive for project implementation
because each household will have the option to receive a serviced lot at Government expense outside the
park boundary. However, some villagers will resist the project because they will have to curtail certain
activities at their traditional home. For example, car repair and servicing is not consistent with an
environmentally sensitive area and this sort of activity will likely be prohibited by the Wadi Rum
Administration, which will be established to administer the park. The degree of resistance will probably
depend on the residents' perception of: (a) the value of the serviced lot outside the park; (b) increased
tourism-related revenue and employment opportunities that will result from enhancements to the park
under the project; and (c) the benefit to women from the planned income-generating activities.
Fiscal Impact
40.   Over the six-year implementation period, the Government will have to provide about US$12.0
million in counterpart funds under the project, varying from about US$1.1 million in FY98 to a
maximum of US$3.6 million in FYOO. This level of investment is less than one percent of the country's
total annual investment and should not pose any overall fiscal constraint. For example, counterpart funds
would be included in the budgets of MOTA (for the Karak, Jerash, Petra and PRC investments), MPWH
(for the road investments), and ARA (for the Wadi Rum component). For each of these entities, annual
counterpart contributions are expected to be less than US$1.0 million.  For MOTA, counterpart
requirements would average under 10 percent of its total investment budget. The timely provision of
counterpart funds is expected, however, the Government also confirmed the provision of adequate
counterpart budgets prior to negotiations.



Annex 4
Page 9 of 15
41.    There will be a slight increase in recurrent expenditures from the staffing and operation of PRC
(see PAD, Section 16). But this entity is meant to be a small and efficient organization, relying on short-
term consultants to the extent possible versus permanent staff. Until it receives its own budget ratified
by the Cabinet, PRC's investment and recurrent costs will be shown as separate line items in MOTA's
budget. (MOTA's 1997 budget already contains shows separate entries for PRC totaling just over
US$2.6 million.) Increased operating and maintenance costs resulting from all new or rehabilitated
infrastructure under the project are estimated at about US$1.3 million per year.
42.    Repayment of the loan from IBRD (US$32 million) is the sole responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance and there will be no pass-through of this obligation to another entity. The single currency
LIBOR-based loan would be repaid over 17 years at an estimated 6.7 percent annual interest rate, with a
likely annual commitment fee of 0.75 percent calculated on the undisbursed balance. There would be a
grace period of four years, after which annual principal plus interest payments would vary from US$4.8
million (FY04) to US$2.8 million (FY15). This project represents an incremental increase of 0.62
percent to Jordan's overall debt (US$7.05 1 billion, 1994 figure, latest estimate available).
Financial Sustainability
43.   IBRD and the Government are the sole financial sources for the Project, and there appears to be
adequate funds available. For example, during the project's implementation period, the maximum
counterpart funds required in any one year is US$3.6 million. This is a very modest sum for a country
with an average annual Government capital investment budget of about US$300 million. However, the
Bank also asked the Government to enact a provision that would set aside 25 percent of Petra's tourist
admission fees (or commit to allocating the required amounts in the general budget) for park operations
and maintenance. This was done with a Cabinet Decision dated May 31, 1997. Admission fees will not,
however, be used for road maintenance because it is Government policy to include all the country's roads
under a national program set up for this purpose.
Project and Institutional Risks
44.    There are no major project or institutional risks identified in the PAD. Moderate risks discussed
there fall into three categories: (a) those concerning the implementation capacity of Government
authorities placed in charge of project components; (b) political stability in the region; and (c) lack of
sustained financing to maintain rehabilitated or new infrastructure.
45.   Although the project design cannot mitigate the risk of change in the political security of the
region, the design has taken into consideration the risks inherent in the project - institutional
implementation capacity and the availability of funds for O&M costs. Project design has attempted to
mitigate the first risk through establishment of a project management unit within MOTA, the primary
implementing agency. Key staffing of the unit and of the PRC was accomplished as a condition of
negotiations, and steps toward implementation (including the tendering for detailed engineering and
supervision) took place before negotiations. In order to ensure efficient operation of the PMU and PRC
from the beginning of the Project, technical experts were also selected before negotiations took place. In
addition, the Sector Development Support component of the project will address key organizational
issues of the sector as a whole.
46.    A main goal of the assistance given to the PMU and the PRC will be to strengthen institutional
capacity over the long term and to accomplish the transfer of technical and managerial expertise.
Accomplishments achieved under these headings will be reviewed at the mid-term review and
adjustments made in the technical assistance component if so indicated.



Annex 4
Page 10 of 15
Mid-Term Review
47.    The project's mid-term review is scheduled for the third year of the implementation period. The
mid-term review will be used as a means to adjust project components and reallocate effort and resources
as appropriate. In the context of the economic analysis, the following items are scheduled to be
addressed and assessed at the mid-term review:
(a) subproject economic analyses under the Karak and Jerash Tourism Development Pilot
Program;
(b) accomplishments for the strengthening and improving of managerial and technical expertise
in MOTA's PMU and the PRC;
(c) surveys and statistics to confirm the growth of tourism at Wadi Rum;
(d) traffic and track counts to document the increased safety and reduced vehicle operating
costs of the Unaizah-Shobak-Wadi Musa road; and
(e) assessment of natural and cultural resources in Wadi Rum by comparing the baseline survey
with surveys of the same areas just prior to the mid-term review.
48.    To ensure that the required information will be available, planning for the mid-term review will
be discussed in the project launch workshop and then followed up during supervision. Well in advance
of the actual date of the review, the concerned implementing agencies will be asked to provide relevant
documentation for prior review and to formulate action plans as required. The Bank will also ensure that
staff with the appropriate skill mix will participate in the mission.
Road Component Cost Benefit Analysis
49.    For the road rehabilitation components described beginning at paragraph 15, benefits are
estimated for improved road conditions that lower vehicle operating costs, decreased maintenance costs
and benefits resulting from improved road safety. While reduced vehicle operating costs, time savings
for passengers and savings in road maintenance following rehabilitation are important benefits, what is
more important from a tourism viewpoint are the safety issues involved with the proposed road
rehabilitation. The benefits from improved road safety were estimated at US$15,000 per million vehicle
kilometers2. Tables 2 and 3 present the "with" and "without" project scenarios for the two roads based
on the World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-III).
50.    A 0.8 conversion factor was used in the model to estimate the economic costs for patching, re-
sealing, 4 cm overlay, reconstruction and routine maintenance. This conversion factor is estimated
taking into account a 10 percent import duty for bitumen (HS Code No. 2714.9) and a gross corporate
marginal tax rate of 25 percent, expected to yield an average net tax rate of 10 percent.
51.   Nine sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of base case ERRs for this
component. The scenarios were designed to model the normal project risks for construction cost
overruns (Nos. 1, 2), and an overestimation of benefits (Nos. 3, 4, 5, 9), plus the risk mentioned in the
PAD that there may be a lack of sustained financing to maintain rehabilitated infrastructure, in this
instance the roads (No. 8). Results are summarized in Table I below. As shown there, and using a 12
percent discount rate, a negative NPV would result only from a combination of two scenarios: (a) costs
2 Based on a total cost of accidents in Jordan of about 2 percent of GNP for about 4.5 billion vehicle kilometers
traveled per year.

Page 11 of 15
increasing by 25 percent and benefits decreasing by 25 percent; or (b) benefits both decreased by 25
percent and delayed by two years.3
52.    Switching values were also calculated for this component using project cost increases plus
changes in traffic counts. Regarding the former, costs would have to increase by 45 and 32 percent for
the Um Seyhun - Little Petra and Unaizah - Shobak- Wadi Musa roads, respectively, in order to have a
zero NPV. As for traffic counts, they would have to decrease by 31 and 41 percent, respectively, to
yield a zero NPV.

53.    The sensitivity analysis shows that the ERR for the project's road rehabilitation component is
very robust and that the increase in costs, or decrease in benefits, needed to result in a zero NPV are
unlikely to occur. This is particularly the case considering: (a) the short road lengths involved (7.5 and
53.3 km), and (b) the anticipated brief construction period of only two years.
3  Other combinations of scenarios were also examined with similar or better outcomes. Scenarios 6 and 7 are
thought to be "worst case" outcomes and were chosen for this reason to be illustrated in Table 1.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
A. ProcurementMethod (Tables Al and A2)
1.    The project elements, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements and schedule for the
components to be financed by the Bank are summarized in Table Al and Table A2.
2.    All Bank-financed civil works, equipment and materials would be procured in accordance with the
Bank Procurement Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995 and
revised January and August 1996. Procurement of consultant services and technical assistance would
follow Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers of
January 1997.
3.    Contracts for civil works valued at US$2,000,000 or more would be awarded according to
intemational competitive bidding (ICB) following Bank Guidelines. Prequalification of contractors for all
civil works contracts bid under ICB would be required. Civil works contracts under US$2,000,000 would
be awarded according to national competitive bidding (NCB) procurement procedures.
4.    Goods and equipment required for the project would consist of vehicles for sites and project
management, computers, telecommunication and office equipment, handicraft equipment, and small
equipment for solid waste management. Contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost more than
US$250,000 equivalent each would be procured through ICB, using World Bank Standard Bidding
Documents. Contracts valued at less than US$100,000 would be procured according to National Shopping
with an aggregate amount of US$700,000. Contracts valued above US$100,000 and below US$250,000
would be procured according to International Shopping with aggregate amount of US$1,000,000. National
and Intemational Shopping should be based on at least three price quotations and, where relevant, from two
eligible countries.
5.    Consultant and training services for the project's technical assistance components and detailed
engineering and construction supervision services would be contracted in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers of January 1997.
These services include studies, technical assistance for capacity building, training, engineering designs, and
construction supervision services for which proposals would be requested from three to six short-listed
firms.
B. Prior Review Thresholds (Table B)
6.    All contracts for works exceeding US$1,000,000 and contracts for goods and equipment
exceeding US$250,000 would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. For consultancy
assignments financed by the Bank, there would be prior review for contracts worth US$100,000 and
above for contracts with consulting firms and US$50,000 and above for contracts with individual
consultants. This would result in prior review of about 80 percent of Bank-financed procurement. The
contract review arrangements are summarized in Table B.

Disbursemen
C. Allocation of Loan Proceeds (Table C)
7.    The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table
C. Withdrawal applications for contracts valued at more than US$1,000,000 for works, US$250,000 for
goods, US$100,000 for consulting firms, and US$50,000 for individual consultants would be presented
in English for disbursements. During negotiations, it was agreed that annual audit reports of project
accounts and SOEs would be prepared and submitted in English by auditors acceptable to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
D. Use of Statements QfExpenditures (SOEs)
8.    Disbursements for contracts valued at less than US$1,000,000 for works, US$250,000 for goods,
US$100,000 with consulting firms, and US$50,000 with individual consultants would be made on the
basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursement for training services valued at less than
US$50,000 would be made on the basis of SOEs. During negotiations, it was agreed that documentation
to support expenditures financed under SOEs or otherwise would be maintained in English by the MOTA
and made available for review by Bank supervision missions.
E. Special Account
9.    To facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures, the Government would establish in the
central bank two Special Accounts to be operated respectively by MOTA and ARA under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Bank would, upon request, make an authorized allocation of
US$1.5 million to the Special Account of MOTA and an authorized allocation of US$0.5 million to the
Special Account of ARA. Initially, the allocation would be limited to US$0.75 million in the Special
Account of MOTA and US$0.25 million in the Special Account of ARA. The full authorized allocations
could be claimed when disbursements reach US$5.0 million for MOTA and US$2.0 million for ARA.
MOTA and ARA would submit replenishment applications for their respective Special Accounts on a
monthly basis, or when about 20 percent of the initial deposit has been utilized, whichever occurs first.
The replenishment applications would be supported by the necessary documentation: a bank statement of
the Special Account and a reconciliation bank statement of the Special Account against the Bank's
records. The minimum amount for applications for direct payment and for special commitment would be
20 percent of the authorized allocation to the Special Account. Replenishment of the Special Accounts
would follow Bank procedures. The Special Accounts would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to the Bank for review
and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was
reached on the above provisions for the operation and auditing of the Special Accounts.
