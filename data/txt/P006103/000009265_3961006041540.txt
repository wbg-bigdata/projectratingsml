SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (POWER II)
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:           Government of Belize
Beneficiarv:        Belize Electricity Limited
Amount:             US$11.5 million equivalent
Terms:              Repayment over 17 years, including 5 year grace period at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:    17 years, including 5 year grace period, at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate. BEL would bear the interest and the foreign exchange
currency pool risk.
Project Description:  The proposed project would cover BEL's medium-term (1997-2005)
power and transmission requirements. The proposed project would
comprise: (a) the construction of a 115 kV interconnection transmission
system running from the border with Mexico to Belize City; (b) the
integration of San Pedro (the major tourist area of the country) to the
system; (c) the integration of Dangriga (the principal area of the citrus
industry) to the system; (d) a dispatch center, supervisory control, data
acquisition and communications for system operations; (e) an
environmental mitigation program for the existing diesel plants; and (f)
consulting services to assist BEL in engineering and project management,
and technical assistance and training.
Benefits:           The proposed project would result in overall improvement in the
generation and supply of electricity that would reduce cost of electricity
to consumers and increase reliability and cost-effective of the supply of
electricity in Belize.
Risks:              Apart from the dispatch center and a Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition System, all the other components of the project are standard
electric utility facilities with very well known technologies; therefore
technology risk during project implementation is very low. During
project operation the major risk is BEL's financial performance. If
Macal river hydrology is significantly less favorable than expected,
obligations under the power purchase contract with Mollejon developers
could affect negatively BEL's financial condition in some years. To
mitigate this potential risk, contractual provisions allow for a



v 
compensation mechanism ("energy bank") and the elimination of the pay-
or-take obligation after the tenth year of operation of Mollejon.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
1.1   Belize, located south of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on the Caribbean cost of Central
America, attained independence from the United Kingdom in September 1981. With a population
estimated at 199,000 in 1992, occupying an area of about 22,000 km2, the population density is
low, about 9 people per km2. Belize compares well with neighboring Central American and some
Caribbean countries in regard to income distribution, education and health. Belize's population
is predominantly young (about 50 percent below the age of fifteen) and quite literate. About one-
fourth of the population lives in Belize City, the country's largest city. The country is endowed
with abundant and fertile land, literate urban labor, proximity to North America and a stable
currency (i.e., its exchange rate has been pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate since 1976), all
of which make it attractive to foreign investment. Belize's small, open and private sector led
economy is based on agricultural exports and tourism. Belize achieved a per capita GNP of
US$2,200 in 1992.
1.2   The country's economy has historically been based primarily on export agriculture.
Agriculture accounts for almost one-fifth of GDP. In recent years, however, diversification away
from excessive reliance on sugar into other economic activities has been taking place. In 1992,
the share of sugar in total exports (goods and non-factor services) fell to 15% from over 409% in
1980. The rest of Belize's agriculture comprises citrus and banana production and fishing,
mainly oriented to the export market, and the production of corn, rice, beans, and livestock for
domestic consumption. Industry (including construction and electricity) accounts for about one-
quarter of GDP. In manufacturing, the major commodities are export oriented: citrus processing
and garments. Tourism, which became a major foreign exchange earner during the 1980s,
accounts for 25 % of exports; citrus, bananas and fish products currently contribute to 10%, 49%
and 5% of exports, respectively.
Recent Economic Developments
1.3   Since the mid-1980s, Belize has experienced rapid economic growth in response to good
economic management and a favorable external environment. During 1986-90, real GDP growth
exceeded 9% per annum on average, with strong contributions from all sectors. Sugar export
receipts grew by 80%, production and exports of citrus nearly doubled and exports of bananas
tripled. Tourism arrivals more than doubled and receipts tripled. Construction boomed, led by
public infrastructure investments and tourism-related construction. This, in turn, boosted trade
and transport-related activities. Belize's performance since the mid-1980s contrasts with the
economic difficulties the country faced during the early-1980s, a period during which sharp
declines in export earnings and government efforts to stimulate the economy through
expansionary demand management policies led to domestic and external imbalances.



-2 -
1.4   Following the rapid economic expansion of the mid to late 1980s, growth continued at
a steady but somewhat lower rate in the early 1990s. In 1991 and 1992, real GDP increased by
5.4% and 5%, respectively. Inflation averaged 4% per year. Domestic imbalances emerged as
a result of large increases in the public sector investment program (PSIP) and in public sector
wages, and of reduced privatization proceeds. In 1991 and 1992, the overall public sector deficit
(after external financing) reached 1.2% and 5% of GDP, respectively. These deficits were
financed by the Central Bank, domestic borrowing and commercial loans (suppliers credit).
Foreign exchange reserves decreased to 2.1 months of import equivalent at the end of 1992.
1.5   The new administration that took office in June 1993 declared that its immediate priority
would be to reestablish a sound fiscal position. New fiscal measures were aimed at sharply
reducing the FY93/94 public sector deficit from the projected 8% of GDP. Further fiscal
measures to reduce the deficit are expected to be included in the FY94/95 budget.
Development Issues and Growth Prospects
1.6    Belize is vulnerable to changes in the global economy. This stems from its dependency
on a few export commodities and a high degree of openness, with both exports and imports
representing about 60% of GDP. Economic development in industrial countries as well as
changes in the demand for specific export commodities impact directly on the Belize economy.
However, Belize has been able to reduce its excessive dependency on exports of sugar and to
diversify into other agricultural commodities (mainly citrus and bananas, agro-processing and
fisheries) and tourism. In 1992, the share of sugar in total exports (goods and non-factor
services) had fallen to 15% from over 40% in 1980. Citrus, bananas and fish products currently
contributed to 10%, 4% and 5% of exports respectively, while services including tourism and
the expenditure of British troops accounted for 25% and 8% of exports, respectively.
1.7    Although the economy is diversifying, Belize still remains exposed to changes in market
access for key agricultural export commodities and to fluctuations in commodity prices. About
60% of Belize's sugar exports benefit from preferential trade arrangements with the U.S. sugar
quota, the duty-free entry of citrus from Mexico to the U.S. under the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the erosion of preferences in the EU currently accorded to
banana producers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. The gradual erosion
of these arrangements expected over the medium-term underscores the need to further reduce
dependency on these main export crops. The withdrawal in a year's time of British troops whose
collective expenditures are equivalent to 4% of GDP, will also have a dampening effect on
growth.
1.8   The successful completion of the recent GATT rounds is likely to provide significant
opportunities for Belize to diversify its exports into nontraditional "niches". Similarly, the new
NAFTA agreement can affect Belize's trade patterns as Mexico (a country with which Belize
shares a long border) gradually liberalizes its economy and aligns its domestic prices closer to
world levels.

Bank Lending Strategy
1.9    Belize's development strategy supported by the Bank, calls for the public sector to
concentrate on three broad policy fronts: (i) continuation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies,
with particular emphasis on expenditure restraint, to maintain price stability and provide a stable
environment for private sector development; (ii) improvement of economic and social
infrastructure to eliminate bottlenecks and improve economic efficiency (i.e. urban and rural
infrastructure, water and sewerage, electricity and health); and (iii) rationalization of the incentive
framework to ensure efficient resource allocation and provide an enabling environment for further
export diversification and improvement of the competitiveness of the economy. The proposed
Project is consistent with this strategy and would assist in the improvement of Belize's
infrastructure.
1.10   Belize has pursued a prudent external debt strategy. It has benefited from grants and
concessional loans from bilateral and multilateral sources and, thus, has maintained its debt
indicators at low and manageable levels. During the 1980s, grant financing averaged about 4%
of GDP. This financing is expected to decline as donors gradually reduce their aid flows to the
Caribbean countries. In 1992, medium- and long-term external debt outstanding and disbursed
amounted to US$158 million (35% of GDP). Bilateral loans -- largely from the U.K. and the
U.S. -- represented about US$70 million; and multilateral loans amounted to about US$590
million -- mainly from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) (US$27 million) and IBRD. In
1992, Belize became a member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Over the
medium term, the Government is expected to rely on multilateral and bilateral sources and on
moderate amounts of commercial financing and of suppliers credit to finance its investment needs.
The Bank's exposure in Belize is low; debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$19 million in
1992 and IBRD debt service at 1 % of exports of goods and nonfactor services. Belize is
considered creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II: THE ENERGY SECTOR
Organization of the Energy Sector
2.1    The Ministry of Energy and Communications (MEC) is responsible for formulating the
overall energy policy. The Ministry of Natural Resources is responsible for petroleum
exploration activities through its Geology and Petroleum Office, while biomass energy issues fall
under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Section. Petroleum pricing and importation issues are
handled by the Ministry of Trade and Commerce. Under the 1992 Electricity Act, the Minister
of Energy and Communications, assisted by a Director General of Electricity Supply, is in charge
of all matters concerning electricity supply in Belize.
2.2    At present, Belize Electricity Limited (BEL), a company whose major shareholder is the
Government, is the only commercial generator, transmittor and distributor of electricity in Belize.
Since BEL's current distribution system does not cover the whole country, captive power
generation is common. A private developer is building a hydroelectric power plant on a BOT
based arrangement to sell electricity to BEL.



- 4 -
2.3    The importation and bulk handling of petroleum products is currently in the hands of
Esso.  The distribution of petroleum  products is undertaken by three local affiliates of
international oil companies (Esso, Shell and Texaco). Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is
imported and distributed by private companies under a licensing system.
Primary Energy Resources
2.4    Belize's energy resources are limited. The two primary resources are biomass and hydro
energy. The biomass resources consist of wood (about 93 percent of Belize's land area is
classified as forest) and agricultural residues, mainly bagasse. The hydropower potential of the
Macal River only, where the 25 MW hydro plant is being constructed, is estimated at about 60-80
MW. In addition to the Macal River, there are several other rivers that might offer viable hydro
power sites.
2.5    Geological studies indicate a good possibility that Belize has deposits of oil and gas, both
on-shore and off-shore; estimates range from 19 million barrels to 130 million barrels of oil.
Since 1955, 40 wells totalling 250,000 ft have been drilled and about 6,000 line miles of seismic
surveys have been conducted by several companies.  Presently there are 13 independent
companies carrying out oil exploration. Various findings have been reported but so far there
have been no reports of discoveries of either oil or gas in commercial quantities. Belize has no
known coal resources of commercial quantities.
Energy Supply and Consumption
2.6    Petroleum Products. All petroleum products are imported, mainly from the U.S.A and
Mexico. Domestic consumption of oil products was about 27,463,000 gallons (650,000 bbl), in
1992. In addition, about 16,830,000 lbs of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was imported. The
following table gives a breakdown of domestic consumption of petroleum products in 1992.
Table 2.1. Domestic Consumption of Petroleum Products in 1992 1/
Product Name               |                     Quantity                    Unit
Gasoline                                        9,671,000                 GaUons
Diesel Oil                                     15,298,000                 GaUons
Fuel Oil                                         481,000                  Gallons
Kerosene/Jet Fuel                               1,140,000                 Gallons
Aviation Spirit                                  873,000                  Gallons
TOTAL OIL PRODUCTS                          27,463,000                  GaUons

Note: Imports of lubricating oils are not included in the table. Gasoline is unleaded.

2.7    Of total diesel oil consumption, about 60 percent (9,184,000 gallons) was used by BEB
for electricity generation. Fuel oil was used mainly in the sugar and citrus processing industries
for steam production. Official statistics do not provide a breakdown of the usage of petroleum
products by economic sector. In order to improve information availability, it is recommended
that MEC's Energy Unit start collecting energy end-use data.
2.8    Petroleum Products Prices. Petroleum product prices are controlled by the government,
but vary from place to place depending on transportation costs. The Government's objective is
to minimize price fluctuations. This is implemented through a stabilization mechanism called "the
revenue replacement duty", to compensate for increases and decreases in international prices.
Although the Government's policy does not allow subsidy of petroleum product prices, the
stabilization mechanism prevents the fluctuations in the international prices to be fully reflected
in the pump prices. Annex 2.1 provides the breakdown of petroleum products prices in Belize
City as of June 1993, and the prices of LPG in various locations in Belize. BEL imports its fuel
requirements directly from Mexico and is not affected by Government petroleum pricing policy.
2.9    Electricity. With the exception of the Corozal/Orange Walk system, which is supplied
with electricity from Mexico, Belize relies primarily on individual, isolated diesel generating
plants. These plants use imported diesel oil purchased exclusively from Mexico. Belize
Electricity Limited (BEL) operates 9 individual electrical systems. In FY93, the combined net
electricity generation totalled 139 GWh and sales to about 33,000 customers were 120 GWh.
Sales have increased on the average by 12 percent per year in the period FY87-92. Rapid
economic growth; rural electrification programs; and connection of industries and hotels, which
previously generated their own electricity, to the BEL system have been the main reasons for the
high demand growth. This increase contrasts sharply with the low demand increases during the
early 1980s. The aggregate peak demand reached about 25 MW in FY93, following increases
on average of 13 percent per year during the period FY87-93. According to the 1991 population
census, about 70 percent of all households have electricity, but access varies greatly between
districts (about 90 percent of households in Belize district have electricity, while the portion is
only about 25 percent in the Toledo district in southern Belize 2/.)
2.10   In addition to BEL, electricity is generated by private industries, such as sugar, dairy and
citrus processing, and by timber mills, and hotels. It is estimated that there is about 20 MW of
privately owned generation capacity, although no reliable data exists on how much electric energy
is generated by these captive diesels. Two privately owned small scale hydro plants (150 kW and
60 kW) are in operation.
2.11   Biomass. About 93 percent of Belize's land area is classified as forest. Woodfuel
consumption is relatively limited; about 30 percent of households used firewood for cooking in
1991. According to a limited survey conducted in 1982, the average household used about 10
pounds of dry firewood per day. Based on these figures, the total consumption can be estimated
at about 40 million pounds of dry firewood per year. Although estimates on the sustainable
supply of wood are not available, the limited use of wood for cooking is not considered to

endanger the forests. Firewood is mostly cut free of cost in the neighborhood of the dwelling.
In addition, Belize has biomass resources in the form of sugar cane bagasse, which is mainly used
for producing process steam and electricity in the sugar industry. The feasibility of using surplus
bagasse for power generation by BEB was studied in 1989 by Canadian International Power
Services (CI Power). The study concluded that bagasse generation would be economically
attractive to complement the supply in the Corozal/Orage Walk area. The consultants also carried
out an evaluation of the feasibility of using wood and sawmill residues for power generation; this
option was not considered economic due to the relatively small quantities of residue available.
2.12   Other Renewable Energy. Solar photovoltaic energy is exploited on a very limited scale,
mainly in tele- and radio communications, navigation lighting and in tourist attractions far away
from BEL's power lines. Solar is also used on a limited scale for water heating. At the privately
owned resort on St. George's Caye, wind turbines are used to generate electricity for the resorts'
own needs. Occasional wind powered water pumps can also be observed at private farms. Based
on the results of the feasibility study mentioned above, neither solar nor wind are economic
alternatives for medium  or large scale electricity generation.  However, the technical and
economic feasibility of using solar energy to complement energy supplies, especially in hotels and
other tourist developments on the environmentally sensitive barrier islands, should be studied
further.
2.13   Energy Consumption by Households. The following table provides a picture of energy
consumption by households.

2.14   As shown in Table 2.2 above, almost 70 percent of households use electricity for lighting.
Nevertheless, electricity is seldom used for cooking. Instead, households prefer LPG since
electricity as a cooking thermal energy source is about 3 times more expensive than LPG 3/.
Wood for cooking and kerosene for lighting is the combination for most rural households without
3/     Cost of LPG used for cooking is estimated at US$20/GJ, and of electricity at about US$55/GJ. The
efficiency of a gas cooker is assumed at 60 percent, and of an electric cooker at 75 percent.



access to electricity, the majority of the rural population. The share of households using wood
for cooking has decreased from about 40 percent in 1981 to less than 30 percent in 1991.
Energy Conservation and Demand Management
2.15   Although energy conservation has not been a high priority policy in Belize's energy
sector, high energy prices provide incentive for energy conservation and efficiency. The only
demand management effort on the side of the BEL has been the ongoing replacement of low-
efficiency street lighting by higher efficiency sodium lamps to reduce peak load. The tariff study
to be financed under the proposed project will analyze potential load management options through
tariffs. This is a necessary first step before persuing other more specific measures aimed at
demand side management in BEL system.
Government's Energy Sector Objectives and Policy
2.16  In 1990 the Belize Government established its Development Plan for 1990-1994, setting
out an ambitious energy policy aiming to: (a) reduce Belize's dependency on imported energy;
(b) develop indigenous energy resources; (c) reduce the cost of energy; (d) provide electricity to
rural communities; and (e) secure a reliable and sustainable electricity supply across the country.
The following actions in the electricity sub-sector, set out in the plan, have been implemented:
(i)    granting a franchise to a group of private investors to build, own and operate a
run-of-river 25 MW hydro-power plant at the Mollejon site on the Macal river,
in order to develop Belize indigenous hydropower (construction of the plant is
in progress and commissioning is expected by early 1995);
(ii)   enactment of the Electricity Act of 1992, restructuring the electricity industry,
introducing private participation and competitiveness in the sector;
(iii)  incorporation of Belize Electricity Limited as the successor company of the state-
owned electric utility, BEB, through the public sale of shares and debentures; and
(iv)   a rural electrification program totalling about BZ$19.2 million during FY91-93
(approximately US$10 million), increasing electrification to more than 80%
nation-wide.
2.17   The position of the new Government, that took office in June 1993, is to move forward
and improve its policy in the energy sector by:
(i)   improving the contractual arrangement with the developers of the Mollejon
hydroelectric plant;
(ii)   supporting the proposed Second Power Development Project; and
(iii)  expanding the electricity imports from Mexico, interconnecting the electrical
systems of both coountries.



- 8 -
2.18   In the last three years, the previous and the new GOB have moved clearly and strongly
in the direction of reform and private participation in the power sector, basically in line with
Bank's policy in the sector. Although, the initial public offering of BEL's shares was only
partially successful, the present GOB is open to consider additional private participation in BEL.
The implementation of the proposed project, combined with the expected improvement of BEL's
operations as a commercial corporation, will extend BEL's attractiveness to the private sector.
PART III: THE ELECTRICITY SUB-SECTOR
Reform of the Power Sector
3.1    The Belize power sector was reformed in 1992 under the Electricity Act of 1992. The
new Electricity Act provides for: (a) the regulation and provision of electricity services; (b) the
issuing of licenses for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; (c) the powers
etc. of license holders; (d) transfer of the assets of BEB to a successor company, Belize
Electricity Limited (BEL); and (e) miscellaneous other matters dealing with the use of meters,
preservation of amenities and fisheries, financial provisions, electricity tariffs, equipment
installation, etc. An important feature of the new Electricity Act is the establishment of a
mechanism for the granting of licenses authorizing any person or company to generate, transmit
or distribute electricity in a specified "authorized area". The new Electricity Act moves away
from the exclusive supply rights provided for BEB in the previous Electricity Ordinance, and
provides instead an environment for competition under a licensing system.
3.2    Another new feature in the law is the establishment of a high level position, that of
Director General for Electricity Supply, to assist the Minister of Energy and Communications in
administering the licencing mechanism, enforcing regulations, and participating in all other
matters concerning the implementation and application of the Electricity Act. The Director
General's main duties are: (1) to ensure that all reasonable demands of electricity are satisfied;
(2) to ensure that license holders are able to finance the provision of services they are authorized
to carry on; (3) to promote competition in the supply of electricity; (4) to protect the interests of
the consumers; (5) to promote efficiency and economy of electricity supply and use; and (6) to
control safety regulations and standards. The Director General is also authorized to establish by-
laws with respect to electricity supply activities. He is assisted by staff from the Public Services
Commission.
3.3   In accordance with the new Electricity Act, the assets and liabilities of the former Belize
Electricity Board, a Government agency, were transferred to the Belize Electricity Limited, a
private company incorporated under the Companies Act of Belize. The Government granted BEL
a 15 year license to generate, transmit and distribute electricity in all the areas where the former
BEB operated, covering about 3/4 of the country.
3.4   In August 1992, the Government published a Prospectus offering for sale 49 percent of
the shares and all the debentures of BEL to the general public in Belize. The offer was opened



- 9 -
on October 5, 1992 and closed on January 15, 1993. The general public was only moderately
interested in investing in BEL, however. As a result, only 37.5 percent of the shares were sold.
The remaining 11.5 percent were therefore purchased by the state owned Social Security Board.
As the holder of a Special "Golden Share", the Government has the right to appoint two of BEL's
Directors, and as long as the Government is the holder of the 'Golden Share" and of at least 25
percent of the issued share capital, it may appoint the Chairman of the Board. Of the current
nine directors in the BEL's Board, six have been nominated by the Government. However, three
of the Government nominees come from the private sector while one represents BEL employees.
3.5    The Government has indicated that as a policy, during the transition period to a private
majority or fully private ownership of BEL, it will deal with its shares in BEL as an investor and
not as a manager. It has already made significant progress in restructuring the electricity sector
and introduced private participation in the ownership of BEL and in power generation. The
Government is currently considering options (see also para. 2.18) to transfer its remaining 51 %
shares in BEL to the private sector. This most probably should occur in 1997/1998, when the
debentures sold in conjunction with ordinary shares in the first offering can be redeemed or
converted into equity, the Mollejon plant will be in operation and the proposed project would be
substantially completed. Completion of this expansion program will put BEL on much better
footing, improving its revenue position and making for a more attractive private investment
candidate.
3.6   The primary objective of the sale of the Government's remaining shares in BEL would
be to place the majority of shares in the hands of investors with the experience necessary to
successfully manage an electric utility. The interests of Government and the public will be
protected through Government retention of the "Golden Share" with rights limited to approval
of subsequent sales of shares, and the implementation of the regulatory framework, established
in the Electricity Act of 1992, charged with responsibility for monitoring BEL's compliance with
service standards as defined in its operating license and the management of transparent electricity
pricing setting.
Electridty Demand and Supply
3.7    BEL's sales of electricity amounted to 120 GWh in FY93 and was supplied by 124 GWh
of own thermal generation and 15 GWh of purchases from Mexico. Electricity sales have
increased on the average by 12 percent per year during FY87-93. The coincident (97%
coincidence factor) maximum peak increased concurrently at an average yearly rate of 13 percent
and was about 25 MW in FY93. The rapid economic growth, rural electrification programs
(especially in San Ignacio, Corozal and Dangriga), the promotion of San Pedro as a major tourist
center, and connection of industries and hotels which previously generated their own electricity,
have been the principal causes for the high sales growth. The recent high sales growth compares
favorably with sales growth during the early 1980s of about 5 percent per year.
3.8    Of the total sales of 120 GWh in FY93, 38 percent were to residential consumers, 34
percent to businesses and industries, and the balance to statutory and government offices. The
following table summarizes the consumption of electricity by consumer category by BEL's
customers.

Source: BEL, December 1993 billing records.
3.9    The average monthly consumption by residential consumers was about 145 kWh, and by
business and industrial consumers about 800 kWh, while the statutory bodies and the Government
of Belize consumed on the average about 3,000 kWh per month. The relatively low average
consumption figures for businesses and industries result mainly from the fact that the larger
industries, such as the citrus and sugar companies, have their own generation facilities and are
not accounted for in BEL's statistics.
Electricity Prices
3.10   Electricity in Belize is expensive compared to most countries in the LAC region, although
it should be recognized that the market is very small and too dispersed to take advantage of
economies of scale and more efficient generating technologies. BEL's current electricity tariff,
in effect since 1989, consists of three increasing blocks:
Block                        Belize Cents          US cents
0-70 kWh per month             31                    15.5
71-150 kWh                     35                    17.5
more than 150 kWh              41                    20.5
3.11   There is no demand charge or distinction between customer categories. The average
revenue per kWh sold was 38 Belize cents in FY92 (equivalent to US cents 19) compared to the
average generating cost of about 27 Belize cents. The current tariff rates have provided BEB
with a rate of return on (historically valued) net fixed assets of around 10 percent during the
recent years.
3.12   As part of the CDB loan in 1980, a tariff study was prepared by consultants in 1982.
The study recommended substantial rate increases to meet the financial covenants of the CDB
loan. In addition, the study recommended that a separate tariff be established, comprising both
an energy and a demand charge, for large industrial customers. The recommendations of the



- 11 -
study were however never implemented. In view of the future changing structure of supply
sources (hydro-power, imports from Mexico and diesel generation), a new tariff study is
required. Agreement was reached during negotiations that BEL would furnish to the Bank. not
later than March 31, 1995. the Government's and BEL's recommendations based on the results
of a tariff study carried out by consultants (Annex 5.8) and that. after consultation with the Bank,
would promptly implement such recommendations. The study would analyze the options for
tariffs which more effectively reflect the cost of supply, the regulatory requirements, and provide
consumers with price signals for efficient use of electricity.
3.13   Regarding the tariff setting and approval process, the 1992 Electricity Act reflects the
previous Ordinance with no specific provisions provided for price regulation. The License
granted to the BEL sets out only general guidelines for tariff determination, such as: (1) the rates
should reflect the cost of generation, transmission and distribution; (2) the Licensee should obtain
a reasonable rate of return; and (3) the interest of the customers should be taken into account.
In this regard, complementary and subsidiary price regulations to the Electricity Act are required.
The Government agreed during negotiations that, by March 31. 1995. it would establish specific
regulations to define transparent procedures for tariff setting and approval, acceptable to the
Bank. Technical assistance from the proposed project will be used to assist the Government in
this matter.
Rural Electrification
3.14   Following the arrangement between the Government and the former BEB, BEL
undertakes electrification of rural villages on behalf of the Government and receives
reimbursement for investment costs. Between September 1989 and May 1993 the Government
provided about BZ$26 million for the electrification of 131 villages.
3.15   The policy of the new Government, that took office in July 1993, is to reduce the pace
of its financial support in rural electrification due to financial constraints and considering that
nation-wide electrification has already reached more than 80%.
Existing Power Sector Facilities
3.16   Generation Facilities. At present, BEL operates 12 diesel plants with units varying in
size from 100 kW to 3.5 MW. The total available capacity is about 38.3 MW and the firm
capacity is estimated at about 27.4 MW. The table in Annex 3.1 summarizes available and firm
generating capacity by location. The plants at Belize City and Ladyville, those at Belmopan and
San Ignacio, and those at Corozal and Orange Walk are interconnected. The newest additions
to the generating capacity are two units at Belize City and two units at Belmopan, commissioned
in mid 1993 as part of the Power I project.
3.17  In addition to its own thermal generation, BEL has, since 1990, also purchased small
amounts of electricity from the Commission Federal De Electricidad (CFE) in Mexico (about
13.8 GWh in FY92) to supply the Corozal/Orange Walk area. The present contract between BEL
and CFE allows continuous purchase of up to 5 MW at 34.5 kV. This supply has been very
reliable.

3.18   Transmission and Distribution Network. The major distribution voltages in Belize are
6.6 kV, 1 1 kV, 22 and 34.5 kV. The 11 kV distribution voltage is limited to Belmopan. The
34.5 kV voltage in the Corozal/Orange Walk area, constructed as part of the Power I project in
1991, is presently a transmission voltage and an extension of the line interconnecting the Mexican
grid to the Belize system at Santa Elena. BEL plans to maintain this line primarily as a sub-
transmission when the planned 115 kV national grid system is constructed. The developers of the
Mollejon hydroelectric plant are constructing a 115 kV transmission line, as part of their project,
from the plant site to Belize City, via Belmopan. This line will be part of the planned national
grid.
3.19   BEB's system losses have been high. In 1984, when BEB first introduced loss reduction
measures, the total losses were about 26.5 percent of net generation.  As a result of the
implementation of the Power I project, losses were reduced to some 14 percent in FY91,
however, the reduction was not sustained and in FY92 losses increased to about 16 percent. A
supplementary program of loss reduction was therefore started in March 1992, based on targets
established in consultation with Bank supervision mission. This program has achieved a reduction
of losses to about 10.5 percent by December 1993.
Electricity Sales and Peak Demand Forecast
3.20   A review of the several existing electricity demand forecasts was carried out by Bank
consultants, in cooperation with BEB, in June and November 1992 4/. The forecast was
updated in September 1993 to take into account the latest figures of generation and sales for
FY93 and the new country economic projections (Bank's most recent GDP growth forecast is 4.4
percent per year during 1994-2004).
3.21   Demand projections have been desegregated, for each load center, into residential,
industrial/commercial and street lighting. In the short-term, sales growth will remain strong due
to the expected connections to BEL's system of large industries and communities, which currently
use their own diesel generation. In the longer-term, after the connections have been made, the
sales growth rate is forecast to decline to reflect the historical long-term elasticity of electricity
consumption to GDP. For residential demand, the forecast also considers new connections based
on an annual population growth of 3 percent and increased access to electricity. Table 3.2 below
summarizes the base case forecast and Annex 3.2 provides the detailed forecasts for the different
load centers.
4/     BEB prepared forecasts in 1991 as basisfor theirfive year FY92-97 development plan, and BEL revised
these projections in 1993 as basisfor its long-term expansion plan. According to BEL's 1993 projections, electricity
sales are expected to grow at an annual rate of about 12 percent between 1994-1997. BEL bases itsforecast on
the Government 's GDP projections of about 7.4 percent a year and prepares only an aggregated forecastfor each
load center.

3.22    Two demand forecasts for the period FY93-FY2004 have been considered in the
evaluation of the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed project: a base case forecast
and a low-growth scenario. The base case forecast projects BEL's electricity sales to rise at an
average annual rate of 6.5 percent, with a corresponding 5.9 percent annual increase in peak
demand.   This reflects the expected slowdown in economic growth and a reduction in
incorporating new areas to BEL's system, compared to the average annual sales growth in FY87-
93 of about 12 percent. For sensitivity analysis the low-growth scenario has been assumed to be
20% lower than the base case.
3.23    According to the base case forecast, the system peak will increase from  24.8 MW  in
FY93 to 46.4 MW in FY2004. The corresponding electricity generation will increase from 139
GWh in FY93 to 262 GWh in FY2004. The forecast assumes a reduction in transmission and
distribution losses from about 13 percent of net generation in FY96 (including 2.5% estimated
transmission system losses in the new 115 kV system) to 10 percent in FY2004. The increase
in sales is expected to be particularly strong in Dangriga and San Pedro as a result of the
incorporation of existing citrus processing industries (Dangriga) and existing hotels (San Pedro),
as well as new developments, such as hotels and a desalination and a sewerage facility in San
Pedro. Detailed demand forecast was prepared only for 10 years (up to 2004). From 2005 to
2010 the demand growth was kept equal to the 1997-2004 annual average. Beyond 2010 it is
assumed that the demand will grow at 4% per year.
Current Sector Problems and Issues and the Second Power Development Project
3.24   There are two major issues in the power sector of Belize. First, electricity is expensive
because generation capacity is dispersed in small local systems with relatively high investment



- 14 -
and production cost requirements (all generation is thermal based and use imported diesel oil).
Second, the quality and reliability of electricity supply is low because the small size of the
systems cause relatively large voltage and frequency fluctuations, and reserve capacity is limited
in each local place (back-up generation cannot be shared).
3.25   Clearly, expansion of electricity generation cannot continue in the same manner as before
if Belize wants to adequately address these two issues. World-wide experience has shown that
integration and interconnection of electrical systems is the best solution to cope with the problems
just mentioned. The Mollejon hydroelectric development and the Second Power Development
Project would serve this purpose.
3.26   BEL's generation expansion plan shows that, if the existing isolated systems are not
interconnected, new diesel units would be required as early as 1996 in San Pedro (1 MW),
followed by 4 MW in Belize City-Ladyville in 1997 and 1.5 MW in Dangriga in 1998.
Furthermore, another 22 MW of new units would be required in the medium-term (till year 2004)
to cover the expected electricity demand. The studies carried out during preparation of the
Second Power Development Project have shown that the interconnection line with Mexico is a
better solution than continuing with diesel expansion. This interconnection will provide the
Belize power system with a large, reliable and relatively cheap source of electricity supply, and
integration of the major load centers, by creating a national trunk transmission system.
3.27   How these new sources are combined to supply the required capacity and energy is shown
in the table and charts of Annex 3.3. The table shows the capacity (power) and energy balance
for the interconnected system from 1993 to 2004 and the charts illustrate the expected annual
dispatch by sources of electricity, a typical montly dispatch (for year 2000), and a typical daily
dispatch (for a weekday of January 2000).
PART IV: THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
The Borrower
4.1   The Borrower of the proposed IBRD loan of US$11.5 million equivalent would be the
Government of Belize, who would onlend the proceeds of the loan to Belize Electricity Limited
on the same terms and conditions (para 6.8).
Belize Electricity Limited
4.2   Legal Status and Capital Structure. BEL was incorporated under the Belize Companies
Act in October 5, 1992 as a public company empowered to issue shares. BEL has an authorized
share capital of BZ$ 100,000,000 comprised of 38,000,000 Ordinary Shares of BZ$2 per share,
12,000,000 Preference Shares of BZ$2 each, and one Special Share (Golden Share) of BZ$1.
On January 7, 1993, the Government transferred the assets and liabilities of the BEB to BEL at
book value as of March 1992, in return for shares and debentures valued at BZ$57,750,001 as
follows:

Total               57,750,001     100
4.3   In October 1992, the Government offered 49 percent of the Ordinary Shares and all the
12% Convertible Debentures for sale to the general public in Belize in units of BZ$100 consisting
of 12 ordinary shares, and one debenture. After the closing of the offering in January 1993, 37.5
percent of the ordinary shares were bought by private interests while the remaining 11.5 percent
were sold to the State Social Security Board.  The Government retained the Convertible
Preference Shares, the Special Rights Preference Shares, and 51 percent of the Ordinary Shares.
4.4   The debentures are convertible at the holders option into Ordinary Shares at any time
prior to December 31, 1997 at a ratio of 38 ordinary shares per debenture. The holders may also
purchase additional Ordinary Shares for BZ$2 each up to December 31, 1997. BEL's Articles
of Association provide that each time Debentures are converted into Ordinary Shares, the same
amount of Preference Shares will automatically be converted into Ordinary Shares.
4.5    Organization and Management. Under BEL's Articles of Association, the company is
to be managed by a Board of Directors consisting of not less than three and not more than twelve
directors. Presently, the Board has nine members; seven, including the Chairman, are nominated
by the Government and two represent private sector shareholders. Currently, of the Govermnent
nominees, three are private businessmen. The Chairman of BEL is also the Chairman of Belize
Telecommunications Limited (BTL), a former Government enterprise successfully privatized in
1988. BEL took over the management and staff of BEB, including the positions of Chief and
Deputy Chief Executive Officer. BEL's CEO is a professionally qualified accountant with more
than seven years of experience in the power industry. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer is a
qualified engineer who has been on BEB's staff for more than 20 years.
4.6    BEL's organizational structure (see Annex 4.1) is satisfactory. In the years prior to its
dissolution, BEB's institutional performance considerably improved. Its staff was strengthened
by the employment of additional professionally qualified engineers. BEL is a small company and
its activities are organized into two principal departments: (i) engineering; and (ii) finance and
administration. Each is headed by a general manager who reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
In addition, the Manager for Customer Services, the Manager for Data Processing and the
Manager for Human Resource Management report directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
Twelve District Managers report to three Area Superindendents who report to the General



- 16 -
Manager F&A. The eight senior officials of BEL are dedicated professionals, many of whom
have post graduate degrees in engineering or business administration from overseas universities.
4.7    Staffing and Manpower Development. BEL employs about 394 people of which 14 (e.g.
3.5%) are professionally qualified engineers. The number of customers and MWh sold per
employee are, in round figures, 83 and 300 respectively. This profile compares favorably with
utilities with similar characteristics in the region. Under IBRD financed Power I Project, the
following manpower development and training needs were carried out: seven engineers completed
advanced courses in engineering, system operation and maintenance, computerized planning, and
business administration; one employee received training as Training Officer; and a number of
supervisory level staff completed courses in electrical and mechanical diesel operation and
maintenance. As a result, BEL's institutional performance improved considerably.
4.8    The implementation of the proposed Second Power Development Project would require
additional skills and qualifications in new areas, such as operation and maintenance of
transmission lines and submarine cables, in load dispatching and environmental issues.
Additionally, the downscaling of the diesel plants may result in some staff becoming redundant.
As part of the project implementation plan, BEL will prepare, and thereafter carry out, a program
for the training of staff required to implement, operate and maintain the proposed project,
according to an agreed project implementation plan and schedule. The proposed project will
finance this training and also training in cost of service calculations and tariffs, another area of
increasing importance to BEL.
4.9    Financial Organization and Accounting. BEL produces monthly financial statements
which are compared with budgets. BEL's accounting is largely computerized although parts of
the system, such as accounts receivable and payroll, are not integrated with the general ledger.
A data processing specialist, financed from funds from the IBRD Loan No. 2749 (Power I
project), reported inadequacies in BEL's computer systems, including accounting applications,
and a pressing need to integrate all BEL's computer systems and to purchase required hardware
and software. As part of the project implementation plan, BEL will submit to the Bank and
thereafter carry out an action plan for the integration of its data processing systems and the
purchase of the required hardware and software, according to an agreed project implementation
plan and schedule. EIB is considering financing this program. In an effort to strengthen the
company's financial management, BEL appointed a new General Manager for Finance and
Administration in June 1993. The new Manager was previously the General Manager for
Engineering. He has an MBA, private sector experience, and, prior to his appointment, played
a significant role in recent successful efforts to improve BEL's financial and investment planning.
4.10   Billing and Collection. On March 31, 1993, accounts receivable were at a very good
level equal to 36 days of sales. The Government has met its agreement under Loan 2749-BEZ
to ensure that public sector bills are paid within 60 days. This has been an important factor in
keeping receivables at a low level.
4.11   Auditing. The annual financial audits of BEL will be carried out by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank, who also audited the accounts of BEB. BEL agreed during negotiations
that it would engage independent auditors. satisfactory to the Bank. and that BEL's audited



- 17 -
accounts. including SOE's and the Special Account. will be submitted to the Bank not later than
four months after the end of its fiscal year. BEB's past record in this matter has not been fully
satisfactory but it has improved in recent years. It is expected that performance will further
improve by the recent appointment of a new qualified General Manager for Finance and
Administration.
4.12   Income Taxes. Unlike BEB, which as a Government statutory body was exempt from
income taxes, BEL has to pay income taxes. The Government has indicated, however, that it will
take steps to make sure that BEL will be liable for income taxes on its taxable income only from
April 1, 1993 and that, for the first three fiscal years thereafter, BEL will be liable at a 10% rate.
The rate will be increased by 5% annually thereafter to a maximum rate of 35%, beginning on
April 1, 2000. 35 % level of taxation is standard for private companies in Belize. BEL will also
be permited to offset the accumulated losses of BEB against its taxable income.
4.13   Insurance. BEL carries insurance coverage for all its assets in operation, general plants
and buildings. Renewal of insurance for transmission and distribution lines and substations is
becoming extremely difficult in the Caribbean region due to substantial losses caused by hurricane
Andrew. BEL is using its best efforts to secure adequate insurance. BEL is also studying the
viability of establishing a reserve fund to deal with this problem.
PART V: THE PROJECT
Background
5.1    Participation of the Bank in Belize's Power Sector development dates back to 1986 when
a US$7.5 million loan (2749-BEZ) was approved to assist in meeting the sector's immediate
needs, specially to strengthen institutionally the Belize Electrify Board (BEB) and to reduce the
substantial level of distribution losses. The Power I Project was part of BEB's 1987-1993
investment program and comprised five major components, namely: (i) distribution expansion and
improvements; (ii) installation of new diesel-electric generating sets; (iii) technical assistance
and training;  (iv) pre-investment studies; and (v) consultant services for engineering and
construction supervision.
5.2    As the Power I Project was on schedule and progressing satisfactorily, the Government
and BEB informed the Bank in late 1991 of their interest in having the Bank's financial assistance
in developing an interconnection with the Mexican Power System in the State of Quintana Roo.
Subsequently the Bank assisted in the preparation of a power project - a Second Power
Development Project (Power II) - which would continue the institutional strengthening of Belize's
Power Sector and structure its main trunk transmission system around the interconnection with
Mexico. The proposed project is part of the medium-term expansion program (1995-2004) of
Belize's Power System.



- 18 -
Rationale for Continued Bank Involvement
5.3    The Power I Project was successfully completed, on schedule, at the end of 1993. The
objectives of this project were achieved, both tangible physical works as well as for institutional
strengthening. The Govermment of Belize has moved firmly in the direction of economic reform
and private participation in government owned enterprises. The electricity sector has been
reformed, the private sector is developing a hydroelectric scheme and, as indicated in paragraphs
3.3 to 3.6, the Government has establish BEL as an independent corporation. Furthermore, the
Government has already sold part of its interest in BEL to private investors. Necessary
conditions for continuing the Bank's support of Belize power sector have been met. The
proposed project constitutes a strategic component of the long-term plan to develop an
interconnected system that will provide a reliable and economical electricity supply to Belize.
Objectives and Description
5.4   The main purpose of the proposed project is to integrate Belize's five major load centers,
hitherto isolated, into an integrated national power system and tap new supply sources of
relatively cheap electricity. This would be achieved by means of the interconnection with Mexico
and the transmission system associated with the 25 MW BOT hydroelectric scheme at Mollejon
on the Macal River. When completed, the Belize trunk transmission system will encompass 286
km of 115 kV lines and associated substations, and will tie-in the main populated areas of the
country.
5.5    A subsidiary purpose is to continue support of the current re-structuring of the power
sector to increase efficiency and expand private investment in the sector. Additionally, the
proposed project aims at strengthening BEL through provision of technical assistance and
training.
5.6    As agreed with GOB and BEL, the proposed project will consist of eight major
components, namely:
(i)    136 km, 115 kV interconnection transmission line with Mexico (Group 1);
(ii)   115 kV substations and Dangriga connection to the Mollejon line (Group 2);
(iii)  Interconnection of San Pedro (Ambergris Cay) to the 115 kV transmission from
Mexico (Group 3);
(iv)   Energy Management System  (EMS) and Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) and communication systems (Group 4);
(v)    Operation and Maintenance Vehicles, Equipment and Tools (Group 5);
(vi)   Environmental Clean Up of BEL's Diesel Power Plants;
(vii)   Consultant Services for:



- 19 -
Engineering and Project Management;
Cost of Service and Tariff Study;
Diesel Plant Environmental Mitigation Study;
Monitoring of Implementation of Environmental Action Plan
(viii) Training & Technical Assistance
A detailed description of the physical components of the proposed project is presented in Annex
5.1. TORs for consultancy services are included in Annexes 5.7, 5.8 and 5.10. The physical
components of the Project are illustrated in IBRD Map No. 25745.
5.7   Two other components of the expansion plan are the Mollejon hydroelectric power plant
and the expanded power supply from Mexico. These two components will be completed and
fully operational when the Second Power Development Project is completed. When all
components of the expansion plan are in place, Belize's electricity demand will be covered from
three sources, the Mollejon hydroelectric plant, the supply from Mexico and the local diesel
units, mainly for peak load and as local generation reserve.
The Mollejon Hydroelectric Development
5.8   The Mollejon hydroelectric develpment is a run-of-river 25 MW hydroelectric power
plant (three Francis units of 8.4 MW each) at Mollejon in the Macal river (a tributary of the
Belize river); its associated 139 km, 115 kV transmission line from the plant site to Belize City;
and three intermidiate substations. The average yearly energy production has been estimated at
110 GWh. From historical records, in a dry year, production could be as low as 72 GWh and,
in a wet year, as high as 137 GWh. The plant has a small reservoir with a live storage of
845,000 cubic meters for daily regulation. Annex 5.2 shows the basic technical characteristics
of the Mollejon plant and the expected power and energy production (derived from 10-year
hydrological historical information).
5.9   The Mollejon project is being implemented by a private group of developers under BOT
and power purchase agreements with the Government and BEL (price terms and other conditions
are explained in paras. 6.4 and 6.5). Construction of the hydroelectric plant and its associated
transmission system is underway. Completion of the first unit is expected by December 1994 and
all three units will be completed by March 1995. The estimated total cost of the project is US$
59 million, including about US$ 6 million of financing costs. IFC and CDC will be part of the
financing package of Mollejon, once a Master Financial Agreement is signed. Due to the
interrelation of Mollejon and the proposed project, IFC and IBRD have work in close
coordination during project preparation.
The Mexican Power Supply
5.10   The power and energy output of the Mollejon plant is highly variable. To firm up the
capacity of Mollejon, and supply additional power and energy for the interconnected system, a
key component of the proposed project is a long-term electricity supply contract with Mexico.
BEL, with the support of the Government, has pursued actively this matter. The Comision



- 20 -
Federal de Electricidad (CFE), CFE has answered positively the request of BEL to supply up to
25 MW at 115 kV at the Mexican border.
5.11   Power and energy are presently being purchased from the CFE and being utilized in the
Corozal-Orange Walk area. The power is delivered at 34.5 kV. The present contract allows the
purchase of up to 5 MW at 34.5 kV. CFE has indicated that this level can be increased to 6 MW
without additional installations. In order to effect the larger supply requested by BEL to cover
its 10-year demand requirements, the CFE plans to construct a second 115 kV transmission line
between CFE's Ticul and Xul Ha Substations. Once that is completed in 1998, CFE will
provide BEL with additional 12 MW, for a total of 18 MW. Additional installations would be
required to allow BEL to purchase the maximum 25 MW requested. CFE estimates that these
installations would be available in 2003 (price terms and other conditions are explained in para.
6.6).
Status of Project Preparation
5.12   Project preparation is well advanced. For the transmission components, an electrical
system design and cost estimate have been made5/. In addition, a generation dispatch simulation
and production costing on the interconnection with Mexico and the supplies to Dangriga and San
Pedro_/ have been completed. A line route selection and environmental impact assessment has
been carried out for the interconnection with Mexico7/. The final route has been determined
as part of the EIA. An economic technical and environmental impact analysis has also been done
of the submarine link to Ambergris Cayl/. Work is presently underway on route survey for
the 115 kV line to Mexico and the 34.5 kV line to Dangriga. Plan and profile drawings for these
lines will be available by December 1994. These drawings will be accompanied by a soils
investigation analysis. As a condition for disbursements for the 115 kV transmission line goods
and works (Group 1). BEL should have completed all Project transmission line and substation
land surveys. identified all rights-of-wav. and completed easements and land acquisition
procedures. as required for the first year of Droiect construction.
5.13   BEL will engage a consulting firm to perform final engineering design of the physical
components of the Project and provide project management services during implementation. The
firm will also carry out the basic designs and specifications for the dispatch center, the

system. It is expected that the consulting firm will be engaged by June 1994 and complete its
services for final engineering design by January 1995. The services for project management and
supervision will start in January 1995 and will extend for a period of approximately 30 months.
Project Cost Estimate
5.14   The project cost at December 1993 prices, including physical and price contingencies,
and excluding taxes and duties, is estimated at the equivalent of US$29.7 million, of which
US$26.5 million (89%) would be the foreign cost. Total financing requirements, including
US$3.3 million interest during construction, would be US$33 million. Annex 5.4 shows a
detailed cost estimate, while a project cost summary is given in the following table:

5.15   Engineering and project management costs have been estimated at about 10% of direct
project costs plus physical contingencies, which is in line for projects of the nature of the
proposed project. Physical contingencies of about 15% have been estimated for local costs,
which are essentially labor costs and local transport. For foreign costs, which represent mainly



- 22 -
materials and equipment, a contingency allowance of about 10% has been added. For price
contingencies, a 5 % overall allowance has been considered adequate, given the fact that very little
inflationary pressure is foreseen in the next coming years that would affect the construction cost
of the proposed project.
5.16   The project cost estimate has been established using prudent cost estimation both for
substation equipment and for transmission line construction, as of December 1993. For instance,
the 115 kV transmission line single circuit wood pole-mounted has been estimated at US$45,000
per km and for 34.5 kV line at US$25,000 per km. These unit costs are well within recent
historical and current cost levels. For substation equipment, the consultants have used pro-forma
price quotations and catalog prices, which are generally higher than prices obtained in ICB. On
the other hand, the cost for environmental clean up of diesel plants should be considered as a
preliminary estimate derived from  a general, non-detail, spot checks in the field.  An
environmental mitigation study (Annex 5.10) will determine detailed scope and costs.
Project Financing Plan
5.17   The project financing plan is shown in the table below, and details of the agreed packages
are given in Annex 5.4. In this project funding scheme the IBRD loan would be US$11.5 million
equivalent, all of it for foreign currency project items.

5.19   BEL has established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), properly staffed and funded;
and has appointed a Project Coordinator-Manager in charge of the unit, having qualifications and
experience satisfactory to the Bank. The Project Coordinator will be accountable to BEL's Chief
Executive Officer. Project management, preparation of detailed engineering design, preparation
of tender documents, evaluation of bids, supervision of construction and implementation of the
environmental mitigation action plan, as well as the project's accounting required for the
execution of the physical components of the Project would be performed by the PIU with the
assistance of an international consulting firm. Annex 5.6 shows the planned organization chart
of the PIU. During negotiations BEL a2reed to maintain during project implementation the PIU
properly staffed and funded: and that it would carry out the project according to an agreed
implementation plan and schedule (Annex 5.5).
5.20  Project management will require an overall coordination of project engineering design;
preparation of bidding documents, bids evaluation and contracting; procurement, storage and
handling of materials and equipment for the transmission lines; and supervision of project's
works. Construction of project components will be done by competent foreign contractors.
Consultant Services
5.21   The proposed project includes consultancy services to be engaged by BEL following the
Bank's guidelines and under terms of reference accceptable to the Bank for the following tasks:
(i)    Engineering  design, technical specifications, project management and
construction supervision, for an estimated total of about 150 man-months. Terms
of reference for the engagement of these consultants appear in Annex 5.7;



- 24 -
(ii)    Cost of service and tariff study, for which about 12 man-months are required.
Terms of reference for the engagement of these consultants appear in Annex 5.8;
(iii)   Clean-up scope study of diesel-electric power stations and supervision of
mitigation measures, for which about 12 man-months are required. Terms of
reference for the engagement of these consultants appear in Annex 5.10; and
(iv)   Monitoring of Environmental Action Plan (EAP), for which about 12 man-
months are required. Terms of reference for the engagement of these consultants
appear in Annex 5.11.
Institutional Strengthening, Training and Technical Assistance
5.22   A comprehensive two-year training and technical assistance program would continue the
program developed during the Power I Project and would aim at further strengthening BEL's
administrative and technical capabilities. Training will be given, inter alia, in the following areas
(A specific program will be prepared for this matter; see also paras. 4.7 and 4.8):
(i)    Operation and Maintenance of high voltage transmission lines and substations.
(This program will be prepared in coordination with the suppliers of equipment
and the contractors);
(ii)   System operations and dispatch;
(iii)   Cost of Service and Tariffs;
(iv)   Commercialization (meter reading, billing, customer services, etc.);
(v)    Distribution Planning and Mapping; and
(vi)   Environmental Impact Evaluation and Monitoring.
5.23   In addition, the following technical assistance, inter alia, will be provided:
(i)    Electrical System Operation Studies (load flow, short circuit and stability).
Consultants will provide and install a PC network analysis software package and
train BEL's personnel on its use.
(ii)    Generation Dispatch and Production Costing Simulation.  Consultants will
provide and install a PC generation dispatch and production costing simulation
package, adapted to BEL's system conditions. Consultants will train BEL's
personnel on its use.



- 25 -
(iii)    Consultant will train BEL's personnel in the use of CAD to produce and update
engineering drawings, plans, profiles, substations layouts, single-line diagrams,
etc. BEL's PC mapping system will be used for this training.
5.24   Technical assistance will also be provided to advice the Government in establishing
complementary price regulations to the Electricity Act.
Procurement
5.25   A country procurement assessment was carried out in May/June 1993. Although the
assessment concluded that the country does not have comprehensive procurement regulations,
BEL personnel involved in the Power I Project are knowledgeable on Bank procurement
procedures. Additionally, BEL's PIU will be supported by qualified international consultants on
all bidding and procurement process.

5.27   Contracts for the supply and construction of the 115 kV transmission line component of
the project, including all necessary civil works, will be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank's procurement guidelines. Operation and
maintenance vehicles, equipments and tools will be procured through LIB in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Both ICB and LIB will use Bank standard bidding documents.
5.28   The environmental clean up of BEL's diesel plants will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). Since this component involves a number of jobs of relatively limited
scope in widely separated localities, it is foreseen that foreign contractors would need to use as
much as possible local subcontractors.
5.29   Consultant services will be contracted following Bank guidelines for selection of
consultants. Individual consultants for technical assistance and training will be hired following
Bank guidelines for selection of consultants. Small quantities of training materials and equipment
which could not be packaged in contracts of US$25,000 or more, and not exceeding an aggregate
amount of US$50,000, will be procured through international and local shopping, following Bank
procurement guidelines.
5.30   Bank prior review of proposed invitations, award recommendations, and final contracts
will be required for: (i) all contracts for works and goods procured under ICB and LIB; and (ii)
all contracts for consulting services except those with consulting firms estimated to cost below
US$25,000. For consulting services from firms estimated to cost below US$25,000, the Bank
will review ex-ante the terms of reference and ex-post, relevant supporting documentation on
selective basis during supervision. As a result of these procedures, the Bank's prior review will
cover about 95% of the contracts financed by the Bank.
Disbursements
5.31   The proceeds of the Bank loan are expected to be disbursed over a four-year period. The
disbursement schedule reflects a careful evaluation during project preparation of the intervals
needed to perform the different tasks included in the proposed project. Proceeds of the proposed
Bank loan would be used to finance:
(i)    100% of foreign expenditures for purchase of equipment and materials for the
115 kV Mexico Border-Belize City transmission line, and purchase of vehicles,
equipment and tools for transmission system operation and maintenance;
(ii)   100% of foreign expenditures for construction works for the 115 kV Mexico
Border-Belize City transmission line;
(iii)   100% of foreign and local (ex-factory) expenditures for purchase of equipment
and materials for (a) environmental clean up at diesel power stations; and (b)
training equipment and material; and 85 % of locally procured imported items;
(iv)   100% of total expenditures for works for the environmental clean up at diesel
power stations; and



- 27 -
(v)    100% of total expenditures for engineering services, technical assistance and
training.
Retroactive financing, up to US$500,000, for expenditures incurred after January 31, 1994, for
consultancy services necessary for the final detailed engineering design of the project, a tariff
study, and technical assistance to GOB for electricity pricing regulations, would be included.
5.32   Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for payments against contracts
whose value is less than US$25,000 equivalent. Claims for expenditures of these lesser amounts
would be subject to presentation of a statement of expenditures for which the supporting
documentation would be kept by the borrower for Bank review, on selective basis, during
supervision. A Special Account would be established in the Central Bank of Belize with a deposit
of US$750,000, representing three months of estimated expenditures. Periodic replenishment
would be made to this special account against withdrawal applications received from BEL and
supported by such documents as the Bank would require. The Borrower would be required to
have annual audits for the project accounts, Special Account, and withdrawals based on statement
of expenditures. The closing date of the loan would be December 31, 1997, six months after
estimated completion of the Project.
Environmental Considerations
5.33   During project preparation, environmental assessments (EAs) of the 115 kV transmission
line and of connection to Ambergris Caye were carried out. In the latter case the study included
evaluation of several supply alternatives (i.e., submarine cable crossing, overhead line crossing,
expansion of local diesel generation). The submarine cable was the preferred solution from both
economic and environmental viewpoits. Consultants concluded that with proper precautions in
routing and construction only minimal environmental impact would occur. The right of way for
the overland segments will require very limited clearance of trees and bushes. No natural
reserves will be affected. For the submarine cable, care will be taken during construction to limit
dredging activity and sediment fouling. A study of baseline conditions in the channel between the
mainland and Ambergris Caye will be conducted prior to construction (see para. 5.35).
Monitoring and evaluation are foreseen during construction (see para. 5.36). Annex 5.9
describes in more detail the environmental issues and the recommendations of the EAs.
5.34   On the basis of land surveys which are underway, a plan to secure land for the ROW and
the final siting of substations will be established. BEL will also interact with the appropriate
agencies (e.g., Ministries of Tourism and Environment - MTE, Natural Resources - MNR, and
Housing and Urban Development - MHUD) to secure the necessary reviews, clearances and
licenses, ensuring compatibility of the ROW with other land use development proposals,
avoidance of protected areas and sites of archaeological interest, the right to fell trees and clear
mangroves as needed. Surveys of the ROW by the Department of Archaeology/MTE and the
Forestry Department/MNR will be carried out.
5.35   Baseline data on current patterns and water quality in the San Pedro crossing will be
collected during a four-week period through a study to be financed by the CDB. The study will
also define a monitoring and evaluation plan for the marine environment in the area of influence



- 28 -
of the submarine cable and will establish parameters against which monitoring results will be
evaluated during construction.
5.36   During the pre-construction phase, an international consulting firm will be employed to
prepare an integrated monitoring plan for the project. It will also provide orientation to BEL's
Environmental Unit and carry out monitoring and evaluation activities in order to verify
contractors' compliance with the environmental safeguards and mitigation measures foreseen in
the EIAs and incorporated into tender documents.
5.37   During project preparation, a preliminary evaluation was carried out of enviromnental
problems in BEL's major diesel plants. Terms of reference were prepared for a pollution
mitigation program to be financed under the proposed project (see Annex 5. 11). Consultants will
be employed to carry out environmental audits and design clean-up plans for seven of BEL's
thermal power plants (i.e., Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan, which are expected to provide base-
load power, and San Pedro, Dangriga, Corozal and Orange Walk, which are expected to operate
on a stand-by basis after implementation of the Second Power Development Project).
Project Risks
5.38   There are three types of physical risks that could affect the transmission lines and
substations included in the proposed project, namely: hurricanes, salt-fouling of insulation, and
corrosion of conductor and line hardware. Due to potential for tropical storms and hurricanes
in Belize, a high wind factor will be taken into consideration in all line designs. It has been
determined that winds of 240 km per hour (150 mph) with gusts to 265 km per hour (165 mph)
will have to be used as the design standard in order to ensure the structural integrity of the lines.
Salt fouling of insulation and corrosion of conductor and line hardware are phenomena likely to
affect transmission lines and substations sited near the sea coast, particularly if there is a long dry
season which allows accumulation of salt on surfaces, as is the case in Belize. A special study
will be done on these problems (see Annex 5.7) to minimize their impact on the transmission and
substation facilities included in the Project. Design of insulation, selection of conductor and line
hardware will be governed by the result of this study.
5.39   The project cost estimate has been established in a prudent manner by reputable
consultants, with appropriate contingency allowances, so that there is little risk of cost overruns.
The type of facilities included in the project are not subject during implementation to unusual
construction risks, on the contrary these are straightforward jobs for which minimal obstacles can
be foreseen both with supply of materials and equipment, and with labor. Delays in project
execution could arise due to BEL's lack of experience with the type of power facilities included
in the project, such as 115 kV transmission lines and substations, and submarine cable. To
minimize this risk, provision has been made to engage engineering consultants to assist BEL in
the implementation of the proposed project. BEL's staff will also be assisted by Bank's staff in
matters related to Bank procedures.
5.40   During project operation the major risk is BEL's financial performance. If expected sales
do not materialize, and BEL cannot take the available energy from Mollejon, or Macal river
hydrology is less favorable than expected, obligations under the power purchase contract for



- 29 -
Mollejon could affect negatively BEL financial condition. If this should occur BEL would
postpone its planned non-project expending and, if necessary, make temporary use of bank
overdraft facilities.
PART VI: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
BEL's Past Operating Results and Present Financial Position
6.1    BEL's Sales and Generation forecast and Investment Plan are presented in Annexes 6.1
and 6.2, respectively. BEB and BEL's past and projected 1990-2003 income statements, balance
sheets and cash flow statements are presented in Annex 6.3. The assumptions used in the
preparation of the financial projections are included also as part of Annex 6.3.
6.2    After being unable to service its debt and sustaining operating losses for many years,
BEB's finances began to improve in FY85 as a result of tariff increases, the conversion of debt
to equity by Government, lower fuel prices and efficiency improvements. BEB's financial
performance has since been good despite a 7.5% tariff reduction in FY89. The growth in kWh
sales has been strong and the average annual growth rate between FY89 and FY93 was about
12.8%. Operating costs per kWh sold were about 34 BZ cents in FY93 compared to 38.5 BZ
cents in FY85. Rates of return for the five year period FY89 to FY93 range from 3% in 1989
to 10.6%. BEL's 1993 net operating income was BZ$7.6 million compared to BZ$5.0 million
in FY92.
6.3    BEL's audited balance sheet at March 31, 1993 is summarized below. BEL's financial
position was satisfactory with a debt/equity ratio of 54:46, and a current ratio of 1.4.

Franchise and Power Purchase Agreement for the Mollejon Plant
6.4   In April 1991 Government granted a franchise to a joint venture of two US companies
to construct and operate a 20 MW run of river hydroelectric plant on the Macal river as well as
a 139 kilometer 115 KV transmission line to Belize City, Ladyville and other load centers. The
Franchise Agreement provides that, forty years after the commercial operation date of the plant,
the ownership of the hydroelectric plant will be transferred to the Government or such parties as
the Government may designate. After the construction of the transmission line and associated
substations, the Agreement also provides for ownership to be transferred to BEL with a nominal
charge of US$1.00.
6.5    A 40 year power purchase agreement, dated April 19, 1991, between BEB (subsequently
assigned to BEL) and Belize Electricity Company Limited (BECOL, the company formed by the
developers) provides for BEL to pay an annual fixed amount, in equal monthly installments,
based on energy equal to 110 GWh in FY1996, 115 GWh in FY1997 and 1998, and 120 GWh
up to FY2004, at a rate of 8.75 UScents per kWh. Excess energy is to be purchased at 7 US
cents per kWh. After FY2005, the fixed payments will be eliminated and BEL will pay only for
the energy actually supplied, on a take-or-pay basis. BEL is to pay the producers for the
operation and maintenance of the hydro facilities an amount equal to five percent of its gross
electricity revenues from the resale of the energy purchased2/. Under a Guarantee Agreement,
the Goverrnent guarantees the timely performance of BEL's obligations.
Power Purchase Agreement with Comisi6n Federal de Electricidad (Mexico)
6.6    Under an existing agreement between BEL and Comisi6n Federal de Electricidad (CFE),
BEL is entitled to purchase up to 5 MW from CFE. A long-term electricity supply contract
providing for larger electricity purchases by BEL is essential for the proposed Power II Project.
BEL is negotiating a contract with CFE for the supply of up to 25 MW. CFE has requested that
BEL pay US$1.1 million in order to finance the capacity increase of the Mexican facilities
necessary to permit this export of electric power to Belize (mainly a transmission link at 115 kV).
BEL will finance this investment out of its internally generated funds or through a commercial
bank loan. Power supply to Belize would be charged at the CFE tariff for supplies at 35 to 220
kV to its Peninsular region. The current (December 1993) rates for the Mexican supply vary
from US$0.032 during base load time to US$0.058 during peak load time (6 p.m to 10 p.m
Monday to Saturday), while the monthly peak demand is charged at about US$8.8 per kW
(Annex 5.3 shows the structure of the Mexican tariff). The signing of an extended long-term
power supply contract with CFE. Mexico. on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
would be a condition for Loan effectiveness.
6.7    Given that BEL's future system demand will be covered mainly by supplies from
Mollejon and Mexico, and that the proposed project is only one part of an expansion plan in
91     7he cost of the Mollejon energy, at delivery points in the high voltage substations, is estimated at about
USCents 10/kWh (at 0.95 average power factor), including 5% of the present average retail tariff of
USCents 19.2/kWh for operation and maintenance, and 3.5% estimated transmission losses.



- 31 -
which these supplies are an integral part, an additional event of default that would authorize
suspension of disbursements of the Loan would be that either BECOL or CFE fails to supply.
under the foregoing agreements. the electricity reguired by BEL to meet consumer demand. and
BEL is unable to meet the deficiency from either CFE or BECOL or any other source.

6.9   In the financing plan, it has been assumed that the US$11.5 million Bank loan (BZ$ 22.8
million) to the Government (at variable lending rate, over 17 years, including a five year grace
period, and equal annual principal payments) will be available to BEL for the same amount and
with the same conditions. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and
BEL. satisfactory to the Bank. would be a condition for loan effectiveness.
6.10  It has been assumed that the US$5.2 million (BZ$10.3 million) CDC Loan would be
made to BEL at an 9.5% interest rate over 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with
equal annual loan repayments. Subject to prior management approval, CDC expects to conduct
its project appraisal in June 1994. Based on this timing, loan approval is expected in July 1994.

As a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan. CDC's Board should have approved a loan
to finance the cost of the 115 kV substations and the Dangriga connection components of
propQsed project.
6.11   The CDB loan would be for US$7.5 million (BZ$14.8 million) at CDB's standard
variable interest rate (currently about 7.5%) with a maturity of 18 years, including 3 years grace
period. CDB concluded its appraisal at the same time as the Bank appraisal. Board approval is
expected in July 1994.
6.12   The EIB loan would be for US$3.2 million (BZ$6.3 million) at a 3% interest rate with
a maturity of 18 years, including a 3 year grace period. EIB appraisal will be conducted in
March 1994. Board approval is expected in May 1994.
6.13   An additional event of default that would authorize suspension of disbursements of the
Loan would be that the CDB or CDC or EIB loan agreements shall have failed to become
effective by March 31. 1995.
Electricity Rates
6.14   To help finance its capital spending program during the 95-98 project construction period
and maintain a sound financial position, during negotiations it was agreed that BEL would
maintain its electricity rates at a level sufficient to earn a rate of return on its average net fixed
assets in operation. revalued from time to time when required by the Bank. of not less than 7%
in FY96 and thereafter. This would repeat the rate of 7% under Loan 2749-BEZ. It was also
agreed that (i) before January 1 of each fiscal year. BEL would furnish to the Bank a preliminary
estimate of the rate of return for the current fiscal year and for the next fiscal year and  ) if the
estimates indicate that BEL would not meet the rate of return reguirements. it will promptly take
all necessary measures to meet such reguirements. The Government a2reed to promptly ta-k
such measures, as may be reguired, to enable BEL to comply with the foregoing rate of return
requirements.
Financial Forecast
6.15   As a consequence of the transfer of BEB's assets and liabilities to BEL (para. 4.2) in
return for debentures and shares, the revenues from electricity operations will be required to meet
additional cash outlays for debenture interest and dividends declared on the preference and
ordinary shares as well as income taxes. However, BEL's (formerly BEB) cash flow from
operations increased about 2.5 times between FY90 and FY93 as a result of strong sales growth.
BEL is expected to be able to finance about 38% of its total investment needs between FY94 and
FY98, the project implementation period. The debt service ratio is forecast to stay at or above
a strong level of 1.86 during this period. After project completion, BEL is expected to be able
to completely finance from internally generated funds a much smaller investment program in the
succeeding years to FY2003.
6.16   To protect BEL's financial viability BEL would not incur any new debt (other than for
the Project) without the prior approval of the Bank unless its future debt service coverage ratio



- 33 -
is 1.5 or hi2her. It was also agreed that BEL would not undertake any investments in excess of
US$500.000. until completion of the Second Power Development Project. without the approval
of the Bank.
Project Monitoring
6.17   Project execution would be monitored against target dates as shown in the implementation
plan and schedule of Annex 5.5 and BEL's operational. financial and managerial nerformance
would be monitored through performance indicators (Annex 6.4).
PART VII: PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
7.1   The proposed project, which is a follow-up to the recently completed Power I project
(Loan No 2749-BEZ) comprises three components: (1) a 136 km, 115 kV overhead transmission
line from the Mexican border to Belize City, creating, together with the transmission line from
the Mollejon hydro plant currently under construction, a national grid system connecting Belize's
main cities; (2) the incorporation of Dangriga load center to the national grid through a 56 km,
34.5 kV overhead transmission line; and (3) the incorporation of San Pedro load center to the
national grid through a 21 km, 34.5 kV submarine cable.
7.2   The proposed project would, together with the Mollejon line, interconnect all the main
economic centers (95% of total demand) and provide electricity supply which would be more
cost-effective, reliable and environmentally clean, than the current system composed of small-
scale independent diesel generation in all the load centers. The project would facilitate the
continued economic development of Belize by making electricity available to industrial,
commercial and residential customers who are willing to pay for it, and by reducing the need for
consumers to purchase and operate private power plants. The proposed project would also
provide for the clean up of environmental contamination caused by oil spills from existing diesel
plants. Additionally, the project would support the Government of Belize's on-going efforts to
increase the efficiency of the power sector, evidenced by the privatization of BEL, through
technical assistance and studies. The project is considered economically justified and the
estimated economic internal rate of return of about 21 percent is not very sensitive to moderate
variations in the key economic parameters. The following paragraphs summarize the Bank's
economic evaluation of the proposed project. Further details are provided in Annexes 7.1 to 7.3.
Least-Cost Plan
7.3   In 1990, BEB's foreign consultants, financed under the Power I Project, studied the
feasibility of electricity generation from renewable energy sources. The study concluded that
hydroelectric development in the Macal river would result in substantial savings over the
continued use of diesel generation in the Belmopan and Belize City systems. The study further
found that generation from excess bagasse from the sugar factory in the Corozal/Orange Walk
area would be more cost effective than using local diesel generation to supply the Corozal/Orange



- 34 -
Walk system unless power could be purchased from the Mexican grid. The study finally
concluded that generation from other renewable sources, such as solar and wind, is not
economically viable at this time.
7.4    Following the study findings, the Corozal and Orange Walk systems were interconnected
with Mexico through a 34.5 kV overhead transmission line, financed under the Power I Project,
and the Government negotiated a 5 MW supply contract with Mexico. This system has been
operating successfully since June 1991.
7.5    Also in line with the study recommendations, the Government pursued the development
of the hydroelectric potential of the Macal river by negotiating a BOT contract with a private
investor group (see para 5.9). BEB subsequently signed a 40 year take-or-pay power purchase
contract with the developers. The transmission line from the Mollejon hydroelectric plant will
link the electrical systems of Belmopan and Belize City and initially displace most of the diesel
generation required in this area. However, as demand for electricity grows, given the variability
of the Mollejon output, the level of diesel generation capacity needed would start increasing soon
after the commissioning of the hydroelectric plant at the beginning of 1995.
7.6    During 1992 and 1993 BEB first, and then its successor company BEL, studied, as part
of their expansion planning, the technical and economic feasibility of (1) building a 115 kV
overhead transmission line from the Mexican border to Belize City, where it would connect to
the Mollejon line, creating national interconnected system; (2) incorporating Dangriga to the
interconnected system; and (3) incorporating San Pedro to the interconnected system. Analyses
carried out by consultants confirmed that expanded electricity imports from Mexico, facilitated
by linking the Belize system withn the Mexican grid via a 115 kV transmission line, is the least-
cost alternative to firm up the supply from the Mollejon hydroelectric plant and complement the
future power and energy requirements of the Belize City-Belmopan systems. The consultants also
concluded that the connection of the Dangriga and San Pedro (Ambergris Cay-Island) systems
to the national grid, would enable the substitution of diesel generation with cheaper electricity
imports from Mexico.
7.7    Egualizing Discount Rate (EDR). The analyses carried out by the Bank, taking account
of, inter alia, the Bank's November 1993 crude oil price forecast and the updated project cost
estimates, confirmed the consultants' findings. Two alternative schemes to meet the balance
between the forecast electricity demand and Mollejon supply were analyzed. The EDR was
computed for the proposed interconnection scheme, versus the alternative scheme of expanding
local diesel generation. In the interconnection scheme the proposed project would complement
the hydro supply in Belize City/Belmopan and create a national grid which would allow BEL to
displace diesel generation in Dangriga and San Pedro by imports from Mexico. The results show
that the proposed interconnection scheme is the least cost supply expansion alternative for Belize.
The equalizing discount rate was calculated at about 18 percent, which is higher than the
estimated 12 percent opportunity cost of capital.
7.8    The results show that the production cost of the interconnection alternative is about 30
percent lower, on a net present value basis, than the corresponding cost of the diesel alternative,
using a real discount rate of 12 percent (calculated over the period FY95-FY2012). The levelized



- 35 -
production cost of the interconnection scheme of about 9.6 US cents/kWh compares favorably
with the levelized production cost of the local small-scale diesel operation of approximately 12.2
US cents/kWh. Of the 9.6 US cents/kWh, about 8.9 US cents are attributable to the proposed
project (3.9 US cents from investments, 4.8 cents from the purchase price, and 0.2 cents from
O&M) and the rest to the operating and maintenance of diesels which would be retained mainly
for back-up.
7.9    The choice of the proposed interconnection project as the least-cost alternative remains
valid over a range of values for key economic parameters. Even the most pessimistic of the cases
tested produce EDRs above the 12 percent estimated opportunity cost of capital. For instance:
(1) a 20 percent increase in the capital costs of the proposed project combined with a 20 percent
increase in the cost of Mexican imports reduces the EDR to 14 percent; and (2) a 20 percent
decline in diesel fuel prices reduces the EDR to some 15 percent.
7.10   EDR for Project Components. To find out whether the three project components are
justified independently, the equalizing discount rate was calculated for each of them by comparing
the proposed project component with the respective diesel expansion alternative. The results are
shown in the table below and detailed in Annex 7.1.
Table 7.1 Estimated Equalizing Discount Rates
Project Component             Equilizing Discount Rate (%)
115 kV interconnection line           18.7 %
Connection of Dangriga                24.1 %
Connection of San Pedro               13.4 %
Proposed Project as a Whole           18.0 %
Economic Analysis
7.11   Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). The EIRR for the proposed project was
estimated at about 22 percent, which is above the estimated 12 percent opportunity cost of capital
in Belize. The EIRR was computed on the BEL's entire investment program for the proposed
interconnected system (ICS) and covers the fiscal years 1994/95 through 2011/2012. Annex 7.2
provides details of calculations and the assumptions used.
7.12   Project Economic Cost.   The economic costs used in the analysis comprise: (1)
investments, including physical contingencies, required to meet the incremental demand; (2)
incremental cost of operation and maintenance of generation, transmission and distribution
facilities; and (3) the cost of electricity purchased from Mexico. Since the proposed project
would also substitute for more expensive diesel generation, the project economic costs have been
adjusted for the corresponding cost savings.



- 36 -
7.13   Project Economic Benefits. The measurable economic benefits of the proposed project
stem from increased energy sales in the ICS made possible by the proposed investments. The
incremental energy demand served is valued using the current tariffs as a proxy for the consumers
willingness to pay for electricity. Additionally, the proposed project would result in some
benefits which are difficult to quantify and which the economic analysis consequently does not
include. These benefits include the reduced environmental hazards related to the transportation,
handling and combustion of diesel fuel. This is particularly the case in the ecologically sensitive
Ambergis Caye Island (San Pedro) with its adjacent coral reef, protected wildlife areas, and
developing eco-tourism. Furthermore, the project would also help increase the reliability and
quality of supply by interconnecting the major load centers via a national grid, hence reducing
the additional costs of self-generation, which is currently common among the large consumers,
many of which are export oriented agro-processing industries.
7.14   Sensitivity Analysis. The sensitivity of the EIRR was tested for the following four
alternative cases: (1) 20 percent increase in the capital cost of BEL's investment program for the
ICS; (2) 20 percent increase in the price of electricity purchased from Mexico; (3) 20 percent
decrease in the cost of diesel fuel; (4) 20 percent decrease in energy demand forecast; and (5) 20
percent increase in the capital cost of BEL's investment program coupled with a 20 percent
increase in the cost of electricity imports. The following table illustrates the results:
Table 7.2 Estimated Economic Internal Rate of Return
Sensitivity Case                           EIRR (%)
Base Case                                   21.7 %
20% increase in investment costs            18.6 %
20% increase in Mexican supply price        19.8 %
20% decrease in diesel fuel prices          20.9 %
20% decrease in annual energy sales         17.0 %
20% increase in investment costs and        16.9 %
20% increase in Mexican supply price
7.15   The results indicate that modest changes in the assumptions do not have a significant
impact on project economics. The results are most sensitive to assumptions of energy sales
growth, however, the project economics would still be acceptable even if the annual sales growth
declined by 40 percent (from the forecast 4.8 percent to 2.9 percent). Thus the conclusion that
the proposed project is justified remains valid even under less favorable conditions.

PART VIII: AGREEMENTS REACED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1    During negotiations the Government and BEL agreed on the following:
The Government would:
(i)    enact, by March 31, 1995, specific regulations in accordance with the Electricity
Act of 1992 and satisfactory to the Bank, that define transparent procedures for
electricity tariff setting and approval (para. 3.12); and
(ii)   promptly take all measures as may be required to enable BEL to comply with the
rate of return requirements of the Project (para. 6.14);
BEL would:
(iii)   employ consultants to carry out a tariff study on terms of reference agreed with
the Bank, and not later than March 31, 1995, furnish to the Bank the
Government's and BEL's recommendations based on the results of this study, and
after consultation with the Bank, promptly implement such recommendations
(para. 3.1 1);
(iv)   engage independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank and submit BEL's audited
accounts, including SOE's and the Special Account, to the Bank not later than
four months after the end of its fiscal year (para. 4.11);
(v)    maintain the Project Implementation Unit properly staffed and funded; (para.
5.19)
(vi)   carry out the project according to an agreed implementation plan and schedule
(5.19);
(vii)   maintain its tariffs at a level sufficient to earn a rate of return on its average net
fixed assets in operation, revalued from time to time when required by the Bank,
of not less than 7 % for FY96 and thereafter (para. 6.14);
(viii)  furnish the Bank before January 1 of each fiscal year with a preliminary estimate
of the rate of return for the current fiscal year and for the following fiscal year
and, if the estimates indicate that BEL will not meet the rate of return
requirements, will promptly take all necessary measures to meet such
requirements (para. 6.14);
(ix)   not incur any new debt (other than for the Project) without the prior approval of
the Bank unless its future debt service coverage ratio is 1.5 or higher (para.
6.16); and



- 38 -
(x)    not undertake any investment in excess of US$500,000 without the approval of
the Bank, until after completion of the Second Power Development Project,
(para. 6.16).
8.2    Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be that:
(i)    BEL has signed an extended long-term power supply contract with the Comision
Federal de Electricidad (CFE), Mexico, on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para 6.6);
(ii)    a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement has been executed between the
Government and BEL (para 6.9); and
(iii)   CDC's Board should have approved a loan to finance the cost of the 115 kV
substations and the Dangriga connection components of the proposed project
(para 6.10).
8.3    As a condition for disbursements for Group 1 - 115 kV Transmission Line goods and
works, BEL should have completed all Project transmission lines and substations land surveys,
identified all right-of-ways, and completed easements and land acquititon procedures, as required
for the first year of project construction (para 5.12);
8.4    An additional event of default that would authorize suspension of disbursements of the
Loan would be that either BECOL or CFE fails to supply, under the agreements referred to in
paras. 6.5 and 8.2 (i), the electricity required by BEL to meet consumer demand, and BEL is
unable to meet the deficiency from either CFE or BECOL or any other source (para. 6.7).
8.5    An additional event of default that would authorize suspension of disbursements of the
Loan would be that the CDB or CDC or EIB loan agreements shall have failed to become
effective by March 31, 1995 (para. 6.13).
8.6    With the above agreements, the proposed project would be suitable for the Bank loan of
US$11.5 million equivalent.
8.7   The documentation employed to process the Project and to prepare this report is listed
in Annex 8.1.

Note:  According to the Ministry of Finance, the FOB prices are based on Esso's actual purchase prices
for each shipment. BEB is exempt from import taxes. Industries may obtain a partial exemption
from import taxes.
The maximum retail prices for LPG are fixed by the government, and vary, due to transportation
cost, from 43.50 BZ$ (Corozal Town) to 56.50 BZ$ (Punta Gorda Town) per 100 lbs cylinder
(in October 1992). These prices include a stamp duty of 10 percent of the import value and an
import duty of 3 Belize cents per pound. The current world market bulk price for LPG is around
US$0.12 per kilogram. The Belizian price of about US$0.48 per kilogram (in Corozal Town,
including taxes) should guarantee at least a reasonable margin for handling, delivery and other
commercial fees.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Introduction and Background
1.    The Belize Second Power Development Project involves the implementation of a 115 kV
transmission line from the border of Mexico to Belize City, its associated substations and the
establishment of an integrated power system that will interconnect the main load centers and the
electric generating sources of the Country. The Project will also incorporate the Dangriga area
by means of a 56 km (35 miles) long 34.5 kV subtransmission line as well as the Ambergris Cay
(San Pedro) through a 35 km (21.5 miles) long mainland overhead transmission line, a submarine
cable section and an inland overhead line connection to the San Pedro power plant.
2.    The 115 kV transmission line from Mexico, to be constructed under the proposed project,
will be interconnected with the 115 kV transmission line from the Mollejon hydroelectric plant
to Belize City, under construction. The Mollejon Hydroelectric Plant on the Macal River (25
MW run-of-river) is being built by a private consortium (Belize Electricity Company Ltd. -
BECOL) on a BOT (build, operate and transfer) basis. Commercial operation is expected to start
in December 1994. The 115 kV Mollejon transmission system is also being built by BECOL and
ownership will be transferred to BEL after construction. BEL has undertaken to purchase, on
a take-or-pay basis, 120 GVAh per year, on average, from the Mollejon hydroelectric plant.
3.    Since the Mollejon hydroplant is a run-of-river plant with only very limited storage, the
power and energy outputs of the plant will be very variable from dry to wet seasons and from
year to year. The required power and energy complement to serve the demand would be met by
imports from Mexico and BEL's own diesel-electric generation. The integrated 115 kV trunk
transmission system would extend 286 km from the Xu La substation in Mexico to the Mollejon
power plant substation.
Physical Scope of the Project
4.    The proposed project comprises the following facilities:
Transmission Lines:
115 kv single-circuit transmission line, 136.5 km (85.5  miles) long from
Mexican border to km 13.5 Western Highway Substation.

Annex 5.1
Page 2 of 5
This line will be built on wood H-frame poles using a conductor equivalent to
477 MCM ACSR, which is similar to the Mollejon transmission line.
Construction standards of the US Rural Electrification Administration (REA) will
be used and the design will be made for winds speeds of 240 km per hour (150
mph) with gusts to 265 km per hour (165 mph).
Special precaution will be taken to ensure against insulators fouling by salt fog
and corrosion of conductor and line hardware caused by proximity to the
seashore. Protection of the line will be done by high-speed distance relaying for
single-phase tripping of breakers at both ends of the line.
34.5 kV overhead subtransmission line 56 km (35 miles) long from km 48
Western Highway to Dangriga. This line will be fed from a substation on the
115 kV line from Mollejon to Belize City.
34.5 overhead substransmission line 8 km (5 miles) long from km 48.3 of the
Old Northern Highway to the coast. This line will be fed from a substation
located at Maskall on the 115 kV transmission line from Mexico.
34.5 kV submarine cable section of 21 km (13 miles) long from the coast to a
substation located south of San Pedro on Ambergris Cay. The submarine cable
will traverse an area of moderate to low depths, and constitutes the middle
section of the Ambergris Cay connection to the trunk transmission system.
34.5 kV overhead subtransmission line 5.6 km (3.5 miles) long from the
substation south of Ambergris Cay to the San Pedro power plant. This line
constitute the final section of the Ambergris Cay feed system.
115/34.5 kV, 7.5/9.5-10.5 MVA transformer substation will feed the Dangriga
subtransmission line.
34.5/22 kV, 5/6.25-7 MVA auto-transformer substation at Dangriga.
115/34.5 kV, 7.5/9.5-10.5 MVA transformer substation at Maskall to feed the
Ambergris Cay subtransmission connection.
34.5/22 kV, 10.5 MVA transformer substation at Ambergris Cay substation.
115 kV switching substation at the Mexican Border.

115/34.5 kV, 7.5/9.5-10.5 MVA transformer substation at Buena Vista km 120
of the Northern Highway.
Two 115 kV circuit bays at km 13.5 of the Western Highway substation. Tbis
substation is being constructed by BECOL as part of its commitment with BEL.
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System
BEL will construct a Central Dispatch Center with supervisory control and data adquisition
facilities (SCADA system), capable of generation control, frequency control, active and reactive
power flow control, data adquisition, basic state estimation and fault recording and location. The
SCADA system will be capable of economic dispatch of local generation and supply from
Mexico. SCADA features will be installed in all dispachable generating stations and main
substations. An adequate telecommunication system will be set up to carry protection signals,
data and voice communications.
Environmental Mitigation in BEL's Diesel Plants
Consistent with BEL's environmnental stewardship, BEL is seeking to conduct various
environmental activities associated with seven of its power plants, with the assistance of a foreign
contractor. These are the Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan, San Pedro, Dangriga, Corozal, and
Orange Walk Power Plants. With the implementation of the Second Power Development Project,
the Belize City, Ladyville, and Belmopan Power Plants are expected to provide peak-load power;
and the remaining four power plants are expected to supply stand-by power.
The following is the scope of services expected from this component of the project:
*     Task 1 -      Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure
*     Task 2 -      Noise Pollution Control
*     Task 3 -      Mitigation of Smoke Emissions
*     Task 4 -      Remedial Investigation and Planning for Decontamination of soil
More details of the expected services for the environmental mitigation can be found in Annex
5.10.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ENGINEERING AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT SERVICES
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    BEL currently operates nine isolated electrical systems, all of them supplied by diesel
thermal units. The total installed capacity is 42 MW. In FY92 the combined demand of all the
nine centers was about 23 MW, with sales of about 107 GWh. Two of the electrical systems
were interconnected in 1991 (Corozal and Orange Walk load centers), and are supplied from
Mexico through a 34.5 kV line, from Chetumal in the Yucatan Peninsular.
2.    With the objective of diversifying the sources of electricity supply, the Government of
Belize and BEL signed an agreement with a private consortium, the Belize Electricity Company
Ltd (BECOL), to construct and operate a 25 MW run-of-river hydropower plant at the Mollejon
site in the Macal River. The hydro plant will be connected to the BEL distribution systems at
Belmopan and Belize City by a 115 KV transmission line. Construction of the plant and the
transmission line started in January 1993 and it is expected to be completed by the end of 1994.
3.    As a further means of diversification, the BEL is planning to interconnect its electrical
system with the Mexican system through the construction of an 84 mile 115 kV transmission line
from Chetumal in Mexico through the Corozal/Orange Walk system, to Belize City, where it will
join the transmission line coming from the Mollejon hydro station. The planned interconnection
would thus form the basic structure of a national grid linking the main load centers of Belize.
Additionally, BEL is planning to link the load centers at Dangrida and San Pedro (Ambergris
Cay) to the grid, thereby extending the national system to comprise all the major load centers of
the country (Corozal/Orange Walk, Belize City/Ladyville, Belmopan/San Ignacio, Dangrida and
San Pedro). The San Pedro load center is planned to be interconnected through a 13 mile 34.5
kV submarine cable between the mainland and the Ambergris Cay-island. This transmission
system and links, and the associated Supervisory Control, Data Acquisition (SCADA) and
Dispatch Center is known as the Second Power Development Project. A detailed project
description, a project map and one-line diagram are included in Annex 5.1.
4.    Basic engineering, cost estimates, environmental assessment, route selection, economic
evaluations, and other technical studies of the project have already being carried out. BEL has
contracted field surveys to establish the plan and profile of the 115 kV interconnecting line and
the 34.5 kV Dangriga line; it is expected that this work would be finished by December 1994.

Economic Proposal
19.   Although price will not be a factor in the selection of the Consultant, the estimated human
resources requirements, as indicated in paragraph 14, should be taken as a reference in the
preparation of the economic proposal. The technical and economic proposals should be presented
in separate packages (envelopes).  The Consultant should divide its costs in two basic
components, professional fees and expenses. The professional fees can be assigned by category
but only monthly (for long-term) and weekly (for short-term, less than three months assignments)
fees will be allowed. To obtain the total professional fees the Consultant should applying the per
unit fees to the activities-time-personnel participation matrix, mentioned in paragraph 18-i. If
required by BEL, the Consultant should provide the breakdown of the professional fees.
20.   The expenses will be divided into three basic components: (i) travel expenses; (ii) living
expenses; and (iii) other or miscellaneous. The Consultant will estimate the number of round-trip
tickets and other travel required for each person; these expenses will be reimbursed by BEL
against documentation. Living expenses will be paid on fixed rate basis. Consultant's personnel
staying in Belize for periods of three or more months (long-term assignments) will be paid
US$3,000/month. Personnel staying in Belize for periods of less than three months will be paid
US$150/day. BEL will recognize the Consultant a monthly fixed amount of US$250 for
miscellaneous expenses (communications, printing, copying, etc.); any other extraordinary
expense will be reimbursed against documentation.
21.   The costs mentioned in paragraphs 19 and 20 should be presented separate for each one
of the Phases of the scope of work. All applicable conditions and form of payment of the
services for each one of the Phases should be clearly indicated in the economic proposal.
Contract Award
22.   Contract(s) will be awarded for the two Phases to a single consulting company or Phase
1 to one company and Phase 2 to another company; or only Phase 1 could be awarded.
Reporting and Documents
23.   The Consultant will be responsible of producing all technical and contractual
documentation for the project (specifications, bidding, procurement and contractual documents,
drawings, maps, layouts, electrical schemes, computer studies results, studies reports, inspection
reports, et.). During project implementation a supervision report should be prepared every
quarter, including reporting on the physical, financial and economic status and progress of all
components of the project.
24.   The Consultant will keep and maintain a complete project file, including all reports
prepared by the contractors; as-built drawings, maps, schemes, etc. prepared by the contractors;
operating and maintenance manuals prepared by the contractors and equipment suppliers; design

Attachment I
SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL STUDIES
A.    Reactive Power Compensation and Voltage Control
Purpose of the Study
1.    The study to be carried out by the consultants should determine the required reactive
power comensation equipment to maintain stable voltaje conditions along the 115 and 34.5 kV
transmission system of the Second Power Development Project, as well as the method to be
employed in controlling this equipment.
Scope of Work
2.    The tasks envisaged in this reactive power compensation study are the following:
i)    Establish the light loading and the peak loading conditions on the transmission
system for a 15 year horizon using the medium and the high demand scenarios;
ii)    Determine the voltage profiles along the transmission system for the conditions
developped above;
iii)   Examine the various alternatives to maintain voltage level at all points of the
transmission system within a band of plus/minus 5% of rated voltage; and
iv)    Device the control system to switch on/off the capacitor banks and reactances
incorporate in the transmission system in order to effect proper reactive power
compensation. The control system should be designed to make use of the
SCADA system which will be implemented in the project. The design of the
control system should permit manual and programmed switching of reactive
power compensation devices.
Output of the Study
3.    The results of the studies indicated above, should be used by the consultants in the
preparation of the following documents:
a)    The electric design of the reactive power compensation schemes for each
substation of the transmission system;
b)    The reactive power compensation control system  design for programmed
switching of reactive power compensation devices; and

i)     Determine the severity of insulation fouling during the dry season and its impact
on the level of insulation to be provided on the transmission line and on the
associated substations;
ii)    Prepare an insulation coordination scheme for the transmission line and
substations using data gathered from above and the isoceuranic level in the area
which the transmission line traverses, as well as for the locations of the
associated substations;
iii)    Establish the physical characteristics of the insulators and associated hardware.
This task shall include indication about insulator skirts shape and diameter,
method of attachment (ball and socket, or bolt and clevis) in order to prevent salt
collecting on cavities; and thickness of galvanizing on insulators metal elements
and on line hardware;
iv)    Establish the physical characteristics of electrical apparatus' insulation at all
substations, and busbars insulation requirements;
v)     Determine the type of conductor to use in order to minimize corrosion effects
that could cause rupture of conductor or high corona losses.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
COST OF SERVICE AND TARIFF STUDY
Terms of Reference
BACKGROUND
1.    The current electricity tariff of the Belize Electricity Limited (BEL), in effect since 1989,
consists of three increasing blocks which apply to all consumers in the country:
Block                      Belize cents/kWh                  US cents/kWh
0-70 kWh/month                    31                                15.5
71-150 kWh/month                  35                                17.5
more than 150 kWh/month           41                                20.5
2.    Neither demand charges nor service fees are levied in addition to the above rates. In
FY921/ the average revenue per kWh sold was 38 Belize cents (equivalent to about US$0.19)
compared to the average generating cost of about 27 Belize cents.
3.    BEL currently operates nine isolated electrical systems, all of them supplied by diesel
thermal units. The total installed capacity is 42 MW 2/. In FY92 the combined demand of all
the nine centers was about 23 MW, with sales of about 107 GWh. One of the electrical systems,
the in 1991 interconnected Corozal/Orange Walk system, is supplied from the Mexican grid
through Chetumal in the Yucatan Peninsular.
4.    With the objective of diversifying the sources of electricity supply, the Government of
Belize and BEL signed an agreement with a private consortium the Belize Electricity Company
Ltd (BECOL) to construct and operate a 25 MW run-of-river hydropower plant at the Mollojon
site in the Macal River. The hydro plant will be connected to the BEL distribution systems at
Belmopan and Belize City by a 115 KV transmission line to be constructed by BECOL. All the
power generated by the Mollejon plant will be sold to BEL on a pay-or-take basis.
I/    BEL's fiscal year is from April to March.
2/    Totalfirm capacity is 26.5 MW.



- 75 -
Annex 5.8
Page 2 of 6
5.    As a further means of diversification, the BEL is planning to interconnect its electrical
system with the Mexican system through the construction of an 84 mile 115 kV transmission line
from Chetumal in Mexico through the Corozal/Orange Walk system, to Belize City, where it will
join the transmission line coming from the Mollojon hydro station. The planned interconnection
would thus form the basic structure of a national grid linking the main load centers of Belize.
Additionally, BEL is planning to interconnect the load centers at Dangrida and San Pedro to the
grid, thereby extending the national grid to comprise all the larger load centers (Corozal/Orange
Walk, Belize City, Belmopan, Dangrida and San Pedro). The San Pedro load center is planned
to be interconnected through a 13 mile 34.5 kV submarine cable between the mainland and the
Ambergis Caye-island.
6.    The World Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the Commonwtlth Development
Corporation are considering to contribute to the financing of the Mexican interconnection as well
as of the Dangrida and San Pedro connections.
7.    The power purchase agreement between BEL and BECOL stipulates a base price of
US$0.0875 per kVAh for a supply up to 120 GVAh, which is the minimum supply guaranteed
by BECOL. For purchases above 120 GVAh, the unit price will be US$0.07 per kVAh. The
official tariff system for the Mexican peninsular region, which will apply to purchases by the
BEL, will have different rates for base and peak energy, charges for maximum demand, and will
also include power factor penalty surcharges resp. power factor premium discount. The current
(December 1993) rates for the Mexican supply vary from US$0.032 during base load time to
US$0.058 during peak load time (6 p.m to 10 p.m Monday to Saturday), while the monthly peak
demand is charged at about US$8.8 per kW.
8.    In view of the planned changes in the supply options the current tariff structure appears
inadequate. Especially the following issues need to be addressed: (1) the tariff does not follow
the structure of the costs of future supply; (2) the tariff does not provide customers with adequate
signals for efficient use of electricity in particular since rates do not reflect peak and off peak
supply costs; (3) generation costs are expected to change when BEL moves from a purely thermal
system toward a more diversified system including purchases from the Mollejon hydro-plant and
from Mexico.
STUDY OBJECTIVE
9.    The objective of the tariff study is to provide the Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) with
an efficient rate structure for all categories of customers. The rate structure should reflect the
costs of supply and provide incentives for the efficient use of electricity within the financial and
operating constraints of the BEL. Additionally, the BEL staff will be given an opportunity to
learn utility ratemaking in practice through participation in the tariff study.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Environmental Issues
and Summary of Environmental Impact Assessment Studies
Legal, Institutional and Policy Framework
1.    Over the past years, the GOB has been making a very significant effort to create
legislation and to develop or strengthen its institutional framework and capacity to promote
environmentally sustainable development in the country. Since its creation in 1989, the Ministry
of Tourism and the Environment (MTE) has conducted the preparation of a Policy and Strategy
Statement (1992). An Environmental Protection Act was enacted in 1993 enabling it to enforce
environmental standards and guidelines for environmental assessment of projects. While specific
legislation is generally in place for natural resource management (e.g., the National Park System
Act, the Forest Reserve Act, the Fisheries Ordinance), detailed regulations for air, water and soil
pollution are not yet available. Review and enforcement capabilities are still weak.
2.    The GOB is being supported in this effort by several international programs and agencies.
The ODA acts as the lead agency in the Tropical Forestry Action Plan of Belize. This is a five-
year program which began in 1991 and comprises improvement of land use planning and forest
management. The program includes redefinition of boundaries of the country's reserved areas,
the installation of a geographic information system, training and institutional strengthening.
Under the Natural Resource Management and Protection Project (NARMAP), USAID is
providing technical assistance to help develop the monitoring, assessment, and enforcement
capabilities of the GOB. The project comprises promotion of sustainable agricultural production
methods and forestry development, in conjunction with ODA's efforts. UNDP through the global
Environmental Facility (GEF) has been providing support to the Coastal Zone Management
Committee. The World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy foresees help in preparation of a
National Environmental Action Plan.
3.    Non-governmental organizations, both local and international, have had a very active role
both in implementing environmental programs, such as the management of forest reserves, and
in discussing proposed guidelines and major specific development projects for the country.
Second Power Development Project: Environmental and Social Issues
4.    The EA process: Because of Belize's singular natural characteristics and its privileged
coastal resources, special care was taken by BEL and the Bank, in preparing the Power II
Project, to ensure full consideration of existing environmental legislation in the country,
observance of Bank guidelines, and best international practice in dealing with potential
environmental and social project impacts. Although the project was rated as category "B" by the



- 81 -
Annex 5.9
Page 2 of 4
Bank, full environmental assessments (EAs) were conducted for the Mexican 115 kV
Inteconnection and for the 34.5 kV San Pedro connection servicing Ambergris Caye. The EAs
were conducted by international consultants, who, in both cases, worked with a Belizean NGO
during preparation of the baseline studies.  In accordance with Bank guidelines, public
consultations were carried out: first, a scoping session was held in December 1992 to discuss the
proposed terms of reference of the EAs; second, two public forums were convened in December
1993 to discuss findings of the studies. BEL's management has demonstrated great commitment
to obtaining effective participation of potentially affected or interested people throughout the EA
process. The public forums, originally to be held in Belize City, as was the scoping session,
were postponed and transferred to locations along the future transmission line routes, in order
to facilitate participation and allow more time for examination of the EA drafts.
5.    The Mexican Interconnection: For this line (137 km; 30 meter right-of-way), two
alternatives were assessed. (Minor variations along the proposed corridors were also explored but
dropped.) The impacts associated with construction and operation of either of the two main
alternatives are expected to be low and there is negligible difference between them in terms of
factors such as disruption of existing settlements, disturbance of cultivated lands, disturbance to
critical wildlife habitats and sanctuaries, visual impact, avoidance of road and stream crossings,
and use of existing rights-of-way. Resettlement will not be required in either case. The
transmission line alignment along the Old Northern Highway is favored over its alternative, above
all, because it facilitates the extension of the transmission grid to Ambergris Caye. In the
preferred solution, medium or moderate impacts may occur as a result of vegetation clearing, use
of sensitive terrain (e.g., steep slopes at river crossings) and visual presence near towns. Impacts
to human settlements, agricultural practices, critical wildlife habitat, sites of archaeological
interest, and human health and safety are all rated as low.
6.    The Dangriga Line: A formal environmental assessment was not required given the
general alignment and physical characteristics of the line, i.e. a single-pole structures, medium
voltage, requiring a 10 meter ROW, routed predominantly along existing roadways and areas
which have been substantially disturbed by previous projects and agriculture. Guidelines and
proposed mitigation measures prepared for the Mexican Interconnection will be followed in the
case of this component.
7.    Supply of San Pedro: Given the very special natural resources of Ambergris Caye, with
the Hol Chan Marine Reserve at its southern tip, Belize's unique barrier reef along its full
extension on the east (Gulf of Mexico) side, and mangrove along the west (continent) side of the
island, the electricity supply expansion proposal for the caye underwent a thorough consideration
of alternatives from economic, technical, social and environmental standpoints. Power market
growth projections were revised, taking into consideration the different plans for future
deevelopment of the island which have been proposed by different agencies (e.g., UNDP). Five
supply alternatives were considered: (a) expansion of existing plant; (b) new plant at new site;
(c) submarine cable crossing; (d) overhead crossing; and (e) combination of the two previous
ones. Within the scope of this overall feasibility study, an assessment of the potential impacts



- 82 -
Annex 5.9
Page 3 of 4
of these supply alternatives was conducted, including identification of mitigation costs and
residual impacts for which feasible solutions are not available. The overall optimal solution was
found to be the submarine cable crossing. Although requiring slightly greater initial investment,
it was assessed as having the lowest production (O&M) costs, being the most reliable source of
supply, and having the smallest residual environmental costs in the long term. In the short term,
i.e., during the construction phase, some sediment fouling is to be expected with possible
negative but largely reversible effect on the marine environment. These were assessed to be less
serious than impacts on bird fauna, risks of collision by ships and airplanes, and aesthetic impacts
arising from the second-best alternative, the overhead crossing. (Other alternatives, such as wind
and solar power, were also investigated but were not found to be advantageous as compared to
conventional electricity supply.)
Environmental Action Plans
8.    Environmental protection, avoidance and reclamation measures have been recommended
in the EAs of both components. General procedures to be incorporated into the bidding
documents for contractors have been proposed for the preconstruction, construction and clean-up
phase. Procedures for monitoring and maintenance are also recommended in the EAs. Design
of detailed mitigation measures and of a monitoring plan will be prepared according to guidelines,
cost estimates and schedules established in the EAP, while detailed engineering, final route
alignment, and a land survey of the right-of-way are carried out over the coming months. During
this period, a survey of the proposed ROW as regards possible interference with archaeological
sites will be carried out by the Department of Archaeology/Ministry of Tourism and the
Environment. Minor modifications in positioning and spacing of poles may be expected so as
to avoid unexplored or partially explored sites of archaeological interest along the route.
Although easement is foreseen as the predominant approach to formation of the ROW, a land
acquisition program is to be prepared, comprising valuation of fixed assets and agricultural
production and payments of compensation, to be negotiated or fixed in accordance with Belizean
legislation (the Electricity Act, the Crown Lands Ordinance and procedures and guidelines
established by the Lands and Surveys Department/Ministry of Natural Resources for valuation
of propety losses, as applicable).
9.    In the case of the submarine crossing to Ambergris Caye, specifications to tenders will
require minimization of fouling effects from dredging. To supplement current knowledge of wind
and current patterns, a data collection program has been designed. Its implementation is to be
initiated as soon as possible, prior to detailed project design and construction specifications.
Results will also provide information to define a monitoring plan to be used during the
construction phase as a controling mechanism.
10.   During project preparation, a preliminary evaluation was carried out of environmental
management problems pertaining to Belize's principal diesel power stations. Fires and oil spills
have ocurred in several of these in recent years. Terms of reference were prepared for a
pollution mitigation program to be financed under the proposed project, covering the following



- 83 -
Aneex 5.9
Page 4 of 4
issues: spill prevention, control, and countermeasures; noise pollution; smoke emission control;
remediation of contaminated areas; and training for BEL staff. Terms of reference are included
in Annex 5.10.
Strengthening of BEL
11.   An environmental team will be created within BEL's Project Implementation Unit. In
the short term, this team will ensure that all mitigation measures recommended in the EAs are
incorporated into the final project design and bidding documents for the transmission lines, and
that these are followed during project implementation. It will liase with government and non-
governmental personnel regarding environmental issues.  It will also be responsible for
supervising and providing support for preparation by consultants of clean-up plans for existing
diesel plants. In the long term, the presence of the team will enhance BEL's capability for
developing and implementing environmentally sustainable projects, developing environmental
policies, guidelines and standards for all of BEL's activities. It will also negotiate proposed
regulations as they are developed by the GOB and ensure compliance by BEL once they are
approved. The unit will be staffed with one natural resource management specialists and one
BEL engineer, to be trained in industrial health and safety practices and procedures. Both will
be trained in EIA assessment and monitoring.
12.   An international consultant will be contracted to supervise final design of mitigation
measures, tender documents, and the monitoring plan during the preconstruction and early
construction phase. Monitoring of compliance with the EAP will be carried out by local
consultants or NGOs. The supervisor of the environmental staff will report to the Project
Coordinator. A training program for the environmental staff and for the local consultants/NGOs
encharged with the environmental monitoring will be carried out during project implementation
by the international consultant. TORs for contracting this services are included in Annex 5. 11.
13.   To support the implementation of the submarine cable connection to Ambergris Cay, it
is recommended that a small, ad-hoc, Environmental Advisory Committee be formed to advise
on mitigation and monitoring plans, on their implementation, as well as on suitable courses of
action in face of unforeseen circumstances which may arise during project implementation. It
is recommended that this committee include the following persons: the Project Coordinator, a
representative from the Ministry of the Environment/Department of Environment, a representative
from the National Social and Economic Council, a representative from the Coastal Zone
Management Committee, and a representative from the town of San Pedro, an a marine
resource/ETA specialist (preferably an international consultant). The commmittee should meet
regularly through project implementation. The organization chart in Annex 5.6 illustrates the
relationship between the environmental unit, BEL's organization, the Ambergris Cay Advisory
Committee and the Project Implementation Unit.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION
AT BELIZE ELECTRICITY LIMITED'S POWER PLANTS
Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.    The Development Plan of the Government of Belize for 1990-1994 sets out an ambitious
energy policy aiming at reducing Belize's dependency on imported energy, increase the efficiency
of energy use, provide electricity to rural communities, and secure a reliable and sustainable
electricity supply across the country. The Government's strategy in the power sector for
implementing these objectives include rural electrification, construction of a new hydroelectric
plant, expansion of electricity imports from Mexico, and construction of new electrical
transmission lines. This strategy will alter some of the current functions of the power plants
operated by Belize Electricity Limited (BEL).
2.    Consistent with BEL's environmental stewardship, BEL is seeking the services of a
qualified consulting firm to conduct various environmental activities associated with seven of its
power plants. These are the Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan, San Pedro, Dangriga, Corozal,
and Orange Walk Power Plants (please see Attachment A for background information about these
power plants). With the implementation of the Government strategy in the power sector, the
Belize City, Ladyville, and Belmopan Power Plants are expected to provide peak-load power; and
the remaining four power plants are expected to supply stand-by power.
3.    This Terms of Reference gives the background, scope of services, and description of
deliverables expected from this project, which will consist of the following five tasks:
*     Task 1 -      Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan
*     Task 2 -      Noise Pollution Control
*     Task 3 -      Mitigation of Smoke Emissions
*     Task 4 -      Remedial Investigation and Planning for Decontamination of soil
*     Task 5 -      Environmental Training of the BEL Employees

TASK 1 - Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan:
4.    Backgound: A preliminary survey of seven BEL power plants was conducted to identify
the environmental issues associated with spill prevention and control, and waste management.
This survey has revealed a need for upgrading the existing facilities and improve the current
operating procedures. More specifically, the areas listed below were identified for improvement
Belize Power Plant: (i) Vehicle filling station, (ii) tank-truck unloading station, (iii)
vehicle maintenance station, (iv) fuel storage, (v) lube oil storage, (vi) waste oil handling,
and (vii) drum storage.
Ladyville Power Plant: (i) Tank-truck unloading station, (ii) fuel storage, (iii) waste oil
handling, and (iv) drum storage.
Belmopan Power Plant: (i) Tank-truck unloading station, (ii) fuel storage, (iii) waste oil
handling, and (iv) wastewater discharge.
San Pedro Power Plant: (i) Fuel storage, (ii) lube oil storage, and (iii) waste oil
handling.
Dangriga Power Plant: (i) Fuel storage, (ii) waste oil handling, and (iii) parts cleaning.
Corozal Power Plant: Fuel storage.

5.    S e O. f Work: The consultant will conduct a thorough survey of the seven power
plants to evaluate: (i) designs of existing structures and (ii) current operating procedures that may
cause environmental discharges (e.g., spills). The scope of this investigation will not be limited
to the issues identified in the preliminary survey, but will be more comprehensive. Based on this
investigation, the consultant will identify specific areas where environmental discharges occur and
prescribe measures for preventing, controlling, and countermeasuring these discharges. These
measures may include improvements of existing designs (e.g., paving of an earthen area with
concrete), new designs (e.g., diking), or changes in operating procedures (e.g., improved waste
drum handling procedures). The consultant will estimate costs associated with each recommended
measure. For measures which involve improved or new designs, the consultant will provide all
engineering designs for construction. These designs will be compatible with the international
standards.
6.    The consultant will prepare a SPCC Plan for each of the seven power plants with
emphasis given to the Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan, and San Pedro Power Plants. The
SPCC Plan will prescribe measures to prevent and control spills, including designs

Page 3 of 10
(e.g., design of drum storage area) and operating procedures (e.g., procedures for loading and
unloading of tanks), identification of responsible facility personnel, inspection, and housekeeping.
The consultant will also prescribe spill countermeasures, including initial response procedures,
waste containment and disposal, safety considerations, personnel training, notification sequence,
arrangement with local authorities, and emergency procedures.
7.    Deliverables: The consultant will prepare and submit the following deliverables to BEL.
Each deliverable will be finalized by the consultant following review and comment by BEL.
a.    The consultant will prepare a report, which includes detailed descriptions of
proposed measures for spill prevention and control, and waste management; and
engineering designs of measures which involve structural changes or new
structures along with costs of these measures. The report will also include
information on the existing designs or procedures as a reference.
b.    The consultant will prepare a SPCC Plan, which includes all the necessary design
criteria and operating procedures for preventing spills, and additional procedures
to control and countermeasure spills. This Plan will be BEL's base document for
the training of its facility personnel in SPCC procedures. The Plan will also be
used as a practical document for prevention, control, and countermeasure of
spills at BEL's power plants.
8.    Schedule: The schedule for Task I will be as follows:
- Submittal of the Draft Report:  2.0 months after project start
- Review Period by BEL:          0.5 month
- Submittal of the Final Report:  3.0 months after project start
- Submittal of Draft SPCC Plan:   4.5 months after project start
- Review Period by BEL:           0.5 month
- Submittal of Final SPCC Plan:   5.0 months after project start.
TASK 2 - Noise Pollution Control:
9.    Background: Noise levels at work place have been a source of complaints by some BEL
employees. In addition, BEL received complaints on the noise levels emanating from a few BEL
power plants by some members of the local community. For example, noise levels from the
Belize Power Plant have been a source of complaints by the newer members of the community.
Near the Belmopan Plant, some complaints have been received from a furniture manufacturing
facility (located about 50 meters from the plant; there are no residences nearby the plant area).
However, no complaints have been received for the San Pedro Power Plant, although this plant
is located in a residential area. To-date, no noise monitoring has been conducted for any of the
BEL plants.



- 87 -
Annex 5.1
Page 4 of 10
10.   Scope of Work: The consultant will monitor the noise levels within the plant sites (i.e.,
work places) of the Belize City, Ladyville, and Belmopan Power Plants. In addition, the
consultant will monitor day time and night time noise levels at receptor points near the Belize
City, Belmopan, and San Pedro Power Plants. If the noise levels are found to be above the
World Bank guidelines or other international standards, then the consultant will identify
mitigatory measures through an alternatives evaluation study, and provide costs of these
measures. Selection of these measures should consider BEL's future business plans (e.g., the
San Pedro Power Plant is to provide only stand-by power).
11.   Deliverables: The consultant will prepare and submit to BEL a report which will contain
the results of the noise monitoring studies (along with the description of the methodology,
equipment, and data), evaluation of alternatives, and recommendations for mitigatory measures
and costs. The report will also include the backup information for all cost estimates.
12.   Schedule: The consultant will submit to BEL the draft report for Task 2 two months after
start of the project. The consultant will finalize the draft report two weeks after receipt of BEL's
comments.
TASK 3 - Mitigation of Smoke Emissions:
13.   Background: Flue gases from the Belize City Power Plant are emitted to the atmosphere
about 10 meters above the ground level through a stack located south of the Power Station.
Smoke in these emissions is visible by a naked eye and is a source of complaints by community
members located about 50 meters southeast of the plant.
14.   Scope of Work: The consultant will monitor smoke emissions from the Belize Power
Plant at discharge and receptor locations. If the levels are found above the international
standards, alternative mitigatory measures should be evaluated (with respect to such criteria as
effectiveness, implementability, and costs) and recommended solutions should be prescribed.
15.   Deliverables: The consultant will prepare and submit to BEL a report which will contain
the results of the smoke emission monitoring studies (along with the description of the
methodology, equipment, and data), evaluation of alternatives, and recommendations for
mitigatory measures.
16.   Schedule: The consultant will submit to BEL the draft report for Task 3 two months after
start of the project. The consultant will finalize the draft report two weeks after receipt of BEL's
comments.

TASK 4 - Remedial Investigation and Planning for Decontamination:
17.   Background: Contamination of soil by petroleum products has been identified at the
Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan, San Pedro, and Dangriga Power Plants. At the Belize Power
Plant, soil contamination can be observed at: (i) the vehicle maintenance area and discharge
canals from this area, and (ii) the waste oil storage area (which is saturated with oil). At the
Ladyville Power Plant, the water phase from an oil-water separation well discharges to an area,
where it accumulates oily materials, and possibly drains to the Belize River. In addition, some
soil contamination can be observed by the fuel and drum storage areas. At the Belmopan Power
Plant, about 60 m2 of an adjacent lot (which is also owned by BEL) to the plant property are
contaminated with oily wastes from the plant. As it rains, this contamination drains to the creek.
In addition, soil contamination can be observed at the waste oil storage area, which contains
about 20 waste oil drums. Oil from these spills wash away after rain storms and drain into a
creek. At the San Pedro Power Plant, about 15 in2 of soil are contaminated in the waste storage
area. At the Dangriga Power Plant, the fuel storage area (which has a gravel base) is
contaminated with oil. In addition, about 40 rn2 area of the adjacent lot west of the plant site
(which is also owned by BEL) is contaminated by oil. Furthermore, about 120 m2 of the parts
cleaning area of the Dangriga Power Plant and about 50 m2 area of the adjacent lot are
contaminated with oil.
18.   In addition, for many years, the portion of the Belize River Creek and associated lagoon
southeast of the Belize City Power Plant site have been used for the disposal of various plant
waste materials, including waste oils, used filters, and empty drums. A portion of this
contaminated area south of the Belize Refrigeration Limited, covering an area of about 2,000 m2,
is filled with dirt at a depth of 1.2 m. This area is separated from the Belize River Creek and
lagoon areas by means of wooden pilings, although this separation may not prevent flow of oil
from the fill area to the adjacent surface waters. The remaining portion of the surface waters
southeast of the plant is heavily contaminated (a very rough estimate of this area is 6,000 rn2,
with an average depth of about 1.2 m). This contamination is likely to cause health risk to the
members of the community, especially to those who live in the surrounding areas of the lagoon.
19.   Scope of Work: The consultant will prepare remedial plans for the decontamination of
soils at the Belize City, Ladyville, Belmopan Power, San Pedro, and Dangriga Power Plants.
In addition, the consultant will prepare remedial plans for the mitigation of the contamination
caused by the Belize City Power Plant to the surrounding surface water bodies, soils and
sediments. Furthermore, the consultant will investigate the potential of seepage from the Belize
City Power Plant's fill area to the surface water bodies; and if found to be the case, the
consultant will prepare a mitigation plan through evaluation of alternative measures.
20.   The consultant will first prepare a Work Plan, which will describe the existing conditions,
a statement of objectives, and plans for the field investigation efforts. The Work Plan will
include a list of analyses to be performed and a description of the sampling, sample preservation,



- 89 -
Annex 5.10
Page 6 of 10
and analytical techniques to be used. The Work Plan will also include health and safety
procedure to be followed by team personnel involved in field investigations
21.   During field investigations, the consultant will obtain representative samples of soil,
water, and sediments for physical examination and chemical analyses necessary to fully
characterize the extent of contamination. Sampling and analyses will be performed using
techniques outlined in the Work Plan by trained personnel.
22.   The consultant, in cooperation with BEL, will develop the cleanup criteria for the
contaminated areas.  These criteria will be compatible with international standards.  The
consultant will then identify and screen remedial technologies based on the following criteria:
a.    Effectiveness: How effective is the selected technology in reducing the pollutant
concentrations to the target levels? Has the technology been commercially used
at other similar sites? Are there adverse environmental impacts associated with
the technology?
b.    Implementability: Is the remedial technology easily implementable in Belize?
c.    Costs: Is the remedial technology relatively inexpensive?
23.   The consultant will prepare remedial plans for the remediation of the contaminated
surface water bodies, soils, and sediments; and, if necessary, for the fill area as well. The
remedial plans should include inter alia: extent of contamination at the sites, identification and
screening of remedial technologies, and the recommended remedial measures along with their
costs and implementation schedules. The remedial plans will include Executive Summaries and
will be appended with supporting information such as the Work Plan and field data. The
remedial plan should also prescribe the recommended disposal method for wastes generated from
remedial measures.
24    Deliverables: The consultant will prepare and submit the following deliverables to BEL.
Each deliverable will be finalized by the consultant following review and comment by BEL:
a.    Work Plan
b.    Field Investigations Report(s).  These reports will include results of field
investigations at the Belize City, Ladyville, and Belmopan Power Plants as well
as the Belize River Creek and associated lagoon and the fill area by the Belize
City Power Plant. The reports will include the background, environmental
setting, methodology, extent of contamination, contaminant characteristics, and
potential receptors. Supporting documentation such as analytical results, maps,
drawings, etc. will be appended as appropriate.



- 90 -
Annex 5.10
Page 7 of 10
c.    Remedial Plans: For each contaminated area, the consultant will prepare a
remedial plan. Each plan will include remedial objectives, identification and
screening of remedial technologies, and a detailed remedial plan. The initial
section of each plan will be an Executive Summary, which outlines the remedial
objectives and highlights the conclusions.  Each plan will also include
descriptions, designs, environmental impacts, monitoring requirements,
implementation schedules, and cost estimates for the recommended remedial
measures, including transportation and disposal requirements and costs.
Supporting documentation such as bases for cost estimates, preliminary
equipment lists, and technical support documentation will be appended as
appropriate.
25.   Schedule: The schedule for Task 4 will be as follows:
a.    The consultant will submit the Work Plan for Task 4 to BEL within two weeks
after start of the project. The Work Plan will be finalized within one week after
receipt of BEL's comments.
b.    The consultant will submit to BEL all Field Investigation Reports within four
months after start of the project. The Reports will be finalized within two weeks
after receipt of BEL's comments.
c.    The consultant will submit to BEL all Remedial Plans within six months after
start of the project. The Plans will be finalized within two weeks after receipt
of BEL's comments.
TASK 5 - Environmental Training of BEL Employees:
26.   Background:  To-date no environmental training has been provided to the BEL
employees. However, along with the environmental mitigatory measures to be implemented
under this project, a new phase will be initiated at BEL. These mitigatory measures will also be
complemented with a training program aimed at protecting the health and safety of BEL
employees and the environment.
27.   Scope of Work: The consultant will train the BEL employees in the areas of SPCC and
industrial hygiene. The consultant will use the SPCC Plan as the base material for the SPCC
training. With respect to industrial hygiene, the consultant will conduct a survey of the BEL
power plants to review the existing work conditions (e.g., temperature, noise levels, availability
of industrial hygiene facilities) and industrial hygiene procedures (e.g., use of personal protection
equipment by BEL employees), identify deficiencies, and prescribe solutions. The consultant will
include these findings in a report, which he will discuss with the BEL management.
Subsequently, the consultant will design the training program, which he will discuss again with



- 91 -
Annex 5.10
Page 8 of 10
the BEL management. The participants to this program will include BEL personnel from BEL
headquarters in Belize City and managers and operators from various BEL power plants. The
consultant will deliver the training program in Belize.
28.   Deliverables: The following deliverables are to be provided to BEL by the consultant:
a.    The Industrial Hygiene Report that the consultant will discuss with the BEL
management.
b.    The Outline of the Training Program, which the consultant will discuss with the

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Terms of Reference
Background
1.    The Second Power Development Project, to be undertaken by Belize Electricity Limited
(BEL) with financing from the World Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), and the
Commonwealth Developmnent Corporation (CDC), comprises a 1 15-kV interconnection from the
Mexican border to Belize City (85.5 miles), and 35-kV lines to Dangriga (35 miles) and to San
Pedro, on Ambergris Caye (22 miles). The latter transmission line will be composed of three
segments: a 5-mile overhead section, from Maskall on the Mexican interconnection to the coast;
a 13.3-mile submarine crossing from the mainland to Ambergris Caye; and a 3.5-mile overhead
section, from the west coast of Ambergris to the town of San Pedro. (See figure.)
2.    During project preparation, environmental assessments of the interconnection to Mexico
and of the tap to Ambergris Caye were carried out. The studies concluded that, with proper
precautions in routing and construction, environmental impact should be minimal. During the
detailed engineering phase, two additional environmental planning activities will take place:
(a)    a study financed by CDB will provide baseline data and will propose a
monitoring and evaluation plan for the area of influence of the Ambergris
submarine cable; and
(b)   the Environmental Unit to be created by BEL will be responsible for preparing
a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan for the project, comprising:
(i)  a Project Implementation Manual (based on environmental safeguards and
mitigation measures recommended in the EAs); and
(ii)  a Monitoring and Evaluation Manual providing guidelines for routine
inspection of project sites and of contractors' compliance with the project
implementation manual.
Objective

Objective
3.    BEL is seeking the services of qualified consultants to be employed during the pre-
construction and construction phases to undertake the following tasks:
(a)    help the Environmental Unit (EU) prepare the Project Implementation and the
M&E manuals for the project components not covered by the CDB study;
(b)   train the EU to carry out M&E of construction of the Mexican interconnection
and the Dangriga and Ambergris lines;
(c)    assist BEL in ensuring due consideration of environmental issues during
preparation of detailed engineering studies and in supervising and carrying out
M&E activities; and
(d)    prepare a post-construction environmental impact report.
Basic Information and Studies
4.    The Environmental Assessments carried out for the Mexican Inconnection (Canadian
Power International/Monenco/Agra) and the Ambergris Caye Electricity Supply (Danish Power
Consultants/Elsamprojekt A/S) constitute the basic references for the Monitoring and Evaluation
Plan to be developed under this contract. Other references are the technical and economic
analyses of the Power II Project, the environmental legislation of Belize and environmental
guidelines of the financing agencies.
Scope of Work
Task 1: Preparation of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
5.    The consultants will prepare a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan, to be applied
during the construction and operation phases of the Power II Project to all transmission line
segments, including the Dangriga tap. The plan should be based on recommendations of the
environmental assessments of the Mexican Interconnection and of the supply alternatives for
Ambergris. (It should also incorporate or complement the proposed M&E plan for the Ambergris
channel, to be financed by CDB.) The plan should comprise:
(a)    a Project Implementation Manual, consolidating and complementing, where
appropriate, the recommendations contained in the EAs for environmental
safeguarding and protection of natural environments, population settlements, and
cultural heritage, to be carried out by contractors and operations and maintenance
teams; and

8.    The consultants will prepare and carry out a small (two-week) training program for BEL's
Environmental Unit and for staff in other units involved in design, construction and operation of
the Power II transmission system. This program should cover two modules:
(a)    For a wider public, including the above-mentioned staff and possibly staff from
the Ministry of the Environment and other agencies of the Government of Belize,
an introduction and overview of:
(i) the role of EA during the project cycle (emphasizing issues pertinent to
the types of facilities typical of BEL's system);
(ii) the Power II Project: Environmental impacts foreseen and proposed
mitigation measures; and
(iii) the M&E program for the land-based and submarine segments.
(b)    For staff to be directly involved in project implementation, the first module
would be followed by instruction on data collection, use of instruments,
preparation of reports. This module should be integrated to training proposed to
prepare BEL staff to conduct M&E for the Ambergris crossing.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
BALANCE SHEETS
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are at cost less depreciation.
Work in Progress
Capital expenditures are included in fixed assets in operation as follows:
(i)    Fifty percent (50%) of transmission and distribution expenditures are capitalized
in the year the expense is incurred and the remaining fifty percent inthe following
year.
(ii)   Second Power Development Project expenditures are substantially capitalized in
FY97. The final costs in FY98 are capitalized in that year.
(iii)   All other capital expenditures are capitalized in the year the expense is incurred.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are calculated at the equivalent of 35 days sales.
Inventories
As a consequence of the decline in power generation by BEL and the increase in power
purchases, inventories are assumed to decline by BZ$500,000 annually until 1999 and then to
follow the ratio of inventories to operation and maintenance expenditures.
Accounts Payable
Payables are projected at 13% of operating expenses, excluding depreciation.
Consumer Deposits
Consumer deposits are projected to increase proportionally with the increase in customers
connections.
Share Capital
BEL's issued and fully paid share capital consists of 6,930,000 ordinary shares of BZ$2 each and
11,191,950 convertible redemable preference shares of BZ$2 each. The preference shares rank
equally with the ordinary shares with regard to cash dividends paid by BEL.
Capital Contributions
From FY95, capital contributions are projected at 1.5% of electricity sales.

INCOME STATEMENTS
Generation and Sales Forecast
The generation and sales forecast are detailled in Annex 3.3.
Other Revenue
This is projected as 1.5% of electricity sales based on past experience.
Fuel
Fuel consumption is proportional to BEL's net generation. Fuel prices has been assumed to
increase by 2.5% annully until 1995 and by 3% thereafter.
Salaries and Wages
Salaries and wages are kept constant in 1994 and 1995, and increased thereafter in proportion to
the number of persons employed.
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
Diesel related O&M has been adjusted proportional to changes in diesel generation. Other O&M
components have been increased in proportion to sales.
Mexican Electricity Purchases
The expense is based on the tariff schedule shown in Annex 5.3.
Purchases from Mollejon Hydroelectric Plant
It has been assumed that under the terms of the purchase contract, BEL will be required to pay
for 110 GWh in FY96, 115 GWh in FY97 and 120 GWh in FY98 up to the end of the projection
period in FY2003, at a rate of 0.0875 US$/kWh. In addition BEL would be required to pay 5%
of revenues from energy sold from Mollejon purchases.
Depreciation
Depreciation has been calculated at an annual rate of 4.45% of gross fixed assets, based on past
experience.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are calculated at 10% of taxable income in FY94, 95 and 96, 15% in FY97, 20%
in FY98, 25% in FY99, 30% in FY2000 and 35% in FY2001 and thereafter. The accumulated
losses of BEB will be offset againts BEL's taxable income.
Dividends
Dividends on ordinary and preference shares are assumed at 10 BZ cents per share in FY98 and
FY99 and 20 BZ cents thereafter.

SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Project Components
Method
1.    The Bank's evaluation of the cost effectiveness of the proposed project was carried out
using local diesel generation expansion as the reference expansion plan. The proposed project
was evaluated first as a unity, comprising all three components. Thereafter, each of the three
major physical components (i.e. the 115 kV interconnecting line from Mexico to Belize City; the
Dangriga connection to the system; and the San Pedro connection to the system) were evaluated
independently to find out their cost effectiveness, following the same methodology as used for
the proposed project as a whole.
2.    The economic comparison of the proposed project, and the next best expansion alternative
comprising diesel generation, were carried out by calculating the present value in FY 1994/95
of annual economic costs through the year 2012. It was considered unreliable to extend the
analysis beyond that period, and in any case, an extension would only have a marginal impact
on the results. The remaining economic life of the investments was taken into account by
residual values. Economic costs were defined as incremental investments, operating and
maintenance of generation and transmission facilities, fuel, and the cost of electricity imports
from Mexico. The table at the end of this annex provides a summary of the available capacity
and generation in the two alternatives, and also the cost streams and the calculated ecualizing
discount rates (EDR) for each project component. Annex 7.2 provides the assumptions used in
the analysis. The following paragraphs provide details of the evaluation of the three project
components.
115 kV Transmission Line from Mexico to Belize City
3.    Belize City is the commercial center of Belize, whereas Belmopan is its administrative
capital. In the year 1997, the Mollejon hydro plant would, under average hydrology, provide
about 80 percent of the energy needs of the Belmopan and Belize City systems. In 2005 the
Mollejon plant would cover only about 55 percent of the demand. Additionally, the Mollejon
supply would need to be complemented with other sources during dry seasons when its capacity
is limited.
4.    The economic evaluation of this project component was carried out by comparing the
present values of the economic costs of the proposed Mexican interconnection and the alternative
diesel expansion program to meet the balance between the forecast demand and the hydro supply.
The results show that the proposed interconnection is the least-cost alternative to meet the
additional energy and power demands of the Belmopan/Belize City systems. The equalizing
discount rate was calculated at 19 percent.

Connection of Dangriga to the Grid
5.     Dangriga is located south of Belize City in the heart of Belize's citrus and banana district.
The sales growth in Dangriga is expected to be strong due to, inter alia, the incorporation to the
BEL system of the large citrus companies, which currently operate their own generation. As a
result, BEL would need to expand the generation capacity of the Dangriga power plant to meet
the energy, power and reliability requirements.
6.     The economic evaluation of the Dangriga connection was made by comparing the present
values of the incremental economic costs of the proposed scheme (a tap 34.5 kV overhead
transmission line from the Mollejon transmission line), with the economic costs of the alternative
in which BEL would install new local small-scale diesel units to meet incremental loads and to
increase supply reliabilityl/. Comparison of the present value of the costs of these two
alternatives shows that the proposed interconnection would be cost-effective, resulting in a
calculated equalizing discount rate of about 23 percent. On a net present value basis, the
interconnection would lower the production costs by almost 50 percent compared to local diesel
generation.
Connection of San Pedro to the Grid
7.     Located on the Ambergis Cay-Island, San Pedro is Belize's major tourist center. The
major electricity consumers in San Pedro comprise small and medium size hotels, resorts and
tourist related service enterprises. BEL has during the past years increased its generation capacity
in San Pedro in order to facilitate for existing hotels to switch from private generation to BEL
supply, and also to supply new tourist service businesses. The current power plant is located in
the center of the town and it is very difficult to expand it at the current location. To able to
increase diesel capacity, BEL would need to build a new power plant on a new site. According
to BEL a new site can be found, but due to the tourist development potential of the island, BEL
would most likely have to pay a substantial compensation for the land.
8.     The EDR for the proposed incorporation of San Pedro into the national grid, via a 34.5
kV, 13.3 mile submarine cable, versus the continued use of diesels was calculated at about 14
percent2/. This project component is sensitive to variations in assumptions regarding the key
1/     The incremental cost of the proposed Dangriga connection comprise: (1) investment in and operation of
the 34.5 kV transmission system; and (2) energy purchased from the interconnected system. Additionally, it is
assumed that BEL will maintain the existing diesel units as a local emergency capacity reserve.
21     7he proposed San Pedro connection to the national grid will result in thefollowing incremental costs: (1)
investment in and operation of an 34.5 kV transmission system (overhead lines, submarine cable section and
substations); (2) energy purchase from the interconnected system; and (3) operation and maintenance of existing
diesel unitsfor emergencies.

economic parameters. Any of the following sensitivity cases would reduce the equalizing
discount rate to about 12 percent: (1) a 20 percent increase in project investment cost; (2) a 20
percent increase in the Mexican tariff; (3) 20 percent decline in annual sales growth; and (4) 20
percent decline in diesel prices. However, the proposed project would help Belize to improve
the environmental quality of San Pedro by eliminating the burning of diesel oil in close proximity
to hotels and residential areas, and reduce the risk of oil spills at sea during transportation in an
environmentally sensitive area. The submarine cable would also provide a reliable electric link
to San Pedro.
