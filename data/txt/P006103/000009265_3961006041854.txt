MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDA-TION OF THE P1lESIENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ONA
PROPOSED LOAN TO BELIZE
FOR A SECOND POWER DEVELOPMENT PROQECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Belize for the equivalent-of US$11.-5 million to help finance a project for power
development. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of
i7 years including 5 years' grace. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to Belize Electricity
Limited (BEL) at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years,
including 5 years' grace. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) would cofinance the
project. The CDB loan of US$ 7.5 million equivalent would be at CDB's standard variable
interest rate, with a maturity of 18 years, including 3 year's grace; the CDC loan of US$ 5.2
million equivalent would be at 9.5% interest rate, with a maturity of 10 years, including 3 years
grace; and the EIB loan of US$ 3.2 million equivalent, would be at a 3 % interest rate,with a
maturity of 15 years, including 4 years grace. BEL would bear the foreign exchange risk on the
Bank, CDB, CDC, and EIB loans.
2.    Belize is located south of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on the Caribbean coast of Central
America. With a population estimated at around 200,000 at the end of 1992, it occupies an area
of about 22,000 sq km. The population density of Belize is extremely low, about 9 persons per
sq km . Belize's population is predominantly young (about 50% is below the age of fifteen). The
country is endowed with abundant natural resources, a literate urban work force, proximity to
North America and a stable currency (its exchange rate has been pegged to the US Dollar at a
fixed rate since 1976). All of these factors make it attractive to foreign investment. Belizes
principal economic activities consist of sugar, banana and citrus production as well as fishing,
light manufacturing and tourism. Belize's small, open and private sector led economy is based
on agricultural exports and tourism. Belize achieved a per capita .-P of US$2,200 in 1992.
3.    Belize's energy resources are limited and its energy supply is presently highly dependent
on imported oil. Various studies have confirmed the findings of geological .itudies indicating that
Belize has deposits of oil and gas, both onshore and offshore. However, there have been no
reports, so far, of any findings of either oil or gas in commercial quantities. The primary energy
resources are biomnass and hydro. The biomass resources consist of wood (about 93% of Belize's
land area is classified as forest) and agriculture residues, mainly bagasse. The most important
indigenous potential source of energy in Belize is hydropower. In 1975, a UNDP-financed
survey of hydro-electric resources identified several alternatives for development. In 1990,
consultants financed under Bank Loan 2749-BEL, completed a study on Belize's Renewable
Energy, which recommended the development of h) Jro potential on the Macal River. The hydro
potential of the Macal River, where the Mollejon 25 MW hydroelectric plant is being built, is
estimated at 60-80 MW.



-2-
4.    Prior to September 1992, Belize Electricity Board (BEB) had the sole authority to
generate, distribute, supply and sell electr-icity for public and private purposes in Belize. The
Belize power sector was reformed in 1992. The 1958 Electricity Ordinance (creating BEB) was
replaced by the 1992 Belize Electricity Act, which became effective in August 1992. The new
Electricity Act provides mainly for (i) the regulation and provision of electricity services; (ii) the
issue of iicenses for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; and (iii) the
transfer of BEB's assets to a successor company, Belize Electricity Limited (BEL), which is
registered under Belize s Companies Act. In October 1992,the Government of Belize (GOB)
offered 49 percent of die ordinary shares and convertible debentures of BEL for sale to the
general public in Pelize. After the closing of the offering in January 31, 1993, 37.5 percent of
the ordinary shaLes had been purchased by private investors. The remaining 11.5 percent wer:.
purchased by the State Social Security Board.
5.    With the exception of the Corozal/Orange Walk area, which is supplied with electricity
from Mexico, Belize relies primarily on individual unconnected diesel generating plants. These
plants use imported diesel oil purchased exclusively from Mexico. BEL operates nine individual
electrical systems powered by diesel plants which are not interconnected. In FY93, the combined
net electricity generation totalled 139 GWh. Sales to about 33,000 customers were 120 GWh.
The average annual sales growth between FY87 and FY92 was 12%. Rapid economic growth,
rural electrification programs and the connection to the BEL sy..em of industries and hotels,
which previously generated their own electricity, have been the main reasons for the high demand
growth. The aggregate peak demand was about 25 MW in FY93, and the average annual growth
rate between FY87 and FY93 was 13%. Electrification in the country is high; mid 1993 figures
show that nation-wide electrification has reached a litdt over 80%. However, electricity prices
in Belize are high compared to most countries in the LAC region, in part because the Belize
electricity market is very small and too dispersed to take advantage sf economies of scale and
more efficient generating technologies.
6.    In April 1991, GOB granted a 40-year franchise to a group of private developers to build,
operate and transfer a run-of-river 25 MW hydroelectric power plant at Mollejon in the Macal
River, and its associated 115 kV transmission system from the plant site to Belize City. The
franchise rights granted by GOB were subsequently transferred to Belize Electricity Company
Ltd. (BECOL). A 40 year power purchase agreement was signed between the Belize Electricity
Board and BECOL, and subsequently assigned to BEL. This contract provides for the supply of
energy from Mollejon for which BEL would pay an annual fixed amount, in equal monthly
installments, based on energy supplied equal to 110 GWh in FY1996, 115 GWh in FY1997 and
1998, and 120 GWh up to FY2004, at a rate of 8.75 UScents per kWh. Excess energy is to be
purchased at 7 US cents per kWh. After FY2005, the fixed payments will be eliminated and
BEL will pay only for the energy actually taken, on a take-or-pay basis. In addition, the
Government signed a guarantee agreement to backup BEB's obligations under the power purchase
contract. BEB's rights and obligations under the power purchase agreement were taken over by
BEL. Construction of the hydroelectric plant, and its associated transmission system, is
underway. Completion is expected by March 1995. The estimated project cost is US$59
million, including US$6 million for financing costs.
7.    In the last three years, the previous and the new GOB have moved clearly and strongly



- -
in the direction of reform and private participation in the power sector, basically in line with
Bank policy in the sector. Although the initial public offering of 1W-Us shares was oniv partlally
successful, the present GOBi is open o consider additional private Participation in BEL. The
Conmnonwealth Development Corporation's (CDC) request, to have part of its loan, with the debt
convertible to equity in the near future, is one way to inorea.e- private participation.  rhe
implementation of the propose  project, combined with the expectetd imptovemnent of BEL's
operations as a commercial corporation, will mncrease BEL's attraiivcnes.s to private s"eor
investors.
TiLE PROJECT
8.    Project Objectives. The proposed project would improve electric power supply in Belize
by integrating its major load centers and providing access to econiomical, reliable and clean
sources of energy. The project will also improve the environment for private sector participation
in the power sector by strengthening the sector institutional and regulatory frameworks, with the
ultimate objective of reducing the cost of electricity to consumers.
9.     Project Description. The hMollejon supply will replace part of the thermal generation by
diesel units in the Belmopan/San Ignacio and Belize City/Ladyville load centcrs. As a run-of-
river plant, the powtr and energy output of Mollejon is highly variable during seasons and years.
Therefore, complementary generation will be required to cover future demand. The proposed
project, together with the Mexican and Mollejon power supply, will provide Belize with a more
economical, reliable and en7ironmentally clean electricity supply than would the continued
expansion of diesel generatior. The proposed project consists of: (a) the construction of a 115
kV interconnection transmission system running from the border with Mexico to Belize City; (b)
the integration of San Pedro (the major tourist area of the country) to the system; (c) the
integration of Dangriga (the principal area of the citrus industry) to the system; (d) a dispatch
center, supervisory control, data acquisition and comr 'nications for system operations; (e) an
environmental mitigation program for the existing diesel plants; and (1) consulting services to
assist BEL in engineering and project management, and provide technical assistance and training.
10.   Project Cost and Financing. The project cost, at December 1993 prices, including
engineering and project management, and physical and price contingencies, excluding taxes and
duties, is estimated at the equivalent of US$29.73 million. Of this amount US$26.55 million
(89%) would be foreign costs. Total financing requirements, including US$3.25 million interest
during construction, are estimated at US$32.98 million. Engineering and project management
costs are estimated at about 10% of direct project costs plus physical contingencies, which is in
line with similar projects. Physical contingencies of 15% have been taken olx local costs, which
are essentially labor costs and local transport. For foreign costs, which represent mainly
materials and equipment, a contingency allowance of 10% has been added.  For price
contingencies, a 5% overall allowance has been considered adequate, given the fact that very little
inflationary pressure is foreseen in the next few years that would affect the construction cost of
the nature involved in the proposed project. Schedule A presents detailed project costs and
financing plan in tabular form. Procurement arrangements are given in Schedule B, and a
timetable of the project's key processing events in Schedule C.

11.   Environmerital Aspects. During project preparation, a preliminary evaluation was carried
out of environmental management problems in BEL's major diesel plants. Fires and oil spills
have occurred in some of these plants in recent years. Terms of reference were prepared for a
pollution mitigation program to be financed under the proposed Project, covering the following
issues: spill prevention, control and countermeasures; noise pollution control; smoke emission
control; remediation of contaminated areas; and training for BEL staff.
12.   The environmental impact of the  15 kV interconnection transmission line with Mexico
and the submarine cable to Ambergris Cay has been carefully studied by reputable consultants.
Consultants concluded that with proper precaution in routing and construction of the transmission
line only minimal environmental impact would occur sincc that part of Belize is generally covered
by low bush. Right of way for the iiae would require therefore very limited tree pruning. For
the submarine cable installation, care will be taken to avoid as much as possible areas of live
coral. Extreme ends of the submarine cable will be buried in such a way as not to present
unsightly appearances. All other lines would follow established right-of-ways with land clearing
and visual impact kept to a minimum. Substation structures will be properly screened to reduce
undesired visual impact.
13.   Project Implementation. The project will be implemented by BEL with the assistance of
consultants for the preparation of tender documents, bid evaluation, engineering and supervision
of construction of the transmission lines, substations, submarine cable, and the installation of the
supervisory control and data acquisition system. BEL, whose management md staff successfully
implemented the first Power Development Project (Loan 2749-BEL), has established a Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a Project Co-ordinator with experience and qualifications
acceptable to the Bank. The PIU will be responsible for overall project management and the
maintenance of accounting records. BEL would be responsible for the cost of the service and
tariff study and implementing the training program. Government, through the Energy Unit of
the Ministry of Energy and Communications, is responsible for implementing the study relating
to the establishment of regulations for tariff setting.
14.   Proiect Sustainabilky. Project design stresses institutional strengthening, training and
technical assistance to enhance successful project implementation and operation. The focus on
sector policy framework improvement is intended to ensure efficient pricing t_ cost recovery,
and promote expansion of private participation in the sector. To monitor BEL's financial
soundness, annual financial forecasts would be prepared by BEL and reviewed by the Bank. The
forecasts would serve as the basis for deteimining whether any tariff adjustments would be
required to meet the rate of return covenant under the Project Agreement.
15.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. The first Power Development Project
(Loan 2749-BEZ) was succesfully completed on schedule in December 1993. Project selection
based on economic evaluation was introduced, BEB's finances were restructured and efficiency
improvements made. The main lesson learned from the project is that, with strong commitnent
on the part of Government and the project entity, an entity providing poor electricity service and
with weak finances can make substantial improvements.



.5-
16.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. CAS Board review took place in November 30, 1993,
during discussionof the Belize City Infirastructure Project. The proposed project is consistent
with the CAS. Tle Bank's country assistance strategy will focus on the provision of needed
assistance to preserve Be!ize's macroeconomic financial stability, improve the incentive
framework and related infrastructure to facilitate increased private sector participation in the
development of the economy and ensure human resource development, poverty alleviatiorn and
environmental sustainability. Accordingly, the Bank's on-going program of assistance has been
aimed at: (i) encouraging Belize to maintain a sound macroeconomic framework and enhance its
incentives for private sector development in light of the changig external environment; (i)
supporting the Government's efforts to strengthen the public sector planning capacity and improve
Belize's basic infrastructure; (iii) assisting the Government in the formulation and implementation
of its human resources and poverty alleviation, and environmental preservation agenda; and (iv)
assisting the Govermnent in ob'aining external donor assistance in support of its overall
development objectives. With infrastructure projects in implementation and at advance stage of
preparation, the Bank intends to increase its focus in the future on human resource development
and the environmenr.
17.   The proposed project is an economically attractive and environmentally sound option to
address a key infrastructure development issue. The interconnection with Mexico will provide
Belize with a long-term reliable and economic source of electricity to complement its limited
indigenous resources. The proposed project is therefore consistent with Belize's development and
Bank's assistance strategies.
18.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations it was agreed with GOB that: (i) it will enact,
by March 31, 1995, specific regulations, in accordance with the Electricity Act of 1992, defining
transparent procedures for electricity tariffs setting and approval; and (ii) it would promptly take
all measures necessary to enable BEL to comply with the rate of return requirements of the
Project.
19.   During negotiations it was agreed with BFT that it will: (i) employ consultants to carry
out a tariff study on terms of reference agreed with the Bank, and not later than March 31, 1995,
furnish to he Bank the Government's and BEL's recommendations based on the results of this
study, and after consultation with the Bank, promptly implement such recommendations; (ii)
engage independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank, and submit BEL's audited accounts,
including SOE's and the Special Account to the Bank not later than four months after the end of
its fiscal year; (iii) maintain the Project Implementation Unit properly staffed and funded; (iv)
carry out the project according to an agreed implementation plan and schedule; (v) maintain its
tariffs at a level sufficient to earn a rate of return on its average net fixed assets in operation,
revalued from time to time when required by the Bank, of not less than 7% for FY96 and
thereafter; (vi) before January 1 of each fiscal year, furnish to the Bank a preliminary estimate
of the rate of return for the current fiscal year and for the subsequent fiscal year and if the
estimates indicate that BEL will not meet the rate of return requirements, promptly take all
necessary measures to meet such requirements; (vii) not incur any new debt (other than for the
Project) without the prior approval of the Bank unless its future debt service coverage ratio is 1.5
or higher; and (viii) not undertake any investment in excess of US$500,000, until completion of
the Second Power Development Project, without the approval of the Bank.



20.   Conditions of effectiNeness of the proptse  loan would be that: (i) BEL should have
signied an extended long-term power supply contract with Comision Federal de Electricidad
(C£E), MWxic&, on terms and conditions satisfactofy to the Bank; (ii) a satisfactory subsidiary
loani agreement has been executed between Government and BEL; and (iii) CDC's Board should
have approved a loan to finance the cost of the I 15 kV substations and the Dangriga connection
co!fponents of the proposed pfvject.          -                    :
21.    ero Bienefits aT6d Risks. The proposed project would result in overall improvement
ifi tfie generatioin and supply of electricity, teduLed cost to consumers and a more reliable and
cost effective supply of electriicity in Belize. There are nq major risks in project construction and
completion. Apart fml the dispatch center and SCADA, all the other components of the project
are standard eleCtric utility facilities with very well known technologies. During project operation
the major risk is BEL's financial performance. If Maca river hydrology is significantly less
favorable than expected, obligations under the power purchase agreement with Mollejon
developers could affect negatively BEL financial condition in some years. To mitigate this
potential rick, contractual provisions allow for a compensation mechanisnm ("energy bank") and
the replacement of the fixed payments condition, after the tenth year of operation of Mollejon,
by a take-or-pay clausc. In the short-term, BEL would reduce its planned non-project capital
spending and, if necessary, make temporary use of bank overdraft facilities.
2?.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
Of Agreement of the Bank and recomrmend tllat the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
