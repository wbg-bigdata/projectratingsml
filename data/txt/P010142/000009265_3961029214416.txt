MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Impact Evaluation Report on Sri Lanka
Smalli oldler Rubber Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1017-CE)
Fourth Tree Crops Project (Credlit 1562-CE)
Attached is the Inipact Evaluation Report on the Sri Lanka-Smaliholder
Rubber Rehabilitation project (Credit 1017-CE, approved in FY80) and the Fourth Tree Crops
project (Credit 1 562-CE, approved in FY85) prepared by the Operations Evaluation Department.
The Smaliholder Rubber Rehabilitation (SRR) project was the first of two IDA
financed projects designed to support the government's scheme to replant over-aged, low-
yielding smaliholder rubber trees. To do so, the project aimed to strengthen the administrative
capacity of agencies responsible for replanting; provide adequate inputs and incentives; improve
the quality of smaliholder rubber and expand the capacity for future replanting.
The main objective of the Fourth Tree Crops (FTC) project was to reverse the
decline in Sri Lanka's production of tea, rubber and coconuts by improving the performance of
two large, government-owned plantation corporations. This was to be achieved by improving
producer incentives, increasing productivity, rehabilitating factories and strengthening the
management and financial control of the corporations. The project also aimed to stabilize lands
through soil conservation and improve the health and welfare of estate workers. During
implementation, GOSL decided to privatize the management of the two corporations because of
rapidly increasing losses. Privatization became the most important institutional development
issue under the project.
After some delay, both projects largely achieved their physical (replanting)
targets, but these did not translate fully into achievement of project objectives, particularly in the
FTC project. The disconnect is explained by a number of missing links between physical
targets and project objectives, notably quality factors (such as poor clonal varieties or inadequate
field maintenance) and constrainits that were not addressed under the projects (such as labor
distortions and deficient management incentive systems under the FTC project). There were
also important external shocks. particularly the decline in prices for all three tree crops, the
escalation of violent political and ethinic confrontation, and the rise in the opportunity cost of
labor as Sri Lanka's textiles and services sectors flourished.
Economic rates of return were below ten percent for both projects. The SRR
project yielded an ERR of 4.8 percent. whereas the FTC project generated returns of 8.2 percent
for tea, 7.4 percent for rubber and 2.0 percent for coconuts. The main reasons for the low
returns were unforeseen declines in commodity prices, lower than expected yields (for rubber
and coconuts) and higher than projected costs of production. Based on these returns, both
projects are rated as unsatisfactory at impact evaluation.

The FTC project's social welfare objectives were largely achieved. After
appraisal, beneficiary surveys were conducted and the resulting findings were used to identify
and prioritize social welfare improvements. Beneficiary participation was high in the
construction of latrines and the re-roofing of houses, both of which were added to the project as
a result of the surveys. Appraisal targets with respect to dispensaries and health centers were
also exceeded. These successes are clearly associated with improvements in health and
demographic indicators for estate residents that occurred during the project period.
Institutional objectives were, on the whole, not achieved. Bank-proposed
reforms under the SRR project to improve rubber policy development and planning, as well as
to integrate extension with the authorization of government grants for replanting, were soon
reversed due to differences of opinion in the administration. The FTC project had little effect
on the quality of management systems at the two corporations. Institutional development for
both projects is rated as modest, at best.
Around the mid-point of project implementation, privatizing the corporations
became an explicit objective of the FTC project. This is not reflected in the above ratings of
the project's performance. Although the Bank's objectives and approach were generally sound
and its supervision and technical support increased the transparency of the privatization process,
the final outcome was unsatisfactory and unsustainable. The Bank encouraged GOSL to
privatize the ownership of the estates or to grant long-term leases to private companies.
However, the government opted to retain full ownership of the estates and to grant short-term,
renewable management contracts to private agents. Political interference in the management of
the estates has persisted, especially in wage determination and the deployment of labor. The
management arrangements have also provided little incentive for the private sector to inject
much needed capital into the plantations. Thus, in spite of improvements in cultivation
practices, the estates have continued to make losses and their debts are escalating rapidly.
The sustainability of the FTC project's benefits hinges on a resolution of the
privatization issue. The SRR project has benefitted from continued support for strengthening
extension and other services under the follow-on operation. However, the need to increase the
levy on exports of rubber (proceeds from which are used to replenish the Rubber Replanting
Fund, which gives grants to farmers for replanting), and the continuing shortage of labor for
tapping call into question the sustainability of the project's benefits. Therefore, the
sustainability of both projects' benefits is rated as uncertain.
OED has received comments from the Borrower and from the Government of
the Netherlands, one of the cofinanciers for the Fourth Tree Crops project. These have been
taken into account in the text and are attached as an annex to the report.

Preface
This report is one of a series of impact evaluations undertaken as a result of the Bank's
increased emphasis on the sustainability of the operations it finances. To complete the
evaluation in a timely fashion, an analysis of all aspects of project impact was eschewed in
favor of those factors thought most likely to determine the future of the tree crops sector in Sri
Lanka. The most significant of these is the 1992 privatization of the management of two of
the world's largest plantation corporations. The decision to privatize the management of the
estates was driven by rapidly increasing financial losses under government management.
Privatization of ownership was not considered politically feasible. Although the new
management was appointed after the Fourth Tree Crops (FTC) project was closed, the Bank
played an important role in the privatization process during project implementation by funding
technical assistance, undertaking sector work and sustaining a dialogue on policy changes.
The report analyses the agricultural, economic, financial, social and institutional impact
of the Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation (SRR) project and the Fourth Tree Crops (FTC)
project. The two projects were selected for an impact evaluation because of the importance of
the tree crops sector to Sri Lanka's development and because together the two projects offered
an opportunity to review and contrast experience with tree crop development at the
smaliholder and the estate level. The privatization issues related to the FTC project were also
regarded as relevant for other borrowing member countries of the World Bank Group that are
considering privatization of state-owned agricultural enterprises. Finally, the evaluation of the
SRR project is timely in that it allows for an assessment of the long term effects of the first
SRR project, while informing the on-going, follow-on SRR operation, notably with regard to
factors that are likely to influence the sustainability of both projects' benefits.
The report is based on a review of the appraisal reports, the loan documents, the project
completion reports, the Performance Audit Report for the SRR project, the transcripts of the
Executive Directors' meeting at which the projects were considered, project files, and a
number of other relevant documents prepared by the Borrower, the Bank and cofinanciers.
The projects were discussed with Bank staff associated with their design and implementation.
In October/November 1994 an OED mission visited Sri Lanka. Discussions were held with
government officials and representatives of the cofinanciers, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), private management companies, brokers and dealers. The mission also undertook
field trips to tea, rubber and coconut growing areas to meet with private and government estate
managers, supervisors and workers, and with rubber smallholders. The valuable assistance
provided by the Government of Sri Lanka, as well as all the persons contacted by the mission,
is gratefully acknowledged.

Evaluation Summary
Background
1.    Tree crops have played a central role in Sri Lanka's development since the 19th
century, when tea and rubber were introduced to the island. At that time coconuts were
already a long-time staple, grown primarily by smallholders. Sri Lanka is currently the
world's largest exporter of tea and one of the world's five largest exporters of coconut kernel
products, such as desiccated coconut. While Sri Lanka's output of natural rubber is modest
compared to its main competitors, export duties on rubber have been a major source of
earnings for the government (12 percent of revenues in 1979).
2.    Until the late 1970s, Sri Lanka adopted a generally inward-oriented development
strategy that entailed increasing government intervention in the economy. The tree crops
sector had long been an exception to the inward-oriented policy, accounting for more than
three quarters of Sri Lanka's export earnings by 1979. However, heavy taxation of the
sector's earnings, coupled with repeated threats of nationalization and declining commodity
prices, led to inadequate investment in replanting. By the late 1970s, the actual and potential
output of tree crops had been seriously eroded by years of neglect. Furthermore, new
challenges had emerged after 1972 as a result of the nationalization of all landholdings over 20
hectares. Two government-owned plantation corporation-the Janatha Estates Development
Board (JEDB) and the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC)-gained control of
more than half the area under tea cultivation, 30 percent of the area under rubber and about 5
percent of the area under coconuts.
3.    GOSL recognized these challenges and sought external assistance to reverse the
decline in the sector. The Bank's overall strategy supported the government's policy of
gradual trade liberalization, deregulation and privatization. However, since the privatization
policy did not extend to JEDB and SLSPC, in 1978 the Bank embarked on a series of four
projects that aimed to rehabilitate tree crops and diversify production on government-owned
estates. Taken together, the four projects accounted for 43 percent of Bank-wide lending for
tea during the last two decades. These four projects aimed at government estates were
complemented by two projects targeted at smallholder rubber growers. This Impact Evaluation
Report (IER) focusses on the first Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation project (Credit 1017-CE)
and on the Fourth Tree Crops project (Credit 1562-CE).
The Projects
4.    An IDA credit of US$16 million equivalent was approved for the first Smallholder
Rubber Rehabilitation (SRR) project in May 1980. The objectives of the project were to
improve production and enhance earnings for rubber smallholders by supporting the replanting
of over-aged and degraded stands, in-filling of gaps in viable stands, rehabilitation or
expansion of group processing centers, and institutional strengthening of the Rubber Control
Department (RCD) and Advisory Services Department (ASD) of the Ministry of Plantation
Industries (MPI). A small component was provided for the Rubber Research Institute of Sri



10
Lanka (RRISL) and funding was provided for impact evaluation surveys and case studies by
the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI). Most of the IDA credit was to be
channelled to the government's Rubber Replanting Fund (RRF), which provides grants to
smallholders for replanting rubber. While grant payments are recovered in part via a cess on
exports of rubber, cess revenues have not been sufficient to cover the RRF's expenditures
(paras. 2.39ff).
5.    The Fourth Tree Crops (FTC) project was supported by an IDA credit of US$55
million equivalent, approved in March 1985, and cofinanced with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB); the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom; and the
Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank. The objective of the project was to reverse
the decline in tea, rubber and coconut production on public sector estates operated by JEDB
and SLSPC, two of the world's largest plantation corporations at that time. This objective was
to be achieved by improving estate productivity through field development (replanting and in-
filling of degraded and over-aged areas under tea and rubber, replanting and under-planting of
areas under coconuts, and diversification into fuelwood in areas considered unsuitable for tree
crops), development of field nurseries to produce replanting materials, factory rehabilitation,
strengthening the corporations' management and financial control capabilities, and improving
housing, health and social amenities for estate workers through respective project components,
collectively referred to as the Social Welfare Program (SWP).
Project Implementation
6.     The SRR project was closed in June 1988, 21/2 years later than planned. About
US$4.9 million of the credit was canceled, primarily due to depreciation of the Sri Lankan
rupee (LKR), which increased the local value of IDA funds beyond what was required to
implement the project. The final project cost was US$19.6 million, compared to an SAR
estimate of US$28 million. The project got off to a good start but ran into trouble il 1983 as
a result of drought conditions and a shortage of replanting materials. The appraisal objective
of replanting 18,800 hectares was achieved at project closing in 1988, notwithstanding the
need to uproot 1,500 ha of rubber in the project area due to an attack of Corynespora leaf spot
(a fungal disease).
7.     Civil unrest led to implementation delays in the FTC project, which was closed in
December 1991, 11/2 years late. Actual costs were US$237.7 million, compared to US$211.8
million at appraisal. Much larger areas of tea and rubber were replanted than had been
planned, whereas in-filling targets for tea were not met. This was due to the fixed cost nature
of labor costs and the existence of surplus labor, for which estate superintendents attempted to
create employment. The excessive replanting rate outpaced the flow of counterpart funds,
leading to the reallocation of most Bank funds earmarked for nursery development and
institutional development to the field development component. In addition, senior Bank
management approved an increase in IDA's disbursement percentage for the field development
component from 35 percent to 90 percent. Government intervention in labor matters precluded
effective direct bargaining between the unions and plantation managers and resulted in
substantial wage increases and employment guarantees that reduced efficiency and drove up
costs. This is largely attributable to pressure from labor unions representing the largely Tamil
estate workforce. The unions acquired considerable political clout as a result of the extension



11
of voting rights to Tamils of Indian origin in the early 1980s and of the government's security
concerns resulting from the ethnic conflict in Jaffna. While progress was made under the
project on housing and health care for estate workers, conditions for estate residents are still
poor, compared with those of the rural population.
Project Results
8.     Virtually the entire area replanted under the Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation project
(18,800 ha) is now mature, although the earliest replantings are just reaching full development.
By 1999, it is estimated that production will reach 19,530 tons/year, equivalent to 22 percent
of average annual output by private producers during the project period, 1981-88. Yields are
expected to peak at 1,080 kg/ha, 15 to 17 years after replanting. These figures are the same as
the PCR's, but are 20 percent lower than appraisal projections.
9.     Both the SAR and the PCR calculations assume no replanting in the absence of the
project, so that all production at full development is incremental. But given the age of rubber
stands, there would clearly have been some replanting even without the project. The impact
evaluation estimates that production would have reached only 9,080 tons by 1999 in the
absence of the project, due primarily to funding constraints on the RRF and to more limited
outreach by the extension services. The SRR project's net impact on production is therefore
estimated at 10,450 tons/year.
10.    At appraisal of the SRR project, economic rates of return were expected to reach 23
percent (paras. 2.17ff). At project completion, ERRs were re-estimated at 18 percent, mainly
because of reduced yields and lower prices. A further unforeseen decline in rubber prices
coupled with a sharp upswing in real wages for tappers have reduced the re-estimated ERR for
the project to 4.8 percent.
11.    Re-estimated financial returns (FRRs) on replanted rubber were attractive at impact
evaluation (14.4 percent) for smallholders who used family labor for tapping. However, FRRs
were below ten percent for smallholders who relied on hired labor for tapping, i.e. about half
of all smallholders with less than four hectares of land (paras. 2.35ff). These returns are lower
than estimates for FRRs for various farm models at appraisal (11 to 21 percent). One reason
for the decline is real wage inflation prompted by the growth of Sri Lanka's textiles and
services industries. Another reason is lower than expected yields. Eighty percent of the
project area was replanted with a low-yielding clone (PB 86) that had been superseded in
Malaysia in the 1960s. This was a serious error. The problem of insufficient clonal material
of acceptable quality was compounded by poor cultivation practices. A further reason for the
low returns is the low quality of smallholder-processed rubber. While the project attempted to
address this via co-operative-style Group Processing Centers, the GPCs experienced numerous
logistical problems and failed to attract members (para. 2.38).
12.    Replanting grants and intercropping with bananas raised FRRs on rubber investments
to acceptable levels. However, only one in eight farmers planted intercrops and most growers,
especially those with less than one hectare, failed to maintain proper cultivation practices and
were therefore ineligible for the full grant.



12
13.   Under the Fourth Tree Crops project, annual production of tea on government estates
is expected to reach 185,200 tons by the year 2014, compared to estimated without-project
production of 141,300 tons as a result of no replanting, for an increment of 43,900 tons/year.
The SAR and PCR estimated incremental production at 47,900 tons/year and 39,700 tons/year,
respectively. At impact evaluation, yields on replanted areas are expected to average 2,125
kg/ha made tea at full development (12 years after replanting), which is fairly standard for
vegetatively propagated (VP) clonal teas, and is consistent with SAR and PCR estimates.
14.    With respect to rubber, annual production on government estates is expected to peak at
65,800 tons in the year 2002, compared to without-project production of 49,200 tons/year.
The incremental production of 16,600 tons/year at full development is explained by a larger
replanting program and by higher yields than in the absence of the project (para. 2.12). The
project's net impact on production is unlikely to reach appraisal projections of 20,100
tons/year at full development.
15.    With regard to coconuts, annual production on government estates is expected to reach
57.1 million nuts/year at full development of the FTC project (in 2006). Without a replanting
program, production on the estates would have declined to 49.6 million nuts/year in 2006.
Thus the FTC project will result in incremental production of up to 7.5 million nuts/year at
fuill development. This is less than half the appraisal estimate of incremental production, 18
million nuts/year, due to major shortfalls on both yields and area replanted.
16.    Economic rates of return at appraisal of the FTC project were projected to reach 28 to
31 percent for tea, 24 to 28 percent for rubber and 18 percent for coconuts. The ERR for the
project was estimated at 26 percent. The PCR re-estimated the project ERR at 10 to 15
percent. Rates of return were found to be 10 to 1 1 percent for tea and I I to 15 percent for
rubber. The PCR did no calculations for investments in coconuts, since these accounted for
less than 5 percent of project costs and information was inadequate. The decreases in ERRs
for tea and rubber were due to higher production costs and lower output prices than foreseen
at appraisal. The impact evaluation revealed a further modest decline in returns. Revised
ERRs range from 8.2 percent for tea to 7.4 percent for rubber and only 2 percent for coconuts.
The ERR for the project (excluding unquantified welfare benefits and related costs) is
estimated at 7.9 percent (paras. 2.17ff).
17.    The financial performance of the two government corporations has been dismal.
JEDB lost money every year after Bank approval of the FTC project, while SLSPC reported a
profit only twice. Both companies became increasingly reliant on external borrowing and on
overdrafts from government-owned commercial banks for day-to-day expenditures. For
example, JEDB's debt-equity ratio soared from 0.8 in 1982 to an unsustainable 9.8 in 1989.
"Creative accounting techniques" were employed to make the financial position of SLSPC
appear less dire (para. 2.25). In 1990, the two corporations had to be bailed out at a cost of
LKR 3.6 billion. Since then, the tree crops sector has been a major burden on the fisc, as
GOSL's expenses on the estates have risen while export duties on tea and rubber and the ad
valorem sales tax on tea have been phased out (para. 2.32).
18.   The main reasons for the losses at JEDB and SLSPC were depressed world prices,
stagnant productivity and rising costs of production. The latter two were attributable to
internal factors, including restrictions on the movement and use of labor, political patronage



13
and mismanagement of the estates. Project investments added to the corporations' short term
liquidity problems, while yielding unattractive returns in the longer term: FRRs at impact
evaluation range from 8.3 percent for rubber to 0.4 percent for coconuts.
19.   The FTC project included social welfare objectives that were largely achieved (paras.
3. I1ff). After appraisal, beneficiary surveys were conducted and social welfare services were
identified and prioritized on the basis of the resulting "Needs Assessments". Beneficiary
participation was high in the construction of latrines and re-roofing of houses. These items
were not included at appraisal but were identified as high priorities by estate residents.
Appraisal targets with respect to dispensaries and health centers were exceeded. These
successes are clearly associated with some of the improvements in health and demographic
indicators for estate residents that occurred during the project period.
Privatization
20.    Privatization became the most important institutional issue for the FTC project,
although it was not an objective at appraisal. Following the mid-term review of the project in
September 1988, the Bank encouraged GOSL to establish a Core Group to solve the growing
financial crisis at JEDB and SLSPC. This led eventually to the establishment of a Task Force
in 1990 with a broader mandate, namely to consider the "..appropriate structure, organization
and management of the two corporations.." (para. 3.36). The Task Force met with
considerable resistance, due to the political sensitivity of the privatization issue.
21.    The Bank was the main source of external guidance on the privatization process, but
its objectives and approach differed significantly from GOSL's (para. 4.10). In particular, the
Bank supported the transfer of ownership to the private sector, including to foreign firms, so
as to attract skills and capital. The government favored and finally adopted a management
contract approach to privatization that relied on management contracts with no equity stakes
for management companies and no foreign participation. GOSL wanted to retain control of
the assets and ensure that employment would not be adversely affected. What emerged in
1992 was a highly restrictive management arrangement with 22 private Sri Lankan Estate
Management Companies (EMCs, para. 4.27). The winners were identified via open bids in
April 1992 after more than 150 local and foreign firms had expressed an interest. The 22
EMCs signed management contracts with 22 new, wholly government-owned Regional
Plantation Corporations, which were given control over most of JEDB's and SLSPC's 500
estates.
22.   In January 1992, the Bank withdrew its intended support for a follow-on to the FTC
project, because GOSL was not prepared to make a time-bound commitment to privatizing the
ownership of the estates or to awarding long term leases to the EMCs as a second-best
solution. In practice, private management has reduced losses on the estates and increased
efficiency. However, the private sector has been unwilling to inject funds into state-owned
companies in which it has no equity share and with which it only has five-year management
contracts. Furthermore, GOSL interference in wage decisions has persisted. Thus costs have
not been reduced sufficiently, nor has private capital been attracted to the sector. These
problems have led to rising debts that are undermining the sustainability of the current
arrangement.



14
Findings at Impact Evaluation
23.    Both projects are rated as unsatisfactory at impact evaluation. To be sure, they were
implemented under challenging circumstances, arising from an ethnic conflict that erupted in
the north of the island in 1981 and from violent political confrontation in the south in the late
1980s. The FTC project was particularly affected by these conflicts, both indirectly via the
northern conflict's effects on wage determination and directly via the murder of 25 estate
superintendents following the southern outbreak. Furthermore, during 1980-92 world prices
declined for all three tree crops.
24.    Successes in other sectors, notably the high rates of growth achieved in the labor-
intensive textiles and services sectors, resulted in labor shortages on rubber smallholdings and
drove up the cost of labor. The labor issues on government estates were somewhat different: a
blend of ethnic and political factors contributed to high wage increases, constraints on the
movement of labor between estates, year-round employment guarantees, low work norms,
declining productivity and severe underemployment of estate labor, particularly in the
mountainous tea-growing areas in the centre of the island. In addition, political and cultural
factors have militated against reforms to a highly inefficient work rule for tea pluckers, who
are almost exclusively women. They are required to work eight hours to receive the daily
wage even if they can complete their assigned task (and more) in less than eight hours. Male
workers, on the other hand, are free to leave as soon as they finish their assigned task and are
still guaranteed a full day's wage.
25.    The price and labor factors, combined with low yields due to weak management,
outdated cultivation and processing practices, and poor quality inputs, undermined the expected
returns under the two projects. Notwithstanding improvements in cultivation practices on
government estates under private management, these factors continue to make the sustainabilitv
of project benefits uncertain.
Lessons at Impact Evaluation
26.    The tree crops sector is likely to prosper if and only if appropriate policy measures are
taken. Past approaches have failed to be sufficiently comprehensive or structured. For
example, the FTC project was part of a medium term investment program that did not address
pressing labor concerns. The ultimate objectives should be to: i) generate sustainable growth,
and ii) improve the welfare of those who earn a living from the tree crops sector. These
ultimate objectives can only be achieved by galvanizing the sector via improved technology
and increased factor productivity, and by competing more effectively in international markets,
in ways that are specified below. Success with regard to these intermediate objectives in turn
requires a significant injection of capital, investment in human resources, exploitation of the
industry's global expertise, and elimination of inefficient practices.
27.    The analysis in this impact evaluation suggests that these objectives cannot be attained
under government management of the industry, nor will the restrictive private management
arrangement currently in place suffice. A coherent set of measures should be considered and
adopted by GOSL to create an enabling environment in which the private sector can flourish
(see the lessons below). The government's full commitment to this approach is as yet



15
uncertain, but will be essential in order to restore domestic and external investors' confidence
and provide investors with appropriate incentives. The Bank and other donors can and should
continue to play an important supporting role in the fulfillment of these objectives. These
policy proposals are consistent with the intentions communicated in a Policy Framework Paper
for 1994-96, that was prepared by GOSL in collaboration with staff of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Finally, the proposals are consistent with the lessons of
experience drawn from the evaluation of the SRR and FTC projects. These are summarized as
follows:
(a)    Support of Viable Tree Crops Projects. In the event of sharp movements in prices and
costs during implementation, the Bank should re-assess economic returns to ensure
that: i) the focus is maintained on development objectives rather than just on
implementation indicators; ii) projects that become inviable are restructured or
suspended in a timely manner without saddling the borrower with additional debt.
(b)    Support of Viable Rubber Replanting Schemes. T he Bank should only support a cess-
based, accelerated replanting program for tree crops if: i) the clonal material to be
replanted is of an internationally acceptable standard and has been thoroughly tested;
ii) the replanting grant is adjusted regularly to reflect changes in investment costs and
guarantee a minimum acceptable level of support; and, iii) cess rates are adjusted to
reflect changes in the level of grants.
(c)    Privatization as a Process. A process of privatization should: i) be transparent; ii)
enjoy unwavering commitment from the government; iii) be open to foreign
investment and expertise; iv) encourage participation by all stakeholders; v) secure
popular backing, rather than just the support of vested interests; and, vi) publicize the
positive case for privatization.
(d)    Attracting Private Capital. The privatization strategy adopted to date fails to provide
the private sector with adequate incentives to invest its capital and is therefore
unsustainable. The experience of the past two years suggests that privatization will
only succeed if private managers are given the option of purchasing a substantial share
of the equity of the corporations. This will: i) enable them to borrow and invest
against their shares; ii) provide incentives to invest in long-term projects and manage
the estates accordingly; and, iii) provide them with some down-side risk so as to
discourage excessive risk-taking.
(e)    Criteriafor Management Contracts. The design of the management contracts adopted
thus far has limited their effectiveness. The contracts are short-term and grant private
managers little operating autonomy. If management contracts are to be used for tree
crops plantations, they should be given for an extended period of time, e.g. 50 years,
and should provide substantial operating autonomy to private managers in order to
encourage long-term planning and investment. Even then, they must be regarded as
second-best arrangements for attracting private capital.
(f)    The Policy and Regulatory Environment. i) the elimination of export taxes was a
sound policy decision that should be maintained, together with an exchange rate policy
that takes into account its effects on the tree crops sector; ii) other regulatory reforns



16
warrant consideration, e.g. the removal of restrictions on direct sales outside the
auction system, in order to encourage vertical integration, the development of brand
names, price stabilization through forward contracts, and reductions in the lag between
production and disposal of tea.
(g)    Labor Wages and Productivity. i) Wages and benefits should be subject to collective
bargaining between managers and unions; ii) specific contractual commitments are
required to safeguard private sector investments against arbitrary administrative
decisions on labor matters; iii) jobs can only be preserved if productivity is increased,
e.g. by allowing workers to move from labor surplus to labor deficit areas and by
renegotiating work norms that have been set at unduly low levels.
(h)    "Putting People First". i) Needs assessments and beneficiary participation were key
elements in the success of the social welfare program; ii) the underemployment of
estate youth is an acute problem requiring urgent attention, e.g. via training and
promotion of off-farm opportunities; iii) women's work norms as tea pluckers result in
compulsory overtime that is inefficient and lowers women's effective wage rates.
Therefore the best practices applied in tea growing countries in Eastern Africa should
be piloted and then, if successful, applied more widely on Sri Lankan estates.

1. Introduction
A. Background
1.1    Tree crops have played a central role in Sri Lanka's development since the 19th
century, when tea and rubber were introduced to the island. At that time coconuts were
already a long-time staple, grown primarily by smallholders. By 1965, Sri Lanka had become
the world's largest exporter of tea, a position that it lost to India during the 1970s but regained
in the late 1980s. Natural rubber production is second in importance to tea in terms of export
revenues, but has been a major source of earnings for the government, accounting for as much
as 12 percent of government revenues in 1979. Although more than three-quarters of Sri
Lanka's coconuts are consumed domestically, Sri Lanka ranks among the world's top five
exporters of kernel products.
1.2    Following Independence in 1948, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) pursued an
inward-oriented development strategy that involved increasing government intervention in the
economy. The proposal to nationalize tree crop estates was repeatedly raised after
Independence, leading landowners to limit their long-term investments in the industry. After a
change of government in 1972, all landholdings exceeding 20 hectares (50 acres) were indeed
nationalized. This placed two government-owned plantation corporations-the Janatha Estates
Development Board (JEDB) and the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC)-in
control of more than half of the area under tea cultivation, 30 percent of the area under rubber
and about 5 percent of the area under coconuts. The two corporations were then among the
largest plantation corporations in the world.
1.3    The predominant role of tree crops as a source of export revenues changed after 1977,
when a change of government led to liberalization of the trade regime and then to new sources
of export earnings and economic growth. Furthermore, the growth potential of tree crops had
been eroded by years of inadequate investment in replanting. The new administration
recognized this and other challenges (e.g. falling real prices for tree crops) and sought external
assistance to reverse the decline in the sector. During 1978-79, the Canadian and British
Governments provided technical assistance to prepare masterplans for tea and rubber,
respectively. IDA simultaneously began preparing the first of two projects targeted at
smallholder rubber growers and the first of four projects targeted at the government estate
sector (Table 1.1). Taken together, the latter four projects have accounted for 43 percent of
all Bank lending for tea in the last two decades.1
1.4    This Impact Evaluation Report (IER) focusses on the first Smallholder Rubber
Rehabilitation project (SRR, Credit 1017-CE, approved in 1980) and on the Fourth Tree Crops
project (FTC, Credit 1562-CE, approved in 1985). The two projects were selected for an
impact evaluation because of the importance of the sector for Sri Lanka's development and
because together the two projects offered an opportunity to review and contrast experience

with tree crop development at both the smallholder and the estate level. The privatization
issues related to the FTC project were regarded as relevant for other borrowing member
countries of the World Bank Group that are considering privatization of state-owned
agricultural enterprises. Finally, the evaluation of the SRR project is timely in that it allows
for an assessment of the long term effects of the first SRR project, while informing the follow-
on SRR operation with regard to the factors that are likely to influence the sustainability of
both projects' benefits.
1.5     The projects were implemented under challenging circumstances arising from  an ethnic
conflict that erupted in the north of the island in 1981 and from violent political confrontation
in the south in the late 1980s.2 The macroeconomic environment was also unfavorable in the
early 1980s, with a downturn in growth and employment and a rise in the real effective
exchange rate. The environment improved in the second half of the decade after the
government had launched economic stabilization and reform programs.

1.6     Since 1993, the economy has grown at over 6 percent per annum. Central Bank data
suggest that much of the expansion in output has come from the labor-intensive textiles and
2. A number of estate superintendents were murdered in the late 1980s as the country was virtually brought to a standstill.
Indeed, both JEDB and SLSPC financial statements reflect expenditures on defence in 1989 and 1990 to protect staff. The PCR
(pam. 5.10) notes that the estate staff "-were completely exposed to terrorist activity throughout the period. The successful
physical achievements in field development serve as a monument to their loyalty and bravery."

services sectors. Consequently, labor shortages have emerged on rubber smallholdings and the
cost of labor has risen (Annex D). The labor issues on government estates are somewhat
different: a blend of ethnic and political factors has contributed to high wage increases,
declining productivity and severe underemployment of estate labor, particularly in the
mountainous tea-growing areas in the centre of the island.
1.7    The labor distortions, coupled with declining prices for tea crops resulted in increasing
losses for the two plantation corporations. Since privatization of ownership was felt to be
politically infeasible, GOSL decided to privatize the management of the estates as a way of
halting the drain on public coffers. The 1992 transfer of management responsibilities to 22
estate management companies (EMCs, Annex A) was one of the largest agricultural sector
privatization in the world to date. The approach adopted by GOSL was rather unusual-open
bids for management contracts with no equity stakes and no foreign participation-which
makes it an interesting case study for an impact evaluation. The Bank believed that the
strategy did not go far enough and withheld support for a proposed follow-on operation to the
FTC project. In practice, private management has reduced losses on the estates and increased
efficiency, but rising debts are undermining the sustainability of the current arrangement.
B. Focus of Investigation and Layout of the Report
1.8    First and foremost, this impact evaluation attempts to estimate the net benefits of the
two projects and assess whether these benefits are sustainable. Subsequently, the report
identifies the agricultural, economic, financial, social and institutional impact of the two
projects on key stakeholders: smallholder rubber growers, GOSL, the plantation corporations,
and estate labor.
1.9    Second, the report addresses key issues that arise from the experience of the two
projects. These include:
The viability of the smallholder rubber replanting scheme. At appraisal of the
Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation project, the level of the replanting grant was found
to be closely correlated with replanting by borrowers. This report discusses the
adequacy of the replanting grant and the liquidity of the rubber replanting fund (RRF)
from which the grant is paid. The report also considers whether replanting is
warranted even with increased grants, in the light of the increasing cost and scarcity of
labor for tapping.
*      The viability of the plantation corporations. The report examines the financial position
of the corporations both before and after privatization of management. Reasons are
identified for changes in the financial position and those related to the FTC project are
highlighted. The analysis suggests lessons for improving the financial performance of
the government estates.
The evolution and implementation of the privatization strategy. The report attempts to
throw some light on the merits of the strategy adopted in 1992, on the nature of the
advice provided by the Bank and on the sustainability of the approach.



20
The socio-economic status of estate labor, particularly of women. The report traces
developments in the socio-economic status of estate workers, identifies constraints to
opportunities for enhancing their status and suggests possible solutions based on the
experience of the last ten years. Particular attention is paid to the problem of
incentives, notably for tea pluckers, who are predominantly women.
1.10    This impact evaluation is based on field-level interviews conducted by an OED
mission that visited Sri Lanka in October/November 1994; on extensive interviews with Bank
and Borrower officials and other individuals associated with the projects; on a review of
financial data for JEDB, SLSPC, the RPCs, and the RRF; on data on the tree crops sector
provided by the Ministry of Plantation Industries, and on extensive documentation in Bank
files. The analysis in this report is constrained by the fact that data for 1994 are not available
for most variables. Furthermore, while the impact evaluation mission obtained payroll data on
wages and employment for a sample of estate workers (para. 3.25 and Annex B), no structured
survey of beneficiaries was conducted at impact evaluation. Finally, an assessment of the
environmental impact of the two projects is beyond the scope of this report.3
1.11    The remainder of this chapter describes the objectives and implementation experience
of the two projects. Chapter 2 analyses the agricultural, economic and financial impact of the
two projects, whereas Chapter 3 discusses social and institutional developments under the
projects. The themes identified under the bullets above are introduced in the relevant sections
of the two chapters. Chapter 4 focusses on the privatization strategy. Sri Lanka's strategy is
examined in the context of transparency and fairness, the support of stakeholders, political
popularity and governance. These features have characterized successful privatization in other
countries. Chapter 5 draws together the key findings and lessons of the impact evaluation.4
C. The Projects
1.12    Smallholder Rubber. In May 1980, an IDA credit of US$16 million equivalent was
approved for the first Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation project (Credit 1017-CE). The
objectives of the project were to improve production and enhance earnings for rubber
smallholders by supporting replanting or in-filling of overaged and degraded stands,
rehabilitation or expansion of group processing centers, and institutional strengthening of the
Rubber Control Department (RCD) and Advisory Services Department (ASD) of the Ministry
of Plantation Industries (MPI). A small component was provided for the Rubber Research
Institute of Sri Lanka (RRISL) and funding was provided for impact evaluation surveys and
case studies by the Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI).
1.13    The SRR project was closed in June 1988, 21/2 years later than planned. About
US$4.9 million of the credit was canceled, primarily due to depreciation of the Sri Lankan
rupee. The final project cost was US$19.6 million, compared to an SAR estimate of US$28

OED's notes on those comments in Annex H. Also see paragraph 6.6 of the FTC project completion report (no. 12045, dated
July 16, 1993) for an assessment of the project's effect on the environment.
4. The annexes include the following: a brief characterization of key institutions in the tree crops sector (Annex A); selected
macroeconomic and sectoral data (Annex B); an analysis of financial statements for JEDB and SLSPC and financial data on the
Regional Plantation Companies (described in Annex A) that inherited their assets (Annex C); analysis of financial and economic
returns under the two projects (Annexes D and E); comments from the Borrower (Annex F) and from cofinanciers (Annex G), and
notes to those comments (Annex H).



21
million. The project got off to a good start but ran into trouble in 1983 as a result of drought
conditions and a shortage of replanting materials. The appraisal objective of replanting 18,800
hectares was achieved at project closing in 1988, notwithstanding the need to uproot 1,500 ha
of rubber in the project area due to a fungal attack of Corynespora leaf spot on areas planted
with RRISL's RRIC 103 clone.5 Sustainability was considered promising at project
completion, given projected rubber prices in 1990. The PCR re-estimated the ERR at 18
percent, compared to 23 percent at appraisal.
1.14   Fourth Tree Crops Project. The project was supported by an IDA credit of US$55
million equivalent (Credit 1562-CE), approved in March 1985, and cofinanced with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB); the Governments of the Netherlands, Norway and the United
Kingdom; and the Bank of Ceylon (BOC), a state-owned commercial bank.6 The objective of
the project was to reverse the decline in tea, rubber and coconut production on public sector
estates operated by the Janatha Estates Development Board and the Sri Lanka State Plantation
Corporation. This was to be achieved by improving estate productivity through field
development and factory rehabilitation, strengthening the corporations' management and
financial control capabilities, and raising workers' quality of life through a Social Welfare
program (SWP) aimed at improved housing, health and social amenities.
1.15   Civil unrest led to implementation delays and the project was closed in December
1991, 11/2 years late. Actual costs were US$237.7 million, compared to US$211.8 million at
appraisal. Much larger areas were replanted than had been planned for tea and rubber,
whereas in-filling targets for tea were not met. This was due to the fixed cost nature of labor
costs and the existence of surplus labor, for which estate superintendents attempted to create
employment. The high replanting rate placed considerable strain on counterpart funds, leading
to the reallocation of most project funds from factory development to field development and to
an increase in IDA's disbursement percentage from 35 percent to 90 percent.
1.16   Due to higher production costs and lower output prices, the ERRs ranged between 10
and 15 percent at completion, well below SAR expectations of 26 percent. Institutional
development was limited. On the one hand, an innovative inter-ministerial Investment
Monitoring Board was established and proved effective in monitoring the quality of project
investments. On the other hand, insufficient attention was paid to institutional development
(e.g. of management systems) by the corporations. There was persistent political and
bureaucratic interference in management at all levels. Government intervention in labor
matters precluded effective direct bargaining between the unions and plantation managers and
resulted in inappropriate labor and wage policies that reduced efficiency and drove up costs.
Housing and health care were improved for estate workers during the project period-appraisal
targets for construction of housing and latrines were exceeded, although the building of
creches and dispensaries fell short of SAR estimates. The services provided were identified
and prioritized on the basis of "Needs Assessment" surveys.
5. The Rubber Development Department reports that 20,729 hectares on 35,046 holdings were replanted as part of the first SRR
project (including areas affected by Corynespora leaf spot). An additional 16,815 hectares on 25,132 holdings were replanted
under the follow-on SRR project (Cr.1909-CE) between 1988 and 1993.
6. The British Govemment withdrew its intended support for mini-hydro development during project implementation.

2. Key Accomplishments at Impact Evaluation
A. Production Impact
2.1    Tea. The first three Bank projects in the govemment estates series sought to
rehabilitate suitable tea-growing areas and to diversify out of tea in less suitable areas. The
diversification goals were partly a response to Bank policy on beverage crops (tea, coffee and
cocoa), which postulated that inelastic demand for these crops depressed export earnings when
production increased. However, under the Fourth Tree Crops project, diversification objectives
were de-emphasized as the focus shifted to arresting the decline in production of tea. These
attempts were enshrined in a Medium Term Investment Program (MTIP) prepared by the two
corporations in 1983, appraised by the Bank and cofinanciers in 1984 and financed by the
FTC project approved in 1985. The project is synonymous with the MTIP and nearly all
investments under the five-year program are associated with the project.7
2.2    Tea production rose 12 percent worldwide during the FTC project period (1985 to
1991) but fell by 8 percent on GOSL estates, due to a decrease in mature area. While the
FTC project helped to maintain yields at current levels, it did not reverse the long-term decline
in area cultivated by the government estates. The reduction in mature area is attributable
mainly to old tea fields being taken out of production, rather than to the increase in immature
tea resulting from replanting under the FTC project.8
2.3    Although about 80 percent of the area replanted under the project is now (1995) in
production, the replanted areas have yet to reach full development. Annual production on
government estates is expected to reach 185,200 tons by the year 2014, compared to estimated
without-project production of 141,300 tons as a result of no replanting, for an increment of
43,900 tons/year (Figure 2.1 and Annex E). Based on the same counterfactual scenario, the
SAR and PCR analyses estimated incremental production at 47,900 and 39,700 tons/year,
respectively. Yields on replanted areas are expected to average 2,125 kglha made tea at full
development (12 years after replanting), which is fairly standard for VP teas, and is consistent
with SAR and PCR estimates.
2.4    While the main focus of Bank assistance for tea production has been the government
sector, the most striking achievements have been those made by the private sector, which is
dominated by smallholders. Yields on smallholdings have risen dramatically, notably in low-
country areas in the south-west of Sri Lanka. In 1991, average private sector yields (1,110
7. T'he exceptions are investments funded by projects already under implementation in 1985, i.e. the first and third tea projects
(Credits 818-CE and 1240-CE), which were both closed by September 1986, (Table 1.1).
8. Both poor management of suitable tea areas and highly warranted, Bank-supported diversification out of unsuitable tea areas
explain the decline in area planted with tea.

kg/ha) surpassed those on government estates (1,047 kg/ha) for the first time (Figure 2.2).9
Increases in area cultivated and production by private growers have also partly offset declines
on government estates (Annex B). The performance of the private sector enabled Sri Lanka to
retain most of its world market share during the project period (1985-91) in spite of growing
competition from Kenya and China.

2.5      Preliminary findings suggest that since 1992 the government estates have benefitted
from private management, although it is too early to measure the impact of the estate
management companies (EMCs) on production performnance. Yields in 1993 were higher than
9. These yield figures are based on area planted, rather than area in production, for which no information is available for the
private sector. They are also based on tea produced rather than tea processed; thus, the data drawn from the Plantation Sector
Statistical Pocket Book are adjusted by including tea bought by the govemment estates from private producers under private
production rather than govemment production. The private sector yields reported in this study fall far below the 2,440 kg/ha
reported in the Tree Crops Strategy Study (Report No. 12356-CE), although private sector yields of well over 2,000 kg/ha have
been obtained for vegetatively propagated (VP) tea in low-country areas.



25
the JEDB/SLSPC average for any year in the 1980s.10 Part of the increase may have been
achieved by sacrificing quality, as plucking three leaves and a bud has become commonplace,
although the best teas are made with two leaves and a bud. This may be the result of a policy
decision by the new managers."  The effect on prices is difficult to assess.

2.6      Rubber. Since the 1950s, Sri Lanka's rubber industry has steadily lost market share
to competitors. During the period 1980-91, i.e. from approval of the SRR project to closing of
the FTC project, world production of rubber rose by 22 percent, whereas production in Sri
Lanka fell by 22 percent (or 29,300 mt, see Annex B). Average yields stagnated, rising
slightly for the private sector but falling on government estates. On the positive side, there
has been a sharp increase in domestic consumption of rubber since the mid-1980s (Figure 2.3)
associated with rapid growth in exports of rubber products and thus of domestic value added.
10. The Govemment of Sri Lanka has commented that tea and rubber yields may have been underestimated, due to overestimates
of the area under tea and rubber (see Annex F and OED's notes to GOSL's comments in Annex H).
I1. "A new plucking system, previously unknown in Sri Lanka, was introduced whereby even three leaves and a bud, instead of
the traditional two leaves and a bud, were plucked as a matter of policy during rush crops. Plucking averages improved from 14
to 22 kg per plucker and will improve still further with the use of plucking shears." [Sepala Ilangakoon: Progress of Plantation
Management Companies in Sri Lanka, Tea Intemational, Issue 3, March/April 1994, emphasis added].

2.7     The key factor that explains Sri Lanka's weak production performance, compared to
international rivals, is the very high replanting rate during the past decade. This resulted from
insufficient replanting during the 1960s and 1970s, when declining (real) replanting grants,
concerns regarding nationalization and high export duties discouraged private investment in
rubber. The share of immature rubber in total stands rose from 14 percent in 1981 to 27
percent in 1988, far above the recommended ratio of 18-20 percent (Figure 2.4). Bank staff
were aware of this problem at appraisal. In 1979, the rubber masterplan, funded by the British
Government, noted that 28 percent of rubber stands in 1979 needed to be replanted and
predicted that output would decline until the mid-1990s. The Bank sought to alleviate the
consequent strains on the rubber replanting fund (RRF) by providing external support to the
fund under the SRR project.12
12. The RRF was established in 1953 to support the replanting of over-aged rubber. Growers are provided advice, replanting
inputs and financial assistance during the immature period. The RRF is financed by a cess on exported rubber and by GOSL
grants. Since 1980, the RRF has been supported with IDA funding under the first and second SRR projects (paras. 2.39ff).

Sou~rce: Annex B
2.8    Virtually the entire area replanted under the project (18,800 ha) is now mature,
although the earliest replantings are just reaching full development. At full development of
the project (1999) it is estimated that production will reach 19,530 tons/year, equivalent to 22
percent of average annual output by private producers during the project period (Annexes B
and D). Yields are expected to peak at 1,080 kg/ha at full development, 15 to 17 years after
replanting.
2.9    At appraisal 5-20 percent of the rubber stands in the project districts were over 30
years old. Thus there would certainly have been some replanting even without the SRR
project. However, given the funding constraints on the Rubber Replanting Fund (para. 2.39),
the without-project replanting program would have been more modest, covering perhaps half
the project area. Furthermore, farmers would not have benefitted from the same level of
support from extension services and would have applied less inputs to their rubber. Under this
alternative scenario (Annex D), the impact evaluation estimates that: i) yields would have
peaked at 994 kg/ha (8 percent less than with the project); and, ii) production would have
reached 9,080 tons in 1999. Incremental production under the SRR project is therefore
estimated at 10,450 tons/year.



28
2.10    The yield curve at impact evaluation is the same as that reported at project completion,
but is on average 20 percent lower than projected at appraisal. The main reason is that 80
percent of the project area was replanted with a relatively low-yielding variety of rubber,
nanely the Malaysian clone PB86.13 This was a serious error. The clone was developed in
the first half of the century and has long been superseded by better clones in Malaysia and
elsewhere. RRISL figures indicate a peak yield of about 1150 kg/ha for PB86, compared to
1,430 kg/ha for the locally developed RRIC 100 clone and to significantly higher yields for
clones planted in other rubber-producing countries during the 1980s. For example, an impact
evaluation of Bank-supported rubber projects in Thailand generated a composite yield profile,
based on actual tapping practices, that averaged 1,570 kg/ha and peaked at over 2,000
kg/ha.14  The Bank's repeated advice that the Indonesian GTI clone be used for replanting
under the SRR project was not heeded. RRISL trials focussed on locally developed varieties
until the mid-1980s, when 3,000 hectares replanted with the RRIC 103 clone had to be
uprooted due to an outbreak of Corynespora leaf spot, to which the clone was particularly
susceptible.'5 The failure to ensure that good quality, high-yielding clones were planted was
an important error that will depress earnings on 15,000 hectares of Sri Lankan rubber stands
for 20 years or more.
2.11    The sane commentary applies to the Fourth Tree Crops project. Although the
appraisal report (SAR) presents a yield curve that projects yields in excess of 1,600 kg/ha at
full development, these figures are optimistic even in the context of higher-yielding local
varieties. This evaluation expects yields to peak at 1,260 kg/ha at full development and hover
slightly above 1,200 kg/ha under stimulation and slaughter tapping in the final years before
replanting. 16  It is estimated that the project resulted in ten percent higher yields than would
have prevailed in the absence of project support for replanting, due to more intensive
monitoring of the quality of investments and to project requirements that: i) old rubber be
exploited by chemical stimulation and by upward tapping above the regular tapping panel; and,
ii) investments in replanting generate an ERR of at least 10 percent. The incremental yield
might have been greater if these project requirements had been observed more widely.

15. The Second Smalilbolder Rubber Rehabilitation project (Cr. 1909-CE) contained conditionality requiring RRISL to acquire
and rapidly test well-established, high-yielding foreign clones for their suitability under local conditions. This requirement was
followed in 1987 by a US$18.6 million credit in support of an Agricultural Research project, cofinanced by the German
Government, that aims to develop better varieties of tea, rubber and coconut, and to improve farmers' husbandry practices and
farming systems. The project is scheduled to close in December 1996. Finally, the Bank has recently (1994) persuaded GOSL
not to provide grants for replanting with PB 86.
16. Yields have historically been higher for the estates than for smaltholders, due to better cultivation practices and to better
planting material. Indeed, a major problem under the SRR project was that the govemment estates held a monopoly on nurseries
and retained the best planting materials for their own use, offering lower quality budded stumps for sale to smaliholders
(especially during the 1983 drought). This problem, which was not foreseen at appraisal, was addressed quite successfully during
implementation by promoting private nurseries.

2.12    Annual production of rubber on government estates is expected to peak at 65,800 tons
in the year 2002 (Annex E). Without the project, it is estimated that in 2002 production
would have reached only 49,200 tons/year, due to lower yields and to a more modest
replanting program (3,000 ha instead of 15,000 ha). Thus the project is expected to result in
incremental production of 16,600 tons/year at full development (Figure 2.5). This is lower
than the SAR and PCR estimates of 20,100 tons/year and 21,900 tons/year, respectively.17

2.13    Coconut. Three-quarters of coconut production in Sri Lanka is by smallholders.
Private estates account for about 20 percent and government-owned estates account for less
than 4 percent of the area cultivated and less than 2.5 percent of production (Figure 2.6). The
overall area under coconuts has fallen by 48,000 hectares (I11 percent) since 1980, due in large
measure to urban spread into coconut-growing areas.
17. As noted earlier, the SAR's yield assumptions are optimistic, so that the appraisal projection for incremental production is
higher than that at imnpact evaluation. The SAR also assumes no replanting in the absence of the project. The PCR recognizes
that there would have been some replanting without the project (estimated at 25 percent of the area replanted under the project).
However, the PCR uses the appraisal yield curve for the with-project scenario, even though it notes that the SAR yield estimates
are sanguine.



30
2.14   Yields, and thus production and exports, fluctuated sharply during the 1980s in
response to weather conditions. However, yields have consistently been 2-3,000 nuts/ha higher
for private growers than for government estates (Figure 2.6). This is explained in large
measure by poor maintenance and by praedial larceny on government estates. Stands planted
during the Medium Term Investment Program (MTIP) supported by the FTC project are sparse
and require rehabilitation. Re-estimated yields are as much as 25 percent lower than the
12,250 nuts/ha estimated at appraisal (the PCR did not re-estimate returns on coconut
investments, which account for only 3 percent of the total tree crop area rehabilitated under
the project).
2.15   Annual production on government estates is expected to reach 57.1 million nuts/year at
full development of the FTC project (in 2006). Without a replanting prograrn, production on
the estates would have declined to 49.6 million nuts/year in 2006 (Annex E). Thus it is
doubtful that the FTC project will increase production by more than 7.5 million nuts/year at
full development. This is less than half the appraisal estimate of incremental production, 18
million nuts/year, due to shortfalls on yields and area replanted.

2.16   On the positive side, the new private management on government-owned coconut
estates seems dynamic. Diversification efforts are underway, as are efforts to enhance



31
efficiency. In 1993, yields rose by 500 nuts/ha on EMC-managed lands, while production fell
sharply on private lands. This suggests that the improvement on government estates may have
been due to better management rather than to weather conditions, but it is too early to reach a
definite conclusion.
B. Economic Impact
2.17   Economic Rates of Return. The adjusted cost and benefit streams for the
Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation project are presented in Annex D. The revised ERR for the
project is 4.8 percent, which is well below SAR and PCR estimates (Table 2.1).18
Incremental production at full development (1996) is valued at LKR 330 million in tenns of
undiscounted, constant (1990) Sri Lankan rupees, equivalent to US$8.2 million. Due to the
low ERR, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory.
2.18   The adjusted cost and benefit streams under the Fourth Tree Crops project are
presented in Annex E. The revised ERR is 8.2 percent for tea, 7.4 percent for rubber and 2.0
percent for coconuts. These retums are much lower than the ERRs at appraisal and at project
completion (Table 2. 1). The overall ERR for the project at impact evaluation, 7.9 percent,
compares unfavorably with the appraisal projection of 26 percent and the re-estimated return
of 10 to 15 percent at project completion. In all three cases, the project ERR omits
unquantified welfare benefits. The value of annual incremental production for the three crops
is projected to exceed LKR 3,500 million by the year 2014, in terms of undiscounted constant
(1990) Sri Lankan rupees, equivalent to (1990) US$88 million. This is 35 percent less than at
appraisal and 15 percent less than estimated at completion. Due to the low rates of return, the
project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory.

18. In August 1988 the Agricultural Research and Training Institute (ARTI) published a Post Project Evaluation: Smallholder
Rubber Rehabilitation Project of Sri Lanka, which estimated that as of 1987, ERRs had dropped to around 16 percent for project
investments.



32
2.19    The critical factors that explain the low rates of return compared to appraisal estimates
are:
Prices. There were unforeseen declines in world prices for all three commodities, but
especially for tea (Figure 2.7 and Annex B). The FTC project was appraised in 1984,
when prices were exceptionally high and the corporations were generating significant
returns (Annex C). However, just one year into the project, prices had plummeted by
more than 50 percent in real terms. Projected tea prices are currently half the
appraisal forecasts and 25 percent below PCR projections. Similarly, projected rubber
and coconut prices are currently both 30 percent below appraisal forecasts.19

19. In the case of rubber, prices fell significantly after the PCR for the SRR project was written; adjusting the PCR's analysis to
rflct rubber prices at impact evaluation yields an ERR figure of 13.4 percent, rather than 18.3 percent.



33
While the long-term downward trend in rubber prices was reversed sharply in 1994-95,
the Bank's medium-term projections suggest that this is a temporary phenomenon.
Thus rates of return on investments in rubber under the two projects are not likely to
rise to acceptable levels. In order for FTC project investments in rubber to yield a 10
percent economic rate of return, rubber prices would have to be 23 percent higher than
projected at impact evaluation over the remaining life of the investments. The
increment in rubber prices required to achieve a 10 percent ERR on SRR project
investments is 29 percent.20
*        Production.  Yields were below  appraisal projections for rubber and coconuts (paras.
2.10 and 2.14 above). This contributed to lower incremental revenues under both
projects. In the case of coconuts, the area rehabilitated also fell far short of appraisal
projections.
*        Costs of Production.  The yield shortfalls also contributed to unforeseen increases in
unit costs of production, since up to 55 percent of production costs are fixed costs.
Thus, for example, unit costs of production of coconut are projected to be almost twice
the appraisal projections by 1997. Unforeseen increases in real wages have also driven
up the costs of production. While real wages for tappers decreased gradually
throughout the 1980s, they rose 30 percent after 1990 as a result of greater
opportunities for employment in other industries, especially the garment industry. This
has particular implications for the economic analysis in the Smallholder Rubber
project, where an adjustment to the PCR's figures to reflect current and projected
shadow wages yields a return of 11.2 percent instead of 18.3 percent.21
2.20    Methodological differences had relatively minor effects on the rates of return for the
FTC project, but were important in the case of the SRR project: the IER assumed an
alternative (without-project) scenario with a replanting program covering half the project area
whereas the SAR and PCR assumed a without-project scenario of no replanting. Under the
SAR/PCR assumptions, the ERR at impact evaluation would have been 0.2 percent instead of
4.8 percent.22
20. The Govemment of Sri Lanka has commented that the sharp variations in medium to long term price projections since project
completion raise concems about the reliability of the ERR analyses, so that sensitivity analyses with regard to price movements
are warranted (see Annex F and OED's notes to those comment in Annex H). The above findings suggest that it is unlikely that
retums on rubber investments will exceed 10 percent. The same is true for coconuts, for which prices would virtually have to
triple to yield a 10 economic rate of retum. In the case of tea, if prices were to be 16 percent higher than projected at impact
evaluation over the period 1995-2014, then the re-estimated ERR would rise to 10 percent. A price increment of 38 percent
would raise the ERR to 12 percent. These increments are considered unlikely in the light of past trends in tea prices.
21. When the labor cost and rubber price factors mentioned in footnote 19 are combined, the ERR is undefined for the PCR's
analysis - the net present value at 10 percent is negative LKR 500 million.
22. The PCR also made less conservative assumptions than the IER regarding rubber benefits foregone (Annex D). For example,
it assumed that there were no benefits foregone on any area replanted in the last three years of the project (1986-88). These
assumptions would have boosted the retums at impact evaluation by approximately 3 percentage points.



34
2.21    These disappointing results should not necessarily be taken to conclude that Sri Lanka
has lost its comparative advantage in the production of tea, rubber or coconuts. A 1994
analysis of domestic resource costs by the World Bank suggests that the opportunity cost of
domestic resources used in the production of all three tree crops on govemment estates is
lower than the domestic value added by those resources. Thus Sri Lanka was found to have a
comparative advantage in all three tree crops, although there is a danger that further wage
increases or price declines could reverse this finding, especially for tea.23
2.22    Contribution to Foreign Exchange Earnings. Sri Lanka no longer relies on the tree
crops sector for most of its export earnings. In the ten years to 1993, the sector's share of
total export earnings fell from 55 to 18 percent, as total exports rose 45 percent and tree crop
export revenues fell by more than 50 percent. The largest reductions in export earnings were
for tea (1990 LKR 15 billion, equivalent to 1990 US$373 million), in spite of (or perhaps
because of) consistent increases in the volume of tea exports. Other producers, notably Kenya
and China, also increased export volumes, contributing to the downward pressure on prices
mentioned earlier. In this context, export duties clearly did not sustain prices by curtailing
exports, notwithstanding the inelastic world demand for tea and Sri Lanka's dominant position
in the market.
2.23    Foreign exchange earnings from  natural rubber and coconut kernel products also fell
by a total of 1990 LKR 4.8 billion (US$118 million) in the decade to 1993. These declines
were driven by both reduced volume and depressed prices. In the case of rubber, the reduced
export volume is largely explained by the increase in domestic consumption, much of it as an
input for export-oriented industries, such as apparel, tires and vulcanized rubber thread or cord.
These industries have boomed and the real value of total exports of rubber end-products
quadrupled during implementation of the FTC project.
2.24    While the two projects had unsatisfactory rates of return, their impact on foreign
exchange earnings is still expected to be significant. By the year 2004, the FTC project is
expected to generate net benefits totalling LKR 1,650 million per annum for the three crops, in
terms of undiscounted, constant 1990 rupees. This is equal to 10 percent of Sri Lanka's
export earnings from tree crops in 1992. The Smallholder Rubber project is expected to
generate net annual benefits in excess of LKR 100 million over the next four years, equivalent
to 5 percent of 1992 export earnings from natural rubber. Taken together, the two projects'
total incremental benefits over the next twenty years should yield net, undiscounted foreign
exchange earnings or savings equivalent to 1990 US$770 million. These earnings might have
been achieved at lower cost to the public purse if more decisive measures had been taken to
upgrade factor productivity and improve incentives for producers (paras. 2.10-2.11, ? and
2.31).
23. The ratio of the economic value of non-traded factors to domestic value added is referred to as the DRC ratio. A country has
a comparative advantage in the production of a good if the DRC ratio is less than unity. The Sri Lanka Tree Crops Strategy
Paper, (Report No. 12356-CE, dated July 5, 1994) found that the DRC ratio for tea produced on government estates was 0.8,
whereas for rubber and coconuts it was 0.69 and 0.33, respectively. Prices have moved favorably for rubber since then, whereas
costs for all three tree crops have changed little over 1994-95. However, if e.g. prices for tea were to fall 15 percent or wages
were to increase by 30 percent the DRC for tea would rise to unity, thereby making Sri Lanka's government estates non-
competitive in tea production.



35
C. Financial Impact
2.25    Financial Performance of JEDB and SLSPC. The quality of the plantation
corporations' financial accounts is poor. In 1983, Auditors stated that they were unable to
form an opinion as to whether SLSPC's accounts constituted a fair presentation of the
corporation's financial position. During the Fourth Tree Crops project, external Auditors
repeatedly issued numerous qualifications to the financial statements. Bank staff and
consultants also questioned the corporations' accounting practices. For example, one internal
Bank memorandum notes that "In the case of [SL]SPC, it was found that excessive reliance
had been placed on creative accounting techniques to present a picture of profitability which
was not supported by reality".24  It is doubtful whether this was a wise strategy, since it
made it easier for GOSL to entertain requests for pay raises from estate labor unions. This is
particularly true for the policy of capitalizing replanting expenditures, rather than presenting
them in the profit and loss statement. JEDB and SLSPC switched to the capitalization
approach in 1982, thereby obscuring the exorbitant costs of later wage increases. The situation
worsened after 1990, when several accountants at JEDB and SLSPC resigned, and has not
improved with privatization.25  On balance, while the statements should be used with a
measure of caution, they cannot hiide the weak financial perfornance of the government
estates.
2.26    The financial performance of the two plantation corporations has indeed been dismal
(Figures 2.8 and 2.9, and Annex C). Cumulative retained losses at the end of 1992 amounted
to LKR 4.6 billion for JEDB and LKR 1.7 billion for SLSPC, in spite of equity injections
totalling LKR 3.4 billion for JEDB and LKR 3.6 billion for SLSPC over the period 1983-
92.26  JEDB lost money every year after Bank approval of the FTC project, while SLSPC
reported a profit only twice. As a result, both corporations became increasingly insolvent
(Figure 2.9) and had to rely heavily on borrowing from external sources and from the
government-owned commercial banks.27  Bank overdrafts tripled at SLSPC over the life of
the FTC project, and increased more than ten-fold for JEDB. Overall, JEDB's debt-equity
ratio soared from 0.8 in 1982 to an unsustainable 9.8 in 1989, before GOSL converted LKR
1.6 billion of debt into equity. SLSPC's debt-equity ratio rose less dramatically, to 3.2 in
1988, before debts of almost LKR 2 billion were capitalized.
24. Intemal Bank Memorandum, dated April 17, 1989.
25. For example, the impact evaluation team was presented with unaudited balance sheets and income statements that were
intemally inconsistent for two of the 22 RPCs.
26. The impact evaluation team was not able to obtain financial statements for JEDB or SLSPC for 1993, due to delays in the
preparation of the statements. Comparisons with earlier years would in any case be vitiated by the fact that JEDB and SLSPC
each only retained about 25 of the poorest performing estates after the 1992 privatization of management. This caveat also applies
to comparisons of certain financial data for 1992 with earlier years. It is nonetheless clear from COP and NSA figures (even
without calculating overhead costs) that GOSL has had to continue to channel an undetermined amount of resources to the two
corporations. Based on available data, the impact evaluation team estimates that losses in 1993 exceeded LKR 350 million for the
two corporations.
27. They also accumulated massive unfunded pension liabilities. These have been passed on to the 22 RPCs.

2.27   The main reason for the losses is a price-cost squeeze that was largely but not entirely
beyond the control of estate managers. Real average revenue per worker declined after 1984,
due to depressed world prices for all three crops and to stagnant productivity. At the same
time, real wages for plantation workers rose rapidly (Figure 2.10).
2.28   The fall in prices was clearly an external shock, but it was exacerbated by heavy
taxation of the industry (paras. 2.31 ff). The stagnant productivity and rising production costs
were largely attributable to internal factors, including:
Labor distortions. Restrictions on the movement and use of labor effectively turned
labor into a fixed cost (paras. 3.8 and 3.10). The problem was exacerbated by
Government approval of wage increases that were unrelated to productivity. These
interventions demoralized estate managers as it frustrated their efforts to contain costs.
Their incentives to do so were further undermined by the fact that managers were
entitled to pay increases linked to increases in estate labor wages;

Mismanagement of the estates. The size of the corporations provided opportunities for
political patronage that undermined the companies' financial position. There was also
little incentive for estate superintendents to improve performance since staff rules
precluded incentive payments for individual managers. In practice, the estate-level

managers' response to the labor distortions, and possibly to the broader atmosphere of
civil disturbances prevailing in the late 1980s, was logical: employ workers in more
labor-intensive activities, notably replanting. However, the largely debt-financed
replanting activity resulted in high current expenditures on debt service in addition to
the labor expense, but yielded no offsetting current income, due to the gestation period
for the tree crops. This contributed to a dramatic change in the corporations' asset
structure: in 1984, JEDB's short-term assets were 56 percent of total assets; by 1991,
they had fallen to 23 percent (Annex C). The story is the same for SLSPC and the
figures are almost identical. These problems underscore a major lack of financial
planning and oversight by central staff at JEDB and SLSPC.
2.29    GOSL proved reluctant or unable to address the mismanagement and the labor
distortions adequately in the course of the MTIP. Since the FTC project attempted to address
the investment needs of the sector without targeting these critical areas, low productivity and
high costs reduced the profitability of investments supported under the project.28 Re-
estimated financial rates of return range from 8.3 percent for rubber to 7.4 percent for tea and
almost zero for coconuts (Annex E). These returns are similar to those re-estimated by the
PCR (except coconuts, for which no return was calculated) but are 8 to 15 percentage points
lower than appraisal estimates (Table 2.2).

2.30    Notwithstandinig these problems, IDA increased the disbursement percentage for the
replanting category from 35 percent to 90 percent in 1989.29 In January 1991, SDR 9.3
million (US$12.2 million) in Bank funds intended for the institutional development and
nursery development components, together with SDR 3 million (US$3.9 million) in
unallocated funds, were reallocated to the field development component. The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) also reallocated a total of US$14.5 million to field development
during 1991-92, primarily from the factory development component. Given the constraints on
alternative sources of funding, the Bank/ADB support during this period was critical to
maintaining the replanting program. It is an open question as to whether the increases in
disbursements for replanting were an appropriate policy response. On the one hand, the
28. This point is made in the Sri Lanka Tree Crops Strategy Report, No. 12356-CE. prepared by the Agriculture Operations
Division in Country Department III of the South Asia Regional Office, The World Bank, 1994.
29. Senior management approved the increase, with notification to the Executive Directors. At the same time, the project
description was expanded to permit the procurement of specialized equipment (e.g. color separators for improved sorting of tea at
tea factories) and the preparation of studies (regarding privatization). In practice, no funds were withdrawn for specialized
equipment and the studies were suspended in 1990.



39
corporations' capacity to participate in the replanting program had clearly been overestimated
at appraisal as a result of higher commodity price projections, and the amendments to the
financing plan enabled the corporations to continue replacing over-aged tea and rubber and
providing work for underemployed labor. On the other hand, appraisal replanting objectives
had already been exceeded considerably by 1989; the requirement that all replantings meet the
minimum criterion of a 10 percent ERR was not enforced; the corporations missed an
opportunity to convert to cut, tear and curl (CTC) teas, since funds were reallocated away
from the factory development component;30 and the increase in long-term funding for
replanting may have facilitated a short-term, stop-gap approach to the labor issue, rather than
encouraging the adoption of longer-term solutions.
2.31    Impact on Government Revenues. GOSL taxed the tree crops sector heavily
throughout implementation of the two projects. In 1981, one-third of tea export revenues and
more than half of rubber export revenues were absorbed by the govemment in the form of
export duties and cesses (Figures 2.11 and 2.12 and Annex B).   Part of these earnings
were channelled back into the sector in the form of replanting grants to smallholders and
capital contributions to the governm1enit estates. However, net government revenues from the
tree crops sector reached (1990) LKR 10.9 billion in 1984 and remained positive and
substantial until 1990 (Table 2.3). Overall, GOSL earned LKR 31.7 billion from the tree
crops sector over the period 1983-92 (measured in 1990 rupees), equivalent to US$787
million.

2.32    The tree crops sector became a major burden on the fisc from  1990 onwards as GOSL
revenues fell due to declining export earnings and expenses rose as a result of the financial
crisis at JEDB and SLSPC. The weakness of the sector eventually led GOSL to eliminate the
export duties on tea and natural rubber and the sales tax on tea in 1992. Cesses were
maintained to fund replanting by tea and rubber smallholders.32
30. World demand for CTC teas is growing rapidly, relative to demand for bulk tea, since CTC tea is more suitable for use in tea
bags. Sri Lanka's output of CTC tea is increasing, but still accounts for less than 5 percent of all Sri Lankan tea.
31. Other taxes included in the analysis for later years are an ad-valorem sales tax on tea, introduced in 1984, and income tax on
the plantation corporations' profits. The sector has also been taxed via macroeconomic policies, notably the failure to maintain a
competitive real effective exchange rate over an extended period. These issues are not tackled here, however for more
information see Sri Lanka: Strategic Issues in the Development of Sri Lanka's Agricultural Sector, Report No. 8229-CE, prepared
by the Agriculture Operations Division. Country Department Ill in the South Asia Region of the World Bank, 1991.

2.33     GOSL managed to avoid significant direct losses prior to 1990 by relying on the
banking sector and on the Bank and other extemal donors to support the two plantation
corporations. But by 1990, the debt burden on JEDB and SLSPC had become unsustainable,
as had the state commercial banks' (SCBs') exposure to the tree crops sector (and other) bad
loans (Box 2.1). In 1990, GOSL converted most of the debt of the two corporations into
equity and assumed their liabilities (including IDA and ADB loans under the MTIP). That
same year, the combined losses of JEDB and SLSPC resulted in a LKR 3.1 billion drain on
the public coffers, with an additional LKR 2.1 billion for the two corporations in 1991-92

33. On the revenue side, these figures include income tax, export duty, cess and ad-valorem sales tax paid to GOSL by .IEDB and
SLSPC. They exclude revenues from the business turnover tax. On the expenditure side, the figures include replanting mid
factory development subsidies, other income support (e.g. via the tea stabilization fund), capital contributions by the besury and
by government agencies, (such as the Sri Lanka Tea Board), and conversions of liabilities into equity for JEDB and SLSPC.
These net direct fiscal transfers do not reflect significant indirect support through loans to the two corporations at below-mwket
rates of interest, assumption of the foreign exchange risk on their extemal liabilities, and guarantees on debts retained by the
corporations. For example, in 1989 SLSPC's ratio of interest expense to average outstanding loans was 11.1 percent, compared to
average deposit rates of 13.2 percent and lending rates of 16.4 percent. If SLSPC had been required to borrow at 16.4 percent, its
interest expense would have been LKR 108 million higher.



42
2.34   Since the privatization of management, losses have been reduced on government-
owned estates, as has the direct fiscal burden on government of its estates.34 However,
contingent liabilities have continued to rise as GOSL has guaranteed debentures issued by the
RPCs to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) at rates below market rates of interest. These
advances amounted to LKR I billion in 1993 and an additional LKR 600 million in the first
half of 1994 (para. 4.30 and Figure 4.2). Further indirect support is provided to the RPCs via
GOSL guarantees on commercial bank loans.
Box 2.1: The State-Owned Banks and the Plantation Sector
1.     The commercial banking system consists of two state-owned commercial banks
(the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and the People's Bank (PB)), four domestic private banks
and 17 foreign banks. The banking sector is dominated by the two state-owned
commercial banks (SCBs), which presently account for 60 percent of total loans and
advances, down from 75 percent in 1980.
2.     The SCBs have been used by the government to direct credit to public
enterprises and to rural areas at relatively low interest rates. This has adversely affected
their viability. In 1984, one year before Board Approval of the FTC project, the SCBs
earned a 9.5 percent net return on equity (ROE). By 1989, the return on equity had
fallen to 3 percent. Over the same period, ROEs rose from 6.5 percent to 14.9 percent
for private banks and from 13 percent to 18.5 percent for foreign banks. SCB loans to
the plantation sector also increased significantly, rising from (an almost entirely
externally funded) 2 percent of risk assets to 11 percent (of which over one-third were
own funds). Exposure to plantations soared from 24 to 195 percent of stated capital. In
practice, net worth was overstated by not making sufficient provisions for loan losses and
by failing to fund pension liabilities adequately. An audit by an international accounting
firm in 1990 found that restating the financial statements adequately entailed a negative
net worth of Rs. 14.7 billion on assets of Rs. 74.1 billion. One year later, the accounting
firm estimated bad debts on loans to JEDB and SLSPC at LKR 4.6 billion, with loans to
the two corporations increasing at a rate of LKR 120 million per month.
3.     In 1990, commercial bank overdrafts for JEDB and SLSPC were converted into
government-guaranteed, long-term loans. Since the privatization of estate management,
exposure to government-owned plantation corporations has again increased rapidly, with
overdrafts rising by 140 percent to LKR 1.53 billion between December 1992 and June
1994.

1993
34. Data are weak on net flows to the government-owned estates since 1992, but GOSL appears to have injected LKR 40 million
of capital into the 22 Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) formed in 1992 (paras. 3.37ff and Annex A). This is far less than
earlier commitments to JEDB and SLSPC.

2.35    Returns to Smallholder Rubber Growers under the SRR Project. Financial Rates
of Retum (FRRs) for smallholder rubber growers are presented in Table 2.4. They vary
considerably, depending on the cultivation practices of the grower. FRRs to smallholder
rubber growers using only family labor for the rubber and planting intercrops during the
immature period (Case 2) were 49 percent at appraisal and 17 percent at impact evaluation.
On the other hand, returns to smaliholders using hired labor and not planting intercrops during
the immature period (Case 3) were 11 percent at appraisal and only 5 percent at impact
evaluation. Incremental returns under these two scenarios are presented in Figure 2.14. Since
only 13 percent of smallholders planted intercrops, and since hired tappers are used on
holdings as small as 1.2 hectares, it is likely that in most cases financial returns to
smallholders on project investments (before replanting grants) have been less than 10 percent.

2.36    While such modest returns are clearly not sufficient to encourage replanting, replanting
grants made the investments considerably more attractive. In Table 2.4, Case 3 (hired labor
and no intercrops), replanting grants were projected to increase returns to smallholders from
10.5 to 30.6 percent at appraisal.35 At impact evaluation, the corresponding increase would
have been from 5.0 to 28.7 percent, using the SAR replanting grant installment profile (in
constant 1990 LKR). However, the value of the replanting grant has declined almost 40
percent in real terms since 1980, so that the replanting grant prevailing at impact evaluation
(LKR 37,050/ha) would raise returns to only 12.8 percent. In 1981, the replanting grant
covered 55 percent of replanting costs, but by 1994 the real value of the grant had fallen to
less than 30 percent of replanting costs (see Figure 2.15).
2.37    While it is appropriate to deny replanting grants to smallholders with poor cultivation
practices, the drop-out rate has been staggering: a 1992 survey of households in two of the
three project districts found that only 12 percent of smallholders received the full eight
installments.36 Furthermore, the post-evaluation survey conducted by the Agrarian Research
and Training Institute found that drop-out rates were inversely correlated with the size of
holdings. Between 76 and 90 percent of dropouts in the project area were smallholders with
less than 0.8 hectares. ARTI concluded that "The problem of drop outs highlighted above
could affect the sustainability of the project replanting program as well as future replanting
programs."
35. In practice, it should have been somewhat less, since the SAR analysis did not adjust the grant installments for projected
inflation.

smaliholdings and 50 estate families in Kalutara and Kegalle districts. The third project district was Ratnapura. In 1986, ARTI
conducted a somewhat larger survey (covering a total of 300 smallholdings) that showed only 22 percent of smailholders received
the third installment.

2.38   There are several reasons for the disappointing returns at the smallholder level. In
addition to the external factor of falling rubber prices, there were three major internal factors
that the project attempted to address:
Low yields. Yields have been consistently lower for smallholders than for the
government estates. Some of the reasons for this (notably the lack of adequate clonal
material) have been discussed above. Others include poor cultivation practices. e.g.
insufficient application of fertilizers; inadequate soil conservation practices and
premature tapping or over-tapping. These were to be addressed under the SRR project
by strengthening the Advisory Services Department of the Ministry of Plantation
Industries. In practice, the ASD extension officers had a relatively modest outreach
and impact, because there were insufficient rubber extension officers (REOs) and
smallholders often did not follow their advice (recruitment fell far short of SAR
objectives and the Bank-proposed strategy of making extension staff responsible for
inspecting replantings and authorizing grants was reversed in the course of the project
for administrative reasons).
High labor costs. Part of the reason that cultivation practices are relatively poor is
that smallholders cannot afford the labor required for adequate cultivation practices.
Even on smaliholdings using family labor, the replanting grant incentive is clearly less
attractive than the opportunity to earn income from off-farm activities.



46
Low quality output. Most smallholders (80 percent) do part or all of the processing of
their latex into ribbed smoked sheet (RSS). However the quality of smallholder-
processed RSS is poor. The ARTI post-evaluation survey found that only 36 percent
was graded RSS I to RSS 3. The rest was RSS 4 or 5, or ungraded. The low quality
of smallholder rubber is rewarded by somewhat lower prices. In practice, one of the
reasons for the low quality is that there are insufficient price incentives to increase
quality, because a large share of dealers' profits comes from down grading RSS
purchased from smallholders and upgrading it at point of sale. The project attempted
to address this by improving existing, co-operative-style Group Processing Centers
(GPCs) and building new ones. This initiative was warranted, insofar as GPCs
managed to improve the quality of their production considerably during the project
(the share of RSS I in total production rose from 55 percent in 1981 to 78 percent six
years later). However, the component fell short of SAR objectives because of poor
management and inadequate marketing. These factors discouraged smallholders from
supplying latex to the centers, so that average throughput per GPC was halved in the
course of the project.
2.39    Impact of the SRR Project on the Rubber Replanting Fund. The rubber replanting
fimd maintained a positive cash flow in 8 of the last 13 years (Table 2.5), however in only 3
of the last 13 years has this been due to an excess of cess income over replanting grants. The
last positive net cess flow was obtained in 1988, the year that the first SRR project was closed.
Bank contributions under the SRR projects have been instrumental in sustaining the fund and
at the Bank's insistence, the replanting cess rate was also raised, from LKR 0.50/kg in 1980 to
LKR 1.15/kg in 1983 (an 11.6 percent increase in real terns/. However, the RRF is
unsustainable without external support at current cess rates.3
2.40    Three important factors explain the liquidity problems of the RRF:
*       The replanting rate was too high during the 1980s, due to inadequate replanting in
earlier periods.
Domestic consumption of rubber increased sharply in recent years, reducing the base
(exported rubber) on which the cess is charged (Figure 2.3).
*       The cess rate has not been changed since August 1983, in spite of increases in the
replanting grant.
37. Similar problems with liquidity characterize the rubber replanting aid fund (ORRAF) in Thailand. The Royal Thai
Govermnent has decided to emphasize progress on replanting rather than self-sustainability of the fund and has supported ORRAF
with direct budgetary support as well as grants financed with loans from donors. See the Operations Evaluation Department:
Thailand - Impact Evaluation Report: Second Tree Crops Project (Ln.2078-TH) and Third Rubber Replanting Project (Ln.2691-
TH), Report No. 13244-TH, The World Bank, 1994.

2.41   Currently, smallholders are being cross-subsidized by the estate sector, which is not
eligible for replanting grants even though the cess is collected on exports of estate rubber.
Additional cess revenues are therefore required to convert the RRF into a fund exclusively
targeted at smallholders, (who lack the access to financial markets that would permit them to
finance replanting with formal credit), and to ensure that a high degree of coverage of
applicants is maintained. While the ratio of permits issued to applications received rose
impressively during the first SRR project, reaching 91 percent in 1988, it has slipped since
Project Closing. Furthermore, if smallholders manage to improve cultivation practices, RRF
liabilities will increase. Finally, additional cess revenues are required to ensure that replanting
grants keep pace with replanting costs. Under the second SRR project, the Bank has urged
GOSL to double the replanting grant, which has slipped since Board Approval in 1986 from
over 50 percent to less than 30 percent of replanting costs. in January 1995, the replanting
grant was increased by almost 25 percent to LKR 49,722/ha, far less than the LKR 72,000/ha
proposed by the Bank.
2.42   The Bank has also encouraged GOSL to cover the rising administrative expenses for
the RRF from general funds and to double the cess to LKR 4.35/kg. Domestic rubber
consumers have also urged GOSL to raise cess rates, because Sri Lanka's position as a price
taker in international markets means that a higher cess would drive down domestic rubber
prices. However, there would clearly be trade-offs that should be evaluated. On the one hand,
the RRF would be more liquid; smallholders who are about to replant their stands would be
net gainers, since the increased grants up-front would more than outweigh (discounted)
reductions in prices at maturity (as long as they receive at least the first two grant
installments), and domestic rubber consumers would enjoy lower prices for rubber. On the
other hand, smallholders who have already planted their crops (e.g. SRR project beneficiaries),



48
smaliholders who do not qualify for the second installment, and government 3plantation
corporations (which are not eligible for grants) would be adversely affected.    One measure
that the Bank has_pressed for is expanding the base on which cesses are charged to include
domestic rubber.39  This could be done by collecting cesses from  the 2,000 or so licensed
dealers, rather than just from exporters.
2.43     The broader issue that should be considered is whether the replanting program  is
economically warranted. Given the present yields at the smallholder level, it is not.
Therefore, an increased grant could simply make economically inviable investments financially
attractive for smallholders, unless intensive efforts are undertaken to increase yields, improve
quality and reduce unit costs of production.
38. For Table 2.4 Case 3, before replanting grants, if the price to growers were to be reduced by two (1990) rupees from 1995
until 2010, the net present value to growers of an investment made in 1981 would fall by one-third from an already negative value
of LKR 12,200. The same price reduction would decrease the plantation corporations' FRR on rubber under the FTC project
from 8.3 percent to 5.2 percent, unless the additional cess payments were to be refunded to the corporations. The Bank is
currently urging GOSL to adhere to its commitment to refund the corporations for all cess payments, since they are not eligible
for RRF grants.
39. The Second SRR project contains a covenant requiring the extension of the cess to domestically consumed rubber by
December 31, 1996.

3. Social and Institutional Developments
A. Social Impact
3.1    This section discusses social developments under the two projects. The SRR project
did not have explicit social objectives and there is little ex-post data to link improvements in
social welfare to the project. Therefore, the section on the SRR project relies on available
survey data (from CENWOR, para. 2.37) to shed some light on socio-economic conditions for
smallholders and on the outreach achieved by government services supported under the project.
In contrast, the FTC project included components for housing and social welfare totalling
US$22.8 million at appraisal (14 percent of base costs). The section on the FTC project
describes conditions before and after the project, as well as the physical contributions made by
the project to improving welfare and living conditions for estate residents. It also discusses
ethnic and political factors that give rise to labor distortions discussed elsewhere in the report,
and highlights gender differences in work norms on tea estates that are both inequitable and
inefficient.
3.2    Socio-Economic Conditions in the SRR Project Area. While there have been a
number of noteworthy developments in the socio-economic status of smallholders in the
project districts (Kalutara, Kegalle and Ratnapura), it is difficult to associate them with the
SRR project. On the positive side, health indicators have continued to improve nationwide,
including in the project area (Annex B); educational attainment has improved and gender
disparities in access to education became less pronounced, and housing conditions in 1991
were generally found to be good in project districts.40
3.3    On the other hand, CENWOR's 1991 surveys of smallholders and estate workers in
two project districts suggest that:
the percentage of smallholders below the poverty line is higher than that for resident
estate labor, but comparable to that of non-resident estate workers. Around 30 percent
reported annual household incomes of less than LKR 15,000 or US$350 per year,
compared to 10 percent for resident estate workers;
smallholders' incomes are more vulnerable to changes in market conditions and are
being eroded by rising costs of production;
around 60 percent of those surveyed received replanting grants during the 1980s. Of
these, only one in five received the third of seven (later eight) installments;
around 70 percent of those surveyed received extension advice from the Advisory
Services Department, but very few received advice on all stages of production, and
generally extension does not reach women, even though they participate actively in
tapping and other tasks;
40. The Center for Women's Research (op.cit.) found that more than 85 percent of houses in Kegalle and Kalutara were owner-
occupied and that the majority have tiled roofs, brick walls and cement floors.



50
in spite of underemployment, rubber tapping almost never features among employment
aspirations (government jobs headed the list of specified objectives);
90 percent of holdings are less than 0.8 hectares, with the average holding having only
0.4 hectares under rubber. Smaller holdings tend to spread risks through diversified
production. This of course makes it much more difficult to reach smallholder rubber
growers with services or for farmers to become really proficient rubber growers.
3.4     The CENWOR study concludes that "..the majority [of smallholders] were not able to
generate adequate incomes to ensure significant upward socio-economic mobility.. .It is likely
that replanting, adverse weather and production costs affected their incomes adversely.. .It is
significant, too, that.. .rubber based industries have not been perceived by anyone as a strategy
to increase economic returns and thereby to improve living standards."
3.5     The Social Status of the Labor Force on Government Estates Almost 90 percent
of the 738,000 workers and family members residing on government estates in 1985 were of
South Indian Tanil origins.41  The Tamils were socially, educationally and culturally
disadvantaged, relative to the population at large. Their ancestors were virtually conscripted
by higher caste kanganis acting as agents for management and were brought to Sri Lankan
estates beginning in the 1870s, because the expropriated Sinhala smallholders generally refused
to work on the colonial estates. The Tamils became politically stateless in 1948, when Sri
Lanka gained its Independence. Attempts to address their status in the 1970s and early 1980s
involved efforts to repatriate large numbers of them and gradually grant citizenship to others.
The 1988 Grant of Citizenship to Stateless Persons Act No. 5 and the 1993 Citizenship
(Amendment) Act, at least dejure, finally reached those whom India had refused to accept for
repatriation. Nevertheless, the historical antecedents entailed a significant degree of
marginalization of the plantation work-force and contributed to underlying ethnic tension
between Tamil estate workers and the majority Sinhala population in neighboring villages.
These tensions were exacerbated by the outbreak of conflict in the early 1980s between the Sri
Lankan army and (non-estate) Tamil separatists in the north of the island (around Jaffna).
3.6     The grant of citizenship to the estate population gave it voting rights that have
markedly strengthened the political hand of its labor leaders, particularly in the light of
security concerns resulting from the ethnic conflict in Jaffna. This political clout has
contributed to significant increases in plantation workers' wages since 1984. That year, male
wages rose by 33 percent (14 percent in real terms), whereas female wage rates rose by 60
percent (a real increase of 36 percent) to equal male wages for the first time. Between 1984
and 1993, wage rates rose by another 20 percent in real terms.42 As a result, plantation
workers' incomes in 1992 amounted to LKR 2,700 per month for the average two-worker
41. The remainder were Sinhala (about 10 percent) and Muslim (I percent). See the Plantation Housing and Social Welfare
Trust's Vital Statistics in the Plantation Sector, 1980-1993.
42. This includes the first (nominal) 18 percent of a 30 percent across-the-board increase promised to workers in December,
1992, after privatization of management. When the second part of the increase came up for implementation before the elections in
the summer of 1994, the private management companies (Annex A) threatened to renege on their contracts.

plantation household, which is well above what is earned by the rural and urban poor.43
Furthermore, these figures exclude other income-generating activities, such as earnings from
vegetable plots and dairy production that can yield LKR 10-12,000 per year.

3.7    A World Bank poverty assessment, based on sample surveys conducted in 1985/6 and
1990/1 found that poverty declined by 12 percent over the period on estates, compared to a 23
percent decline in rural areas and an 11 percent increase in urban areas.44 Estates were
found to have the lowest income inequality as well as the lowest incidence of poverty (13
percent, versus 18 percent in urban areas and 24 percent in rural areas, based on a headcount
index using 1990 LKR 471.20/month as the poverty line). However, there are significant
variations in income over the course of a year (Figure 3. 1). Monthly wages fall significantly
during and after the dry season.

3.8    Another apparent benefit to estate workers of their voting power has been their unions'
ability to secure modest work-loads on the tea estates and a guaranteed number of work-days.
While the minimum plucking requirements (norms) vary by season and by the quality of the
bushes, they are generally set at around 18 kg/day on the government estates, compared to
30kg/day for one private tea estate visited by the authors, and to over 30kg/day in Kenya. In
1984, GOSL agreed to a demand from labor unions for a guaranteed 6 day work-week, with
wages being paid whether or not there was work to do. This guarantee was originally
provided by the Estate Labor (Indian) Ordinance of 1889. Although it has not yet officially
been put into effect, it put pressure on JEDB and SLSPC managers to create work for labor
during the FTC project even if they were not economically warranted.

3.9    Ordinary least squares analysis indicates a downward trend in the labor force of just
over 13,000 workers per year during 1980-93. Reductions were particularly sharp during
1982-84 (27,000 per annum) and again following privatization in 1993 (22,000).
Nevertheless, rapid wage increases, distorted labor regulations and management weaknesses
have increased underemployment (Figure 3.2). This problem is compounded because the
estate labor force is inadequately served by otherwise far-reaching national health and
education programs (paras. 3.1 1 ff).



53
3.10    These reductions in the labor force also reflect a lack of opportunities for plantation
families, especially youths. Limited opportunities contribute to widespread alcoholism and
threaten peace and stability on the estates. Average unemployment on the estates is below the
national average (8.9 percent for men and 6.4 percent for women, compared to national rates
of 10.7 percent and 20.8 percent, respectively), however this hides significant differences
between estates. Low country estates tend to be short of labor for tapping and plucking,
whereas high country estates have a surplus. Unions have actively discouraged mobility of
labor across estates, for reasons that reflect both underlying ethnic tensions and union politics.
GOSL has also demurred from actively encouraging the movement of workers from estates
with surplus labor to estates with shortages, even when the estates have been part of the same
plantation corporation. While the Bank and other donors were aware of the seriousness of
these problems, the project did not attempt to target the issue of labor distortions, because of
the political sensitivity surrounding it. However, it did attempt to ameliorate the sub-standard
living conditions of estate workers.
3.11    Health, Demographic and Education Indicators for the Estate Population. In
spite of the Education Ordinance of 1920 that introduced compulsory education on estates, at
project appraisal (1984) 41 percent of the estate population had never been to school. This is
because the govemment, which is responsible for education on the estates, did not provide as
comprehensive a coverage as in urban and rural areas. Accordingly, literacy rates for estate
workers lagged well behind those of the rural and urban populations, gender disparities were
much more acute and post-primary educational opportunities were scarce (Table 3.1).
However, the situation has improved over time.4 The project did not attempt to address
these issues.

3.12    Estate workers also received poorer healtlh services, relative to the general population.
When the FTC project was approved in 1985:
45. Estate workers' literacy rates are catching up with those of the general population. Gender disparities are also falling rapidly.
For example, a 1989 survey by the National Association for Total Education found that 49 percent of males over 65 and 14
percent of females over 65 were literate, compared to 79 and 72 percent, respectively. in the 14-19 age group.



54
*      the maternal mortality rate on the estates (1.2 per 1,000 live births) was more than
twice the national average;
*      the infant mortality rate on the estates was 49.6 per 1,000 live births, compared to the
national average of 29;
*      one in three children was born with low birth weight;
*      the 1985 crude birth rate (31 per 1,000 of population) on the estates equalled the
national average of the late 1960s.
3.13   An attempt was made to address these health and demographic challenges by
strengthening the Social Development Divisions (SDDs) of the two plantation corporations
through a team of technical assistants (TAT) and by financing a Social Welfare Program
(SWP) that was to improve housing, rehabilitate and construct new water supply and sanitation
facilities and renovate or construct new medical centers and creches. These project
components were financed by the Asian Development Bank and the Governments of the
Netherlands (GONL) and of Norway (NORAD). In a second phase of the program (SWP II),
surplus GONL and NORAD funds (resulting from exchange rate movements) were used to
establish a Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust (PHSWT), with a view to ensuring
the continued improvement of estate workers' living conditions under private sector
management.
3.14   By the time the project was completed in 1991, remarkable progress had been made on
the estates with respect to health indicators (Table 3.2):
*      after rising initially, the maternal mortality rate had been reduced to I per 1,000 live
births;
*      the infant mortality rate had been cut to 29 (i.e. the national average at the start of the
project);
*      less than one in six children was born with low birth weight;
*      the crude birth rate had been reduced by one-third to 20.5 per 1,000 of population;
3.15   Several of these improvements can be traced to a remarkable increase in deliveries at
health institutions, which rose from 61 percent of all estate births in 1985 to 83 percent in
1991. The increase is attributable in large measure to the provision of new and upgraded
maternity wards, health centers, hospitals and ambulances under the project.
3.16   One benefit of the social welfare component of the Bank-supported MTIP has been to
intensify monitoring of a wide range of health indicators on the estates. This solid institutional
development, coupled with efforts to assess the needs of estate workers in general and female
workers in particular, has contributed to the development of a second phase for the social
welfare program that has adopted beneficiary participation as its operating principle. The
success of the second phase will, however, depend critically on commitment from the EMCs to
improving the health and welfare of their labor force.



55
3.17    Privatization, which followed the project, has not yet further improved health
indicators for the resident population. On the contrary, there has been some slippage with
respect to certain indicators. Thus 4 of the 9 indicators in Table 3.2 were less favorable in
1993 than at Project Closing in 1991. It remains to be seen whether or not progress on the
health front has been arrested temporarily or whether workers' health is being given less
attention by the new management than it received during the MTIP.46
3.18    Estate Workers' Living Conditions. Living conditions are poor on the estates.
Almost all the estate workers live in "line rooms" that are just 11 square meters in size, often
have leaky roofs and lack kitchens or latrines. Water piping to common stand pipes is often in
disrepair, and water is inadequate and of poor quality. Overcrowding has become more severe
over time, with 4 to 6 members of a family, including married children, sharing the same
room, for an average of less than 3 square meters per person. In 1983, the average floor space
in estate line rooms was 4 square meters per person, whereas the national average was 11
square meters per person.47  However, some progress was made on housing during the
project period: the PCR for the Fourth Tree Crops project found that the number of houses
considered to be in good condition went up under the MTIP, from 33 percent in 1986 to 40
percent in 1990. More than half still required upgrading and the proportion slated for
demolition remained virtually constant at 7 percent.

46. The Government of the Netherlands has commented that even during implementation of the FTC project, insufficient attention
was paid to the SWP, so that it evolved more or less independently from the rest of the project, thereby contributing to decreased
awareness of the need for social development (see Annex G and OED's notes to those comments in Annex H).

3.19   Targets with respect to construction and upgrading of water supply schemes were
exceeded and 33,425 latrines were constructed during the MTIP. Nevertheless, water and
sanitation infrastructure reached only 24 percent of plantation households in 1990. This
compares to national averages of 67 percent for water and 59 percent for sanitation.
3.20   The preliminary findings of an on-going study of estate child care services suggest that
facilities are generally adequate, but that the accountability of creche attendants should be
improved together with their basic Tamil language skills (many of the attendants are Sinhala).
Increased supervision of the creches by estate medical assistants is also warranted.
3.21    The Status of Women on the Plantations. The marginalization of Tamil estate
workers together with a culture of social subordination and of patriarchal norms has made
living conditions particularly difficult for Tamil estate women. Although women on average
earn slightly more than men, only between 8 and 35 percent of female workers collect their
own wages. These are collected by men, treated as family income rather than women's
income, and frequently spent on alcohol. Purchasing food is also a male activity, which
constrains the female worker's ability to determine how her earnings might be used to enhance
her family's nutrition. The same difficulty arises with earnings from produce grown by
women in line gardens. This is because marketing is done by men for various reasons,
including culturally inspired restrictions on women's mobility, women's lack of time and
men's relatively higher numeracy. To sum up, women have a limited say in the way that their
earnings are spent.
3.22   At project appraisal, women were found to be actively engaged in paid labor. Sixty-
seven percent of women were economically active on the estates, compared to 27 and 31
percent in the urban and rural sectors as a whole. However, trade union activity is dominated
by male estate workers. Labor force participation on tea estates is also gender-stereotypical.
Plucking is an almost exclusively female task. Even though careful plucking is critical in the
production of quality tea, it is considered unskilled work that falls in line with alleged
feminine attributes of patience, endurance and tolerance for repetitive actions. Women do
work alongside men in tea factories, but other tasks such as pruning, uprooting and clearing
are almost exclusively male tasks. There is much less gender stereotyping in labor
assignments on rubber and coconut plantations.
3.23   Gender Differences in Work Norms. A key difference between the status of male
and female workers on tea estates is in the work norms that they must fulfill to earn the
minimum daily wage. Tea pluckers, who are predominantly women, are entitled to a
minimum wage only if they fulfill both a plucking norm and a minimum number of hours of
attendance.48 The attendance hours are generally 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a one-hour
break, but exclude time spent transporting green leaf tea to the muster shed and weighing it.
If pluckers fulfill the work norm before 4:30 p.m., (i.e. they are "efficient"), they are still
required to work in the fields until 4:30 p.m. to earn the minimum daily wage.
48. The work norms depend on the condition of the fields, the variety of tea grown, seasonal variations (i.e. "lean" or "flush"
conditions), but tend to be around 18kg/day in the monsoon season and as little as 8kg/day in the dry season. Any collections
above the norm are treated as "over-kilos" and are remunerated at a higher rate (LKR 3.75/kg - n.b. this is far more than the LKR
1.50/kg offered for over-kilos on a private tea estate visited by the authors).



57
3.24   In sharp contrast, men are assigned tasks, such as pruning and clearing, that are judged
by the estate superintendents to take only 6 hours to do, i.e. from 7:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m.. If
they finish their tasks early they may leave, and will still earn the minimum daily wage. Thus
"efficient" males can earn a day's wage for only a few hours work. This has the following
implications:
*      Male wages far exceed female wages on an hourly basis, even though daily wage rates
are nominally equal.
*      Men are guaranteed more leisure time than are women.
*      Although both male and female workers are paid the daily wage for completing a task
(or norm), only women are compelled to work overtime to earn their wage if they are
"efficient".
*      Women whose opportunity cost of time spent plucking exceeds the effective wage rate
on over-kilos are penalized for their efficiency in completing norms ahead of time.
3.25    Studies by the project-financed Technical Assistance Team and others have found that
women's earnings have been consistently higher than those of men. Payroll data on 104
workers (9 percent) at one estate visited by the authors show that women earned an average of
LKR 1,752 per month (including payment for over-kilos), compared to LKR 1,572 for men,
but that this difference was not statistically significant (Annex B). On the other hand, women
were a far more reliable source of income than were men.49 Furthermore, women appeared
to be able to husband resources more carefully, insofar as there was a statistically significant
difference in advances paid before payday. Women on average took out only one-third of
their wages before pay-day, whereas men took out half of theirs.50 While the higher
advances to men may have made it easier for women to wait until payday, there is anecdotal
evidence that a significant portion of male workers' earnings is spent on alcohol.
3.26    Throughout Sri Lanka there is considerable resistance to improving the status of
women, largely due to conservative attitudes and to concern about potential opposition to
change from labor unions. The Bank's own initiative to enhance the role of women in
development through policy dialogue and project support also gained momentum only after the
FTC project had been approved. As a result, gender disparities have persisted on the estates,
even though, as a recent OED Study notes, "[r]esearch findings have demonstrated, and in
some cases quantified, the benefits from addressing gender issues", and there are significant
productive efficiency gains that have yet to be exploited.51 The lessons to be learned from
49. The coefficient of variation (ratio of standard deviation to mean) on men's incomes was 0.57, or 48 percent higher than that
for women (0.39).
50. Strictdy speaking, the payments before payday need not be advances, insofar as payday falls on the 10th day after the end of
the month and payments before payday may be far less than the accrued wages payable on the dates of the early payments.

plucking practices in Eastern Africa are instructive, and merit study in the context of Sri
Lankan estates (Box 3. 1).
Box 3.1: Harvesting of Green Leaf on Commercial Estates in Eastern Africal
1.     "There are no minimum hours which must be worked by pluckers - they can go
home after they have plucked the minimum amount of 32kg if they wish. However,
given the wages structure the incentive is for most pluckers to pick more than the
average."
2.     "Most major companies pay for green leaf on a piece-rate basis. Over the last
decade there has beeii close interaction of management with pluckers, backed by
intensive training based on a greater understanding of the physiology of the tea bush;
which has brought about a fundamental change to the style of harvesting. The old
"gang" system of a group of pluckers (about 20 to 30) under the control of a supervisor
and treated as a collective entity, has given way to transferring more responsibility to the
individual plucker.
"Where best practices are operating, the pluckers "own" their plots in each field, which
means they will always return to the same plots at each plucking round. The result is
that the better the care of the plucking table and the better the plucking technique, the
greater will be the benefit to the plucker in future rounds. This self-discipline creates
improved consistency and quality of leaf, less petty supervision and, therefore, less
friction. A mutual advantage is that pluckers accept their own responsibility to organize
who will pluck their plots if they themselves are unable to do so. The "task", therefore,
is to complete an area of tea within a day but the pluckers use their own initiative with
regard to the speed at which they work.
"Management is now able to concentrate control in ensuring that the timing and overall
organization of harvesting is correct, so thle pluckers are in the right field at the right
time."
B. Institutional Impact
3.27   The SRR Project's Impact on the Ministry of Plantation Industries. Extension
services were reorganized during implementation of SRR I. The Advisory Services
Department was detached from RRISL to become a department in its own right, subsequently
generating a successful training program for extension officers and fanners. However, ASD
remains understaffed and the return of replanting inspection functions to the Rubber Control
Department (RCD) in 1984 reduced farmers' incentives to listen to the extension officers. A
Processing Advisory Division was established within ASD as planned under the project, with a



59
view to improving the quality of processing. However, it focussed on upgrading selected
GPCs, even though their throughput was declining, and neglected to provide assistance to
private processors. These factors all contributed to shortcomings in the impact of ASD at the
field level (para. 2.38).
3.28   The research component was designed to provide only limited support to RRISL
(laboratory equipment, vehicles and 5 fellowships), because the British Government was
planning to fund a major investment program at the institute. Although RRISL was an
implementing agency under the project, only passing reference was made to it in the six-page
section of the SAR on project organization and management. It was thus accorded relatively
little importance in the design of the project and insufficient attention was paid to supervising
the institute during implementation.
3.29   With hindsight, the lack of attention to RRISL's work was unfortunate. The institute's
failure to develop an adequate variety of high quality clones is a major shortcoming of the
project. Of the three locally developed clones that it disseminated in the early 1980s, only one
proved to be of adequate quality (RRIC 100). A second one (RRIC 102) produced latex that
commanded lower prices because of its yellowish tinge, and the disastrous consequences of the
Corynespora leaf spot attack on RRIC 103 were mentioned earlier (para. 2.10). Following the
attack, the Bank obliged RRISL to place greater emphasis on testing foreign clones for their
suitability to local conditions, as part of the second SRR project.
3.30   The Bank did play an active role in technology transfer earlier in the project, both by
funding study tours and by encouraging the adoption of green budding as opposed to
traditional brown budding techniques. The introduction of this technique and support for the
development of private nurseries in the course of the project were unplanned but extremely
positive institutional developments.
3.31   Administration of the RRF improved considerably when RCD hired additional staff and
began to computerize the processing of grant applications with project support. Processing
delays were reduced from 6 months to 3 weeks, and the annual ratio of replanting grants to
applications received rose from 74 percent in 1983 to a peak of 91 percent in 1988, before
declining to 83 percent in 1992 (the last year for which data are available). Nevertheless, the
full potential of the computerization remains to be exploited.52
3.32   Rubber Policy and Planning were to be strengthened by the establishment of a Rubber
Policy and Planning Unit (RPPU) and a Rubber Policy Review Committee. These were
established at the Bank's insistence after some delays, but were essentially dissolved within a
year, due to both non-cooperation by other agencies involved in the industry and conflict with
other parts of government arising from policy decisions that cut across ministries. In 1985 a
Tree Crops Working Group was established in MOF with a broader mandate than the RPPU.
Its responsibilities included recommending changes in export and ad valorem taxes to maintain
remunerative producer prices, although it clearly fell short in this regard (para. 2.31). In 1989
it was wound up when MOF established a Core Group to advise on restructuring the plantation
52. An intemal communication to OED from regional staff, dated June 12, 1995, notes that the computers were underutilized
because their programs were not sufficiently user-friendly. This problem is being addressed under the Second SRR project.

sector (para. 3.34). Although the Rubber Development Department (which merged RCD and
ASD functions in 1993) includes a Directorate for Market Intelligence and Planning, the major
policy coordination role intended for the RPPU is not being fulfilled.
3.33   The FTC Project and Steps Leading up to Privatization. The Fourth Tree Crops
project had already been approved when GOSL seriously considered privatizing its holdings in
the sector. In 1989 the Credit Agreement was revised to allocate US$500,000 for a
privatization study and GOSL officials, Bank staff and external consultants began to develop a
strategy for privatization. The Bank eventually declined to support the privatization program
favored by GOSL, since it did not go far enough, and suspended preparation of the proposed
follow-on Tree Crops Restructuring project (TCR).
3.34   Following a mid-term review of the FTC project in September 1988, Bank staff
strongly encouraged GOSL to establish a senior Core Group to solve the growing financial
crisis at JEDB and SLSPC. By that tine, key financial ratios had reached alarming levels
(para. 2.26 and Annex C). MOF agreed to this recommendation and established a Core Group
early in 1989. The Core Group focussed on financial restructuring, since it was not within the
group's mandate to consider fundamental changes in management or corporate structure. The
Cabinet approved the group's recommendations in August 1989, but parliamentary ratification
and resistance at JEDB and SLSPC delayed implementation. MOF also delayed action on
converting debt to equity until it obtained a firmer commitment to corporate restructuring from
other parts of government, notably MPI and the Presidency.
3.35   An immediate transition to private ownership of the estates had already been ruled out,
although a five-year phase-in period during which private companies would manage
government estates was still under consideration. The Minister of Plantation Industries at that
time favored privatization and reorganized the estates into clusters to facilitate the move.
Furthermore, an agreement with labor representatives was concluded in 1989 that delayed
implementation of the exorbitant six-day work week guarantees. However, early in 1990, a
new minister was appointed at MPI. He reversed the organizational changes introduced by his
predecessor, instructed his ministry to adopt a negative stand towards the privatization process
and the Bank was informed that the privatization consultancy had been canceled.
3.36   On the other hand, the MOF continued to push for privatization in the light of the
massive drain on public finances, and established a Task Force on Restructuring in May 1990.
Although the Task Force had high level support, its terms of reference made only an oblique
reference to "..appropriate structure, organization and management of the two corporations..",
due to the political sensitivity of the privatization issue. Nevertheless, the Task Force
proceeded to develop a strategy for restructuring the industry. The Bank provided low-profile
support for this initiative in order to avoid being seen as instigating the restructuring effort.
However, it linked release of the second tranche of an Economic Restructuring Credit
(Cr.2128-CE, approved in May 1990) to progress by the Task Force.
3.37   A major preliminary finding of the Task Force was that the size of the two
corporations and the long and extremely wide span of control were a severe hindrance to
efficient operation. Thus a feature common to all the alternatives considered by the Task
Force, was to restructure the two corporations into smaller, more compact and manageable
entities, independent of each other with substantial delegation of authority to these smaller



61
units. Initial proposals were based on the 12 existing regional boards, although by June 1991
the number had risen to 22. The Task Force recommended that: govemment estates be leased
for 99 years to 22 new publicly-owned regional plantation corporations (RPCs), rather than
transferred outright; ownership be transferred to management companies in the medium
term;53 private management be introduced from the outset, via 22 estate management
companies (EMCs); JEDB and SLSPC retain control of the 50 least viable estates; and control
and oversight of the restructuring process be transferred from MPI to a separate unit
responsible to the Treasury.
3.38   Since these proposals had to be furtlher detailed, a second phase of the Task Force was
initiated in 1991. A Plantation Restructuring Unit (PRU) was established within MOF with a
Steering Committee to take key decisions, supported by a Secretariat to interface with teams of
consultants. The Bank helped GOSL secure US$1.3 million in funding from the Japanese
Govemment in June 1991 to finance four major studies: preparation of management contracts
and open bid documents; valuation of estates' assets; taxation policy, and human resources.
3.39   There were significant disagreements between the Bank and the PRU throughout 1991,
especially regarding the influence of the PRU Secretariat (hereafter the PRU) on the content of
the studies. GOSL criticized the quality of the valuation study and neglected the taxation
policy study. The Bank considered the valuations to be satisfactory, although it was critical of
the quality of thie related company prospecti, prepared by the same consultants. The human
resources study was not undertaken (in spite of the Bank's insistence) because it would have
had to deal with the sensitive issue of retrenchment. The absence of a human resources study
denied the Bank a useful vehicle for policy dialogue on the question of labor distortions.
Finally, an important study on bidding documents and management contracts was completed
by consultants and was used to guide the privatization process, the PRU's attempts to steer the
study's findings greatly impeded the consultants' work.
3.40   By December 1991, comm11itmeint to eventual privatization of ownership had faded.
Bank management decided that they would not adopt the East African gradualist approach of
the 1970s and would insist on a firm, time-bound commitment to privatization as a condition
for approving the proposed sectoral adjustment (TCR) credit. In February 1992 the decision
was taken not to proceed with the credit, since GOSL refused to commit to anything more
than privatization of management. The Bank continued to support the study process.
3.41   Although the original intention was to open the bidding process for management
contracts to foreign companies, by December 1991 GOSL had decided that any foreign bidders
must not only bid in conjunction with domestic companies, but that the majority partner had to
be Sri Lankan. After the prequalification round of bidding, foreign firms were disallowed
entirely. By May 1992, negotiations had begun with the 22 winners that had been selected on
the basis of management skills, assets, liquidity and management fee expense (expressed as a
share of profit). Five-year management contracts were signed with the 22 EMCs, beginning in
June 1992, to manage the 449 estates that were leased to the RPCs. JEDB and SLSPC

the Presidency waned after a political crisis in the Summer of 1991.



62
continued to operate the weakest 50 or so estates and retained the central staff and most of the
debts of the old corporations.
3.42   To sum up, the FTC project did not include privatization as an objective at appraisal,
but privatization became the most important institutional development issue under the project.
Together with other Bank operations (including the proposed follow-on TCR project and the
Economic Recovery Credit) the FTC project served as an important vehicle for policy dialogue
with GOSL, and considerable staff-time was devoted to the privatization issue during
implementation. In the end, the Bank's efforts to secure a time-bound commitment from the
Borrower to the privatization of ownership were frustrated. The next chapter explores the
reasons for this.



63
4. The Evolution and Consequences of the Privatization
Strategy
4.1     A successful privatization process is characterized by a few common principles.54
Those relevant to the Sri Lankani experience are: i) transparency and fairness; ii) the support
of stakeholders; iii) political popularity, and iv) governance. An analysis of the project
experience and its aftermath reveals, with the benefit of hindsight, that some of these
principles were followed whereas otlhers were not. Some progress towards privatization has
been made, but muclh remains to be done to complete the process.
A. Transparency and Fairness
4.2     Procedures must be put in place in order to achieve fairness and transparency in the
privatization process. This ensures that rent-seeking by influential parties is minimized and
that assets, or in this case the management of assets, are transferred to the most qualified
private sector candidates.
4.3     On balance the privatization of management was achieved fairly and transparently.
About forty companies were pre-qualified, wlhiclh reduced the likelihood of collusion in the
bidding process. All pre-qualified companies were asked to name the 3 RPCs that they were
most interested in managing. The resulting 120 expressions of preference were distributed
over the 22 RPCs in such a manner that there were about 5 candidates per RPC and that each
candidate was able to bid on at least two of its three top choices. An external consultant was
hired to monitor the PRU's evaluation of the bids, in order to ensure that points were assigned
fairly with respect to the criteria for selection of EMCs. The criteria themselves were largely
based on a key study by extemnal consultants. Finally, Bank supervision can be credited with
plaving a major role in ensuLring that the process achieved the degree of transparency it did.
4.4     There were, however, also lapses in thle process.55  Perhaps the most serious one
involved two groups of high quality estates. In January 1992 they were leased for 30 years to
private Sri Lankan and Indiani interests witlh considerable status and influence. These leases
were much more attractive tllan the ones put up for open bid. The argument given at the time
was that "it would moderate public opinion if a respectable firm was given a contract as well
as one viewed as being of favored status."56 The two private sector groups were required to
improve performance, subject to stiff penalty clauses if they failed, and to pay a fixed income
54. 1. Liebemian and J. Nellis: Russia: Creating Private Enterprise and Efficient Markets, 1994.
55.  For example, the Bank insisted on the use of one consultant firm for the study on bids and management contracts, whereas
the PRU favored another. GOSL eventually acceded to the Bank's request, but commissioned a second study with USAID
support to study the same issues. The Bank attempted to block the USAID funding, but USAID provided the PRU with a grant in
December 1991. Other examples include references in Bank tiles on the FTC and proposed TCR projects to alleged
manoeuvreing by ministerial staff to ensure that they obtained influential positions following the privatization, especially on
supervisory boards.

to the EMCs that managed the RPCs from which the estates were drawn. In practice, it has
proven extremely difficult to secure payments from the lessees.
4.5    The exclusion of foreign firns from the bidding process was another major lapse in
transparency and fairness, particularly since the policy on external participation was reversed
after invitations to prequalify and bid had been published prominently in intemational joumals.
With 70 foreign firms expressing an interest and several of them preparing bids, the policy
reversal clearly damaged the government's credibility, and could dampen the interest of
foreign companies in investing in Sri Lankan plantations in the future. The decision was also
a departure from Sri Lankan policy in other sectors, where roughly one-quarter of investment
in privatized enterprises came from foreign sources.57
4.6    Transparency and fairness are required not only in the privatization process, but also in
the contractual agreement. In practice, GOSL has interfered with the management of the
RPCs, after signing the management contracts, in ways that have made it much harder for the
EMCs to generate profits from the RPCs. These issues are treated below in the section on
govemance.
4.7    Labor policy was not treated transparently during the privatization process. Estate
labor unions had acquired considerable political influence by the early 1980s (para. 3.6) and
the plantation industries were also a significant source of employment for the civil service.
Thus in order to allay fears that the privatization would lead to massive retrenchment, GOSL
announced that there would be no lay-offs. EMCs were required to provide employment for
all regional and estate level staff associated with their respective RPCs. In practice, GOSL has
generally turned a blind eye to the relatively high staff reductions since 1992 (para. 3.9).
However, GOSL reckoned that transparency witlh regard to retrenchment would have rendered
the entire privatization process politically infeasible. This of course raises the issue of
stakeholder support.
B. The Support of Stakeholders
4.8    The principal stakeholders in the privatization were: GOSL's Ministry of Finance;
GOSL's Ministry of Plantation Industries; the central, regional and estate management staff of
JEDB and SLSPC; the estate laborers and their union representatives; foreign and domestic
private companies; tea shippers and exporters; tea brokers; transporters and dealers; and
intemational donors (including the Bank, ADB, and the Governments of Norway, the
Netherlands, the United States and Japan). A common agreement and understanding was not
established amongst these disparate stakeholders and as a result the necessary commitment to a
decisive, time-bound privatization strategy was not secured.
4.9    The key decision-makers in this process were the Presidency and the Ministries of
Finance and of Plantation Industries. Their ideas found expression in the proposals of the
Task Force on Restructuring. These proposals clearly also reflected the views and pressures of
powerful interested parties (paras. 4.12 and 4.13). In sharp contrast to the GOSL Task Force

World Bank, 1994.

perspective, the Bank's perspective was one of long-term maximization of benefits for the
whole industry. The Bank was the main source of external guidance regarding the process,
and was prepared to commit funds for an adjustment credit in support of the restructuring of
the tree crop sector.
4.10   While differences can and often do exist between major parties to a privatization, a
convergence of objectives and approach is required in key areas. The columns below highlight
the main differences and similarities between the Bank's and the GOSL Task Force's
objectives and approach to privatization of JEDB and SLSPC:

4.11   There were clearly major differences in the objectives and the approach favored by the
Bank and GOSL with regard to privatization. In 1992, the GOSL approach was implemented
and the Bank withdrew its support for the proposed TCR credit. The key discrepancy that
triggered the Bank's disengagement was GOSL's reluctance to commit to the transfer of
estates to the private sector. GOSL never seriously considered selling the estates, arguing that
to do so would contravene existing laws governing landholdings. A less widely expressed but
equally important reason was that the sale of land to private estates or to immigrant workers
might raise considerable opposition from the families of smallholders who were dispossessed
over 100 years ago. The concept of leasing plantations to private interests was considered but
later dropped. Long-term management contracts were also considered, but then uncertainty
regarding the EMCs' management skills led GOSL to opt for renewable contracts that were
contingent on performance in the first five years.
4.12   The approach that was eventually adopted reflected a balancing of interests and
pressures from the most powerful groups. Central, regional and estate-level staff were
ambivalent towards privatization, as were estate laborers. On the one hand, there was a clear
recognition that the future of the employees hinged on the future of the estates, and that this
was likely to improve with privatization. On the other hand, there was concern that
privatization might lead to retrenchment of staff and labor. Estate laborers were also
concerned that privatization might lead to more demanding work norms and uncertain tenure
of homes on the estates. Consequently, GOSL guaranteed employees continued employment
by retaining the weakest JEDB and SLSPC estates, as well as by stipulating in the
management contracts that EMCs were obliged to retain all employees assigned to their RPCs.
The retention of weak estates went only half-way toward the Core Group's recommendation of
segregating and disposing of non-viable estates and entailed a continued fiscal burden for
GOSL. However these policies were backed by labor, after a leading estate labor union
publicly announced its support in 1991 for the privatization of management. Estate labor
unions also pressed for worker ownership of line houses, but this was resisted by GOSL and
by the new management.58 GOSL also tacitly assented to sharply increased voluntary
retirements after EMCs assumed responsibility for management.
58. De facto, workers are assigned line houses that they and their families live in even after the workers have retired, although de
jure the properties belong to the estates.



67
4.13   Tea brokers and buyers also had a major influence on key aspects of the privatization.
The first was the exclusion of foreign bidders and the second was the retention of limits on
sales of tea outside the auction system. These are capped as a proportion of production (10
percent until 1993, 50 percent thereafter) and are reviewed for their "appropriateness" by the
Sri Lanka Tea Board (non-auction sales are still less than 10 percent, in spite of the relaxation
of the official cap). Tea brokers and buyers clearly have a strong vested interest in
maintaining the auction system, which is the world's largest for tea. Brokers gain a one
percent commission on all auction sales, plus income from charges related to storage and other
services. There are only half a dozen major buyers, and there have often been allegations of
collusion. While there is no direct proof of this, the authors were informed both by
government and by private estate operators that the direct sale price exceeds the auction price
by as much as LKR 30-40/kg. These figures are supported by data on FOB prices and
Colombo Auction prices (Figure 4.1). In 1993, tea buyers' margins (net of cess payments)
were 22 percent of the FOB price, far exceeding buyers' margins on rubber exports, for which
only one-quarter of production passes through the auction system. Admission of foreign finns
to the bidding process would clearly have increased direct sales and reduced brokers' and
buyers' earnings. Removal of the controls on non-auction sales would probably have had a
similar effect.

4.14    There appears to have been little consultation with other stakeholders, e.g. local
transport companies, packagers, tea chest suppliers and other input suppliers. At a more
general level, consumers and taxpayers appear not to have been informed throughout the
privatization of Sri Lanka's largest industry.
C. Political Popularity
4.15    In the light of the importance of the tree crops sector to the Sri Lankan economy, it
was important to build up broad political support for privatization. However, the GOSL made
only a modest effort to educate the general public on both the process and the impact of
privatization. There is no indication of plans or a budget for a public relations campaign in
Bank documents.59
4.16    Two shortcomings stand out witlh regard to dissemination. The first is that no serious
attempt was made to address social issues related to privatization. No provisions were made to
educate workers and staff at the plantation level. MPI did issue a press release in May 1992
in a question and answer format that explained why the privatization was necessary. However,
only 3 of the 23 questions were related to the social impact of the restructuring exercise. The
answers to these three questions were cursory at best and could not have placated the concerns
of the large number of families living on the estates or in neighboring villages, who would be
affected by the process. The phasing of the privatization process and its possible social impact
was never raised or discussed with those who would be involved.
4.17    The second shortcoming is that privatization was generally motivated by, and
portrayed as, a response to an immediate fiscal crisis, rather than as an opportunity to create
longer-term benefits. The positive case for privatization has still not been disseminated widely
in Sri Lanka. This is not an uncommon situation. An OED study on privatization reports on
a survey of Bank task managers regarding Borrowers' motivations for privatization: "Reducing
the fiscal deficit was ranked first by 39 of thle 1 19 managers who responded in assessing the
actual state of affairs in 137 country operations-despite the fact that several Bank papers on
the subject (including the 1992 Second OED Review of SALs and SECALs, p. 104) de-
emphasized fiscal burden as an important motivator for public enterprise reform."
D. Governance
4.18    The transition to private-sector management was greatly complicated by a crisis of
governance that has characterized Sri Lanka sinice the early 1980s.61  The outbreak of ethnic
violence in the north of the country was followed by violent conflict in the south in the late
59. Regional staff have informed OED that the PRU had budgeted funds for a public relations campaign targeted at key
stakeholders (JEDB/SLSPC management, staff and workers), but that in the end the relations effort was limited to a couple of
seminars (Internal memorandum, dated June 21, 1995).
60. Operations Evaluation Department: World Bank Assistance to Privatization in Developing Countries, Report No. 13273, The
World Bank, 1994.
61. Govemance capacity can be defined as the ability to coordinate the aggregation of diverging interests and thus promote policy
that can credibly be taken to represent the public interest (Leila L. Frischtak: Governance Capacity and Economic Reform in
Developing Countries, World Bank Technical Paper No. 254, 1994). This is not easily done if the state apparatus is overgrown or
over-captured by powerful (private and govemment) interests. In certain cases, crises of govemance may become so severe that
the state's incapacity to deploy power makes it difficult to provide law and order.

1980s that nearly brought the country to a standstill. In 1991 there was an attempt to impeach
the President. In 1993 he was assassinated. There ensued other killings of senior government
officials (including two, both of whom had at some point served as Minister of Plantation
Industries). Although disturbances in the south were firmly suppressed by 1990, the conflict
surrounding Jaffna province is still unresolved.
4.19   Several key decisions must be seen in the context of this crisis of governance. For
example, estate wages started increasing rapidly from 1984 onwards, i.e. one year after a
major eruption of ethnic violence in Jaffna. These increases, coupled with employment
guarantees, constraints on labor transfers between estates and other labor restrictions, became
increasingly inconsistent with financial viability for the plantation corporations. However, they
reflect the key political role that labor unlions have played during the past decade.
4.20   By 1989, the real choice was not whethler to restructure or not to restructure, but rather
how to go about restructuring the industry. The weakness of the executive at a key juncture in
1991 diluted GOSL's commitment to a time-bound strategy for transferring assets to the
private sector. This weakness coincided with a rapid turnover of the Bank's regional
management team. Three different Bank directors and division chiefs were involved in the
privatization process over a two-year period. This reduced the Bank's ability to respond
quickly and to influence and support GOSL at the higlhest levels.
4.21   The solution that emerged was a higlhly unusual management contract approach (Box
4.1) that enshrined labor distortions, precluded foreign involvement and retained marketing
controls. The latter two constraints reflect the entrenclhed interests of brokers and buyers
(para. 4.13).62
4.22   GOSL's interference in management decisions has continued since the June 1992
privatization of management. The most damaging intervention was the approval of a 30
percent across-the-board wage increase for estate labor in December 1992. The first part of
the increase was effected in January 1993, but when GOSL required the EMCs to implement
the second part a few months before the parliamentary elections in August 1994, the EMCs
threatened to renege on their contracts. Clearly, the effects of the crisis of governance are still
being felt in the tree crops sector, notwithstanding the privatization of management. This
raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the industry under the management contract
approach that has been adopted to date.
E. The Management Contract Compromise
4.23   Issuing management contracts was a compromise, rather than an optimal solution to
the problem of improving the efficiency and financial performance of JEDB and SLSPC. This
does not mean that management contracts cannot be effective solutions to improving
efficiency-they often do help to overcome many of the problems of centralized, bureaucratic
decision-making that is common in public sector enterprises (see Box 4.1). However,
management contracts are most effective when the private sector managers are granted a large
degree of autonomy and adequate incenitives. Neither of these conditions have been met in Sri
Lanka.
62. The long tenn leases signed in January 1992 (para. 4.4) should also be viewed in the context of over-capture by influential
private interests.

Box 4.1: A Brief Overview of Management Contracts
I.        Management contracts were first introduced in the 1940's by the Hlilton hotel chain within the United States.
They came to be used morc widely only in the 1 970s, whien private investors in hotels around the world sought to avail
themselves of the name recognition. brand loyalty and reservations network of established hotel chains. Management
contracts are now the predominant contractual arrangemilent in the international hotel industry (62 percent), far outstripping
franchises (28 percent), leases (5 percent) and direct management by owners (5 percent).
2.        There has been little reliance on management contracts outside of the hotel industry. They have been used to a
modest extent for water utilities (between French utilities and Francophone African ones), sugar companies and lately
power companies (for independent power projects). T hey have not caught on because implementing the contracts can be
costly, there are few management companies withl adequate skills, and owners fear that their companies' assets might be
stripped. Poland's strategy of relying on management contracts to accelerate the privatization of restructured state
enterprises has met with few takers. due to perceived risk on the operators' side as well as risks associated with finance
and govemance.
3.        Managemcnt contracts in effect throughout the world have several features in common:
o      Operators are rewarded for thicr perforsmance V ia a combination ot' tixed and performance-related
fees. The former generally cover fixed operating cxpenses (mainly salaries), whereas operators'
profits are derived from the performaiice-related fees. These fees are usually related to net profits.
o      Investment and working capital requiremernts are often met by the owners.
o      Operators have the option, or are required, to take a small equity position in the overall company.
4.        International donors have balked at financing the significant transaction costs associated with management
contracts. There are only a few exceptions. lhe AMSCO (African Management Services Company) was set up in the late
1980s with the help of the International Finanicc Corporation and was financed mainly with bilateral funds. AMSCO signs
management contracts with privately owned African companies and provides them with supplemental management support.
In Asia, there is only one major management contract that has been in effect for some time: it governs the Light Rail
Transit Authority (LRTA) in Metro Manila, whichl began operations in 1984. The decision to follow this route was
influenced by Metro Manila's power company, which originally controlled the management company. In practice, there is
little distinction between the management company and the (iovernment owners. LRTA is not making a profit, but is well
managed, has an extraordinarily high ridership and is carning a positive net operating income before debt service. The
Philippine Government recently considered fully privatizing the LRTA, but postponed a decision when additional
concessional financing was made available by the Government of Japan to fund the expansion of the LRTA system.
5.        The intemational lending comniuity has tcnded to view a managerrent contract as an interim step to full
privatization. It has considered such arrangements to be compromises, rather than optimal solutions. It has supported the
use of management contracts only in situationis in which immediate privatization has not been a politically viable
altemative. Sri Lanka is an exantple of suchi a situation.
6.        Sri Lanka's approacii to managemefit contracts has been virtualls unlique in four key respects:
o      Sri Lanka is the only country outside of Eastern Europe that has relied on management contracts as
part of an organized strategy for privatization.
o      Sri Lanka is the only country that has barred foreign firms from bidding for a management contract.
o      Instead of negotiating each contract on a case-by-case basis (as is common e.g. in the hotel
industry). GOSL adopted an open bid procedure (typically used for full privatization) to select the
EMCs.
o      GOSL has to date denied EMCs the option to take an equity share in the RPCs they manage.

4.24   Some of the deficiencies of the process that generated the management contracts have
been described in the previous sections of this chapter. The most critical one was the lost
opportunity to re-introduce foreign financial resources and technical and managerial expertise
into the industry. Most of Sri Lanka's largest private companies had little or no prior
experience with estate management. Therefore they generally hired former JEDB/SLSPC staff
to manage the estates. However, while many of these staff were highly competent managers
or supervisors, they typically lacked the private sector/marketing expertise that was sorely
needed in the sector. On the financial side, the largest private sector companies were roughly
ten times smaller than the RPCs that the winning bidders would manage. This limited the
financial contributions that they could make to the sector and also the relevance of their
management experience.
4.25   Another major shortcoming is that the process was not governed by an overall
privatization action plan. In spite of the work of the Task Force, major elements of the
privatization strategy were not adequately considered. These included: i) the incongruity
between reliance on management contracts and attracting new sources of funding; and, ii) the
absence of clear linkages between the use of management contracts and the valuation of
estates.
4.26   While asset valuations are often prepared prior to a sale of assets, they are rarely
considered prerequisites for the issuance of management contracts. However, the Bank had a
number of good reasons for insisting on a valuation of JEDB's and SLSPC's assets. First, the
value ascribed to the two corporations' fixed assets in their financial statements was
unrealistically low; second, opening balances of assets and liabilities had to be prepared for the
22 newly-established RPCs; third, the Bank shared GOSL's concern about the possibility of
asset stripping by the management companies. Finally, although GOSL was leaning towards
the privatization of management without any transfer of ownership to the private sector, the
Bank was preparing for the possibility of such a transfer within the following two or three
years. The valuation of assets was considered essential for transparency in the privatization
process. A team of consultants was hired to conduct a thorough valuation based on both an
assessment of physical assets and a discounted cash flow approach. The Bank also committed
considerable staff time to monitoring the valuation process. However, in the end the private
companies that bid for the management contracts rejected the valuations because they did not
reflect the bidders' risk perceptions or their concerns regarding the quality of the estates.
Furthermore, GOSL also rejected the valuations, and the opening financial statements for the
22 RPCs failed to include fair assessments of the value of the estates under RPC control.
4.27   In addition to weaknesses in the process, the contracts themselves were marred by
design failures. These failures severely constrained the scope of EMCs' decision-making and
reduced their incentives to enhance the performance of the RPCs . The main shortcomings
were:
The initial contracts were for only five years, which acted as a disincentive for EMCs
to plan longer-term developments. Because of the gestation period for tree crops, the
EMCs were not assured of an opportunity to recover the costs of field investments
financed with their own resources.
The lack of security for EMCs was increased because they were not given the option
to purchase shares in the RPCs. Although the possibility of granting EMCs such an
option resurfaced in April 1994, it was postponed due to electoral considerLtions.



72
The contracts required the creation of new management companies, to be held entirely
by the winning bidders. The newly created EMCs have virtually no assets, and
therefore are unable to borrow directly from the banking system.
The privatization did not lead to new sources of financing for the industry, only to the
hope that expenses would decline and that the pressure on existing sources would
therefore be relieved. In practice the scope for reducing costs has been limited and
GOSL has had to tap into the Employees' Provident Fund, (since GOSL has a large
fiscal deficit and the banking system is already overexposed to the sector).
EMCs were granted negligible formal control over the deployment of labor. They
were obliged to absorb all regional and estate level staff and labor associated with the
transferred JEDB and SLSPC estates. Many of the regional staff have considerable
plantation experience but lack marketing and financial management skills. The EMCs
cannot relocate labor-not even temporarily--from surplus to deficit areas, nor can
they terminate staff without GOSL approval.
EMCs have virtually tno control over labor wage rates. Until 1984, negotiations took
place under the oversight of a wages board based in the Ministry of Labor. Since
then, high-level executive decisions, influenced by powerful unions, have determined
wages and employment conditions. This situation has continued even though
management of the estates has been privatized.
EMCs cannot optimize the value of land. They cannot allow unproductive tea estates
to be left fallow, nor can they readily convert thlem to alternative uses, such as cash
crops, golf courses, resorts, etc.
EMCs cannot sell assets witlhout GOSL. approval, or buy assets worth more than
US$2,000 without GOSL clearance. While the PRU has approved most requests, the
process is overly bureaucratic and second-guesses the EMCs.
Marketing of tea is highly restricted. Direct sales outside the auction system must be
cleared by the Sri Lanka Tea Board and are less than 10 percent of total
sales-although the cap was formally relaxed to 50 percent in 1993. Expenditures on
overseas trips to establish contact with new markets are rarely approved by the PRU.
EMCs bear no financial down-side risk. They earn a negotiated share of profits, but
all losses are borne by GOSL. This distorts incenitives in favor of more risky
investments.
4.28   The last of these shortcominigs is attributable both to uncertainty with regard to the
quality of the estates and to the crisis in governance. GOSL could not credibly commit to not
interfere in key management decisions, particularly those pertaining to deployment and
remuneration of labor.
4.29   The government's half-way approach to privatization has met with partial success. On
the one hand there have been reductions in losses (para. 2.34 and Annex C). The EMCs have
managed to curtail praedial larceny and to cut staff and labor by offering severance packages,
particularly to less competent employees. At the field level, EMCs have introduced a number
of improvements with regard to tea cultivation, including field-by-field fertilizer mixtures



73
based on soil and foliar analysis, rather than the TRI's countrywide standard mix; bush-by-
bush application of fertilizer, rather than broadcast application; new pruning practices; and
proven South Indian VP techniques, rather than TRI-recommended intemodal cuttings.63
Rubber cultivation has also benefitted from field-by-field fertilizer mixtures, increased usage of
rain guards, and greater use of grafted plants, rather than budded stumps. Coconut cultivation
has been upgraded by the application of fertilizer, replanting and underplanting, and
introduction of successful hybrid varieties that have yet to be sanctioned by the CRI.
4.30    On the other hand, the debt of the original 22 RPCs (overdrafts, long term loans and
debentures) has increased from LKR 658 million in December 1992 to LKR 3.5 billion in
June 1994 (Figure 4.2).64 Even though operating losses have been reduced, current
perfornance does not inspire confidence in the RPCs' ability to repay the principal on the
LKR 1.6 billion in debentures issued as of June 1994 when these begin to mature in 1998.
Debt service is furthernore absorbing an increasing proportion of the RPCs' resources. For
example, for the period June-December 1992, capital expenditures were 20 times higher than
interest expenses, and both were at about 70 percent of budgeted rates. By January-June 1994,
interest expenses had grown to equal 57 percent of the value of capital expenditures. During
that period interest expenses were above budget by 11 percent, whereas capital expenditures
were only 40 percent of budgeted rates. This trend is not sustainable. and calls for bolder
reforms to ensure that the sector can be set on a sound financial footing.

5. Strategies for Sustainable Development
A. Findings
5.1    Project Objectives and Sector Strategy. The Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation
project was designed to support the govemment's scheme to replant the backlog of over-aged,
low-yielding smallholder rubber. To do so, the project aimed to strengthen the administrative
capacity of agencies responsible for replanting; provide adequate inputs and incentives,
improve the quality of smallholder rubber and expand the capacity for future replanting. The
scale of the backlog (one-third of the rubber in private hands) and the need for an investment
program to replant it had been identified in the 1979 rubber masterplan. The project was
therefore highly relevant to sector objectives.
5.2    The main objective of the Fourth Tree Crops project was to reverse the decline in Sri
Lanka's production of tea, rubber and coconuts by improving the performance of the
plantation corporations. This was to be achieved by improving producer incentives, improving
productivity, rehabilitating factories and improviing estate transportation. The project also
aimed to strengthen management and financial control of the corporations, stabilize lands
through soil conservation and improve the healtlh and welfare of estate workers. These
objectives were consonant with those of the Medium Term Investment Plan developed by the
central managers of the plantation corporations on1 the basis of estate-level investment
proposals. In that sense, the project's objectives were highly relevant. However, the project
objectives included the replanting of rubber, even though an excessive 32 percent of JEDB and
SLSPC rubber stands were immature at appraisal. Furthermore, the project did not attempt to
deal with the critical issue of labor distortions, which was neglected in the MTIP proposals.
Thus the project failed to address one of the key factors that eventually undermined its
outcome.
5.3    Achievement of Project Objectives. The SRR project largely achieved its physical
objectives, albeit with a three-year delay, (Table 5.1). The only significant shortfall was with
respect to the number of new Group Processilg Centers, which is explained by registration
delays at the Cooperative Department and by a lack of demand for GPC services. The
outcome of the GPC component, together with deficiencies in the supply of planting materials,
affected the fulfillment of project objectives with regard to quality. Institutional objectives
were on the whole not achieved. Bank-proposed reforms to improve rubber policy
development and planning were soon reversed, as were measures aimed at integrating the
provision of extension services more closely to the authorization of replanting grants. The
reversals were driven by administrative opposition to the changes. On the other hand, RCD's
processing of grant applications was greatly accelerated via the hiring of additional staff and to
some extent via the introduction of computers.

5.4    The F TC project's physical achievements on the whole far exceeded appraisal targets
(Table 5.2). However, a number of project objectives were not achieved, for reasons
identified in Table 5.3. The disconnect between achievement of inputs and achievement of
objectives points to a number of missing links between the two. These were either quality
factors (poor clonal varieties, field maintenance, accounting information, etc.) or constraints
that were not addressed under the project (labor distortions, management incentive systems,
etc.). The relatively poor performance with regard to institutional development objectives
(para. 1.16) is also not explicit in the figures since the objectives were not quantified.

78
5.5     The mixed overall performance, relative to project objectives, should be viewed in the
context of the unrest and insurgency of the late 1 980s and of the unforseen decline in world
prices for all three commodities. However, a number of internal factors also influenced the
attainment of objectives, notably political interventions in labor matters and other aspects of
the management of the estates.
5.6     Returns on Project Investments. Economic rates of return were below  10 percent
for both projects. The main reasons were unforeseen declines in commodity prices, lower than
expected yields (for rubber and coconut) and higher than projected costs of production. Unit
costs of production at both the estate and the smallholder level were driven up by real wage
inflation that was not matched by increases in productivity. The Smallholder Rubber
Rehabilitation project managed to boost ERRs to 4.8 percent, relative to a without-project
scenario with less replanting, lower overheads and slightly lower yields, but the ERR was only
0.2 percent when compared to a scenario of ilo replanting. The Fourth Tree C'rops project
generated returns of 8.2 percent for tea, 7.4 percent for rubber and 2.0 percent for
coconuts.65
5.7     Financial returns to smiallholder rubber growers depended on cultivation practices and
on the size of the holdings. Relative to a without-project scenario of no replanting, they
ranged from 5 percent for farners hiring tappers and not planting intercrops to 17 percent for
farners using family labor for tapping rubber, and planting intercrops.66 These returns to
growers do not include benefits from replantinig grants, whichl make all investments attractive,
except the use of hired labor for all farn activities. Governiment estates experienced growing
losses during the project period as real prices declined, productivity stagnated and real costs of
production increased. These same factors will depress earnings on project investments over
the next two decades. Re-estimated FRRs at imipact evaluation range from  8.3 percent for
rubber to 0.4 percent for coconuts.
5.8     Overall Assessment of the Two Projects. Both projects are rated unsatisfactory at
impact evaluation. This assessment reverses the satisfactory ratings given at project
completion, for reasons described earlier. The two projects are not likely to generate
acceptable economic returns, nor will financial returnis be attractive, except for certain
smallholder rubber growers.
5.9     There is considerable uncertainty as to whether the benefits generated under the two
projects are sustainable. Both PCRs had considered the sustainability of project benefits to be
likely, but a number of factors have intervened since completion to alter the sustainability
ratings. In the case of the SRR project, the follow-on SRR operation is continuing to
strengthen extension services to smaliliolders, wliclh should help to improve cultivation
practices and therefore yields. On the other liand, increased cess rates, which are required to
make the RRF self-sustaining, will adversely affect beneficiaries under the first SRR project.
65. The SAR assumed no replanting in the absence of the project fbr each crop. The PCR assumed a modest replanting program
for rubber but not for tea (it did not recalculate the ERR for coconuts). The ]ER made the same assumptions as the PCR for tea
and rubber, and as the SAR for coconuts.
66. Compared to the altemative replanting scenario without the project, returns are solid (14 to 33 percent) since yields would
have been lower.



79
The benefits generated under the FTC project would be enhanced by privatization of
ownership, a more profit-oriented investment program and better cultivation practices. On the
other hand, GOSL has not yet committed itself to privatization of ownership, the burgeoning
debts of the RPCs may stifle investment, and GOSL may oblige the RPCs to pay the
outstanding portion of a 30 percent pay raise approved in 1992, even if labor productivity is
not increased. Finally, there is the possibility that GOSL may reinstitute export taxes if the
industries improve, which would adversely affect producer incentives.
5.10   Institutional development under both projects is rated as modest, relative to project
objectives. Under the SRR project, there were shortcomings with regard to policy, planning,
research and extension aspects of institutional development (paras. 3.27ff). On the other hand,
the project played an important role in encouraging the development of private nurseries and
the application of new budding technologies, both of which emerged as objectives only during
project implementation. The FTC project's impact on institutional development, notably of
management systems, was limited, although the establishment of an inter-ministerial
Investment Monitoring Board yielded valuable information regarding the quality of project
investments (paras. 1. 16).
5.11   The above ratings do not reflect the FTC project's performance with respect to the
objective of privatizing the corporations. This objective was only introduced during
implementation, but it became the most important institutionial development issue under the
project. It is very hard to assess the project's overall impact on the privatization process. The
objectives and approach proposed by the Bank were generally sound (para. 4.10), Bank
supervision and technical support increased the transparency of the privatization process, and
certain project-financed investments (e.g. in VP teas) may have made the estates more
attractive to private investors. However, the Bank's capaci.y to influence the process might
have been enhanced by the presence of a privatization expert and by less turnover of the
management team at a critical juncture (1990-92), when the Borrower's resolve was beginning
to weaken. Finally, a number of policymakers believed that "their backs were not up against
the wall", due in part to relief provided by the FTC project funds (and the reallocation of Bank
and ADB funds to the replanting component). Even though privatization was mooted as early
as 1986, when falling prices cut the corporations' profits, serious action on the matter was
deferred for three years. It is therefore an open questioni wvhether or not the MTIP support
postponed the required restructuring of the industry.
B. Lessons
5.12   Tree crops have played a major role in the development of Sri Lanka since the 19th
century. The industry is likely to prosper if and only if appropriate policy measures are taken.
The privatization of management has contributed to improved performance in key aspects of
the estates' operations, however it has fallen short of what was originally intended and of what
is required to turn the fortune of the tree crops sector around decisively and sustainably.
5.13   A comprehensive strategy, organized around a logical framework, is required in order
to: i) generate sustainable growth, and ii) improve thle welfare of those who earn a living from
the tree crops sector. These ultimate objectives can only be achieved by galvanizing the sector
via improved technology and increased factor productivity, and by competing more effectively



80
in international markets. Success with regard to these intermediate objectives in turn requires
a significant injection of capital, investment in human resources ("putting people first"),
reliance on the industry's global expertise, and elimination of wasteful practices.
5.14   The analysis in this impact evaluation suggests that these objectives cannot be attained
under government management of the industry, nor will the fettered private management
arrangement currently in place suffice. A coherent set of measures should be adopted by
GOSL to remove market distortions and create an enabling environment in which the private
sector can flourish. The government's full commitment to this approach is as yet uncertain,
but will be essential in order to restore domestic and external investors' confidence and
provide investors with appropriate incentives. The Bank and other donors can and should
continue to play an important supporting role in the fulfillment of these objectives. The above
policy proposals are consistent with the intentions communicated in a Policy Framework Paper
for 1994-96, that was prepared by GOSL in collaboration with staff of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.67 Finally, the proposals are consistent with the lessons
of experience drawn from the evaluation of the SRR and FTC projects. These are summarized
next.
5.15   General Lessons
(a)    Sectoral Strategy. i) a comprehensive vision is required for the sustainable
development of the tree crops sector, with attention to input supply,
production, marketing arrangements and institutional support; and ii) a strategy
is required that includes a complete, coherent and time-bound set of measures
for realizing the visioIn.
(b)    Support of Viable Operations. In the event of sharp adverse movements in
prices and costs during imlplemiienitation, the Bank should re-assess economic
returns to ensure that resources are directed only to viable activities. If ERRs
(or FRRs) fall below 10 percent, corrective action should be taken to
restructure the project or suspend it. Covenants requiring minimum rates of
return for investments to qualify for project support should be enforced
(c)    Information and Accounting Systerns. i) information and accounting systems
should provide managers with accurate and timely information; ii) accounting
systems should meet generally accepted accounting principles; iii) the Bank
should monitor and relate its support to the quality of information and
accounts that it receives, and enforce covenants pertaining to them.
5.16   Rubber Replanting Programs
(a)    Technology. The Bank should only support accelerated replanting programs
for tree crops if the clonal material to be replanted is of an internationally
67. They are also consistent with those of the 1994 Sri Lanka Tree Crops Strategy Report, No. 12356-CE, prepared by the
Agriculture Operations Division in Country Department III, South Asia Region of the World Bank.



81
acceptable standard, has been thoroughly tested and is readily available for
distribution together with adequate technical support for farmers.
(b)    Replanting Grants. If a cess/grant system is used to support replanting, then
the grant should be adjusted regularly to reflect changes in investment costs, so
as to provide a minimum acceptable level of support. Cess rates should in
turn be adjusted to reflect changes in the grants, and should also be assessed
on domestically-consumed rubber.
(c)    Management of Replanting Programs. i) Attention should be paid to
stabilizing replanting cycles, so that, wherever possible, the liquidity problems
associated with large immature areas can be avoided; ii) attention should also
be paid to the distributional implications of replanting programs. Unlike credit
arrangements, cess schemes require that all (exported) rubber be taxed, even if
only qualifying smallholders receive grants. Those who qualify may be
wealthier smallholders with more technical support. Measures may be required
to counteract this tendency.
5.17   Private Sector Participation in Tree Crop Development
(a)    Privatization as a Process. The process of privatization should: i) be
transparent and explain why as well as what is proposed; ii) enjoy unwavering
commitment from the goventment; iii) be open to foreign investment and
expertise; iv) encourage participation by all stakeholders; v) secure popular
backing, rather than just the support of vested interests; and vi) publicize the
positive case for privatization.
(b)    Management Contracts. The design of the management contracts adopted thus
far has limited their effectiveness. The contracts are short-term and grant
private managers little operating autonomy. If management contracts are to be
used for tree crops plantations, they should be given for an extended period of
time, e.g. 50 years, and should provide substantial operating autonomy to
private managers in order to encourage long-term planning and investment.
Even then, they must be regarded as second-best arrangements for attracting
private capital.
(c)    Private Capital. It was appropriate for the Bank not to support the
privatization approach adopted in 1992, since it lacked a strategy for attracting
private capital and was therefore unsustainable. The experience of the past
two years suggests that privatization will only succeed if private managers are
given the option of purchasing a substantial share of the equity of the RPCs
(or are given long-term leases on the land). This will: i) enable them to
borrow and invest against their shares; ii) provide them with incentives to
invest in long-term projects and manage the enterprise as a long-term business;
and iii) provide them with some down-side risk, thereby discouraging
excessive risk-taking.



82
(d)    Valuation of Assets. A simple valuation of assets was clearly warranted in
order to guard against asset stripping by the management companies.
However, the Bank-supported discounted cash flow analysis which aimed to
inform the private sector's valuation of the estates was rejected by the bidders.
This is because it was conducted from a seller's perspective and failed to
reflect the market's risk perceptions or concerns regarding the quality of the
estates. If and when the RPCs are privatized, it will be essential to adopt a
buyers' perspective to assign a value to their assets. This will reinforce the
argument for a credible commitment from GOSL to a private-sector-led
approach, since GOSL's commitment will be essential to narrow the gap in
(subjective) valuations between buyers and sellers.
(e)    Foreign Participation. The privatization of a large scale industry, such as Sri
Lanka's tree crops industry, should be open to international bidders. This can:
i) attract managerial and marketing expertise; ii) attract financial capital; iii)
promote competition and efficiency; and iv) enhance transparency.
5.18   Removal of Market Distortions and Wasteful Practices
(a)    Policy and Regulatory Environment. i) the elimination of export taxes was a
sound policy decision that should be maintained, together with an exchange
rate policy that takes into account its effects on the tree crops sector; ii)
restrictions on direct sales outside the auction system should be eliminated, in
order to encourage vertical integration, the development of brand names, and
price stabilization through forward contracts and reduction in the time lag
between production and disposal of tea; iii) the productivity of land was kept
low by restrictions on land use, especially in mid-level estates, where
diversification from tea into alternative crops is most warranted; iv) research
recommendations from CRI, TRI and RRISL need to be up-to-date, thoroughly
tested and responsive to growers' needs so as to avoid wasteful practices, e.g.
the use of inappropriate clonal varieties or application of fertilizer that is not
tailored to specific local conditions.
(b)    Determination of Wages and Benefits for Estate Labor. Wages and benefits
should be subject to collective bargaining between managers and unions.
Specific contractual commitments are required from government, in this
regard, to allay private sector concerns that returns on their investments might
be undermined by arbitrary administrative decisions.
(c)    Labor productivity. Sri Lanka's wage rates are still low by international
standards, but productivity is also low. Jobs can only be preserved if
productivity is increased. This might be done by: i) allowing workers to move
from labor surplus to labor deficit areas; ii) renegotiating work norms that
have been set at unduly low levels; iii) adopting the best labor management
practices employed in other countries; iv) broadening the scope of labor
assignments in areas where the traditional estate crops are no longer viable;
and v) proposing less burdensome alternatives to the guaranteed six-day work-
week.



83
5.19   "Putting People First"
(a)    The Social Welfare Program. i) Needs assessments and beneficiary
participation were key elements in the success of the program; ii) the EMCs
have displayed at best modest interest in the SWP. This may be due to the
short-term nature of the management contracts and the long-term nature of the
benefits of investing in a healtlhy and educated work-force; iii) the continued
commitment of external donors to the SWP after project closing has sustained
the SWP's benefits.
(b)    Off-Farm Opportunities for the Estate Population. The underemployment of
youth on the estates is an acute problem that calls for urgent attention. This
might be done via: i) technical and skills training using existing rural and
urban programs, as well as Sinhala language training; ii) home-based, income-
generating projects for women; and iii) employment in the Middle East and
Far East, organized through the Foreign Employment Bureau.
(c)    Women's Status and Living Conditions. i) Regulations requiring that wages
and maternity benefits be paid directly to women are not being enforced; ii)
women's work norms result in compulsory overtime that lowers their effective
wage rates and does not necessarily generate additional tea plucking, nor is it
required to ensure that all the fields get plucked. Indeed, by limiting
opportunities for women to generate income in other activities, household
earnings are depressed. This can increase pressure for higher wages.
Therefore the best practices applied in tea growing countries in Eastern Africa
should be piloted and then, if successful, be applied more widely on Sri
Lankan estates.






85                                Annex A
Institutional Arrangements in the Tree Crops Sector
1.    The Government Estate Sector. Until the early 1970s, tea, rubber and coconuts were
grown primarily on private estates and smallholdings. The Sri Lanka State Plantation
Corporation, which had been established in the 1950s, managed the production of tree crops
for GOSL.
2.    Following a change of government in 1972, all landholdings exceeding 20 hectares (50
acres) were nationalized. In order to manage the nationalized tea, rubber and coconut estates,
the government created the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and expanded the
operations of the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation (SLSPC). The two companies came
to be among the largest plantation corporations in the world. During the 1980s, their top
administrative levels were organized into government ministries, with His Excellency the
President serving as Minister for JEDB and Minister for SLSPC. Following a change of
administration in 1989, the Ministries for JEDB and SLSPC were reorganized into the
Ministry of Plantation Industries, which had until then focussed on the smallholder sector.
3.    In 1992, GOSL decided to privatize the management of most of its estates. About 90
percent of the 500 estates owned by JEDB and SLSPC were leased for 99 years to 22 newly-
established, wholly government-owned Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs).68 The
government then invited Sri Lankan companies to bid for management contracts for the 22
RPCs. Each of the 22 winning bidders was required to establish a new subsidiary to manage
the RPC for which it bid successfully. The subsidiaries are referred to throughout the report
as Estate Management Companies (EMCs). Five-year, renewable contracts were signed in
June 1992 between the EMCs and their respective RPCs.
4.    The RPCs share a common board of directors and are supervised by the Plantation
Management Monitoring Division (PMMD) of the Ministry of Plantation Industries (MPI).
This division succeeded the Plantation Restructuring Unit (PRU) of the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) that oversaw the privatization. The PMMD also supervises the operation of about 50
estates that have remained under JEDB and SLSPC control.
5.    Tea. The Ministry of Plantation Industries continues to provide numerous services to
the tree crops sector. The principal MPI agencies in the tea sector are the Sri Lanka Tea
Board, the Tea Smallholdings Development Authority (TSHDA) and the Tea Research
Institute (TRI). The Sri Lanka Tea Board administers subsidies and collects cesses, monitors
tea factories, promotes and markets tea, approves sales of tea outside the auction system,
collects data and provides policy advice to the government. The TSHDA provides extension
services to tea smallholders.
6.    About 95 percent of Sri Lankan tea is marketed through the Colombo auctions, the
largest tea auctions in the world. The tea is brought to the auctions either by dealers, who
purchase it from several hundred private and government-owned tea factories, or by the
68. A twenty third RPC was established in July 1993.



Annex A                                 86
factory owners themselves. Producers were not allowed to sell more than 10 percent of their
output outside the auction system, until 1993, when the ceiling was raised to 50 percent.
7.     Seven brokers auction the tea on behalf of the planters. They also provide godowns,
arrange for sampling of the tea by buyers and offer advances to producers. The tea is
purchased by buyers/exporters who are associated with a few large multinationals. Some of
the tea bought at the auctions is blended and/or packaged before it is exported. The exporters
pay any cess or export duties assessed by GOSL.
8.    Rubber. The principal MPI agencies in the rubber sector are the Rubber Development
Department (RDD) and the Rubber Research Board. The latter administers the Rubber
Research Institute of Sri Lanka (RRISL), whereas the former is the product of a Bank-
supported merger of the Rubber Control Department (RCD) and the Advisory Services
Department (ASD). This merger was effected in June 1994. Until then, the ASD had
provided extension services to smallholders and the RCD had collected cesses on exports and
provided subsidies to smallholders through the Rubber Replanting Fund (RRF).
9.     Less than 15 percent of Sri Lankan rubber is marketed through the Colombo auctions.
The auctions have a limited number of brokers and buyers, and there have been allegations of
collusion by buyers. Most of the auctioned rubber comes from government-owned estates,
since dealers encourage smallholders to bypass the auction system. The dealers often provide
a credit service to smallholders. On the other hand, most of their profit is made by
understating the grade of rubber purchased from smallholders and upgrading i' at point of sale.
Dealers also obtain their rubber from government-organized Group Processing Centers (GPCs),
other rubber processors or from smaller local traders, who purchase it from smallholders.
a.     A substantial share of smallholders' latex is processed into ribbed smoked sheets
(RSS) before it leaves the farm-gate. About 20 percent is sold as latex to private and public
sector factories that produce latex crepe, sole crepe, centrifuged latex or technically specified
rubber (TSR). Since the quality of rubber produced by GPCs and private or estate factories is
far higher than that processed by smallholders, the Bank has supported the establishment and
upgrading of GPCs and latex collection centers.
10.   Until 1981, GOSL had a monopoly on exports of RSS grades 1-3, which it bartered
for rice with the People's Republic of China at a premium over the world price for rubber.
Most of the purchasing, shipping and handling of RSS was carried out on behalf of the
Ministry of Trade and Shipping's Commodity Purchase Department (CPD) by registered
private dealers. CPD also operates depots that accept any RSS offered to them by GPCs,
smallholders or traders, but their importance has declined since the removal of the export
monopoly. In their heyday, CPD fixed a purchase price based on Singapore spot prices that
provided a reference price for dealers and local producers/traders, however by 1988 CPD
depots accounted for a mere 3 percent of marketed RSS.
11.   Coconuts. The coconut sector is assisted via MPI's Coconut Development Authority
(CDA), which controls two statutory boards: the Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB), which
mainly provides support to smallholders, and the Coconut Research Institute (CRI).



87                                  Annex A
12.    While a significant share of smallholders' coconuts are produced for home
consumption, most nuts are either offered for direct sales in the marketplace or sold to local
dealers who pass them on to stockists (wholesalers). The wholesalers sell them directly to
marketers in the fresh nut market, directly to local processors, or put them up for sale in the
Colombo auction. About 90 percent of the fresh nuts marketed by estates pass through the
Colombo auction. The buyers are generally local processors, who produce copra, coconut oil,
desiccated coconut or coir fibre for local retail and for export. Exports of copra were
restricted until recently, in order to ensure a ready supply for the local market. Thus most of
the kernel exports have been in the form of desiccated coconuts.

Macroeconomic and Sectoral Data
I.    This annex comprises nine tables. The macroeconomic indicators in Table BI are
drawn from an updated version of Table 1.1 (Key Economic Indicators) presented in the FY93
Coimtry Economic Update for Sri Lanka (Report No.  1862-CE), prepared by the World
Bank's South Asia Region, Country Department 111.
2.     Table B2 presents data on export revenues from tree crops, drawn from Central Bank
Bulletins and from the 1993 Plantation Sector Statistical Pocket Book (hereafter the Pocket
Book). Tables B3 to B5 present key indicators for each of the three major tree crops: tea,
rubber and coconuts. The data were culled from the Pocket Book, an updated version of the
Sri Lanka Rubber Statistics (1991-1992) prepared by MPI's Rubber Control Departnent, and
the Coconut Development Authority's Sri Lanka Coconut Statistics (1993).
3.    Table B6 on the fiscal impact of the tree crop sector is based on calculations by the
impact evaluation team, using data from JEDB and SLSPC financial statements, Performance
Report Summaries presented to PMMD by the EMCs (see Annex A), and the Pocket Book.
4.     Data on social indicators are presented in Tables B7 and B8. They are drawn from the
Sri Lanka Poverty Assessment, (forthcoming), prepared by the World Bank's South Asia
Region, Country Department III. Table B9 presents summary statistics on payroll variables,
such as wages earned and number of days worked, for a sample of 104 estate workers at
Liddesdale Estate, Maturata Plantations Ltd. The payroll data were obtained by the impact
evaluation team in an October 1994 visit to the estate.

Table D9             Financial analysis: revenues and costs per hectare
Table DIO            Financial analysis: incremental benefits, FRRs and NPVs
Table Dl l(a)-(b)    Economic analysis: incremental benefits, ERRs and NPVs
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Analysis
Yields:       The yield curve used in the PCR for new investments (referred to as the new
technology) was found to be reasonable, based on field interviews by the impact
evaluation team, and was used for the impact analysis (Table Dl(a)-(b)). The impact
adjusted the without-project (or existing technology) yield assumptions: the PCR had
assumed that yields on all areas replanited would decline by 50 kg/year from 350 kg/ha
in 1981 to 150 kg/ha in 1985 and that there would be zero benefits foregone on any
area replanted thereafter (1986-88). The IER assumes that the same yield decline
applies to each cohort of replantings, so that e.g. benefits of 150 kg/ha were forsaken
in 1992 on areas replanted in 1988.69 This reflects a more conservative estimate of
the age of uprooted trees.
According to ARTI, 5-7 percent of trees in Kalutara and Kegalle and 19 percent in
Ratnapura were over 30 years old at appraisal. Thus there would have been some
replanting even in the absence of the project. This possibility is omitted in the SAR
and PCR analyses. It is referred to as the alternative technology in the impact
analysis. It is assumed that as a result of the project's extension outreach, quality
inspections and technology transfer, cultivation practices (e.g. fertilization, drainage
and terracing) and clonal material inproved, thereby increasing yields under the
project by 8 percent relative to the alternative technology.
Labor:        Labor usage was generally taken to be in line with PCR estimates, except for tapping
labor requirements, which were found to have been over-estimated for the with-project
situation; they were adjusted upwards for the without-project scenario. The impact
evaluation team found that hired labor was employed not only for uprooting but also
69. The SAR assumes foregone yields of 265 kg/ha for five years on each area replanted.



Annex D                                     104
for tapping on holdings as small as 1.2 hectares (3 acres). The cost of hired labor for
tapping is therefore included in the analysis. In the PCR, labor for intercropped
bananas is costed as hired labor, except for labor for harvesting and transport the
bananas. The impact costs all labor employed in producing and marketing the
intercrop. Labor assumptions are the same for bananas under the alternative
technology.
Inputs:       PCR estimates of materials appeared to be consistent with those provided by RRISL
and those obtained from field level interviews by the impact evaluation team. They
were thus used in the impact analysis. Applications of fertilizer was taken to be lower
under the alternative technology than under the project.
Intercropping: PCR estimates with regard to labor and inputs were found to be reasonable. Following
the PCR, the impact analysis assumed that intercropping with bananas was done on 13
percent of area replanted, although a small portion of the intercropping consisted of
passion fruit or pineapples, rather than bananas. Insufficient data were available on
these other crops. Areas intercropped by year are presented in Table D6. The PCR's
calculation was adjusted by reducing hectarages for the third year of benefits by half,
since farmers often uproot banana early for fear of reducing yields on rubber. Under
the alternative technology, the intercropped area is taken to be only 10 percent of the
estimated hectarage that would have been replanted under the alternative scenario
during the project period (see aggregation below). Yields and inputs are taken to be
the same under the new and the alternative technologies.
Output Prices: Unlike the PCR, which used a single projected price figure for rubber throughout the
analysis, actual prices were used in the IER for 1980-1993. New York RSS I spot
prices for rubber were adjusted for quality, based on actual quality premia on the
Colombo auction for the years 1980-93, and for freight charges. For the financial
analysis, prices were converted to Lankan Rupees at the official exchange rate. After
1994, the exchange rate was projected to depreciate in nominal terms based on
projected MUV and domestic inflation rates so as to remain constant in real terms at
the 1994 rate. The FOB Colombo price in LKR was adjusted for actual export duties
and cess payments per kilo of rubber exported and for estimated shipper, broker and
dealer charges to arrive at a farmgate price. Estimates for these charges were derived
from appraisal and impact mission information. Projected world prices for rubber
were based on World Bank projections as of February, 1995. Banana and wood prices
were estimated based on actual figures at SAR, PCR and IER. Projected prices for
wood and bananas were assumed to remain constant in real terms from 1994 onwards.
Input Prices:  Annual data on average retail prices for inputs were obtained from data issued by
RDD, PCR data and impact mission interviews. Projected prices for inputs were
assumed to remain constant in real termns. Labor rates for tapping and uprooting were
taken from RDD data for 1981-91 and from impact information for 1994. Real wage
inflation of 1.8 percent per annum was assumed thereafter, reflecting the average real
wage inflation rate for these two labor activities over the period 1985-94.
Aggregation:  Following the PCR, aggregation was based on a model for rubber and a model for
intercropped bananas. For the new technology (i.e. the project), the model for rubber
was applied to the actual hectarage of rubber replanted each year and the model for
bananas was applied to the entire intercropped area each year. For the altemative



105                                  Annex D
technology, the hectarage that would have been replanted each year during the project
period is assumed to be one-half of that actually planted, and the altemative
intercropped hectarage is estimated at 10 percent of the altemative rubber hectarage.
Aggregation was done first for yields and inputs, and the resulting annual totals were
multiplied by actua! prices for the year in which the yields were obtained/inputs were
applied.
Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
Conversion
Factors:     Standard conversion factors were applied, except for labor, for which a specific
conversion factor was used, and fertilizer, for which the shadow price was derived.
Farmgate prices for rubber were derived from world prices (see the derivation in Table
D4).
Overheads:   Project overheads were based on PCR data. It was assumed that under the altemative
technology, overheads would have been one-third of those incurred under the project.

Economic and Financial Analysis of the Fourth Tree Crops
Project
This annex presents the assumptions underlying the economic and financial analysis of the
Fourth Tree Crops project and the following tables:
Table El(a)-(d)     Tea, rubber and coconuts: production with and without the project
Table E2(a)-(c)     Tea, rubber and coconuts: with- and without-project prices
Table E3(a)-(c)     Financial analysis: incremental benefits, FRRs and NPVs for the three
crops
Table E4(a)-(c)     Economic analysis: incremental benefits, ERRs and NPVs for the three
crops
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Analysis
Production:   The impact analysis followed the SAR and PCR in presenting a crop base without the
project and deriving an incremental production stream that was added to the crop base
to obtain the with-project output. The incremental stream reflects both foregone
production and new production on areas replanted. Yields on foregone production
were not made explicit in the PCR's analysis, but interviews by the impact tean
suggested that the SAR's without-project yields were representative of actual
experience; therefore they were used in the impact analysis.
The SAR assumed no replanting in the absence of the project. The PCR added a
modest replanting program for rubber in the absence of the project. The TER followed
the PCR's assumptions in order to obtain comparable results. In practice, likely
without-project replanting programs are highly uncertain in the case of the FTC
project, due to considerable uncertainty regarding the timing and nature of
privatization that might have occurred in the absence of the project. For example,
without the flow of funds provided by the project, the government might have
privatized management of government estates earlier than it did, and might have
allowed private ownership of shares in the RPCs in order to attract private capital.
This scenario would probably have entailed substantially lower production costs as
well. On the other hand, without Bank support for and monitoring of the process,
privatization might have occurred much later than it did and might have been
significantly less transparent.
The PCR used SAR yield curves for the with-project analysis of tea and rubber-it did
not re-estimate retums on coconut investments. The SAR yield curves were found to
be appropriate for tea, but optimistic for rubber (as noted in the PCR, p. 31) and for
coconuts. The impact analysis therefore derived more modest yield curves for tea and
rubber, based on information obtained during mission interviews (Tables El(a)-(d)).
Actual output figures were used for the with-project production streams for each crop
for the years 1985-1993.
Costs of
Production:   Following the PCR, actual average costs of production, were used for the with-project
analysis for each crop for the years 1985-1994. Thereafter, costs of production were



Annex E                                     120
related to output under the assumption that fixed costs and variable costs of production
would remain constant over time. Fixed costs were set at 30 percent of the total cost
of production in 1993 in the case of tea, 25 percent of 1992 costs in the case of
rubber, and 55 percent of (average) total costs for 1992/93 in the case of coconuts.
These proportions are consistent with those applied at appraisal. The remaining costs
for each crop in 1992/93 were taken to be variable and were used to derive average
variable costs of production per kilo for tea and rubber, and per nut for coconuts.
This permitted the calculation of projected total costs of production for 1995-2014 that
were related to with- and without-project production streams.
In distinguishing between fixed and variable costs, the impact analysis followed the
SAR but departed from the PCR's analysis, which did not distinguish between the two.
However, the impact followed the PCR in adjusting without-project costs of production
up, relative to the with-project scenario. The impact's adjustment (one percentage
point, attributable to efficiency gains from project-supported factory development) was
more modest than the PCR's adjustment (3.5 percentage points, attributed (PCR p.36,
footnote d) to poorer labor management without the project).
Prices:       Prices for the three commodities were derived as shown in Tables E2(a)-(c). With-
project financial prices were net of average export taxes for tea and rubber. For the
period 1985-1993, actual net sales average (NSA) figures were used. Thereafter,
financial prices were assu.ned to change in the same proportion as projected world
prices, relative to a base obtained by averaging the NSA for 1989-1991. Under the
without-project scenario, it was assumed that quality of production would have been
poorer, resulting in a 2 percent lower price.
Wood Values: Financial prices were not available by year for coconuts and were taken to remain
constant in real terms at the SAR value. Financial prices for rubberwood were the
same as those used for the SRR project analysis and were based on interpolations of
SAR, PCR and IER data for that project. The total values of coconut palm and
rubberwood sales each year were obtained by multiplying the respective prices by the
product of hectares foregone and trees per hectare. Wood values are subtracted from
the (incremental) investment cost for rubber and coconuts in tables E3(a)-(c) and
E4(a)-(c).
Investment
Costs:        These were re-estimated on the basis of information provided by JEDB and SLSPC in
annual reports on the MTIP, and on information in the PCR. In the case of rubber,
incremental investment costs were presented net of a without-project investment stream
equal to 14 percent of the with-project stream (70 percent of with-project costs on one-
fifth of the with-project area). Since the investments in social welfare yielded
unquantified welfare benefits in addition to their impact on productivity, part of the
welfare investment costs (50 percent) were excluded from the calculations.
Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
Costs of
Production:   Three adjustments were made to the financial costs of production described above.
First, allowances were made for depreciation and interest payments. Second, the labor
components of financial costs of production were adjusted by a specific conversion



121                                    Annex E
factor for labor. The SCF that was used was lower than that for the smallholder
rubber project, due to the lower opportunity cost of estate labor, except in the case of
coconuts, for which the impact team found an acute shortage of labor and a relatively
high proportion of non-resident workers. Third: the non-labor components of financial
costs were adjusted by the standard conversion factor. The proportion of labor costs in
total costs, the conversion factor for labor and the standard conversion factor were
assumed to remain constant after 1994, so that the proportional difference between
financial and economic prices was held constant over time. Just as under the financial
analysis, a one-percent adjustment was made for efficiency improvements under the
project, relative to the without-project scenario.
Prices:       Tea and rubber prices are equivalent to financial prices, as described above, augmented
by the average export taxes collected by GOSL. Following the SAR, economic prices
for coconuts were set equal to the world price of bulk coconut oil, CIF NW Europe,
adjusted for manufacturing and export costs using a 1.2 cost factor that also reflects
the benefits from sales of poonac, a by-product of the manufacture of coconut oil (the
SAR adjustment factor was 1. 17). Just as for the financial analysis, it is assumed that
tea, rubber and coconut prices would have been 2 percentage points lower in the
absence of the project, due to quality improvements.
Wood Values: Financial values for sales of coconut palms and rubberwood were converted to
economic values using the standard conversion factor.
Investment
Costs:        Investment costs in financial terms for the three commodities were converted to
economic values using the standard conversion factor. As noted above, part of the
welfare investment costs were omitted from the calculations, since the benefits
associated with them could not be quantified.

Dear Mr Slade,
Thank  you  for your  facsimile,  relating  to  the  extension  of  the
deadli.ne for co=ents on the draft Impact Evaluation Report on the two
above World Ban-k projects. Please be informed the Netherlands would
appreciate it if the following cc=rents were reproduced in an Annexure
to .he fir-a  zeport.
Quote:
The Netherlands, being the principal donor to the Social Welfare
Programme (SWP, the social development component of the FouWth Tree
Crops Sector Loan/FTC), welcomes the emphasis the Impact Evaluation
Report puts on the importance of adequate social development
strategies ("putting people first") for the future approaches of
assistance to the tree crops sector in Sri Lanka.
Although the results of the. SWP compare favourably with the leconomic
and finai%cial returns of the FTC, it is felt. the overall soci4l impact

of the tree crops assistance could have been more comprehe.saive if
more attention were paid to theae issues during the implement 0tion of
the FTC project, for instance though regular consultation   ith the
donors concerned. Although formulated as an integral part of tke F'TC
in the course of its  imlementation the SWP evolved more or less
independently from it. This development might have contribute d to the
.decreasing   awareness   observed   amongst   principal   Sri   Lankan
'stakeholders   (e.g.   the  Goverment  and  the   Estate  Ha aagoent
Corporations) of the need for social development, given the fe ct that
their policy dialogue with the World Bank could concentrate m .nly on
institutional  and  financial  concerns,  the  social  concerns, being
catered for more or less independently by other donors.
This disentanglement of the FTC and SWP projects could help to explain
why the principal focus of the Impact Evaluation Report  is on
financial, economic and institutional issues. Although Chapt ar 3 of
the Report relates exclusively to the social impact of the pcrojects,
it is felt more could have been made out of it, for in.stance through
more extensive discussions of the Evaluation Team with the T |cbnical

Notes to the Comments from the Borrower and from Cofinanciers
A. Notes to the Comments from the Borrower
The price projections used for the impact evaluation were derived from World Bank
commodity price forecasts. It is indeed a matter of some concern that there has been significant short
term variability in medium to long term forecasts. The tendency in the past has been for commodity
forecasts to overestimate commodity prices, as is indicated in the text (para. 2.19 and Figure 2.7).
However, the latest World Bank report on Commodity Markets and the Developing Countries: A
World Bank Quarterly, dated May 1995, notes that "Tea prices at the London auction remained stalled
at depressed levels during the quarter...If no output disruptions occur, this year's world black tea
output is expected to substantially exceed demand for the third consecutive year." Thus a conservative
forecast of tea prices is not unwarranted.
With regard to rubber, the same report notes that "Prices will remain above long-term trends
during the next three years because of the absence of new plantings during the recent years of low
prices. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand will dampen initial price-induced supply gains, though
global natural rubber production is expected to return to 1992 levels this year, easing current prices."
OED has followed up on the Borrower's suggestion to discuss the sensitivity of the estimates
of economic returns to price projections and to conduct a sensitivity analysis in the case of prices
(para. 2.19). The sensitivity analysis suggests that the report's conclusions are fairly robust.
OED has reflected the Borrower's comment that the area under tea and rubber may have been
overestimated in the past, whereas production figures are more reliable, so that yields may have been
underestimated (footnote 10). Without a more complete set of revised figures on the extent under
cultivation, OED has continued to use the figures in the Plantation Sector Statistical Pocket Book
published by the Ministry of Plantation Industries.
The Borrower noted that the reduced areas under cultivation imply that "the incremental
benefits from the two projects would appear to be larger than it is thought to be with the higher total
extents assumed in the calculations". Since the economic analysis compares with- and without-project
production levels rather than acreages, and since the production figures are considered reliable, no
change has been made to the analysis. While the revised figures on tea and rubber extents would
clearly affect the ratio of the net present value of the project investments to the area under cultivation,
this ratio has not been calculated for the impact evaluation.
B. Notes to the Comments from the Government of the Netherlands
OED shares GONL's concern with regard to the decreasing awareness among key Sri Lankan
stakeholders of the need for social development. GONL's explanation for this, namely that the SWP
component evolved independently from the other components of the project, is reflected in the chapter
on Social and Institutional Developments (footnote 46).
The social aspects of the project were a high priority for OED. OED highlighted welfare and
gender issues not only in the impact evaluation but also in meetings that the OED mission held with
government officials in Sri Lanka. The mission also met with officials of the Technical Assistance
Team, NORAD, the Plantation Housing and Social Welfare Trust, the Ceylon Workers' Congress, the

Institute of Ethnic Studies, the Center for Women's Research, Sarvodaya Women's Movement, CARE
International Sri Lanka, and Satyodaya Kandy. In addition, the mission leader met with FAO
sociologists working on Sri Lanka, and with representatives of large, London-based tea companies that
operate in East Africa so as to compare their labour practices with those on Sri Lankan estates (see
Box 3.1). Finally, the mission visited line houses on tea and coconut estates and interviewed workers,
health staff and estate superintendents in order to make a qualitative assessment of living conditions,
constraints and priorities. Regrettably, most of the analysis in the report had to be based on data
through 1993 (obtained from the TAT and the PHSWT), since the OED mission visited Sri Lanka late
in 1994 and figures for 1994 were not yet available for most variables.
OED recognized that an environmental impact assessment of the two projects was probably
warranted. For example, the Bank had included conditionality in the Development Credit Agreement
regarding flows of untreated effluents from factories that was not complied with, due to shortages of
local funds. However, in the light of the priority assigned to the social component and to the
overriding issue of privatization, careful scrutiny of the environmental impact of the projects was
beyond the scope of this report. This issue therefore merits attention in a future review of the sector.
