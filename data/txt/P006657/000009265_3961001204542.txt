MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN OF US$71 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed lcan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$71 million to help
finance a transport infrastructure project.   The loan would be at the Bank' a
standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of
grace.
2.   Backaround.   In the mid-1980s, the Chilean economy, coming out of a deep
recession, underwent a Bank-supported structural adjustment program, which had as
an objective the recovery of economic activity and employment, coupled with gradual
reduction of the external debt burden. The program supported the evolution towards
an open market-oriented economy, and has been very successful in achieving, since
1985, an overall average growth of about 5% per year. The transport sector underwent
considerable restructuring in line with the strongly market-oriented strategy
pursued by the country. Policy changes included: (a) eliminating transport sector
subsidies; (b) charging private air, land and sea transport for the use of public
infrastructure facilities; (c) permitting each transport mode to set its own
tariffs, design its services, and develop its own policies; (d) liberalizing access
to the road transport industry; (e) encouraging private sector participation for
investments and operations in ports, airlines, railways and urban transport; and (f)
considering all transport modes equal for purposes of taxation.
3. The outward-oriented macroeconomic policies being persued by the Government
makes ports a key element among the transport subsectors. During the last decade,
the Chilean ports systAm underwent a major institutional restructuring based
primarily on transferring to the private sector the operation of public ports, with
the exception of wharfage and storage. This significantly improved public port
efficiency, achieving increases of 1502 in the number of loaded/unloaded tons per
berthed ship-day, and port cost savings estimated at US$90 million in 1989, as
compared with what would have been required in 1981 for the same traffic. As a
result, Chilear ports have been able to maintain reasonable operating conditions
even with considerable traffic growth (over 102 per year during 1985-90), and
without an increase in infrastructure, particularly since some port facilities
(notably at Valparaiso and San Antonio) were destroyed or seriously damaged by the
1985 earthquake. But the institutional improvements and technological changes have
now reached a limit where extra capacity in the system is badly needed to avoid
serious congestion problems; this is especially significant in the ports of
Valparaiso and San Antonio during the peak of the fruit season, and in San Vicente,
all year round, where the percentage occupancy reaches an average value of 80-90%
in each of the three ports. The Government encourages maximum private participation
for expansion of pert capacity, purposely limiting its own participation to
reconstruction, modernization, and maintenance works. State investments for new
construction are made only when private initiative does not materialize or for
national security reasons.



- 2 -
4.   There are several agencies involved in the port subsector, and their actions
are coordinated by an Interministerial Infrastructure Committee (IIC), presided over
by the Minister of Public Works; in addition, there is an executive Interministerial
Port Commission (IPC) responsible for operational and technical matters of port
pr scts. The system is effective and permits a broad d4.scussion of problems for the
purpose of reaching consensus on important policy decisions; for the proposed
project, it should be complemented to handle the many every day problems that will
occur during project implementation, bj appointing a coordination unit in charge of
handling those problems. The agencies most directly involved in the proposed
project, the Directorate of Port Works (DOP), the government agency under MOP
responsible for the execution of public port rehabilitation and construction, and
the Chilean Ports Enterprise (EMPORCHI), responsible for general m&nagement and
control of operations of public ports, are vell qualified and experienced to perform
their duties in the project, provided DOP receives some external support through
consulting services, to cope with expected increases in its workload.
S.   The port system is highly efficient and adequately satisfies the demand within
the constraints imposed by a limited infrastructure. Port productivity is high by
international standards, reaching in the project ports 1.5 to 3 times the values
achieved by a group of developed countries in terms of ton/siiip/hour for the
transfer of dry bulk and general cargo. However, in the movement of containers,
efficiency at San Antonio and Valparaiso is lower, achieving only 40-502 of the
values in ton/ship/hour registered by the same group of countries; consequently,
this is an area that needs to be improved. Port investment and maintenance are
adequately carried out and enough resources are allocated every year for those
purposes.
6.   Overall, the port subsector has achieved significant progress and shows a high
degree of efficiency and productivity. Some improvements can still be achieved by:
(a) reinforcing the coordination between private and public port investments; (b)
strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for the development of
fishing activities in the ports; (c) implementing measures to improve environmental
port conditions; (d) improving port land access; and (e) restructuring port tariffs.
7. During project preparation, it was apparent that EMPORCHI's public port
investment program did not cover a number of complementary activities that fall
outside its authority. Also, it did not provide for investments to complement and
support private sector port activities that may develop over the project period but
which cannot yet be fully characterized. As a result, a separate component was
included in the loan according to an indicative investment program.   Specific
subcomponents would be based on economic and environmental criteria.
8.   Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's involvement fits well with Chile's
outward-looking macroeconomic framework, and its assistance strategy for Chile
emphasizes, inter alia, efficient resource allocation and increased exports,
increased private sector participation in the economy, and improved efficiency in
the public sector. The Bank Group has been involved in the transport sector in Chile
since 1961 through a credit and six road sector loans for a total of US$583 million
plus a US$150 million guarantee for a "B" loan. Bank involvement in the port
subsector, through sector and project preparation studies and emergency repairs of
the earthquake-damaged ports of San Antonio and Valparaiso with proceeds of a road



- 3 -
loan, has been crucial in avoiding overdesign and promoting competition among ports
as well as changes to customs regulations and procedures, mainly with regard to
container traffic. In particular, the Bank's presence in the port subsector would
bring a beneficial catalytic effect in precipitating policy decisions for
improvoments, which may be harder to implement without Bank participation given the
already high efficiency level achieved in the system. This applies, inter alia, to
improvements in container operations, coordination among relevant Government
agencies and with the private sector, orderly development of fishing activities, and
implementation of environmental conditions in ports.
9.   Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives of the project are to: (a) ensure the
provision of port facilities at San Vicente, San Antonio and Valparaiso to handle
forecast traffic efficiently, including seasonal peaks, up to the year 2000; (b)
increase efficiency in port activities by improving port accesses, encouraging the
utilization of advanced container-handling technologies, redesigning port layouts,
establishing a transparent and rational cost-based port tariff system, monitoring
and improving environmental conditions at the project ports, strengthening the
institutional and regulatory framework of fishing aczivities in ports, and
developing inland intermodal cerminals; (c) strengthen the institutional set-up of
the infrastructure sector, including the coordination between private and public
port investments; and (d) ensure provision of other high priority port-related
investments, within a sectoral context.
10.  Project Description.  The project has two parts. Part A (86X of project cost)
consists of the high-priority, 1992-95 MOP Port Investment Program, complemented by
private sector investments; and Part B (14X), within a sectoral context, comprises
high-priority, port-related investments. Part A components are: (a) reconstruction
of earthquake-damaged container and general cargo berths at San Antonio and
Valparaiso, remodelling and expanding related backup areas, and rehabilitation of
the Baron Berth at Valparaiso (58.02); (b) construction of a new berth at San
Vicente (5.42); (c) purchase of container cranes and various port environmental
improvements by the private sector (13.4?); (d) technical assistance for
institutional, engineering, and other project-related studies (8.7?); and (e)
training (0.5?). Part B components (142) would comprise port-related investments
such as construction of fishing jetties, port access facilities, inland terminals,
and complementary investments to facilitate private sector investments selected in
accordance with criteria satisfactory to the Bank. Port components under Part A are
based on feasibility studies financed under previous Bank loans, as updated in 1991.
An EA prepared in 1991 concluded that the project would have no adverse
environmental impact.
11. Total project cost is estimated at US$160.1 million equivalent (including taxes
and duties), with a foreign exchange cost of US$98.4 million. Bank-financed project
components amount to US$131.0 million, representing 821 of the total cost, including
taxes and duties; the difference of US$29.1 million corresponds to the total cost
of project components expected to be financed by the private sector. The proposed
Bank loan of US$71.0 million, which corresponds to about 91? of the foreign exchange
cost of the Bank-financed components, represents 52.7Z of the project cost (net of
taxes and duties) and 44.42 of the total project cost. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of



key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Chile are
given in Schedules C and D, respecti-rely. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report No.
9846-CH dated November 21, 1991, are attached.
12. A maximum amount of US$7.1 million (10S of the total loan) will be used for
retroactive financing of expenditures made after March 4, 1991 (the date the Bank
initiated the appraisal process) for the port works at San Vicente and Baron Berth
at Valparaiso, as well as for consultant services for technical assistance
components. Bank procurement guidelines have been st:ictly followed, and the works
are urgently needed to alleviate current and crnstruction-related congestion
effects.
13. Project Implementatlion. The coordination of the project will be done by a
Interministerial Project Coordination Unit (IPCU) under IIC, complemented by a
Project Control Unit (PCU) that has been created to coordinate and monitor the
execution of the project on a daily basis. The PCU unit will be financed by the
technical assistance component of the project to alleviate the workload of DOP, the
executing agency. IPCU will be integrated by high-level representatives of all
agencies concerned with the project (IIC, IPC, EMPORCHI, DOP, MINTRATEL, MIDEPLAN,
MINFIN) and will act as counterpart of the Bank, perform general coordination, and
supervise and monitor the general progress of the project. Subproject selection of
the Part B components will be based on an economic and environmental eligibility
criteria agreed with the Government.
14. Proiect Sustainability. The carefully structured coordination scheme (para.
11) supports the institutional sustainability of the project, while the high
profitability of EMPORCHI assures financial sustainability.
15.  Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement.  Lessons learned during 30
years of Bank lending experience in the transport sector in Chile are very
encouraging. Especially in the last decade, the country has had an excellent record
of fully complying with objectives, covenants, timing, quality of Works, and cost
estimates of the different projects. Institutional improvements have been remarkably
good, exceeding the Bank's expectations in many cases. Training programs have also
been highly successful. This is confirmed in relevant PCRs, especially in the most
recent one issued on May 21, 1991 for Loan 2297-CH.
16. Aareed Actions. Agreements were reached with the Government at appraisal, and
confirmed at negotiations, to: (a) inform the Bank and give the Bank an opportunity
to comment before authorizing any port investment in the hinterland of the project
ports; (b) establish the framework for an orderly development of fishing activities
in the port areas before June 1993; (c) implement a plan of action for environmental
improvements in ports not later than December 1993; (d) implement and cause to be
implemented a new tariff system satisfactory to the Bank in EMPORCHI by December
1993; (e) cause EMPORCHI to take necessary measures to meet specific working ratios,
and total cash generation requirements of EMPORCHI, to cover its share of the
proposed project cost; (f) take all necessary actions/investments to ensure proper
and timely provision of container-handling equipment; and (g) terminate current
authorization to the fishing fleet to operate at berth 3 at San Antonio on March 31,
1992. During negotiatione, agreements were reached on the agreement to be signed
between the Government and EMPORCHI and required instruments for its effectiveness,



specifying responsibilities of both parties, including the responsibility of
EMPORCHI to provide the local counterpart and service the debt of the loan, and the
timing thereoi; also, it covers the conditions for the transfer of ownership of such
investments to EMPORCHI.
Condition of Effectiveness.   Full staffing of the PCU and the signing of the
agreement between the Government and EMPORCHI with the enactment of the instruments
required for this agreement, are conditions of loan effectiveness.
17. Project Benefits. The benefits generated by Part A components will be cost
savings resulting from: (a) an increase in port operating efficiency; (b) reduction
of port congestion; (c) reduction in transport costs; (d) an increase port capacity;
and (e) minimizing the risk of losing part of the existing port capacity in the
event of a major earthquake. The ERRs of these c3mponents range between 18% and 71%
and the overall ERR is 46%. Part B benefits will be evaluated during project
execution applying already agreed criteria. The project i.'ill also contribute toward
introducing reforms and institutional strengthening in areas such as coordination
between private and public port investments, fishing activities in ports,
environmental conditions in ports, and container terminal management. Consequently,
the project's benefits would significantly exceed the returns on individual
investments.
18. Risks. All port project components will be designed applying the most advanced
seismic design criteria to ensure that all structures can withstand the most severe
earthquake that may occur in the region. Since 1978, projects in the highway
subsector have been efficiently executed and timely with no cost overruns. However,
this is the first Bank operation in the port subsector in Chile; therefore, there
is no experience with the capacity of the DOP, the executing agency for all civil
works, to implement the project properly and on time. To minimize the risk, a well
balanced coordination set-un will be established comprised of executive
representatives of all Goverument agencies involved in project implementation (para.
13).
19. Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
