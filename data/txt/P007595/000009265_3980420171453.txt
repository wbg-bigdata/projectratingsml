Guarantor:                 United Hexican States
Beneficiaries:             Nacional Financiers (NAFIN) in its own right and as
trustee for Fondo de Garantia y Fomento a la
Industria Mediana y Pequena (FOGAiN), Fondo Nacional
de Fomento Industrial (FOMIN), Fideicomiso de
Conjuntos, Ciudades y Parques Industriales (FIDEIN),

(SECOFI)
Amount:                    US$185 million equivalent
Terms:                      15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate
OnlendLng Terms:           The Borrower on behalf of the Guarantor would relend
US$100.0 million of the loan proceeds to FOGAIN st a
rate linked to the ACF (Average Cost of Funds) for
onlending to industrial enterprises through partici-
pating financial intermediaries (PFls) for investment
in fixed assets and working capital.  Another US$45.0
million would be onlent to FOMIN for providing equity
and quasi-equity to private sector companies and
financing for the restructuring component. FOMIN
would, as in the past, share the capital gains on an
equal basis with NAFIN, and for subordinated credits
pay NAFIN 202 of its interest earnings. FIDEIN would
receive as equity US$10.0 million to implement the
industrial buildings and park development program.
NAPIN would retain US$10.0 million for the micro-
enterprise credit program. PFIs would bear the
credit risk; and the Government would bear the cross
currency risk and be responsible for interest and
principal repayments of the loan to the Bank. Since
the Mexican capital market is highly open, the
interest rates structure as measured by the ACP
reflects investors' perception of the relative return
to assets denominated in foreign and domestic curren-
cies. Because the interest rates under the project
are linked to the ACF, the foreLgn exchange risk will
be implicitly borne by the final borrowers.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.N.C.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A FOURTH SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.N.C. (NAFIN) for US$185.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be repaid over 15 years, including 3 years of grace,
at the standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  Of the 85,000 registered industrial establishments in
Mexico, 97.8% are classified as small and medium enterprises (SMIs). SMIs
account for 51% of industrial employment (2.6 million) and 40% of industrial
value added, and are concentrated in consumer goods (mainly non-durables' and
the intermediate goods subsector. SMIs play a critical role in generating
employment at low investment costs, promoting regional development, providing
the seedbed for the development of entrepreneurial talent, upgrading labor
skills, and providing industrial employment for women. macroeconomic
adjustment to the crisis of 1982/83 and to the subsequent decline in the
price of oil has resulted in a sharp contraction of industrial output in
Mexico since 1982. However, SMIs have been less affected by domestic demand
contraction than industry in general. SMIs frequently show greater
flexibility in adapting rapidly to changing demand conditions and product
requirements. Moreover, industrial sector adjustment to recent government
initiatives to liberalize imports, promote exports and enhance international
competitiveness can be supported by further development of SMIs. Subsectors
in which SMIs predominate are more competitive than the average for the
economy. In addition, in their capacity as indirect exporters SMIs have
significant potential to contribute to the more rapid growth of manufactured
exports. The strategic role of SMIs in the process of industrial recovery
and restructuring was recognized by the Government in a specific SMI
development program, issued in April 1985. Shortage of term resources,
insufficient working capital and high indebtedness of firms are important
constraints to continued development of the SMI sector. The Bank has to date
financed three projects in the SMI sector (US$322.0 million), the first two
were successfully completed, and the third is nearly fully committed.
Experience with the execution of the three projects has been good, resources
were efficiently allocated and most institutional development objectives were
achieved.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is aimed at improving the
quality and range of financial and technical assistance services to SMIs in
order to assist them in responding to the increased competitive pressure
resulting from the Government's trade liberalization measures and to increase
their financial viability. The proposed project would: (a) enable private
small and medium scale investors to make their existing units more
competitive by investing in the balancing, modernization, and expansion of
existing units, and help them to establish new enterprises; (b) revive
production of existing SMIs which are operationally viable but are
overleveraged, through establishing an institutional and financial framework



-2-
to plan, implement and support restructuring strategies for selected firms;
(c) help informal micro-enterprises through a pilot credit and training
scheme; and (d) improve the policy framework for SMI development by
broadening the understanding of the potential and constraints of SMIs through
a series of priority studies.
4.        Project Description.  The proposed project would include:  (a) The
Credit Component (US$100 million) accounts for about 54% of the loan and
would be implemented by FOGAIN (Fondo de Garantia y Fomento a la Industria
Mediana y Pequena). Of the total loan funds, at least US$50 million will be
for financing fixed asset investments, covering plant and machinery
purchases, associated working capital needs and related civil works. The
balance of the credit funds could be applied to financing free-standing
permanent working capital requirements of eligible firms; (b) The Risk
Capital Comionent (US$20 million) would support and broaden the scope of
FOMIN's (Fondo Nacional de Fomento Industrial) ongoing equity and
quasi-equity investment program, which finances planned expansions by
existing firms and venture capital type investments by new entrepreneurs. As
in the past, FOMIN financing would support investments in fixed assets and
related permanent working capital; (c) The Pilot Financial Restructuring
Component (US$25.0 million) would offer comprehensive financial packages
including debt/equity swaps, lengthening of terms of accumulated commercial
bank debt and provision of fresh working capital and fixed asset investment
resources, all designed to meet the long-term needs of companies that are
operationally healthy and have good prospects, but currently suffer from a
weak financial structure; (d) The Factory Building and Industrial Park
Development Program (US$10.0 million) implemented through FIDEIN (Fideicomiso
de Conjuntos, Ciudades y Parques Industriales) would finance credit to
industrial park owners or operators in the private sector for the
construction of factory buildings within industrial parks in the high
priority industrial zones. In addition, financing would be available on a
selective basis for the expansion and/or modernization of existing industrial
estates and construction of new industrial parks in high priority zones 1 and
2; (e) The Pilot Micro-Enterprise Component (US$10.0 million) implemented
through NAFIN would provide financing for fixed asset investment and working
capital needs of micro-enterprises which are unable to borrow through the
normal banking channels for want of collateral; (f) The Technical Assistance
Component (US$5.5 million) would provide consultant services and equipment,
including micro-computers, audio-visual equipment, and software development
for: (i) further improving the technical and institutional capabilities of
FOGAIN and the commercial banks by designing and implementing simplified loan
evaluation, portfolio control, and supervision systems; (ii) supplementing
FOMIN's existing staff skills with outside experts in financing instruments
and legal issues related to financial restructuring; (iii) strengthening the
technical capabilities of FIDEIN; (iv) on-the-job training to NAPIN staff
responsible for reviewing subprojects; (v) gradually expanding PAI's
extension service and initiating new support programs for credit unions,
indirect exporters, and subcontracting arrangements between SMIs and
large-scale producers including multinationals; (vi) strengthening the
operations of the promotional agencies responsible for implementing the
micro-enterprise component; and (vii) enabling SECOFI (the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industry) to undertake key subsector studies to identify
development constraints and to formulate policies to promote SMI
development.



-3-
5.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$350.3 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$157.3 million (45%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Mexico are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6539-ME,
dated June 2, 1987, is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is part of a
broad program of Bank assistance for Mexican recovery and restructuring
efforts in industry. It will complement the Government's trade liberal-
ization measures which were supported by the Trade Policy Loan (Ln. 2745-ME)
by enabling small and medium industrial enterprises to restructure their
production units to become more competitive, and by providing long-term
crerUt and badly needed equity funds to reduce the "pain of transition" in
moving from a highly protected environment to one which is internationally
competitive. At the same time, the proposed project would extend to the SMI
sector the lending instrument introduced for larger firms under the recent
ndustrial Recovery Loan (Ln. 2746-ME) and facilitate the Bank's dialogue
with the Government on overall industrial sector development strategy.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government of Mexico
agreed on: (a) a commitment to provide counterpart resources of US$25.0
million for the FOMIN financial restructuring component; (b) including, as a
condition of retaining the restructuring component, a study on formulation of
proposals to strengthen banking regulations and supervision with particular
reference to portfolio quality as part of the financial sector studies
currently being carried out by the Government of Mexico; (c) satisfactory
appraisal procedures, onlending terms, spreads, maturities, grace periods and
free limits; and (d) implementation arrangements for technical assistance
activities. NAEIN would duly execute subsidiary loan agreements with POGAIN,
FOMIN and FIDEIN outlining the terms and conditions for the transfer of loan
proceeds as a condition of loan effectiveness.
8.        Justification.  The proposed project would broaden the scope of the
ongoing SKI development program by: (i) facilitating the restructuring of
viable but overleveraged firms which are underutilizing installed capacity;
and (ii) supporting micro-enterprises in the informal sector which are
operated by low income producers (primarily women entrepreneurs) and which
are normally left outside the formal institutional framework.  Economic
benefits under the proposed project are expected from: (a) increases in the
production, productivity, and international competitiveness of small and
medium enterprises arising from an improvement in the quality and breadth of
financial services provided to the SMI sector; an (b) more efficient
utilization of existing assets and maintenance of employment in the SMI
sector due to improvements in the financial structure of firms. The project
will also strengthen the participating financial institutions, extension
services, and the policy making directorate of SECOFI.
9.        Risks.  The demand for inve'stment credit is sensitive to the
macro-economic environment, particularly to the high inflation levels and
pace of economic recovery. To minimize the dampening effect of high nominal
interest rates on credit demand the project offers, as an option, a subloan



-4-
repayment mechanism that is suitable in a high inflation environment. In
addition, the overall size of the credit component has been based on
conservative demand projections. The implementation of the financial
restructuring component could be delayed due to the reluctance of commercial
banks to participate, particularly if they perceive their own financial
sacrifice as disproportionate to that of the othor participants. To deal
with this uncertainty, the restructuring scheme Is predicated on the
principle of equal sacrifice and benefit for all participants, including
commercial banks and the entrepreneurs who would be converting a family owned
company to one with outside participation.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
