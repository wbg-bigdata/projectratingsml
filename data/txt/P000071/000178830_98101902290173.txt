THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:      People's Republic of Benin
Amount:        US$10.0 million in various currencies
Terms:         Standard
Project
Description: The project would facilitate access to the port of Cotonou
by providing for the rehabilitation of a 107 km section of
the country's main north-south road axis. The project would
also expand the highway maintenance program begun under the
two previous highway projects, including the elimination of
the backlog of bituminous and laterite roads resurfacing.
It would provide technical assistance for highway mainte-
nance and for strengthening the country's transport planning
and coordination capacity. Finally, it would include some
pre-investment studies. The major beneficiaries of vehicle
operating cost reductions would be the local truck owners
and operators, but cost reductions are expected to be passed
on to farmers in the form of higher farmgate prices. About
300,000 people live in the area influenced by the main road
and more than one million in the areas served by the other
project roads.
Estimated Costs:                                     US$ million equivalent

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Benin for the equivalent of
US$10.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highway Proj-
ect. The project would be co-financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development (US$7.0 million) and The OPEC Special Fund (US$1.6 million).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        An economic mission visited Benin recently, from September 19 to
October 7, 1977. The following paragraphs are consistent with its main
findings and incorporate the conclusions of the 1975 IMF consultation mission
report. The Bank's last economic report is dated August 20, 1973. Annex I
contains basic country data.
Past Development
2.        With a GDP per capita of only US$130, Benin is classified by the UN
as one of the world's 29 least developed countries. It is an overwhelmingly
rural nation: about 70 percent of the population is dependent on agricul-
ture which accounts for 30 percent of GDP and 90 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. Insufficient and irregular rainfall limits the production of high
value tree crops. Seventy percent of the total agricultural output consists
of subsistence low-value root crops (yams and cassava). Palm oil, cotton
and groundnuts are the country's major export crops. GDP per capita in the
rural sector is very low, averaging about US$50.
3.        Transport and commerce are the second most important activities
in Benin. The port of Cotonou has traditionally been the door to the sea
for landlocked Niger and a transit port for the western part of Nigeria.
A sizeable share of the imports of consumer goods (beverages, tobacco, radios,
etc.) and exports of agricultural products registered as Benin trade, is in
fact unofficial border trade to and from Nigeria. Due to the recent conges-
tion of the port of Lagos, the transit function of the Cotonou port has
further developed. In 19.76 it is estimated that about half of the port's
total traffic (960,000 tons) originated in or was destined for neighboring
countries (30 percent to Niger and 20 percent to Nigeria). Transport and
commerce generate about one third of Benin's GDP (at factor cost), account
for 10 percent of its foreign exchange earnings, and employ about 12,000
persons.
4.        The country has an embryonic industrial sector, and the known
mineral resources .- limestone and phospha~te - have not yet been exploited.
There are plans in the near future to start exploiting the Onigbolo lime-
stone deposit. There are also indications of the existence of oil offshore.

Political Situation and Recent Economic Development
5.        Since independence in 1960, there have been numerous changes of
Government, in part due to regional and ideological differences. A major
turning point occurred at the end of 1972 when the present military Govern-
ment came to power and established a socialist regime which took measures
aimed at decreasing foreign influence and increasing the country's self-reli-
ance. Nationalization of foreign private interests in key sectors (banking
and credit, gasoline distribution, services related to the port and industry)
took place and the various technical assistance programs were scaled down.
These measures disrupted the economy since there was an inadequate number
of Beninese to replace the departing expatriates. The situation was further
aggravated by changes in the staffing of public services which resulted in
further losses of productivity.
6.        The agricultural sector was most seriously affected by these de-
velopments. Support services, especially input distribution, deteriorated.
Furthermore, the Government's pricing and marketing policies, being mainly
guided by the Government's desire to keep the cost of living and the level
of salaries low in the urban centers, did not provide enough incentive to
the farmers. Production of most cash crops stagnated during 1974-1976 and
cotton production dropped sharply from 50,000 tons in 1972/73 to less than
20,000 tons in 1975/76. Maize production was also affected by attempts by
the Government to prohibit traditional border trade with Nigeria and by the
establishment of a state grain trading monopoly.
7.        Farmer incentives have recently been improved.   Farmgate prices
were increased to generally more satisfactory levels for the 1976/77 season
and farm inputs were distributed on time for the first time in four years.
But the farmers' response has been limited and preliminary results for the
1976/77 season are not encouraging. Low rainfall may also have contributed
to this.
8.        In the modern sector, transport and other economic activities
have been stimulated by the rapid growth of transit trade with Nigeria.
Transport was the only growing sector in Benin over the 1971-75 period. In
1976, the Government took further measures to improve the port's handling
capacity which had fallen to a low 12 tons/hour in 1975 as opposed to 23
tons/hour in 1972/73. To attract Nigerian traffic away from the congestion
at the Lagos Port, border formalities are being simplified. A project for
the expansion of the part facilities has just been appraised. The Government
of Nigeria has financed construction of a coastal expressway linking Cotonou
with the Nigerian border and is planning to build several other roads linking
the western part of Nigeria to the Benin-Niger axis.
9.        Public investment in recent years has been at a low level.    Total
gross investment is estimated to have stagnated at about US$50 million/year
over the 1971-75 period (i.e. to a low US$16 per capita compared with US$32
in neighboring Togo and US$89 in the Ivory Coast), while public investment
is estimated to have averaged about US$25 million per year, (i.e. also a low



- 3 -
US$8 per capita compared to US$27 and US$55 in Togo and the Ivory Coast re-
spectively).
10.       While the Government has not been successful recently in spurring
economic growth, it has maintained a strict financial orthodoxy. The current
budget, which was in chronic deficit during the sixties (requiring support
from France until 1970), has been in equilibrium since then, even generating
a small surplus of about 7 percent of current revenues between 1971 and 1975.
This was achieved through an austerity policy of limiting expenditures on
materials and freezing civil servants' salaries, which had not been increased
for 10 years prior to January of this year. Revenues (in real terms) in-
creased very little due to the zero growth of the economy, and recurrent
cost financing has been difficult.
11.       Benin has succeeded in maintaining the equilibrium of its balance
of payments despite the sharp deterioration of its trade balance, the deficit
of which increased to US$40 million in 1974/75 (11 percent of GDP). The
improvement of the service account, due to increased transit shipments to
Nigeria, helped to compensate for this. As of mid-1976, Benin, a member of
the West African Monetary Union, held net foreign exchange reserves of $32.6
million, equivalent to 2 months of imports.
12.       Recent trends in the agricultural sector have inevitably resulted
in a growing gap between the incomes of the urban population and the farmers,
some of whom shifted back to subsistence crops. However, the illicit trading
of food crops to Nigeria makes it difficult to assess the true cash income of
farmers.
Prospects
13.       Benin's economic prospects are for modest growth over the next
decade, with real GDP expected to rise by 3 to 5 percent per annum. A favor-
able indicator is that, with the publication of a development plan for the
period 1977-79, serious efforts are being made to relieve the stagnation of
recent years. Cooperation with Nigeria has become a major factor for Benin,
since Nigeria offers a large neighboring market and access to investment
resources. The two countries are already associated in the extension of the
Cotonou clinker grinding plant (200,000 tons) to be completed in early 1978.
Discussions are also well advanced concerning joint investment in a project to
produce 40,000 tons of refined sugar at Save for the Nigerian market; and an
expanded cement plant based upon the Onigbolo limestone deposit, producing
500,000 tons per year. The implementation of these projects could consider-
ably improve the balance of payments outlook for Benin, given adequate price
and marketing guarantees by Nigeria'.
14.       The past low level of investment in Benin has been linked to the
Government's desire to reorganize economic institutions and to staff them with
Benin nationals, prior to embarking on substantial new investments. The
recently published plan contains ambitious investment proposals totaling



- 4 -
US$1.0 billion over three years, of which three very large undertakings in
industry (Save sugar, Onigbolo cement and an oil refinery) with high capital
costs, account for half. Local financial resources are likely to remain
limited which implies that such a program would need to be largely foreign-
financed.
15.       Benin's total external debt at the end of 1975 amounted to US$160
million, including undisbursed, or about 40 percent of the country's GDP.
External public debt service amounted to about 7 percent of the country's
exports in 1975. This burden is not insignificant for Benin, considering its
present limited foreign exchange earning potential. In addition, the debt
service burden may rise appreciably if the various large-scale projects
described above were to materialize within the next several years.
16.       Given Benin's extreme poverty, modest development prospects and
difficulty in mobilizing domestic resources, foreign donors should continue
to provide aid to Benin on the softest possible terms and also to cover
a high proportion of local costs. Benin's main sources of foreign assistance
are, in addition to the Association, EDF and Canadian, French, Nigerian and US
bilateral aid.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BENIN
17.       To date the Bank Group has extended 7 credits to Benin, totalling
US $46.8 million., Three of the credits were for agriculture (28 percent of
total lending) and three for highway construction and maintenance (64 per-
cent). The seventh operation was an education project with a large rural
training component. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations in Benin as of August 31, 1977, as well as notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
18.       The Hinvi Agricultural Development Project (1969), which provided
for the construction of an oil palm mill and maize storage silos as well
as for palm plantings and food crop development was IDA's first operation
in Benin. The project has been completed satisfactorily although two con-
secutive years of drought have retarded the growth of palm trees. Yields
are expected to be 20 percent below appraisal estimates because of limited
rainfall. The Second Agricultural Credit was the Zou-Borgou Cotton Pro-
ject (1972). This operation, co-financed by FAC, aimed at expanding
cotton and food crop production in the Zou and Borgou provinces. Due to
organizational and managerial problems in the agricultural sector, insuffi-
cient producer prices and low rainfall, the project failed to achieve its
main objective, resulting in a severe setback to Benin's cotton program. A
technical assistance project to help remedy the situation and prepare for a
possible follow-up project was recently approved by the Board. It provides
financing for the services of six experts, to strengthen the institutions
concerned.



-5-
19.       The Bank Group's involvement in the transport sector in Benin
began in 1969, when the Bank acted as Executing Agency for a UNDP "Land
Transport Study". This study led to the financing of a four-year highway
maintenance project in 1970, which was completed in 1974, followed by a
Second Highway Project in 1973. Under the first project the Government
Department then responsible for maintenance was re-organized and a training
program was carried out. The Second Highway Project, co-financed by USAID,
comprises principally the reconstruction of 320 km of the Parakou-Malanville
road, Benin's most important North-South trunk road, and the continuation of
the road maintenance program. This project was completed in June, 1977 with
the help of a supplementary credit of US$9 million approved in March 1976, due
to severe cost overruns. The third highway operation, approved May 26,
1977, is a feeder roads project which provides for the construction and
maintenance of about 1,270 km of feeder roads and for the preparation of a long
term feeder road development program in support of agriculture.
20.       The first Education project, which became effective in 1976, provides
for the improvement of ongoing rural youth training programs and the construc-
tion and equipping of a skills upgrading center in Cotonou. The project also
includes a pre-investment study for a follow-up training/education project
currently under preparation.
21.       In the short term, IDA operations will focus on the development of
transport infrastructure including, in addition to the proposed project, a
project for the extension of the port of Cotonou, for the preparation of which
the Association has already advanced US$500,000 under the Project Preparation
Facility. This project will likely involve the participation of seven co-
lenders. In the medium term, depending upon the findings of the economic
mission, IDA operations will focus on development of rural areas including the
oncho-free zones and on education.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
22.       Benin's transport system consists of about 7,200 km of roads,
579 km of railways, one deep-water port of about 900,000 tons annual handling
capacity and one international airport at Cotonou. The backbone of the
system is the "Benin Route" which extends the length of Benin from the Port
of Cotonou to landlocked Niger. It comprises 440 km of the Cotonou-Parakou
railway and the Parakou-Malanville road (320 km). The Benin Route carries
most of Niger's exports and imports, generating about 10 percent of Benin's
foreign exchange earnings. Because of Niger's rapidly increasing imports
and the congestion in Lagos, Nigeria, transit traffic to these countries
has increased considerably over the last two years.
23.       Road transport is the predominant mode, carrying about 70
percent of domestic freight and 90 percent of domestic passenger traffic.
About 760 km or 10 percent of the road network are paved, and 2,600 km or
about one-third of the network are all weather-gravel roads. The remainder



of the network (3,800 km) consists of partly improved earth roads and
tracks. Statistics on the evolution of the road vehicle fleet for the
1971/76 period are not available but in 1975 12,000 vehicles were regis-
tered, reflecting a compound growth rate of 2 percent per annum since
1970.
24.       The railway is operated by the Organisation Commune Benin-Niger
(OCBN) for the governments of Niger and Benin, and forms a key segment of
the "Benin Route." In addition to the main trunk line from Cotonou to
Parakou, the railway operates two coastal lines: Cotonou-Segboroue
(eastern line, 107 km) and Cotonou-Pobe (western line, 34 km).    The
Government had originally agreed under Section 4.14 of the First Highway
Credit (No. 215-DA) to close these two lines one year after the rehabili-
tation of the roads running parallel to them, unless the Government and the
Association agreed that increasing traffic dictated otherwise. Postpone-
ment of the closure of the western line was deferred until January 1, 1976
on condition that no capital expenditures were made and operation deficits
were eliminated. However, the Government, for social reasons, has continued
limited service on this line but is not investing in it and the rates
cover marginal cost. The Government intends to extend the eastern line to
a clinker plant under construction at Onigbolo. OCBN is following a
prudent investment policy and revenues are now covering the marginal costs
of operations. To reflect this new situation the Government and the
Association have agreed to waive the provisions of Section 4.14.
25.       The port of Cotonou has now reached its maximum capacity, with
the fast growing traffic to Niger and Nigeria, handling about 960,000 tons
in 1976. A project to expand port capacity has just been appraised by the
Association and representatives from several co-financiers.
26.       The international airport of Cotonou is used by the major
carriers in the region. Interior air transport is not very significant
being limited to four flights a week to Parakou, with the possibility of
charter to other destinations. There are plans to relocate the Cotonou
airport and to modernize the one at Parakou, but considering the high cost
of these projects and the lack of financing, they are unlikely to materia-
lize in the near future.
Transport Coordination
27.       In the past, the Ministry of Transport was responsible for overall
transport planning and coordination through the Directorate of Land Trans-
port which, for lack of qualified personnel and inadequate funding, has never
played its intended role. OCBN has been the de facto land transport coordi-
nator. With the expected completion of construction in the early 1980's of a
bituminous road running parallel to the OCBN railroad over its entire length,
transport coordination will become a more important issue. The Government has
decided that the newly created Directorate of Studies and Planning (DSP) in
the Ministry of Transports would henceforth be responsible for overall trans-
port coordination and planning and would assist in the formulation of transport



policy. The proposed project would provide for technical assistance to
strengthen DSP's transport planning and coordination functions. In parallel
the Government has also agreed that DRB would employ appropriate statistical
procedures for its economic analysis of the country's road network (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 4.02 (a)).
Transport Investments
28.       Data on transport investments and their financing are hard to
obtain because of the lack of a central transport planning and data collec-
tion unit. The available data show that transport investments, excluding
railways, amounted to US$37 million equivalent in 1970/75. The highway
subsector continues to absorb the major portion, although during the 1976/80
period port investments are expected to rival road investments because of the
planned expansion of the port of Cotonou. Transport investments are financed
mainly from abroad. Besides IDA, major contributors have been Nigeria, EDF,
USAID and CCCE. The Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (France) is almost the
exclusive source of foreign financing in the air transport subsector.
Road Transport Industry
29.       The road transport industry in Benin consists of about 350 small
operators with an average of less than four trucks each. Many truckers work
most of the year on contract to OCBN for transit traffic to Niger. To handle
the growing transit traffic with Nigeria, a national transport company,
TRANSBENIN, with private and state participation was recently created. For
the national traffic, the Government has set up state owned trucking companies
in each region, and has made available to them $3.0 million for the purchase
of trucks. The creation of new companies by the Government, if not coor-
dinated and properly planned, may lead to over-capacity in the trucking
industry. The Government has agreed that DSP would study the size, components
and expansion prospects of the transport industry, and make recommendations to
maintain the balance between supply and demand in the industry (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 4.02(b)).
Highway Administration
30.       The Directorate of Roads and Bridges (DRB) of the Ministry of
Equipment is responsible for the construction and maintenance of 4,900 km
of roads. The remaining 2,300 km of unclassified feeder roads and tracks
are the responsibility of the Ministry of Interior and local authorities.
Technical work is carried out by DRB's Studies and New Works Service, its
Highway Maintenance Coordination Service and the central mechanical work-
shops in Cotonou and Parakou. At the regional level DRB is represented by
three district offices and ten subdivisions. DRB's operations were re-
organized under the two previous highway projects and its highway maintenance
capacity has been strengthened. Further technical assistance and additional
staff training would be provided under the proposed project. Under a feeder
road project which was recently approved by the Board, it was agreed that a
specialized division for feeder roads construction and maintenance would be
established in the Ministry of Equipment.



-8-
31.       Major design works and supervision of construction are performed
by foreign consultants under the supervision of DRB. Feeder roads construc-
tion is carried out by force account. There are no domestic consultants
yet, but the Government intends to strengthen the Studies and New Works
Service in the Ministry of Equipment which could become the nucleus of a small
state consulting firm.
32.       Routine maintenance of the highway network is carried out by DRB's
subdivisions and the Ministry of Interior and local authorities for feeder
roads. The Government has recently launched a campaign to encourage volun-
tary participation of the urban and rural population in road maintenance
work. Road maintenance has improved considerably, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. Under the First Highway Project (1971), maintenance program-
ming and budgeting techniques were introduced. A central equipment mainten-
ance division was created and training in equipment maintenance was begun.
Two years after the start of the project, routine maintenance interventions
had been made over more than 80 percent of the network under DRB's respon-
sibility. Under the Second Highway Project (1973), further improvements
included the planning of routine and periodic maintenance of laterite roads
and proper servicing of highway equipment. Under the proposed project, the
program for improvement of maintenance for laterite roads would be continued
and expanded to include bituminous roads. Despite this progress, the mainten-
ance program still suffers from financial and technical shortcomings which the
proposed project tries to address.
Road Development and Financing
33.       Road expenditures almost tripled between 1970 and 1975 from US$4
million to US$11 million, and more than doubled (US$24 million) in 1976
with the construction of a coastal link with Lagos and the Parakou Malanville
road. On the other hand, road maintenance expenditures have declined from US
$400 per km of major road in 1972 to an average of US $340 during the period
1973-75, at a time when costs rose considerably.
34.       Over the next three years, Benin's development plan calls for
allocating about 10-15 percent of total public investment to highway infra-
structure, averaging some US$30 million per year. These investments will
include a new bridge at Cotonou to replace the existing one (US$10 million),
and the paving of the first segment of the Bohicon-Parakou road (US$17 mil-
lion) and other works. The Government's commitments for counterpart funds for
these road projects will total about $2.5 million per year until 1979.
Ideally, the Government should allocate something like $5.0 million per year
to maintaining the present road network. But this target is unrealistic in
the short to medium term in the light of the commitments for road construction
and the other constraints on the availability of government resources for this
type of expenditure. The Government and the Association have therefore
agreed on an annual budget allocation for highway maintenance increasing
from US $3.0 million in 1978 to US $3.7 million in 1980. Thereafter, the
Government has agreed to maintain or adjust its road maintenance alloca-
tions as shall be necessary to meet road maintenance requirements (Development



- 9 -
Credit Agreement Section 4.04 (b)). This increasing funding level could come
from higher budgetary contributions, or increases in fuel or road user taxes.
It is understood that all these options would be considered and discussed with
the Association.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project" - People's
Republic of Benin (N   1506-BEN) and dated October 25, 1977 is being circulated
separately. The proposed project evolved from the Dahomey Land Transport
Survey of 1969 which was financed by UNDP with the Bank acting as executing
agency. An appraisal mission visited Benin in July and again in December
1976. Negotiations were held in Washington in August 1977. The Beninese
delegation was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Rodriguez, Minister of
Equipment.
Project Description
36.       The proposed project would comprise:
(a) rehabilitation of the Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey road
(107 km), including detailed engineering and super-
vision of construction;
(b) resurfacing of about 195 km of bituminous roads;
(c) resurfacing of about 273 km of laterite roads;
(d) strengthening of the ongoing routine maintenance program
through the purchase of equipment and spare parts.
(e)  technical assistance and fellowships to the DRB in
the Ministry of Equipment for the preparation of
the maintenance elements of the project, for staff
training and strengthening of road maintenance
planning, and for assistance to the DSP in the
Ministry of Transport; and
(f)  preinvestment-study of the Ouidah-Allada road (40 km).
Implementation is scheduled to start at the beginning of 1978 and to be com-
pleted by 1980.
37.       The Godomey-Bohicon road is a part of the main north-south artery
originally constructed between 1961 and 1966 as a low standard one lane road.
The road, which carries between 500 and 1,200 vehicles per day, has now badly
deteriorated. It would receive a double 'surface treatment and drainage struc-
tures would be rehabilitated.



- 10 -
38.       The bituminous and laterite roads resurfacing programs would help
eliminate a substantial maintenance backlog. The roads selected for resur-
facing have been in service over six years or more and have never received
a surface treatment or a new laterite layer.
39.       The use of equipment procured under the two previous highway proj-
ects was significantly curtailed by the lack of spare parts and repair facil-
ities. Under the proposed project, the stock of spare parts of the central
mechanical workshops in Cotonou and Parakou would be increased from 3 percent
to 12 percent of the replacement value of the equipment, and some additional
essential pieces of equipment would also be procured. The Government has
agreed to ensure that an adequate stock accounting system, acceptable to the
Association, is established for the workshops by December 1979 (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 4.05).
40.       Technical assistance to the Ministry of Equipment would consist of
the provision of 55 man-months of services by two highway engineers and a
mechanical expert to assist the DRB, including planning and monitoring re-
current and periodic maintenance operations and preparing a comprehensive
program for staff training. Technical assistance to the Ministry of Transport
would consist of the provision of 30 man-months of the services of transport
specialists (an economist and an engineer) to help reorganize the Directorate
of Studies and Planning and to widen the scope of its activities to include
data collection, coordination of all modes of transport, and formulation of
transport policy. All consultants would be selected in agreement with the
Association (Development Credit Agreement, Sections 3.02 and 3.03).
41.       A pre-investment study would be undertaken of the Ouidah-Allada
road which is expected to carry about 200 vehicles per day. Maintenance
costs are high on this road and the Government proposes improving it to
paved standards. Terms of reference for this study have been agreed with
the Government.
Implementation
42.       The Directorate of Roads and Bridges of the Ministry of Equipment
would be responsible for the execution of the project, except for the tech-
nical assistance for the Directorate of Studies and Planning which would be
the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport. The Government would appoint
an agent who would be in charge of monitoring the project and making quarterly
reports to the Association (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.08).
Particular emphasis would be given to the appointment and training of counter-
part staff (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.04).
Project Costs and Financing
43.       The total cost of the project, excluding taxes and duties, is
estimated at US$21.3 million, including contingencies. The foreign exchange
component would be about US$17 million (80 percent). Cost estimates are
based on mid-1977 prices. The Kuwait Fund ($7.0 million) and The OPEC Special



- 11 -
Fund (US$1.6 million) are expected to provide parallel financing for the
Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey road (total cost US$10.3 million), with the Government
contributing the balance (US$1.7 million). The remaining elements of the
Project would be financed by an IDA contribution of US$10.0 million, equi-
valent to 47 percent of total project costs, or 90 percent of the costs of the
project elements financed. The balance of 10 percent (ie $1.0 million) would
be financed by the Government. The IDA Credit would cover US$9 million in
foreign exchange costs and US$1.0 million in local costs. Government contri-
bution to total project financing would be US$2.7 million or 13 percent of
total project costs.
Procurement
44.       The bituminous road maintenance work would be divided into several
operations. Shoulder clearing and drainage rehabilitation (US$1.0 million)
would be executed by force account. Road patching operations (US$0.2 mil-
lion) would also be carried out by force account by a special unit to
be set up in DRB. The application of a single or double surface treatment
on about 195 km of road (US$3.9 million) would be executed by contractors
selected on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank Group guidelines. The resurfacing would be done after completion
of the force account works on individual road sections and in accordance
with a work schedule agreed upon by the Government and the Association
(Development Credit Agreement Section 4.06). Resurfacing of 273 km of
laterite roads (US$1.9 million) would be carried out by force account by
two road maintenance brigades to be reactivated under the proposed project.
The bulk of equipment and spare parts for the resurfacing brigades and work-
shops (about US$2.4 million) would be procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding and in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. In bid
evaluation due consideration would be given to matching new with existing
equipment and to the after-sale servicing offered. Procurement of items
costing less than US$50,000 for the construction of DSP's office space in
Cotonou and for spare parts up to a maximum of $100,000 may be done on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Association. Items costiag under US$10,000, including
office furniture and equipment, small tools, etc., may be procured on the
basis of quotations obtained locally; the total amount of such purchases
should not exceed US$200,000. Disbursements for force account work would be
against certificates of expenditures with supporting documentation retained by
the executing agency and made available to supervision missions. Consultants
for the technical assistance program and for the pre-investment studies would
be selected following Bank Group guidelines. The billing rate for consultant
services is estimated to average US $6,500 per field man-month including
salaries, overheads-and fees. Reimbursable expenses payable to consultants
are estimated to average US $2,500 per field man-month. Procurement for civil
works for the rehabilitation of the Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey road would be done
in accordance with the procedures of the financing agencies concerned.



- 12 -
Disbursement
45.       The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover:
(i) 92 percent of total expenditures for resurfacing of
bituminous and laterite roads;
(ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of
local expenditures for equipment, spare parts and materials
for the maintenance program; and
(iii) 90 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance,
fellowships and consultant services.
Disbursements would include about US$300,000 in retroactive financing for
consultant services for detailed engineering of the Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey
road and preparation of the maintenance elements of the proposed project.
In view of Benin's present poor liquidity situation and in order to avoid
delays in project implementation, it is proposed that IDA make an advance
payment of US$250,000 to the Government as part of the Association's contri-
bution to project financing. These funds would be deposited in a special
account and disbursed against eligible expenditures under terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Association.
Justification and Benefits
46.       The first objective of the proposed project would be to preserve
and rehabilitate the most trafficked south-north road in the country. The
second objective would be to eliminate the backlog of periodic maintenance
on bituminous and laterite roads. A third objective would be for further
overall improvement of the ongoing routine maintenance effort.
47.       The rehabilitation of the Godomey-Bohicon-Abomey road, the main-
tenance of the bituminous roads and the maintenance of the laterite roads
have been analyzed separately, giving on the basis of savings in transport
costs only the following economic rates of return: 35, 155 and 54 percent
respectively. These rates are high but not unusual for maintenance projects,
in which relatively modest outlays enable the recouping of substantial and
otherwise foregone transport benefits accruing to an existing facility. The
overall economic rate of return on these three project components is expected
to be about 75 percent. The economic rate of return is only moderately
sensitive to variations in costs and/or benefits.
48.       The major beneficiaries of vehicle operating cost reductions would
be the local truck owners and operators, but cost reductions are expected
to be passed on to farmers in the form of higher farmgate prices. About
300,000 people live in the area influenced by the Godomey-Abomey road and
more than one million (or one-third of the country's total population), in
the areas served by the other project roads.
49.       The technical assistance aspects of the project would also contri-
bute to the institution building effort in sectoral management which was
initiated under the First Highway Project. The aim is to develop the capacity



- 13 -
of the DRB in the Ministry of Equipment and the DSP in the Ministry of Trans-
port to plan and carry out highway maintenance programs, to evaluate and
coordinate transport investment proposals and to formulate sound policies.
50.       There are no special risks attached to the construction of the
Godomey-Bohicon road. For the maintenance element the main risk is that
the work would be impeded either by further difficulties in the timely
provision of adequate funds to the Road Maintenance Fund, or by frequent
changes in personnel. There is little risk that the benefits would accrue
when the work is done.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Benin and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of
the Association and the draft resolution approving the proposed Develop-
ment Credit, are being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
52.       The following events are specified as additional conditions of
effectiveness: that all the conditions of effectiveness of the Kuwait Fund
Loan Agreement and of The OPEC Fund Loan Agreement, with the exception of the
effectiveness of the Development Credit Agreement, have been fulfilled;
and that the Special Account shall have been opened as provided in Section
2.02 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement. Features of the draft Devel-
opment Credit Agreement of special interest are referred to in Section III
of Annex III.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

B. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 307     Zou-Borgou Cotton Project; US$6.1 million Credit of
May 24, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
The Project was to comprise the provision of staff and equipment
to the National Agricultural Society for Cotton (SONACO) to administer agri-
cultural extension, credit and primary marketing services; the establishment
of a revolving fund to supply credit to cotton growers; construction of two
cotton ginneries; rehabilitation of 620 km of feeder roads; applied research;
and a feasibility study for agricultural diversification in the project area.
The project initially reached appraisal production estimates (42,000 tons of
cotton in 1973), but production has fallen considerably in the past three
years (17,600 tons in 1975/76). This was due to a combination of deficien-
cies in project management, input supply and extension services, unfavorable
Government pricing policy and unfavorable climatic conditions. Since cotton
production never reached the expected level, only one ginnery was built in-
stead of two as provided under the credit.   The other components of the proj-
ect were implemented more successfully, although because of cost overruns,
the feeder roads construction program had to be reduced from 620 km to 425 km.
A non quantifiable but important benefit of the project has been the organi-
zation of effective farmers groups which have demonstrated their ability to
handle primary cotton marketing, to organize the distribution of farm inputs,
to market household items and to invest their savings in rural community dev-
elopment (schools, wells, dispensaries). The project has also been successful
in expanding production of rice and hybrid maize and introducing ox-drawn
cultivation.
Credit No. 415     Second Highway Project; US$11.8 million Credit of
July 3, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to inflation and currency realignments, project cost estimates
increased to US$23.2 million or 77 percent above the original cost estimates.
The Association provided a supplementary credit of US$9.0 million on March 10,
1976, which became effective on October 5, 1976. All contracts for improve-
ment of the southern section (151 km) of the Parakou-Malanville road and two
sections (20 km) of the Godomey-Bohicon road, as well as for consultants' ser-
vices for supervision of construction and for technical assistance have been
awarded. Construction of the Southern section of the Parakou-Malanville road
was successfully completed in June 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 583     Rural Education and Training Project; US$4.0 million
Credit of September 5, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project consists of two main components: (i) buildings and
equipment for a skills upgrading center in Cotonou; and (ii) technical assis-
tance, buildings and equipment for an ongoing rural youth training program.
The project is proceeding well, about on schedule despite some delays in
declaring the credit effective. Bids for buildings and equipment have been
called. Tenders are expected to be returned by June 1977. The technical
assistance team is being recruited. The chief of the skills upgrading cen-
ter has taken post and the one for the rural youth training program will do
the same in December, 1977.
