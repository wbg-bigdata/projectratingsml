                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project Development Objective is to generate temporal employment and rehabilitate irrigation and drainage infrastructure in selected districts in the Khatlon Oblast as a means to
                         increase household food security. Food security will be increased directly in the short-term through the income earned by food insecure households from public works (food access),
                         in the medium-term through increased crop production as a result of improved irrigation and drainage (food availability), and in the long-term through the projects contribution to

                         improving water resource management policies. Despite the extremely limited (less than one year) time-period for project implementation, the key objectives of the project, as
                         specified in the PAD, have been substantially achieved. The public works program implemented in the 5 project districts provided temporary employment for 10,528 people.
                         Preliminary results from the Project Impact Assessment indicate that participants in this work had average net earnings of approximately US$230/beneficiary; and that the associated
                         renovation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure raised the income of an estimated 43,300 households in the project area. These preliminary results also show that 74% of

                         households report higher crop yields, and 82% report improved access to drinking water. The head of the government Working Group responsible for guiding Water Sector Reform
                         reported that the initial output of the TA component for Water Basin Management has already made a tangible contribution to water sector reform through its work on: the delineation
                         of river basin boundaries, implementation of the inventory for irrigation assets, training and institutional reform. These achievements represent substantial progress towards
                         accomplishment of the projectÃ¢➂?➂ s outcome indicators: (i) jobs created by the project; (ii) amount of cash transferred to project beneficiaries; (iii) number of households with
                         increased income, and (iv) preparation of proposals for the introduction of Water Basin Management (WBM) scheme. In view of the above, the PDO status has been rated as
                         Satisfactory.

                         Overall the project has made considerable progress and most of major project activities have been implemented. As of today 96% of public works have been completed in 32 jamoats
                         (municipalities) and about 94% of beneficiaries received their payments. All planned contracts (15) for the projects mechanized works have been issued and works have started
                         under 13 contracts with a completion rate of about 76% of total volume of works envisaged for cleaning of drainage and collector canals. The rehabilitation of outlet gates and pump
                         stations is also proceeding with 125 outlet gates and about 58% of works for rehabilitation of pump stations completed. The PMU has also procured the earth moving equipment, and
                         it is expected to be delivered to Tajikistan by December 20, 2011. Under the second component (technical assistance), the BETS Consulting Services prepared and submitted a
                         comprehensive interim report, on schedule, for review by the PMU and Government➂ s working group on Water Sector Reform. 84% of the total project amount of US$10 million has
                         been disbursed to date (with reference to Client Connection as of December 5, 2011).
