INLAND WATERWAYS AND COASTAL PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 1889-TH)
This is the -roject Completion Report (PCR) for the Inland Waterways
and Coastal Ports Projec. in Thailand, for which Loan 1889-TH in the amount of
US$ million was approved on July 8, 1980. The loan was closed on March 31,
1989, 4 1/4 years behind schedule. Disbursements under the loan totalled
US$39.662 million, and the final disbursement was made on April 13, 1988, at
which time US$2.038 million was cancelled, US$11.3 million having been
previously cancelled on February 17, 1987.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Division, Country
Department II of the Asia Regional Office (pages 1 to xxiii) and the Borrower (pages
1 to 39) and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR); the Loan
Agreement; supervision reports; the Borrower's own records; correspondence between
the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bsak memoranda.
The PCR was read by the Oper2'tions Evaluation Department (OED). The
draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for -ow-n   and they are attached to the
Report (Attachment 1).

PROJECT COMPLETION RPR
THAILAND
INLAND WATERWAYS AND COASTAL PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 1882-TH)
EVALUATION  UME
Objectives
The objective of the Inland Waterways and Coastal Ports Project was to
develop the inland waterways system with the aims of reducing the trrAqsport
component of the cost of exports by using a more energy-etficient mean- of
transport and to stabilize the enormous costs of road maintenance (Overview para
2.1). The major components of the project aimed to:
(a) improve the inland waterways system, so that it could function as
a major carrier of import and export commodities throughout the year for the
central and northern regions;
(b) improve channel maintenance of all coastal ports and undertake
capital dredging for two of the more important ports, so that loss of ship time
in waiting for tides would be reduced and larger vessels could navigate the
channels; and
(c) strengthen the capability of the HD to perform its development and
maintenance functions for the inland waterways and coastal ports.
&mlmRentation 1=2rience
The Inland Waterways and Coastal Ports project was appraised in
November 1979 and the loan became effective in December 1980. The Bank Loan
(1889-TH) for the project amounted to US$53.0 million but, as a result of the
deletion of three dredgers from the project, only US$39.7 million w2s disbursed;
a total of US$13.3 million was cancelled.
The components of the project (Overview paras 2.3 and 2.5) to be
financed under the loan consisted of, for the Inland Waterways, (a) dredging a
channel through each of the shoal areas on the upper and lower sections of the
Chao Phraya and Nan rivers; (b) constructing river training works to help
concentrate the available dry season flow in the reduced width of the river,
thus scouring out the new channel and reducing the maintenance dredging
required; (c) constructing river ports at Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin; (d)
procuring a demonstration set of four steel barges and one pusher tug, and
maintenance dredging equipment comprising three cutter suction dredgers; (e)
providing engineering services for final engineering of the Nan River works,
procurement of equipment and supervision of contracts; and (f) providing
technical assistance and training to strengthen the HD.
The Coastal Ports component of the project included (a) dredging the
entrance channel of the port at Bandon to a depth of 4 m; (b) dredging the



vi
entrance channel of the port of Pattani to a depth of 2.5 m; (c) carrying out
geophysical and hydrographic studies of these channels; (4) procuring a shallow
draft self-propelled trailing suction hopper dredger for maintenance; (e)
providlng engineering services for final engineering, bid evaluation and
supervision of contracts; and (f) providing technical assistance and training
for the HD.
The project started quite well with contractor prequalification
documents being distributed at the time of loan negotiations, and consultants
for both components being appointed a month or two ahead of schedule (Overview
Table 1). Progress then stalled (Overview para 4.2) and momentum was lost, so
that the first river works contract, for the Chao Phraya, was signed nearly i5
months late. The Nan River contract was signed over 32 months late, and that
for the coastal ports dredging contract was 36 months late. The equipment
procurement and river port contracts suffered even more, being from 40 to 79
months behind schedule, finishing only a few days before the loan eventually
closed on April 30, 1989. Technical assistance and training components suffered
equally badly. HD was reorganized to form separate Dredging and Maintenance
Divisions for Inland Waterways and Coastal Ports, but the manpower required to
fill these organizations was not forthcoming for several years. In-house
training by consultantr was often poorlv ttended and the overseas training of
staff is still in progress.
The main reasons for the delayed implementation (Overview para 4.2)
were (a) very slow processing and approval of tender documents, bid evaluations
and contract awards; (b) slow land acquisition procedures; and (c) a lack of
cot.tinuity of Bank staff responsible for the project.
Results
Because of the lack of maintenance afforded to the completed sections
of the rivers (Overview para 5.4), barge owners deemed it was too dangerous to
use the improved waterways and traffic in the project area has remained low,
contrary to expectations. Traffic through the coastal ports does not appear to
have increased to any appreciable extent (Overview para 5.2). The overall
economic rate of return is estimated at 6% compared with 20% at the time of
appraisal.
Sustainabilui
The project has not yet realized its potential benefits and it is
important that the Government does not view the inland waterway and coastal
ports sectors as being incapable of providing benefits to the economy (Overview
par"s 6.1 to 6.3), but these benefits will not be felt for many years, and
considerably later than expected during appraisal. Operator confidence in the
waterway system and in the financial benefits of using different technology and
the marketing of the coastal ports are the keys to eventual success.
The main risks of lack of eventual success can be addre.5sed by the
provision of a realistic maintenance budget and by further training and manpower
reforms to ensure a satisfactorj level of competence throughout the institution
to carry out effective waterway and coastal port management.



vii
idis and Leaonis
The main objectives of the Inland Waterways and Coastal Ports Project
have not yet been achieved, but the Government is now more aware of the
potential of the inland waterways to provide significant cost savings sad this
is to be addressed in the proposed Second Inland Waterway Project now under
consideration.
The Bank learned some valuable lessons (Overview para 7.3) on project
preparation and staff continuity, particularly where weak institutions are
involved. The Borrower also learned (Overview para 8.3) that it must support
the weaker institutions, particularly those resporsible for important sectors of
the economy or infrastructure, by ensuring that training is fully implemented
and by using appropriate expertise (foreign if necessary) to work alongside
government staff to help them develop the operational and maintenance systems
that are essential to keep an investment effective.

PRtOJECTION REPORT
THAILAND
INLAND WATERWAYS AND COASTAL PORTS PROJECT
(LOMA 1889-TH)
1.1 The Transnort Sector. Since the mid-1960s, the Thai economy has been
growing at a rapid pace, generating a high demand for transport. During the
1970s, when Loan 1889-TH was being prepared, freight traffic was growing at
about 8% p.a. and passenger traffic at about 12% p.a. Overall freight traffic
in the late 1970s totalled some 5C million tons and 14 billion ton-km p.a.,
about 70% of which (in ton-km) was carried by road, 20% by rail and 10% by
inland waterways.  Government responded to this increase in traffic wiW  large
investments, mostly in roadworks, and liberal transport policies which
stimulated a competitive road transport industry. By 1980, virtually the entire
primary (national) roads system serving interprovincial trade was complete, and
significant progress had been made towards the improvement of the secondary
(provinuial) system. Railways, inland waterways and coastal shipping, confined
to specific corridors or locations and handling mostly bulk commodities, also
grew, but at a modest rate.
1.2   Sector Develo ment. With the progress made in developing primary and
secondary roads, future transport requirements shifted towards (a) development
of the tertiary road system in support of the needs of rural communities;
(b) the upgrading of the performance of other modes of transport; and (c) the
removal of specific capacity bottlenecks in the national transport system such
as the Port of Bangkok. Tertiary roads were under-4eveloped and inadequately
maintained, while the railways, inland waterways and coastal shipping, for their
part, performed at below attainable output and efficiency levels, and their
capacity for energy-efficient transport was underutilized. The Port of Bangkok
was expected to be critically congested by the eariy 1980s.
1.3   Traffic.  The direction, composition and size of the traffic flows for
each of the modes of transport reflected the country's generally rural
character, the agricultural strength of the Central Region and Bangkok;s central
location and dominance as the country's principal port and consumption center.
30-50% of all freight was agricultural produce, of which about one half was
*scported, most of it through the Port of Bangkok and the eastern seaboard
loading facilities.
1.4 Transoort Plarming. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (NOTC)
is responsible for transport policy, coordination and planning. During the
Third and Fourth Five-Year Plans (1972-81) public sector investment in transport
was about B 49 billion of which 80% was devoted to roads. In 1980, it was
expected that transport invertment for the period 1982-86 would still



ix
concentrate on roads, but, given the worsenlng energy situation, that more
attention would be pald to the development of energy-efficient modes, such as
railways, inland waterways and coastal shipping.
1.5 Inland waterways. Thailand has a comprehensive and developed inland
waterways system which covers well over one-third of the country and extends
over some 1,300 km of navigable waterways. Most of this length is in the
Northern Corridor between Bangkok and Uttaradit along the rivers which serve the
central plAin, principally the Chao Phraya and Nan. The remainder is along the
Mekong river on the Thai-Laotian border. Ease of navigation on these rivers is
asiasonally influenced, with water levels rising in May with the arrival of the
monsoon, reaching a peak in August or September. After the end of the wet
season in October water levels decline to December and remain low for the
remainder of the dry season. These influences are to some extent modified by a
system of irrigation canala and single or multi-purpose dams. In 1980, more
than 100 larger terminals and a greater number of minor loading facilities were
located along the waterways. Their density is highest near population centers
and major sources of agricultural products. All are privately owned and
operated and most handle only one commodity. Two of the larger existing loading
points on the Chao Phraya-Nan system are Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin. Their
capacity, however, was inadequate to handle the expected traffic increase
resulting from the improvement of the waterways.
1.6 Waterwan Traffic. In 1976, barge traffic in the entire Northern Corridor
totalled about 8.6 million tons, of which 6 million tons were sand, 1.3 million
tons were rice, maize and other crops and 0.7 million tons were cement. Average
barge haul was 200 km. Ihailand's inland waterways transport industry was, and
is, highly competitive and free from regulation. The barge fleet consisted of
about 4,000 units with capacities of between 40 and over 300 deadweight tons
(dwt) with a total capacity of 350,000 dwt. There were also about 2,000-3,000
sr4ller units. The barges were of traditional design, those below 100 dwt
capacity were made of wood, whereas the larger vessels were steel hulled. All
barges were moved by tugs pulling a train of up to about 8 units, which
necessitates the barges being crewed.
1.7   Coastal  Ports.  Despite the improvements in land transport, coastal ports
and shipping remained essential parts of the transport and economic system,
especially in Southern Thailand. There are about 40 shallow draft seaports and
inlets ranging from small fishing and cargo wharves of purely local importance
to larger regional ports with annual volumes of several hundred thousand tons of
cargo. Most of these ports are located on the southern peninsula and are owned
and managed by local governments or private operators. These ports also serve
as bases for the marine fishing industry on which the economic well-being of
coastal communities depends. About 2.5 million tons of cargo and petroleum
products and over 1 million tons of fish were annually loaded or discharged at
these ports. The shallow depth of the port access channels was, and still is,
the principal constraint under which coastal shipping operated.
1.8   Harbour Department.  The agency responsible for the management of all
inland waterways and coastal ports is the Harbour Department (HD) of MOTC. It
has never been a strong organization, has little independence (unlike the Port
Authority of Thailand) and its limited budgetary and manpower allocations did



x
not enable it effectively to manage and maintain the inland waterways and
coastal ports for which it was responsible.
2.    Proleee Obiectives and Description
2.1   Project Objectives.  Having, in the past, concentrated largely on roads to
develop the transport system required for the rapidly growing national economy,
the Government decided, at the end of the 19708 to give closer attention to
other transport modes, which had potential for development, with the ultimate
aim of reducing the transport component of the cost of exports by using more
energy-efficient methods of transport and of stabilizing the enormous costs of
road maintenance. The main objectives of Loan 1889-TH were to (A) improve the
inland waterways system, so that it could function as a major co:rier of import
and export commodities throughout the year for the central and northern regions;
(b) improve channel maintenance of all coastal ports and undertake capital
dredging for two of the more important ports, so that loss of ship time in
waiting for tides would be reduced and larger vesseis could navigate the
channels; and (c) strengthen the capability of the HD to perform its development
and maintenance functions for the inland waterways and coastal ports.
DescriRtion of the Project
2.2  Inland Waterways. During the dry season, partly because of excessive sand
dredging, parts of the Chao Phraya river upstream of Bangkok became so shallow
as to be virtually impassable, especially below the Chainat Dam. As a result,
barge traffic was forced to reduce payloads, or bypass the lower Chao Phraya on
slow and more costly routes along the Noi and Tha Chin rivers, or cease
operations. There is no bypass to the upper Chao Phraya and Nan rivers and
traffic was therefore severely affected on these sections. Large quantities of
agricultural bulk commodities, which are better suited to barge traffic, had to
be carried by road.
2.3   The Inland Waterways component of the project included (a) dredging a
channel 40 m wide and 2.2 m deep (1.7 m available depth) through each of the
shoal areas on the upper and lower sections of the Chao Phraya and Nan rivers;
(b) constructing river training works comprising bottom panels and/or groins and
low dikes at each of the dredged shoal areas to help concentrate the available
dry season flow in the reduced width of the river, thus scouring out the new
channel and reducing the maintenance dredging required; (c) constructing river
ports at Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin with both alongside and dolphin type
berths, cargo handling facilities, mechanical equipment and survey and
miscellaneous mai-tenance equipment; (d) procuring a demonstration set of four
700 ton, 45 m steol barges and one 550 hp pusher tug, maintenance dredging
equipment comprising three cutter suction dredgers complete with floating
delivery pipes and three attendant tugs; (e) providing engineering services for
final engineering of the Nan River works, procurement of equipment and
supervision of contracts; and (f) providing technical assistance and training to
strengthen the HD.
2.4   Coastal Ports.  To have provided deeper access channels for the majority
of the 40 coastal ports, besides resulting in a huge quantity of capital



xi
dredging and an insupportable maintenance load for HD, such an undertaking was
totally unjustified on the basis of the traffic using the ports. Only a few
handled an appreciable level of traffic and 8ost of these were eliminated as
being uneconomic or because their traffic forecasts were adversely affected by
the proposed construction of the two major regional ports at Songkhla and
Phuket.
2.5   The Coastal Ports component of the project included (a) dredging the
entrance channel of the port at Bandon to a depth of 4 m at low water ordinary
spring tide (LWOST) with a channel 60 m wide and 20 km long; (b) dredging the
entrance channel of the port of Pattani to a depth of 2.5 m at LWOST with a
channel 60 m wide and 5 km long; (c) carrying out geophysical and hydrographic
studies of the channels at Bandon and Pattani including borings and tracer
studies to determine dumping areas for dredged soil; (d) procuring a shallow
draft (2 m), 400 m3 capacity, self-propelled trailing suction hopper dredger for
maintenance; (e) providing engineering services for final engineering, bid
evaluation and supervision of contracts; and (f) providing technical assistance
and training for the HD.
3.    Proiect Design and Oreanization
3.1   Although Thailand had developed a comprehensive and efficient transport
system based on the extensive construction of roads and the encouragement of the
trucking industry, it was was becoming apparent, in the late 1970s, that, given
the rapid rise in fuel costs and the huge highway maintenance load being imposed
by an ever-increasing number of (frequently overloaded) trucks, close attention
would have to be paid to more energy-efficient methods of transport, which had
been somewhat neglected in recent years. The concept, therefore, of improving
the capacity and efficiency of the inland waterway system and of encouraging
coastal shipping, was fully in line with Government thinking and the Bank's
objectives of increasing a nation's competitiveness by the reduction of
transport costs for its principal exports and of preserving the environment
through a reduction in energy consumption.
3.2   A Bank mission identified a possible project in April 1973 when a combined
Inland Waterway and Port Project was being considered, but interest waned until
it was resurrected in April 1976. A number of missions followed during the
ensuing three years leading up to appraisal, with the coastal ports element
being introduced in November 1977 to supplement the inland waterway and
deep-water port (Bangkok and Sattahip) components. The project was appraised in
November 1979, but before negotiations in Nay 1980, the inland waterways and
coastal ports components were separated from the Bangkok and Sattahip ports
component and they became separate projects. A loan for US$53 million was
approved by the Board on July 8, 1980.
3.3  The project was prepared by the HD with the assistance of its consultants
financed under the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1519-TH). The French and
Australian consultants undertook feasibility studies on the respective
components during 1979, and although not all recomendations put forward were
adopted, there was agreement on the project components by all involved parties.



xii
Preparation vas thorough, despite the lack of up-to-date statistics on barge
traffic and the concept of training long lengths of the Chao Phraya River was
innovative in a country where river transport had traditionally been a seasonal
activity ruled by the monsoonal climate. These works were, however, soundly
designed using accepted training techniques well within the experience of the
responsible consultants, so the unsatisfactory outcome of the project cannot be
attributed to any shortfall in its design except as discussed below (para 6.3).
The project implementation schedule, which was put forward by HD and its
consultants, and adopted in the appraisal report, did turn out to be optimistic
as discussed below (para 5.2).
3.4   This was the first Bank project undertaken by the HD and it waz realised
from the outset that HD's inherent institutional weakness and lack of experience
in managing such projects would require the close attention of the Bank's
project officer. Though roles and responsibilities were clearly defined, these
defects in the organization were contributory factors in the slow implementation
of the project.
4.    Prolect Imlementation
4.1   The project started quite well with contractor prequalification documents
being distributed in May 1980, at the time of loan negotiations, and consultants
for both components being appointed in October and November 1980, a month or two
ahead of schedule (see Table 1). Progress then stalled (para 5.2) and momentum
was lost, so that the first river works contract, for the Chao Phraya, was not
signed until February 1982, nearly 15 months late. The Nan River contract was
not signed until June 1985, over 32 months late, and that for the coastal ports
dredging contract until October 1984, 36 months late. The equipment procurement
and river port contracts suffered even more, being from 40 to 79 months behind
schedule, finishing only a few days before the loan eventually closed on April
30, 1989. Technical assistance and training components suffered equa-ly badly.
HD was reorganized to form separate Dredging and Maintenance Divisions for
Inland Waterways and Coastal Ports, but tile manpower required to fill these
organizations was not forthcoming for several years. In-house training by
consultants was often poorly attended and the overseas training of staff is
still in progress with completion scheduled for July 1989.
4.2   One of the main reasons for the delayed implementation was the very sjlo
2rocessing and approval of tender documents. bid evaluations and contract awards
as compared to that expected at appraisal. This was aggravated at one stage by
the necessity to resolve differences between the Bank's Procurement Guidelines
and those produced by the Ministry of Finance (KOF) for use on Bank funded
projects, and by a disagreement within Government itself over the contents of
the MOF's standard bidding documents based on their guidelines. In addition,
land acquisition for the river ports proved to be a far lengthier process than
had been forecast, taking several years in each case. A lack of continuity of
Bank staff reaDonsible for the project was also a contributory factor (see para
8.1 below, also PCR for Loan 1918-TH, dated June 30, 1988, which ran in parallel
with Loan 1889-TH), as historical perspective and institutional memory were lost
and decisions and findings arising out of one supervision mission were not
necessarily followed up during the next.



xiii
5.    proiect Reaults
5.1   At the time of writing, although some of the works were completed over
three years ago (Table 1), the inland waterways component of the project appears
to have had little impact on the growth of barge traffic or on the reduction of
transport costs within the northern corridor. For the reasons discussed below,
fever barges than expected are using the lower Chao Phraya, especially during
the flood season, which is normally the most popular time to navigate that part
of the river, many preferring instead to continue using the slow, narrow and
heavily locked Noi and Tha Chin rivers. All the civil works, especially the
port works have been completed to a good standard. The total cost of the inland
waterway component was about US$48.4 million (Table 2) which is about 24% less
than the appraisal estimate. The design of the river training works was
modified during construction, at no cost to the Borrower, to incorporate the
latest technology and post-construction surveys have shown that their design has
been effective in keeping the channels scoured out, dredging requirements being
25% less than predicted. Procurement of the equipment has been completed, but
little of it has yet been put into service. The three cutter suction dredgers
were taken out of the project when the Government received an offer from KfW
(West Germany) to finance them. There is still no firm delivery date for these
dredgers and the lack of them is having a serious effect on the annual
maintenance program, with the result that the newly dredged channels, though
silting up less rapidly than expected are not kept at their design depth and
some users have had trouble negotiating the river even with a draft of less than
1.7 m.  During the project, a floating pile-driving rig was added to the scope
of supply of maintenance equipment to meet a need for such equipment within HD.
The ports and the demonstration barge train have not yet been leased to private
operators, because Nakhon Sawan port has no water supply becau e of delays by
the local water authority, and Taphan Hin port and the Barge Train have only
recently been completed. The new maintenance division in HD is more effective
than the original combined division, but the training was not very effective and
is not yet showing results.
5.2 Most of the elements of the coastal ports component were completed over 3
years ago (Table 1). The total cost was about US$12.7 million (Table 2), which
is about 31% less than the appraisal estimate. From the scant data available,
it appears that traffic at the more important of the two ports, Bandon, has
increased roughly in line with the lower estimate of the appraisal report, due
perhaps, in part, to completion being some 3 years late. The trailing suction
hopper dredger was delivered 42 months late, but has now been in service for
more than 3 years. As in the case of the inland waterways, the new coastal
ports maintenance division has not yet realised the potential expected from the
training, some of which is still in progress.
5.3   As a result of lower than expected bid prices, the deletion of the cutter-
suction dredgers and a 25% change in the exchange rate, a total of about US$13.3
million, or about 25% of the total, was cancelled out of the loan amount of
US$53 million (Table 3). The final contributions of both IBRD and the
Government were about 75% of those planned in the Loan Agreement.



xiv
5.4   The design for the river training works on the Chao Phraya and Nan rivers
involved the use of groins, bottom panels and low dikes, which were constructed
of a core of steel beams driven into the river bed with vertical concrete panels
spanning between them, the groins then being surrounded by dredged soil and
quarry-run rock to stabilize them against the fast currents of the wet season.
Buoys were positioned at each structure to clearly locate them and to mark the
navigable channel. A large number of marker buoys were quickly lost, largely
because their design allowed weed to accumulate on them, which eventually
overloaded the mooring and they broke loose. Also their boat-like design (aimed
at reducing drag in fast currents) and fibreglass construction was attractive to
the local populace and many were stolen. A redesigned steel buoy of more
traditional shape was tested and incorporated into the later stages of the Nan
River works. Lack of maintenance by HD meant that the various structures,
unmarked and submerged during the wet season, posed a serious hazard to barges,
especially as some scour and settlement around the structures allowed the steel
piles to protrude well above the concrete panels and protecting rock fill. As a
result, the barge owners lost confidence in the lower Chao Phraya as a safe
channel in the wet season and diverted to the Noi and Tha Chin rivers, despite
their narrowness and numerous locks. In the dry season, when the structures are
visible, the Chao Phraya is used by empty barges, but owners of loaded barges
prefer to continue using the Noi and Tha Chin as they offer deeper water,
because they are used as irrigation feeder canals and are therefore kept full of
water and hence allow a greater payload. The Chao Phraya, on the other hand, is
deprived of water to the agreed minimum of 80 m3/s to provide the designed
navigable depth of 1.7 m, which results in barges having to operate part-loaded.
5.5   This situation will persist until HD can regain the confidence of the
barge owners in the safety of the Chao Phraya. HD have already fabricated and
deployed large numbers of buoys of the new design, which overcomes the
shortcomings of the originals, but budgetary constraints prevent the imminent
replacement of all lost buoys. Also HD must change their maintenance methods
which have traditionally allowed them to not do any work in the wet season, when
there was ample water for the barges to operate, and instead adopt a system of
regular daily maintenance patrols of the entire river throughout the year and
have boats and crews readily available to immediately replace any missing
navigation markers. Unless and until these measures are implemented, supported
by the necessary badgetary allocations and publicity campaign and the barge
owners see they are working, confidence will not be regained and the traffic
will not return to the lower Chao Phraya and it will be wary of using the upper
Chao Phraya and Nan rivers where there is no alternative route.
5.6   The economic rate of return (ERR) for the project calculated at appraisal
was 20%. While the coastal ports component has a satisfactory ERR (Table 4), it
remains below appraisal expectations. Because of maintenance problems on the
Chao Phraya, traffic levels have remained low, yielding an estimated ERR of only
4%. The overall benefits from the project, at the present time, therefore
remain low with an estimated ERR of 6% (Table 4). Once the river maintenance is
effective, the river ports are operating and the demonstration barge train has
had an effect on the composition of the barge fleet, project benefits should
show a higher return on the investments already made. These measures will,
however, take several years to take effect as private operators will have made



xv
alternative investments, mainly in trucks, to transport their goods and
agricultural produce.
6.   Project SustainabilitL
6.1  The project has not yet realised its potential benefits and it is
important that the Government does not view the inland waterway and coastal port
sectors as being incapable of providing benefits to the economy. Appreciable
benefits should accrue once the components of the project have been fully
implemented and they have been given time to take effect. Because of the delays
in completing most of the components these benefits will not be felt for many
years, and considerably later than expected during appraisal.
6.2  Given an adequate level of maintenance, an aggressive publicity campaign
for inland waterways and coastal ports and a successful demonstration of the
benefits of the push-tow system, there is no reason why higher benefits should
not be obtained in the long term. Operator confidence in the waterway system
and in the financial benefits of using different technology are the keys,
especially as these new barges can be used to deliver direct to the Eastern
Seaboard loading terminals or to the new port of Laem Chabang. The coastal
ports should also be aggressively marketed.
6.3  The main risks are (a) the denial of adequate maintenance funding to HD;
and (b) the cutting back on measures designed to strengthen HD as an institution
and to strengthen its ability to effectively manage Thailand's inland waterway
and coastal port assets. These risk factors can be addressed by the provision
of a realistic maintenance budget and by further training and manpower reforms
to ensure a satisfactory level of competence throughout the institution to carry
out effective waterway and coastal port management.
7.    auk  erformance
7.1  Bank performance during the preparation and supervision of this project
has been mixed. Performance during preparation and appraisal was good, but
during the supervision phase, a high rate of staff turnover resulted in
supervision being provided by five different engineers and three economists in a
period of three years, a situation that elicited adverse comment from the
Borrower. In addition the Borrower had to deal with 5 different division
chiefs. The lack of continuity did not help the Bank's working relationship
with the Borrower and executing agencies, and it is to the credit of all those
involved that the relationship remained as good as it did.
7.2  The project was well designed and its objectives were realistic in that
they reflected the need to reduce transport costs in an environment of rapidly
rising fuel prices and represented one of several effective ways of addressing
the problem. There were, however, three areas where the Bank made misjudgments.
These were in assessing (a) the capability of HD to manage the project
efficiently and to provide the maintenance input required for the completed
river works; (b) the time required to negotiate the lengthy procurement
procedures; and (c) the time needed to acquire the land for the river ports.



xvi
7.3  The lessons to be learnt by the Bank are:
a.    Continuity of staff responsible for a project is essential for its
smooth implementation and for the creation of a mutually beneficial
relationship with the Borrower;
b.    The time needed for procurement processes and land acquisition
should be more realistically appraised; alternatively, the receipt
of bids for major components and land acquisition could be made a
condition of Board presentation, where possible; and
c.   Where weak institutions are involved in a project, the Bank should
press for more technical assistance and training than would normally
be necessary and they should be treated more as major components,
rather than being tacked on as an afterthought.
8.    Borrower Performance
8.1  During the preparation and appraisal phase of the project, MOTC and HD
performed well and were enthusiastic, even anxious, to get the project underway
as soon as possible, though, because of a lack of management in the past, the
traffic data available to the Bank was skimpy. This performance was possible
because of a small number of more experienced people in HD, who were able to
devote enough time to enable the preparations for the project to go ahead
smoothly. Once the project got under way and it was necessary to involve other
staff in the project management, the institutional weakness of HD became
apparent and many important aspects of the project were not followed up or
executed as expeditiously as they should have been.
8.2  HD had to transform itself during the project from an organization that
carried out some seasonal channel and river maintenance, pilotage and fee
collection to one that had to effectively manage the inland waterways all the
year round, as well as fulfill its responsibilities for coastal ports and
licensing. It is ciear that it could not attract the calibre of staff required
to achieve this transformation, even in the time frame of the extended project,
and the training provided under the project was either poorly attended or not
implemented on the scale that had been intended.   Whereas the use of
expatriate management advisors has been extensively used in the Thai private
sector successfully to assist in managing the booming economy, there is a
reluctance by Government to bring such advisors into public sector organizations
and reap the benefits from such a move.
8.3   The lessons to be learnt by the Borrower are:
a.    They must do more towards strengthening those weaker institutions
which are responsible for important sectors of the economy or
infrastructure and place due emphasis on full implementation of
training components contained in projects, in order to gain the
maximum benefit from the institution-strengthening components
included; and
b.    They should give further consideration to the use of expatriate
management advisors, who would work alongside government staff to
help them develop the operational and maintenance system that are
essential to keep an investment effective.



xvii
9.               a
9.1 Some good relationships were built up during this project, but the rapidly
changing Bank staff situation meant that they could not be used to their full
advantage to progress the project, as much staff time was spent on the learning
curve and in developing relationships.
10.   Consulting Barvices
10.1 HD made much use of consulting services for both the inland waterways and
coastal ports components of the project, for feasibility studies (Table 5),
design and supervision. In each case, HD chose the firms, which carried out the
original feasibility studies, to do the design work, supervision and studies
that were part of the project. Both firms of consultants performed adequately,
although the French firm responsible for the inland waterways had some
difficulty in preparing acceptable tender documents.
10.2 The contractors carrying out the river works, river ports and channel
dredging all performed satisfactorily, with only the contractor for Taphan Hin
port exceeding the contract period. The standard of workmanship at Nakhon Sawan
port was very good.
10.3 Firms supplying equipment being procured under the project produced
varying performances, with the overseas suppliers doing rather better than the
Thai shipyards involved in constructing some of the floating equipment, some of
which has been seriously delayed.
11.   Project Documentation and Data
11.1 The Loan Agreement contained a number of covenants (Table 6), which were
reasonable and which have all been largely complied with by the end of the
project, albeit very late, with some actions still in progress.
11.2 The Staff Appraisal Report provided a good framework for the
implementation of the project, although it was optimistic on timings.
11.3 Data collection during and since the project has been haphazard and it has
not been possible to obtain any consistently monitored traffic figures.

THAILAND
INAIND WATERWAYS AND COASTAL PORTS PROJECT
(LOAN 1889-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I  -  INTROOUCTION
This Itenort deals with the second part of the Phase IZI of the
Inland Waterways Project, the so-called Inland Waterways Phase III
Construction Project.
This phase is the last touch of the development of Inland navigation
on the Chao Phraya and lower Ran Rivers : it consisted of project
implementation, following previous phases focussing successively on
identification, pre-feasibility and final design.
The Inland Waterways Project was basically aimed at streugthening the
traisprrtation system in the Central Plains of Thailand (see map herewith,
Appendix 3). It supplements existing road and rail systems connecting
Bangkok, Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin and provides excellent transport
facilities for such goods as agricultural products (rice, maize,
tapioca, etc.), mineral ores, petroleum products and construction
materials.
Its hinterland covers the whole northern part of Thailand, thanks to
the transhipment facilities built under the project at Nakhon Swan
and Taphan Hin.
This project was given a high priority by the Thai government, and
as such it was made part of the country's development plan.
It was undertaken by the Harbour Department of the Ministry of
Communications of the Kingdom of Thailand.



2
Designed as a means to revive a traditional, cheap and energy-saving
made of transport, it covered all aspects of Inland Waterways
development, namely :
-    River improvement, by means of river training works designed
to provide satisfactory navipation conditions in the channels
concerned (Chao Phraya and lower Nan) all year round :
the goal was to attain a target, depth of 1.70 m. minimum for
standard low flows throughout the project area, thanks to
(i) capital works and
(ii) subsequent yearly recurrent dredging. The designed
channel width is 40 m minimum.
-     Inland port construction, at Nakhon Sawan on the Chao Phraya
river and Taphan Hin, the uppermost limit of tne project
on the lower Ran river
-     ?todernization of the fleet operated through the introduction
in Thailand of a pilot pushed-convoy
-     Procurement of Maintenance Equipment, including
si)    three cutter-suction dredgers, for channel maintenance,
(ii)    a Pile Driving Unit for the maintenance of river
training works and
(iii)  miscellaneous river maintenance and survey equipment.
-     Procurement of Port Equipment for both ports mentioned above
-     Institutional adjustments within the Harbour Department
(setting up of a division in charge of operation and maintenance
of Inland Waterways)
-     Training aspects

II  -  PROJECT IDENTIFICATION. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
II.1   IDENTIFiCATION
The project was originally formulated following experimental river
training studies and tests on the Chao Phraya River in the sixties
(setting up of bottom panels accross shallow reaches, under
French assistance).
After transferring the responsibility of Inland Waterways to the
Harbour Department, the Thai government engaged in a process of
development of inland navigation : the high potential of inland
waterways indeed was recognized at that time of high cost of
energy. The successive phases of the project were as follows
(see also summary of documentation and reports above) :
(a)   Inland Wa_ erways_Phas_I  : prepared by the Harbour Department,
financed by the French government.
This phase was a review of the Inland Waterways system in the
Central plains of Thailand, and an identification of the
most suitable projects.
(b)   Inland Waterways Phase It : prepared by the Harbour Department,
financed by the French government.
This Phase was the pre-feasibility study of the development of
the so-called Northern corridor, i.e. the Chao Phraya!Nan axis.
This project, identified as part of the Phase I, proposed an
overall development of the Cbao Phraya nd Nan rivers up to
Uttaradit (see map, appendix 3), including :
(i) river improvement
(ii) port construction
(iii)   port equipment
(iv) maintenance equipment
(v) modtrnization of the river craft
(vi)   in;titutional improvements



5
This phase sas completed early 1977. Favourable findings
and bright prospects caught the attention of the Thai
Government and of the World Bank. This led to the
Phase III as mentioned hereafter.
(c)   Inland Watemays Phase III - Feasibility Study and Final Design
prepared by the Harbour Department, financed by IBRD.
This phase focussed on the sections of the Northern corridor
bearing the highest return according to the findings of the
Phase It, i.e. :
-   River up-grading on the Chao Phraya, up to Nakhon Sawan
(380 km from river mouth)
- Construction of a port at Nakhon Sawan and provision of
port equipment.
- Preliminary design of three dredgers for channel maintenance,
and of a modern push-tow boat and associated barges adapted to
Thai river conditions.
This phase was completed in December 1979, along with the
drafting of all specifications and tender documents for
the Civil Works to be undertaken (river and port).
It also included proposals for institutional adjustments
necessary to allow the Harbour Department to manage,
operate and maintain waterways and inland ports.
(d)   Inland Watervays Phase III - Construction : financed by IBRD,
prepared by the Harbour Department.
This phase includes the following items :
(i) Bidding for and imnlementation of projects dealt with in
the Feasibility Study and Final Design stage referred to
in (c) above.
(ii) Feasibility Study and final design of the Lower Nan River
Works and of the Port of Taphan Hin, and then bidding
and construction rhereof.



6
(iii) Final Design of a pilot pushed convoy, three dredgers,
and port equipment for both ports mentioned above,
and then bidding, construction and delivery thereof.
(iv)    Final Design, bidding, construction and delivery of
additional maintenance equipment, namely a Pile
Driving Unit and miscellaneous survey and maintenance
equipment.
This Phase was therefore restricted to the first section of
development of the Northern corridor, i.e. covering the
Chao Phraya River and the Lower Nan River up to Taphan Hin only.
This phase as described in (d) herein is that which is
specifically dealt with in this Report. Purther development of
Inland Navigation on the Nan River up to Uttaradit is therefore
left for the future, and not concerned with this phase of
the Inland Waterways Project.
11.2  PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
(a)   The Inland Wate ways Phase III -Construction  Project is very
complex as it involves both (i) feasibility and final design
studies and (ii) bidding and construction of civil works and
equipment as mentioned above, for a total of nine sub-projects
recalled hereafter in a logical sequence :
1.    Chao Phraya River Works
2.    Port of Nakhon Sawan
3.    Lower Nan River Works
4.    Port of Taphan Hin
5.    Construciton and delivery of a pusht tow boat and
four barges
6.    Construction and delivery of three cutter-suction
dredgers



7.     Supply of a Pile Driving Unit
8.     Supply of miscellaneous River Maintenance and
Survey Equipment
9.     Procurement of Port Equipment for the ports of
Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin.
All these sub-projects were prepared by the Harbour Department
and implemented with the assistanee of Consultants and
Contractors/suppliers.
They were originally all part of the loan agreement between
the IBRD and the Thai government.
However, the construction and delivery of three cutter-suction
dredgers has been removed from the scope of the IBRD-financed
project, following proposals from the KFW of Germany.
At the time of drafting of this Report, the fate of this item
is still under consideration by the Thai Government.
Besides, three sub-projects are not substantially completed
as yet, namely :
-       nThe Port of Taphan Hin, construction of which has
suffered significant delays.
-      The Push-tow boat and four barges, construction of which
has also suffered significant delays (this project is
already almost one-year behind schedule)
-      Port Equipment for both ports, due to be delivered
early 1989.
(b)  Generally sveakin,-the   etimpljemented under this phase III
Construction followed closely the principles set forth in the
previous phase.



8-
Indeed, river were devolopped by seans of free-f low
developent woks. Ports constructed at Nakhon Sawan awd
Taphan His were so at the sites originally planned, and
based on the original plans except for some adjustments
at Tapbha RHi due to land acquisition problems. The river
craft Vas built in line with the original plans, except
for some technical adjustments.
The major changes to the project originally defined were in fact
(i)    the removal of the constmaction and delivery of the
three cutter suction dredgers from the scope of the
project, as *entioned above,
(ii)   the addition to that scope of the Pile Driving Unit and
miscellaneous river maintenance ans survey Equipment
(itms 7 and 8 above). This latter change was readily
decided ad agreed during the overall project
implme_tatioa, as it answeres to basic maintenance
needs ilestified in the Final Design stage (Final
Report, Inland Vaterways Phace III, SCEoDCZCRIUECC,
December 1979).
(iii) significant delavs suffered in most of the sub-projects,
mainly linked to land acquisifton-related and adminis-
trative problems.
Project results were affected accordingly. Three items
are worth noting with this respect
- Firstly, the delav in deliverv of the three
cutter-suction dreduers has made maintenance
camonamns tuettectiLve over the whoLe Uhao Phrava
riLver since completion at related worts in
July 1985. As a consequence, recurrent dredgings
after the high waters of 1985, 1986 and 1987
have been below standard and problems linked to
shallow reaches have been repeatedly met in
subsequent dry season.



9
This made navigation difficult and hampered traffic growth.
The same is expected in 1988 and probably also in 1989 and,
further, as long as there will be a lack of Equipment unless
other steps be taken (e.g. contracting out these works).
Secondly, the Port of Nakhon Sawan was substantially completed
by mid 1988, i.e. three years after the Chao Phraya River
Woiks. And even then, this port still lacks its connection to
the public water supply system to be built by the Provincial
Waterworks Authority (PWA). This means that transhipent
facilities have been missing for three years after completion
of the channel of the Chao Phraya, hamping traffic growth
accordingly.
Thirdly, the pilot pushed convoy aimed at demonstrating to
potential private operators the advantages and low operating
cost of this modern technique, has not been delivered as yet,
due to constructional problems.  In the meantime, the lack of
economically effective vessels specifically adapted to the
conditions of the waterway is another factor hampering
traffic growth.
(c)  Besides, institutional    nrvements have been undertaken rather
slowly, and have been hindered by a certsin lack of experienced
professional staff and adapted equipment. Training and
Technical Assistance are still required, and such questions
as contracting out part (or all) of the maintenance activities
are still open.
Related problems are extremely important since basically the
success of the Qroiect depends on the oerformance of manaQement
and overation and maintenance activities : the major questions,
already outlined at design stage (Final Report, BCEOM/CNR/KEC",
December 1979) are :



10
adequate maintenance of the river channel : this covers
all aspects of river maintenance, with particular emphasis on
(i) dreduine recuirements (timing and capacity) and
(ii) maintenance ot Aids to Navigation.
release by other agencies concerned (RID, EGAT) of the
minimum flows required in dry season, i.e. s
80 mS/s in the lower Chao Phraya, below chainat dam
200 mP/s in the Upper Chao Phraya
* 70 ms/s in the lover Nan River
Further imrovrvmnts are still necessarv within the Harbour
Department so that the above requirements, essential for the
success of the project, be satisfied. They include
Ci)      strenethenine of the River Dredcine and Maintenance
Division or tne naroour Department torganizatton
and planning)
iii)     Technical Assistance for OM activities
(iii)    possibly, re-consideration of the principles of
maintenance and operation tasks (contractine out
part of the works, in particular dredtines and
Aids to Navigation, under supervision by qualLfied
engineers).
(d) Althoujb some of the sub vroiects have suffered significant
delays, with overall project completion now expected about
4 years behind the originally planned schedule, the time
elapsed between pre-feasibility stage and final completion
(about 13 years) is reasonable for this type of project.
The Chao Phraya River Works proper have been speedily
designed and built : this sub project was completed in
three years, which is very short for river training works
of such magnitude, and only 9 years after pre-feasibility
stage.



11
Other delays encountered -mostly resulted from laud-acquisition
problems, beyond control and more or less unavoidable, from
administrative problems linked to contradiction existing between
guidelines of the IBRD and of the Thai Ministry of Finance, and
from constructional problems.
But otherwise, the decision-making process was reasonably
speedy, resulting in final completion within a very resonable
time after project identification as said above.
(c) Consultants have been used throughout the project (in fact from
identification till final completion), for all studies required
(feasibility and final design), bid evaluation assistance and
construction supervision. Construction in general has adfered
to design principles, apart from technical adjustments necessary
because of (i) changing site conditions and/or (ii) technical
Improvements over the whole project time frame and various
other improvements. All such adjustments have been proposed
and accepted at construction supervision stage, and made possible
thanks to the good cooperation between consultants, contractors
and Inspection Committees.
Consultants have also been involved in training activities,
both within the project and under separate contracts.



12
(f) Indentification, preparation and appraisal have concentrated
throughout on the right issues
The development of Inland Waterways in Thailand has from the
beqinning been considered useful and beneficial.
The Phase III - Construction project was devised as a very
comprehensive project, covering all components of Inland
Waterways.
*   Designs have been based on most economic investment costs
in respect of expected traffic : this led to selecting
free-flow developments against more sophisticated projects
(dams and locks).
Construction in general has been according to the capacity of
the Harbour Department, and satisfactory (except for specific
constructional problems for the Port of Taphan Hin and the
push-tow boat and barges). Technical results of the river
development works have even been excellent : maintenance
requirements, in particular recurrent dredging, are well below
design estimates, pointing to a very good functionning of the
improved channel.
Institutional and related training aspects have been pinpointed
at an early stage, and steps have been taken to strengthen the
capability of the Harbour Department to manage, operate and
maintain the project works. But there is still ample room for
improvements in this respect, and further technical assistance
requirements should be considered, as well as ways to improve
operation and maintenance procedures.



13
11-3 Tarsets and goals
(a) The goal of the projoct is to improve inland navigation on
the Chao Phraya and Nan riser, from the river mouth up to
Taphan Hin. This involves all components of Inland Waterways
Development, namely (i) river and channel upgrading,,
(ii) construction of transshipment facilities at carefully-
selected sites, (iii) provision o: operation and maintenance
equipment, (iv) modernization of zhe.fleet, and, finally,
(v) training and organizational aspects.
(b) The limitations of the project were clearly set out in the
Final Design Report of 1979. These limitations result from
the type of river development proposed (free-flow scheme) as
more sophisticated and costly projects (dams and locks) were
not considered economically feasible at this stage in respect
of traffic forecasts. These are reserved as long-term
development prospects depending on the evalution of economic
conditions.
The main limitation is the depth restriction in dry season,
down to 1.70m minimum over the whole project area from
Ang Thong to Taphan Hin. This depth is understood for
standard low flows as indicated in 11-2 (c) above, it results
from hydraulic constraints.



14
(c) Maintaining this minimum depth over the whole dry season
repuires recurrent dredgings, to be carried out every year
at the end of the flood recession period. The project is
entirely based on the assumption that these recurrent
dredgings are properly performed, river training works and
vessels were designed accordingly. The economic evaluation
also was based on this assumption.
As mentioned in 11-2 (f) above, the design of the channel
proved good and viable technically speaking as evidenced by
wost-project investigations pointing to a satisfactory
behaviour of the channel (recurrent dredging requirements are
about 25% below the estimated requirements). The project as
completed is altogether a fine technical achievement, it makes
a sound basis for navigation improvement : it is now the main
target to improve O&M so that the project work satisfactorily.
Such improvement is essential.
(d) The Inland Waterways Phase III Construction project is part of
a long-range program of Inland Waterways Development.
It is the first step of the dtevelopment of The 'Northern Corridor'
up to Uttaradit on the Nan River. The original master plan
indeed provides for river up-grading up to Uttaradit, about
270 km. north of Taphan Hin, and for the construction of Port
facilities it Pitsanulok and Uttaradit.



1S
it is part of a system of watervays comprising the Pasak river
and various canals connecting watervays of the Central plain.
Within this system, the Chao Phraya is the backbone of central
Thailand, the main artery linking the rich agricultural regions
of central and northern Thailand to the Bangkok hub and the
Gulf of Thailand. The project thus opens direct links between
these regions, the Bangkok area and the deep-sea ports of the
Eastern-sea board, allowing sizable transport cost reductions
and favouring export-oriented activities.
This project is therefore highly beneficial to the tr.ansport
sector, and to the country's economy in general.
(e) Reasonably reliable information was available at design time to
allow realistic assumptions and results based on sound forecasts
and projections.  Haever, the economic content has significantly
changed during the time elapsed between feasibility stage and
final completion :
- the country's growth has been rapid
- energy prices have fluctuated. These are an important factor
of the project feasibility, the present situation should be
re-assessed accordingly.
- the time taken for completion has been much longer than originally
expected. As a result (i) maintenance procedures have been
erratic, (ii) maintenance of the river and appurtenant works
should be organized and personnel trained for maintenance of the
the river and of the Port of Nakhon Sawan and (iii) traffic growth
has been hampered as reported in 11-2 (b) above.



16
(f) Since the investments required for river improvements and
port eonstruction have been made, priority should now be
given to manaRement and 0 a N aspects. A complete re-asses_ment
of (i) the economic situation, (ii) the adequate 0 6 N
procedures to be set up, (iii) technical adjustments and/or
improvements which would be possible after completion and
tiv) further training and *echnical assistant requirements
should be undertaken.
Technical adjustments advisable to this stage imclude the
follow ing :
-   to investigate the possibility of eventually increasing
the minimum guaranteed depth thanks to systematic maintenance
procedures as such a possibility seems to exist according
to technical post-project investigations.
- to improve the Aids to Navigation and to improve the
existing and to reduce future maintenance costs and
facilitate the task of maintenance teams.
- to revise the optimum type and size of river craft taking
* into account present economic conditions.
- to develop maintenance centers for the Equipment operated
by the Harbour Department.
- io imDrove the economic data collection system in accordance
with the previous Consultant's recommendations.
All this may involve additional investments (river works,
maintenance centers, etc.) strengthening of the organization
in charge of river management and 0 8 M, promoting the waterway
including broad publicity regarding the river craft and the
hydro-information.

III - PROJECT IMPLEENTATION AND COST
Construction of the first of the 9 sub-projects making up the Inland
Waterways Phase III Project started in March 1982. The original time
frame of 37 months for the whole project has been extended, final completion
of the last sub-project is now expected early 1989 i.e. with an almost 4
years delay.
III - 1-START-UP
Whereas decisions were rather speedilv taken in the start-up period,
problems of land acquisition at Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin soon faced the
Harbour Department. A time-consuming process was engaged, which finally
resulted in the following :
- at Nakhon Sawan, construction was delayed until final settlement
of the problem. Port works finally started it. January 1987, i.e.
with an approximate 3.75 years delay (see section 111-3 herea. er).
- at Taphan Hin, construction a&lso was delayed until final settlement
of the problem. Port works finally started in April 1987, i.e.
with an approximate 4 years delay (see section III-3 hereafter).
In addition, and owing to the specified land conditions at Taphan Hin,
construction of this port was split into 2 stages : the first stage to be
started first on plots of land available, including only (i) the
administration area and (ii) port of the general cargo area. Both areas
were separated by unavailable land plots, and the road and rail access
road as well as the overall port platform could not be made part of
this stage.
Happily, after the commencement of the works, most of the land plots
requ_red for the 2nd stage were made available, and most of the 2nd stage
works were finally added to the on going 1st stage works. This included
inter alia (i) the main access road (ii) the completed general cargo area



18
(iii) tho platform between general cargo and administration areas and
(iv) the extension of the slope protection all along the port waterfront.
III - 2-REVISIONS
Implementation of the construction project proper was based on the following:
- Final design made as part of a previous study phase (feasibility
study and final design, BCE0OM/CNR/UECC, 1979). This concerned the
Chao Phraya River Works and the Port of Nakhon Sawan.
- Final design made as part of studies included in this phase of the
project (feasibility study and final design of the Nan River Works
and Port of Taphan Hin, BCEOUVCNR/KECD, 1982-1983). This concerned
the Nan River Works, the Port of Taphan Hin, Port Equipment, a Pile
Driving Unit, a Push-tow Boat and four barges, miscellaneous river
maintenance and survey equipment, three cutter-section dredgers.
(a) all sub-projects mentioned above, including those whose Final Design
was carried out as a component of this project, were finally implemented
except the three cutter-section dredrers. This item has already been
mentioned in section II above, construction of the dredgers have been
taken out of the current project following proposals from the Government
Federal Republic of Germany to finance this. sub-project. through a
loan from KFW.
(b) Major changes in the project scope, except for schedules which are
separatedly dealt with in III-3 hereafter, have already been mentioned
herein :



19
1. r rmal of the construction of 3 cutter-section dredgers from the
scope of the proejct.
2. addition of the construction of a Pile Driving Unit and miscellaneous
River Maintenance and survey equipment to the scope of the project.
3. other changes are mostly technical adjustments due to various rasons
as detailed hereafter.
Besides, changes mentioned in 1 and 2 above, as well as a drastically
modified schedule have required significant changes in*te supervision
services of the Consultants. Altogether, 6 Addenda and two Memoranda
extending supervision services have been signed between the Harbour
Department and Consultant as detailed hereafter.
The following paragraphs successively deal with ti) technical changes
brought during coDstruction, for all sub-projects concerned, and (ii)
changes to the scope of the Consultants'services.
(c) Technical revisions   during the course of construction have mostly
been the result of (i) adjustments necessary due to changes in site
conditions during design stage and constrction stage, (ii) adjustments
necessary to stick to latest engineering standards as required in
various contract, (iii) improvements brought about in the light of
experience at specific sites, or by late technological advances and
(iv) external requirements (such as for initance conformity with
standards or requirements of external agencies and/or problems of
availability on the local market).
It is worth noting that none of the technical changes, except those
resulting from additional works required by the Harbour Department or
proposed by the Consultants and approved by the Harbour Department,



20
have resulted in cost increases and/or OveTruns as they have bwon
made with a pormanent concern for cost-related aspects. This moans
that improvements brought into some parts of the work for any sub-
project and causing cost increases, have been compensated by equivalent
saving on the items of the same sub-projects made possible by experience
and tochnical advances, without in any way lowering the quality of
works in other works, the only final sub-project cost increases recorded
have been the sole result of variations of quantities, changes of
logislation and price escalation, while the quality of the works has
been kept in accordance with the standards of the specifications and,
in a number of cases, significantly improved.
The main technical revisions are summarized hereafter
- Chao Phraya River Works
The main change concerned the strengthening of most groynes
(particularly those filled with sand) by additional rock rip rap
protections. Based on investigations made during the course of works
(one year after commencement), it was decided to modify the design
of groynes by adding much protections all along the groynes, which
allowed to reTuce the driven length of steel piles forming the core
of the groynes. The modified design was worked out on the basis of
test made in river, during construction, which pointed to a better
behaviour of groynes otherwise prone to erosion when submerged.
This was made in accordance with the contract, which provided for
such possibility. The extra-cost due to the additional quantity of
rock rip rap was entirely compensated by savings on pile length.
The revision thus allowed better technical results at no additional
cost.



21
Port of Nakhon Sawen
A number of design revisions were proposed by the Consultants
and/or the Contractor, and approved by the Harbour Department.
Altogether, they were improvements compared to the original
design, mostly due to the long time gap between the Final Design
(drafting of Specifications and Tender Document in 1979) and
commencement of works (in 1987). The overall additional cost
due to these changes was nil the total actual project cost being
very slightly below the Contract Price.
Items worth a mention are as follows :
- the wharf has been strenathened.(additional piles) so as to
conform to the latest stanaaras issued after drafting of the
Specifications.
- the slope protection has been smoot,uned. with a final slope at
3/2 instead of 4/3.  Ttis revisio was necessary because of
erosions recorded in the river since completion of the design
phase, refusing the overall bank height to be increased.
- the drainaRe svstem access both road and rail access has been
signmtiLcantiy cnangea, so as to rame into account   physical
changes which took place after completion of the design phase :
the construction of a road running along the part site, modifying
the drainage conditions of the whole lowland area situated
behind the port. The revised design took into account this
road and its drainage system.
- the port drainage was modified, and additional drainage and utility
outlets were placed across the railroad on the area left for future.
extension. This step will allow to avoid excavations under that
railroad in the future, when the time comes to extend the port
facilities.
- the design of the railroad and rail access was revised to take
into account the requirements of the State Railways of Thailand
(subbase, turnouts, slopes, etc.)



22
The water suoglv system was changed. so as to take into account
the recent extension ot the previousty non-existing public water
supply system : reservoirs recently built by the Provincial
Watervork Authority of Thailand were considered a better source
of water than the well/water tower system originally designed,
and it was decided to connect the Port to this new public system.
Related connection works, to be by the Provincial Waterworks
Authority of Thailand are still to be completed.
- earth-slooes along the port area, the road access and the railroad
access nave beetn further crotected against damages caused by
rainwater, Dy means or addtlional top-soil covers and grassing.
- the number and location of dolphins originally provided for along
the future extension area have been modified so as to (i) allow
proper mooring space for barges waiting tor Loading/unloading
and (ii) keep future developments open on the extension area.
- the Fender svstem was improved according to the proposal of the
Contractor. This tender system was finally made of steel, instead
of wood as originally provided for.
- other miscellaneous modifications of products/materials entering
construction local proauccs nave been used as far as practicable
and in so far as Contract provisions and standard so allowed.
- Nan River Works
Design modifications proper have been scarce, and mostly the
result of (i) adaptation to site conditions and (ii) experience
drawn from the Chao Phraya River Works.
Characteristics of groynes in general were conform to the Contract
design, but details and dimensions were adapted to the Conditions
prevailing at the time of construction, accord,'ng to revised
designs made by the Consultants as provided for in the Contract.
The main modifications worth a mention are as follows :



23
- signs on land have been made of aluminium boards tied on concrete
legs, instead of steel as originally designed.
-a new type of buoy has been tested during construction. This buoy
was designed by the Consultants so as to avoid as far as practicable
the trapping of weeds, floating plants and debris flowing down river
in meduim and high water stages. Tests performed gave satisfactory
results, and a total of 30 such buoys were finally placed. Long term
behaviour of the system however still has to be monitored, and
compared with that of othcr types of buoys.
-inclined staff gauges have been designed, in place of vertical ones.
-Besides, a total of 4 rew bank protection sites have been added to
the project at the request of the Harbour Department. These
additional bank protections concerned sensitive and critical areas.
Three of them have been built according to conventional debigns by
the Consultants, the fourth one has been fitted with concrete steps
forming protection and providing recreational space in town. This
bank has been further reinforced with a shoulder raised above low
water levels due to the very poor quality of soil material, after
soil investigations made at the request of the Consultants and
approved by the Harbour Department,
Port of Taphan Hin
The general layout of this port had been modified as part of the
Final Design study (1982 - 1983) at the request of the Harbour
Department so as to allow works to start on land plots available
(see III-1 above).
First stage works were then launched in April 1987, but land
availability conditions in subsequent months finally allowed to
include most of the 2nd stage works within this project and at no
additional cost (see tI-i above). The main related additions
were thus



24
-the construction of the main access road : originally excluded from
the first stage works because of land unavailability, this road was
finally built after soil investigations were carried out in
accordance with the Contract.
-the platform between the Administration area and General Cargo area
was finally completed, allowing a slight extension of the General
Cargo area according to the final layout of the 2nd stage.
-the slope protection has been extended all along the waterfront of
the port, in accordance with the 2nd stage requirements. Besides,
the slope have been graded at 3/2 instead of 4/3.
-the Fender system has been improved : the design is similar to that
approved at Wakhon Sawan, and adapted to specific conditions of
Taphan Hin.
- other miscellaneous modifications of lesser importance, concerning
mostly products and/or materials entering construction (sand for
fills, additional filter layer, etc.). Local products have been
used as far as practicable and in so far as Contract provisions and
standards so allowed.
-Push-tow boat and four barges
There is no major deviation compared to tne original Tender, except
for some technical adjustments linked to (i) latest models producted
by certain suppliers (ii) availability or unavailability of certain
products and (iii) classification society requirements.
-Pile Driving Unit
See above 'Push-tow boat and four barges'.
-River Maintenance and Survey Equipment
No change compared to Tender proposals.
-Port Equipment
This item has not been delivered yet, however no change is expected
in the scope of supply compared to the Contract requirements based
on the Final Design findings.
(d) Change in the Consultants' services
The Consultants' services have been adapted throughout the
implementation period to best fit actual supervision requirements.
Change in Consultants'services were therefore linked to (i)
supervision requir*-'nts and (ii) actual schedules of various
sub-projects.



25
Altogether, the Consultants' services were expected to last
37 months. Although the actual completion date is still uninown,
it is anticipated that the total time frame will finally cover
82 to 8S months.
As already wentioned, the Consultant's original Contract has been
supplemented with 6 Addenda and 2 Memoranda of Understanding as
follows:
- Addendum No.1 (1984) : This addendum provided for the removal of
supervision services concerning the Nan River Works from the
original Contract. This Addendum was the result of the delay of
the Nan River Works.
- Addendum No.2 (1985) : This addendum provided for an extension
of the Consultants' services to cover the time-extension granted
to the Contractor in charge of the Chao Phraya River Works.
- Addendum No.3 (1986) : This addendum provided for additional
Consultant's serwices required to supervise the-maintenance
period of the Chao Phraya River Works.
- Addendum No.4 (1986) : This addendum coivered the supervision of
the delayed and revised Nan River Works.
- Addendum No.5 (1987) : This addendum covered the additional
services required for (i) bid evaluation assistance and (ii)
construction supervision of the Port of Nakhon Sawan and Taphan Hin.
- Addendum No.6 (1988) : This addendum covered additional Consultants'

of the Nan River Works (1988) : This memorandum provided for the
extension of the Consultants' services required for the supervision
of extended Nan River Works.
- Memorandum of Understanding for the extension of the supervision
of the Taphan Hin Port Work (1988) : This memorandum concerns
Consultants' supervision services extended to cover delayed Port
Works at Taphan Bin.
All additional and extended Consultants' services as described above
were justified according to actual working and timing requirements.
III - 3- IMWLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
The comparison of actual and expected schedules is summarized in the Table I
of Appendix 1 herewith.
(a)  As can beseen only the Chao Phraya River Works were almost completed
within the original schedule. None of the other sub-projects started
on or before the original completion date.
Note that (i) Port works were delayed as aforesaid mostly because of
problems related to land acquisition.
(ii) The Nan River Works were then delayed accordingly,
pending approval of this sub-project linked to the implementation of
the Port of Taphan Hin Works.
(iii) Procurement of Port Equipment was delayed according to
Port Civil Works.
(iv) The Push-tow boat and barges construction was
delayed mostly for administrative reasons, such as late approval of
Tender Documents and clifferences between Tender Conditions as
s



27
required by IBRD and those of the Ministry of Finance of tL. GoverDent
of Thailand.
(v) The Pile Driving Unit and River Survey and Maintenance
Equipment were not part of the original plan. However, both were
completed before all other Equipment supplies.
(vi) Further delays for the Nan River Works, Port Works
and Procurement of Equipment have been due to differences between
Tender Conditiors and guidelines issued by IBRD on one hand and
those of the Thai Ministry of Finance on the other hand.
(vii) Constructional delays linked to slow and erratic
progress by some Contractors and/or Suppliers (Port of Taphan Hin,
Push-tow boat and barges) have sizably increased the time taken by
corresponding sub-projects, and will finally bring about an
additional overall project delay estimated to between 6 and 9 months
under the present cifcwmstances.
(b)   Some of the causes of delays as reportid above had been anticipated
to some extent : schedule for land acquisition process, and for
(i) approval and (ii) administrative process proved optimistic. The
real nature of most causes of delays above however shows that these
were more or le3s unavoidable, or beyond control.
(c)   Delays and disruptions in the project can be considered to have
sizable effects on the project results, in terms of potential traffic
lost. Traffic losses are difficult to evaluate, they may result
either from loss of confidence of private users in the waterway, or
from alternative investments made by private users in other transport
modes (rail and road). Once traffic has been diverted away from
the river, it is difficult to get it back to the river within a
short period.



28
(d)    In summary, the original time schedule can be considered as
optimistic.
III - 4-PRCUEMENT
(a)    The major problem which faced the Harbour Department during project
implementation resulted from conflicting guidelines between IBRD
and the Ministry of Finance.
The Harbour Department is required to follow the guidelines of the
Thai Ministry of Finance according to the regulations in force. The
loan agreemeDt with IBRD on the other hand implies that IBRD's
guidelines be adhered. to.. Reconcilingsomewhat conflicting guidelines
proved difficolt and time-consuming. Related delays in some
sub-projects are estimated to be several months.
(b)    There was no *ajor disagreement or claim so far in procurement and
Contract proeedures with Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers,
except those related to slow and erratic progress (Contractor for
the Port of Taphan Min, Supplier for the Push-tow boat and barges).
(c)    The extent of local nrocurement proved greater than expected : all
Civil Works wre contracted to Thai Contractors. shzL.vards .n
charge of the Construction of the Push-tow boat, 4 barges and the
Pile Driving Onit were all Thai shipyards. Local products were used
as far as practicable and to a large extent in all Civil Works and
only goods having no local equivalent of required standards have
been imported.



31
- 2.2% for physical contingencies.
Besides, the bid price in bahts was about 5.9% above the Bnginaer's
estimate corresponding to economic conditions of August 1979.
Convemrted into US dollars, the bid price was lower than the
estimated cost of August 1979 because of variations of exchange
rates in the meantime.
2. Port of Nakhon Sawan : the final cost was almost equal to the
Contract Price. Price and physical contingencies actually needed
were therefore nil.
The bid price was about 33.5% below the Engineer's estimate.
3. Nan River Works : the final cost was about 14.7% above the bid
price. These 14.7% break down into :
-   4.7% for price contingencies.
-   10% for physical contigencies. These 10% result from the
additional bank protection works ordered by the Harbour
Department. Without such additional works, the final cost of
this sub-project would have been 5.5% below the bid price.
The bid price was about 24.2% below the Engineer's estimate.
4. Port of Taphan Hin : the latest estimated cost is within the
Contract Price, although a number of items have been added to
the 1st stage works as mentioned herein. Price and physical
contingencies actually needed were therefore nil.
The bid price was about35.3% below tho Engineer's estimate.



32
Bid prices and final costs of (i) the Port of Nakhon Savan,
(iM) the Nan River Works and (iii) the Port of Taphas Bin are
all below the prices estimated at apprasial, i.e. at Final
Design stage (August 1987 for Nakhon Savan, July 1982 for the
Nan River and the Port of Taphan Bin).
5    Equip mnt   none of the Equipment concerned was subjected to any
price increase due to either price or physical contigencies. But
liquidated damages were paid by suppliers for
(i)  the Push-tow boat and four barges (1OZ of Contract Price)
(ii) the Pile Driving Unit (7.81 of Contract Price)
There was consequently no cost overrun for these items.
Did prices for (i) the Pusb-tow boat and four barges and (ii) the
Pile Driving Unit were well below the Enginear's estimate
(respectively 10 X and 411). This was mostly due to low prices
proposed by local suppliers, much cheaper than those of foreign
fims.
The bid prices of Port Equipmeat were closed to the Estimate
( 3.9 2).
The bid prices of River ?aintemanae and Survey Equipment was about
351 above the Engineer's Estimate : this was principally due to
wide fluctuations of exchange rates at the time of bidding (in
particular concerning the Swiss Franc and the Japanese Yen, the
main currencies involved in the bid).



29
(d) Generally sMeaking, international competitive bidding raised up
keen interest among Contractors, and competition has appoared fair
and stiff : most of the Civil Works and goods procured have been
so at prices well below the Engineer's estimates.
Bid evaluation has been conducted systematically first on technical
grounds, then based on price comparison for repponsive bidders. For
all Civil Works, the lowest bidder was selected according to whether
proposals were responsive. For the procurement of goods, the lowest
responsive bidder has been selected. As aforesaid, problems have
been encountered for two items :-
- the Port of Taphan Hin
- the Push-tow boat and barges
(e)  Consultants engaged under the project were groups of Consultants
formed between foreign and local consulting firms. This procedure
is in accordance with the Thai regulations.
111-5 COSTS
The comparison of actual costs and original estimates is summarized in
the Table 2 of Appendix 2 herewith.
(a)   Actual costs are real costs as paid under the various sub-projects,
for all such sub-projects already completed. For others (Port of
Taphan Hin, Push-tow boat and barges, Port Equipment), they are the
latest estimates. For Consultant services, costs are also the
latest estimates.



30
Ike range of accuracy of actual costs is as follows
- Chao Pbraay River Works, Nan River Works, Port of Nakhon Sawan,
Pile Driving Unit, River Maintenance and Survey Equipment : the
related costs are roal costs.
- Port of Taphan Hin : the actual cost given in the Appendix 2 is
the latest estimated cost, considered to be within 5s of the final
cost. Besides, the amount of liquidated damages remains uncertain.
- Push-tow boat and barges : the actual cost given in the Appendix
2 is the estimated final cost, taking into account 10% liquidated
damagos due by the Seller. Futher possible cost variations resulting
from problems at delivery are not considered here.
- Port Equipment : the actual cost given in the Appendix 2 is the
final cost for this "off-the-shelf" Equipment (except in the case
where liquidated daqges would be due).
- Consultants' services : the actual cost is the latest estimated
cost, it does not take into accolunt possible extra services linked
to the supervision of delayed items (Port of Taphan Hia, Push-tow
boat and barges). It can be considered within to be 52 of the actual
final cost.
(b)   Physical and price contingencies at appraisal were adequate, as
evidenced by the following details by sub-project
1. Chao Phraya River Works : the final cost was only about 7.5%
above the bid price. These 7.5S break down into :
-   5.3% for price contingencies, including 1.1% paid to the
Contractor in compensation of business tax increase after
bidding, as required in the Contract (under the heading "change
in costs and legislation").



33
6. ConsultantsI services : the final cost of these sorvices is
noticeably in excess of the original Contract. This is
duo to :
(i) additional services requested by the Harbour Department and/or
necessary for proper supervision : this concerns the additional
services provided for the supervision of the maintenance period
of the Chao Phraya River Works, the supervision of the Nan
River and Port Works, the extension of supervision of the
Chao Phraya River Works, and the supervision of Equipment not
included in the original scope (Pile Driving Unit, River
Maintenance and Survey Equipment).
(ii) Constructional delays and general project delays.
III-6 FINANCIAL SOURCES
Financing of the Project was under the loan agreement between IBRD and
the Thai Government relating to the "Inland Waterways aAid Coastal Ports
Project".
Consultants' services were financed 100X by the World Bank, whereas
Civil Works and Procurement of Equipment were financed partly by the
World Bank and partly by the Thai Government, in accordance with the
provisions of the loan agreement.
(a)   Final expenditures were less than the original expectations, due
to (i) the low prices of most sub-projects compared to original
estimates and (ii) the very small amount of price and physical
contingencies actually used.



34
(b) Exp.nditures were delayed according to delays of the varmous
sub-projects. Reasons for these de:sys have slready been dealt
with herein (section III-3).
111-7 PERFORMANCE OF OrSIT1TANlS CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS
(a) the contribution of Consultants was very comprehensive, including
project design and revisions thereof, construction supervision,
inspection upon delivery, coumissioning, tests and trials, and
partial training of Harbour Department staff.
The services provided were excellent throughout, a fact evidenced
by the satisfactory behaviour of the river channel and training
works in general and the adequacy of supplies.
(b) the construction of Mi) the Chao Phraya River Works (ii) the Nan
River Works and (iii) the Port of Nikhon Sawan gave rise to no
constructional problem. Construction proceeded smoothly, and the
performance of Contractors was satisfactory.
(c) the same applies to the supply of River Maintenance and Survey
Equipment and, to some extent, to the Pile Driving Unit, although
delivery of the latter was effective with about 2.5 months delay.
(d)   Construction the Port of Taphan Bin, not completed yet, has
proved erratic, slow and has given rise to az*mber of constructional
*     and other problems.  Strict and very close control from the Consultants
has been necessary to maintain satisfactory standards of const .-tion,
and the final constructional delay is estimated to about 6 to 8
months.



35
(o)   Construction of the Push-tow boat and barges also has proved
orratic and slow. The delay at present is almost one year compared
to the Contract schedule, and the performance of the equipment as
tested upon delivery is below the requirements of the Contract.
Remedial measures are therefore necessary, this will bring about
further delays.
IV - TRAFPIC AND OPERATIONS
Owing to (i) various disruptions in sub-projects scheduled sequences and to
(ii) the overall project delay, traffic has not grown as rapidly as
expected. It is in fact too early to assess the actual traffic growth
generated by the project, for the main following reasons :
1. Parts of the project are not completed or delivered : Port of
Taphan Hin Civil Works, Water Supply connection of the Port of
Nakhon Sawan, Port Equipment delivery at both Ports, Pust-tow
boat and four barges.
This latter item is considered essential to boost the interest
of the private sector : waterways will be viable only if. the
river craft is modernized.
2. Although the Chao Phraya River,Works were completed in 1985,
traffic growth has been hampered by (i) the non-existence of
port facilities (the Port of N4khon Sawan vas completed
three years after the Chao Phraya, by mid 1988, and still
lacksits connection to the public water supply system).



36
(ii) the insufficiency of operation and maintenance activities.
This is mostly due to an obvious lack of equipment (dredgers
necossary for the project have not been supplied as yet), and to
a certain extent to a lack of adapted organizational facilities
and trained staff. The administrative red tape makes it
difficult to cope with the day-to-day maintenance requirements,
particularly during the critical periods.
V   - FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE EXECUTING AGEiCY
It is too early to deal with this item.
VI - F-'"'MIC REEVALUATION
It is too early to deal with this item.
VII - CONCLUSIONS
(a) The Inland Waterways - Phase III - Construction Project is not
completed yet, but indications already exist concerning ti) the
technical results and (ii) steps to be taken to develop traffic
and attract users.
(b) This irolect has been marked by significant delays due to various
reasons, in particular land acquisition problems and constructional
delays. Altogether, it will be completed almost 4 years behind
schedule.



37
(c)  Tochnically si     ng, parts of the project already completed are.
satisfactory : the channoels behave better than expected, recurrent
dredging requirements are below the estimates, river training works
work well. Ports have adequate facilities, and equipment supplied
are up to the required standards. Aids to Navigation however will
require iuprovements, to be uWde as part of the maintenance
activities, and according to tests made under the Nan River Works
(see III-2-(c)). Costs have been kept within the estimates.
(d)  Traffic Srowth so far has been hampered by (i) project delays and
disruptions, (ii) delays of delivery of the pilot pushed convoy
and (iii) insufficient maintenance.
(e)  EmphaS 's should now be placed on operation and mintenance activities,
particularly as regards river works : recurrent channel dredging
(planning, timing, execution ) and related tasks (hydrographic
surveys, hydrologic records), maintenance of Aids to Navigation and
of river structures.
Adequate operation and maintenance procedures should be re-considered,
such as the possibility to contract out part of the maintenance tasks,
as well as further technical assistance requirements.
(f)   Maintenance works should be facilitated  through a reinforcement of
the facilities of the Harbour Department : this includes maintenance
centers that could be set up for the-Inland Waterways.
(g) Promotion is still badly needed, in particular as regards (i) the
conditions of navigation, available draft, etc. (ii) the information
systems to be developped and (iii) suitable river craft to be
developped.

Dear Sir,
Subjt THAILAND - Inland Waterways.and Coastal Ports Project
(WAN 1889 TH) Project Completion Report
We acknowledged the receipt of your letter dated December 20,
1989 with sincere thanks for the project completion report. The Harbour
Dept. vould like to draw your attention to the following comments :
1. The survey of water transport volume in the Central Basin
area was exhaustively done In 1976 before the project commencement in
order to obtain data for preparation of an aprropriate scheme for water
transport and a long-term water transport development plan. The study
was carried out for 18 months (January 1976 - June 19??) under the
sponsorship of the French Government with the purpose to study the
cargo volume, types of cargoes tranqported by island waterways, ship's
movement, and the types of vehicles used in the inland waterways.
Normally our project has to follow the following procedures :
1. Conception
2. Formulation
3. Analysis and Appraisal
4. Approval
5. Implementation
6. Reporting and Feedback
7. Transition to Normal Administration
8. Evaluation
Mr. Graham Donaldson,
Chief Agriculture, Infrastructure and
Human Resources Division,
Operations Evaluation Department,
IBRD 1818 H. Street N.Y.,
Washington D.C. 20433,
U.S.A.



41
With regard to the Inland Waterways Development Project, it is now on
the seventh procedure i.e. transition to normal administration as the
subproject for the supply of dredgers has not yet been finished.
Upon the completion of the selection of operators for Nakhon
Sawan and Taphan Bin Ports and a set of four steel barges and a pusher
tug, the project will step into the eighth procedure i.e. evaluation
of the project. At this stage, the exhaustive study of data and
information will be collected again for the purpose of evaluation.
Honc*, it is likely too fast to state in the IBRD#s report that the
project appraisal is currently only G% compared with the primary
appraisal of 20%.
2. The project implementation was long delay beyond what
had been plan, this was due to the conflict between the Thai Ministry
of Finance's regulations and the IBRD's guidelines concerning the
purchase and commission. To reconcile each case was rather difficult
and time consuming. Moreover, there was a lack of continuity of the staff
of the Thai Ministry of Finance who supervised the implementation, each
change caused somewhat delay on each step to be taken.
3. The Harbour Department has stipulated one important
condition of the project which has already been accepted by the Cabinet
I.e. the hydrographic situation shall be maintained as follows :
- a minimum flow of 300 cubic meters per second above the
Chao Phraya dam
- a minimum flow of 80 ubic meters per second below the
Chao Phray dam
In actual situation, the Royal Irrigation Department
could not conform to the above-mentioned condition since 1987 as there
were the scarcity of rain for 3 years consecutively (1987 - 1989) which
resulted in the unequal distribution of water to different sectors i.e.
agriculture, electricity and transportation. Moreover, the water
demand for agriculture in the dry season had Increased tremendously
due to the policy of second croppings and the attractive price of
rice in the world mrket. In practice, the agricultural sector always
obtain the first priority from tho Government.

In view of the problems mentioned above, the channel's
depth is unable to be maintained at the level of 1.7 m. as determined
in the project.
4. In short, the IBRD's report is acceptable to the Harbour
Department and the recommendations emanating from the report will be
implemented to improve our efficiency. The proposal for further
technical assistance In training of our staff is very much appreciated.
We wish to thank you very sincerely for your time and energy
devoted to our project. We look forward to having an opportunity to
work with the IBRD's staff again-Kindly inform all concerned of our
heartfelt gratitude for what they have done for us.
With our best regards.
Yours sincerely,
(Mr. Amphon Tiyabhorn)
Director General
