I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank Group has supported educational development in Haiti
through two education credit (Credit 618-HA, US$5.5 million, February
1976 and Credit 770-HA, US$10 million, February 1978). Since the first
involvement in the sector, formal education in Haiti has undergone profound
changes, especially in the last four years. In 1978, the two autonomous
primary education systems, urban and rural, merged into one under the
National Education Department (DEN). Also in 1978, a decree established
Creole as the main language of teaching and learning. In 1979, an Organic
Law gave the basis for reorganization of DEN.  This is gradually being
implemented. In March 1982, a new education system was established,
consisting of ten years of basic education, divided into three cycles.
This new system will be introduced gradually starting in September 1982.
1.02      Credit 618-HA (US$5.5 million, February 1976) financed construc-
tion of 75 primary schools/community learning centers in rural and urban
areas, three primary teacher training institutions and the revision of the
teacher training curriculum. Credit 618-HA was completed by December 31,
1981, about one year behind schedule, due to lack of counterpart funds and
construction delays. The lessons drawn thus far from the implementation of
Credit 618-HA are:
(a) construction of small dispersed rural schools was uneconomical
for contractors under normal contracting arrangements; a system
of negotiated contracts and direct supervision by the project
unit has proved cheaper and more effective;
(b) the project acted as a catalyst for major improvements in
education and provided support for the gradual modernization of
the education system--a process which is continuing.
1.03      Credit 770-HA (US$10 million, February 1978) supports the expan-
sion of basic education and secondary vocational, and agricultural train-
ing. In addition, the project supports curriculum development for grades 1
to 4 on an experimental basis, teacher training programs, a radio
component, and the introduction and implementation of a limited primary
education reform. The implementation of Credit 770-HA is satisfactory with
regard to the educational aspects: curricula, textbooks and teaching
guides, and new teaching techniques in Creole, supported by radio programs,
were tested in 1980/81 in some 1,000 classrooms (8% of the total) for grade
1 to 3 on an experimental basis; over 3,000 teachers have been trained in
the new curricula and teaching techniques, and the reform of the education
system will be introduced gradually to all schools (public and private) in
the country. The implementation of the infrastructural components is about
24 months behind schedule due in part to periodic shortage of counterpart
funds. A recent change in the Credit Agreement allows the project unit to
construct primary schools using a system of negotiated contracts under its
direct supervision. With the establishment of a working fund implementa-
tion is expected to improve, and the project is expected to be completed by
December 1984, one year behind schedule.

1.04      The Government places importance on education, especially basic
education, and on skill training, and its comprehensive education reform
which will change the education structure for basic education and
vocational training at the lower levels shows the intention of the
Government to improve the education system. In March 1981 the Government
submitted a request to IDA for possible financing of a project which
focuses on basic education, the educational reform, and on consolidation of
the actions started under the two previous projects. The project request
prepared by the Education Department (DEN) formed the basis for IDA
appraisal which was carried out by a mission visiting the country in July
1981. Due a reduction in the availability of IDA funds, a post-appraisal
was carried out in March 1982 to adjust the size of the project. The
proposed basic education project would include IDA financing of US$9
million to assist the Government in carrying out a first phase of three
years of a seven year program. Possible future projects would cover
subsequent phases. The proposed project would assist the Government in:
(a) increasing access to rural primary education in three Departments with
the lowest relative participation; (b) improving the quality of primary
education offered in rural areas; and (c) assisting in the overall
coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the educational reform. In
addition, the Government, in 1982, requested the Bank's technical
assistance in improving its accounting and auditing procedures. A small
technical assistance component to design a comprehensive examination for
the accounting profession would be included in the proposed project.
1.05      In September 1981 the Government requested, and IDA approved, the
allocation of US$550,000 from the Project Preparation Facility to initiate
activities under the proposed third education project. These funds are
being used to carry out preparation activities such as school mapping,
hiring of staff for curriculum development, training and evaluation, and
strengthening of the pedagogical supervision system. These activities are
crucial to ensure that the educational reform, which the proposed project
would support, could be introduced gradually starting in October 1982.
II. ISSUES IN BASIC EDUCATION
Overview
2.01      The Haitian education system faces serious problems and con-
straints in its aim to provide basic education to its children. Not enough
children complete their primary education and many of those who do have
inadequate learning results. These problems are particularly acute in the
rural areas. They exist because: (a) less than half of rural children go
to school; (b) only about 20% of those who do go to school in the rural
areas complete six grades; and (c) learning achievements among school
leavers are comparatively low. It is important for national development
that these issues be solved, but the Government must overcome formidable
financial, human and organizational constraints. The lack of resources is
particularly acute in the education sector because of the magnitude of the
problems. This implies that the problems can only be solved in phases over
the long run. The issues, the government plans, and the constraints are
discussed in sequence below.



-3-
Low Enrollment Rates
2.02      A first problem facing the Hlaitian education system is that less
than half of the children go to school, and the participation of those who
attend is unequally distributed along the urban/rural continuum, by region
and by sex.
2.03      In 1980/81 some 620,000 children were enrolled in primary school.
This represented a 70% gross enrollment rate and a 43% net enrollment rate
of the 6-12 age group. In rural areas enrollment represented only a 30%
net rate. In 1980/81 some 509,300 of the 6-12 year olds, or 57% of the age
group, were estimated not to be in school.
2.04      Disparities in participation follow the rural/urban continuum
(30% of the relevant age group is enrolled in rural areas versus 72% in
urban areas), vary widely among the nine departments of the country, with
net enrollment rates varying from 27% (Ouest) to 65% (Nord-Ouest). Rural
representation indices ranging from 0.519 (Grand'Anse) to 1.847 (Artibo-
nite) (Table 2.1). Girls enroll less frequently than boys: 43% in rural
areas and 46% nationally. Enrollments of girls, however, grew at about 1%
per year faster than those of boys over the last five years.

2.05      The overall low and unequal rural primary enrollment rates by
region are caused mainly by: (a) the lack of sufficient school places and
the dispersed location of existing facilities; (b) the cost of education to
the parents; and (c) other socioeconomic factors, such as the need for
child labor in the fields and caring for siblings, and the poor health and
nutrition of the children.



2.06      There are not sufficient school places available in the country.
The table below shows the number of schools and classrooms available in
1979/80.

Private                2,038    1,176        862       7,676    3,327    4,349

For the 1981/82 school year only 12,700 classrooms are available while
13,500 are needed. The real deficit, however, is larger because at least
30% of public schools and 20% of private schools need replacement or
repair. The operation of 30% of public schools in rented, converted houses
explains the high percentage of replacement for public schools. Most pri-
vate schools are also in houses. In addition, 22% of private schools
operate in the open air, without buildings. Schools and settlements are
dispersed, often compelling students to walk more than five kilometers one
way. This makes it difficult for the physically weaker children to stay in
school, particularly under rough weather conditions.
2.07      The cost of education is also a deterrent to enrollment.  The
annual cost to a family per child for public schools was G90, or US$19 in
1979/80; this included school fees, uniforms, learning aids and books. The
annual cost for private education is about the same in the rural areas, but
higher in the urban areas. These costs frequently constitute an excessive
burden for rural families. The average annual income per family in rural
areas is about G765 (1980 estimate). The expense of the family for the
education of one child thus represents 11% of the average income, and 22%
with two children in the primary school age. Two to four percent would be
considered normal in most countries. In addition, there is the opportunity
cost of sending children to school; even young children can make a
substantial contribution to the operation of the household by caring for
siblings, working in the fields or selling newspapers in the streets.
Finally, 75% of school age children suffer from protein-calorie
deficiencies. In 1979/80 a study showed that of children enrolled in
schools, 41% received only one meal at home, 38% two meals; and that the
nutritional status of six-year-olds was 80% of the optimal, dropping to 60%
for the seven-year-olds.
2.08      Low participation in the education system with its resulting low
levels of literacy influences the economic development of a country.
Higher literacy rates are linked to better health status, higher life
expectancy, lower child mortality and economic growth. An increase in lit-
eracy rates of 20% would increase GDP growth by 0.5% according to worldwide
comparative studies. 1/ For the individual access to basic education

2.09      The long-term solution to the problem of low enrollment rates is
to increase enrollments quickly, especially in rural areas. However, the
government can not afford such dramatic steps, so the short-term solution
should be to increase enrollment rates selectively by focusing the limited
government resources on the most disadvantaged areas.
Low Efficiency
2.10      The second major problem facing the Haitian education system is
that not enough children who enter school complete the primary cycle. The
internal efficiency of student continuation is low; for instance, the com-
pletion rate for the cohort entering school in 1978/79 would be, based on
historical coefficients, 47% in urban areas, 20% in rural areas. Most
children stay in the lowest grades due to high repetition and dropout
rates. In the rural areas some 59% of the students were in the pre-
school 2/ and first grade compared to 43% in the first two grades in urban
areas in 1980/81. The urban repetition rate and dropout rate is consist-
ently lower per grade than the rural one (Table 2.3). Both rates are sub-
stantially higher for the lower grades. In fact, 59% of the urban students
and 76% of the rural students drop out before they can be expected to have
attained full literacy (i.e., after grade 4).

2.11      Because of frequent repetition and starting school at a late age,
39% of children are overage i.e., more than 1 year older than the legal age
corresponding to that grade.  The legal primary school age is from 6 to 12
years. At present, 34.5% of the students are 12 years and older. Only 26%
in the urban areas, 13% in the rural areas, pass through primary school
without repeating one grade; 22% (urban) and 39% (rural) repeated three
years or more.
2.12      The inefficiency of the system has multiple causes, some of which
overlap with those indicated in para. 2.05. The undernourishment and mal-
nourishment caused by poverty is a major determinant of low retention.
2/   In 1978, the two separate school systems, urban and rural, were
officially united. The rural system consisted of 7 years of
education, starting with a preschool year focussing on school
readiness (interalia teaching of rudimentary French). Many rural
private schools still have this preschool year.



- 6 -
Studies show that even mild to moderate, but chronic, malnutrition affects
cognitive development independent of other conditioning variables. Added
to this condition of the child, are the conditions in which the child
receives his or her education, for instance, overcrowded classrooms (95
children per classroom is not uncommon in rural areas), teachers teaching
multiple grades per classroom without being adequately prepared for multi-
grade teaching. Also, present curricula and teaching methods do not take
into account the great number of overage students who have different inter-
ests and learning abilities than the regular age group students. All stu-
dents follow the same program because teachers are not trained in the tech-
nique of grouping by age or ability level and providing different indivi-
dualized or group programs. In addition, students may enter school at any
date during the year, making consistent progress in learning difficult to
plan. Lastly, students are taught in French and teachers evaluate students
to be ready to pass to the next grade based on their mastery of French.
This factor by itself explains most of the crowding at the lower levels.
2.13      The consequences of low efficiency are above all a wastage of
resources. Table 2.4 shows the costs of inefficiency: 20 student-years to
produce one graduate in the rural areas, 15 student-years in the urban
public schools, but only 7 student-years in urban private schools. The
urban private schools are about three times as efficient as the rural
schools in producing graduates. The total resources wasted on the 1978/79
cohort are about US$340,000, about US$200,000 by the Government and about
US$140,000 by the parents. The Government waste would pay the salaries of
an additional 167 teachers, or give access to schools to an additional
8,000 children. Another consequence is the psychological conditioning that
children receive because they always fail. This results in low self-esteem
and low achievement motivation.

2.14      To improve the efficiency, measures could be introduced such as
more discipline regarding school dates, number of days and hours, automatic
promotion, grouping of students by age and an accelerated program for the
overaged, as well as a better quality package for the normal student. Data
from preschool nutrition centers constructed by CARE next to the schools
built under Credit 618-HA show that 87% of the children who participated in
the one-year preschool nutrition program were promoted from grade 1 to
grade 2 versus 37% of the nonparticipants. This success may be due to
better school readiness, as well as better nutrition status.
Low Quality
2.15      The third problem facing the Haitian education system is that the
cognitive achievements of students who complete primary education are low.
Low learning achievements are evident, but there are no reliable indicators
of how much students learn. However, achievement can be measured and
compared with other countries in an indirect way by measuring inputs. The
low or inadequate inputs described below all indicate a low quality educa-
tion system, which cannot but produce low results. The inputs reviewed
are: funds spent per student, teacher qualifications, teacher supervision,
relevance of the curriculum and of the language of instruction, and the
availability of learning materials and physical facilities.
2.16      The funds spent per student are low compared with other coun-
tries, e.g., in 1979/80 the unit cost per primary student was US$55, or 19%
of the per capita GDP. Of this, the parents' contribution, US$19, went for
uniforms, tuition and textbooks. The Government's expenditure (US$36, or
13% of per capita GDP) was almost entirely spent on teacher salaries and
little remains for classroom supplies or teaching aids. Most classrooms do
not have maps, paper, glue, scissors or even a blackboard with chalk. The
Government spends US$0.60 per student on these supplies and aids, although
the entire tuition, US$2.40 per student, is officially earmarked for this
purpose.
2.17      Teachers.  In 1980/81 some 14,900 teachers taught primary
school--5,500 public; 9,400 private teachers. About 27% of the teachers
were considered qualified (graduates of teacher training colleges or
equivalent) including 20% in the private sectors and about 40% in the
public sector. An additional 19% have completed secondary education-first
cycle and could become qualified in equivalency courses. All other
teachers need more extensive in-service training. In general, teachers are
poorly prepared to teach in rural circumstances, with more than one grade
per classroom, overage students and infrequent attendance of students.
2.18      Five years ago only half of the teachers were unqualified,
compared with three-fourths at present. This deterioration has resulted
from high teacher attrition, estimated at 9-10% per year. Teachers leave
their profession for higher paying employment abroad and in the country
itself. Public teacher salaries were raised to US$100 per month in 1979,
but are still lower than those received by drivers or secretaries in



- 8 -
Port-au-Prince. At present, all teachers, regardless of qualifications,
earn the same salary, US$100 a month. Private sector teachers earn only
US$40 per month on average.  It is difficult to recruit qualified teachers
to go to rural areas, as most teacher training colleges are in urban areas.
2.19      Supervision of teachers, providing them with pedagogical support,
is poorly organized.  Teachers deal with three levels of supervision:  in-
spectors at the district or zonal level, pedagogical advisors attached to
Regional Pedagogical Centers, and their directors in the schools, as shown
in Table 2.5. The three levels are not integrated, nor are tasks clearly
delineated by level. Directors and inspectors are not properly trained to
provide pedagogical support; they deal mostly with administrative and stat-
istical matters. The inspectors' mobility is limited by lack of transport
and travel budget. IPN's parallel structure of 19 Regional Pedagogical
Centers with some 100 pedagogical advisors attempts to fill the void of
pedagogical assistance to teachers. The advisors, qualified teachers with
several years of experience and trained in a 10-month course in supervi-
sion, form a corps of well-motivated and well-trained professionals. With
curriculum experiments under way since 1978, they have had little time to
devote to regular pedagogical assistance, and they also lack transport.
Advisors spend about 50% of their time giving teacher in-service training
courses and 50% supervising the introduction of the experimental curric-
ulum. This year, 1981/82, the advisors are being freed from some of these
tasks. The teacher training colleges now provide in-service teacher train-
ing, and IPN is experimenting with intensive supervision of fewer class-
rooms in the experimental curriculum. Generally, however, a rural school
teacher does not receive pedagogical supervision.

2.20      Curriculum.  The present primary school curriculum is a copy of
the early twentieth century French curriculum, using the same textbooks and
teaching techniques of one-way classical exposition by the teacher to
passive students. Memorization is the key factor in school learning and
students' evaluation. This French curriculum is geared toward the elite



- 9 -
who fulfill the academic requirements to go on to secondary and university
level education. The premise of academic progression and the materials
presented based on French circumstances are alien to the Haitian world,
esptcially in the rural areas. In Haiti, where few children have the means
and opportunity to pursue academic careers, education needs to be presented
in such a way as to be useful to children who may never have more than two
to four years of schooling.
2.21      Language.  Creole and French are the national languages in Haiti,
with French the official language. Virtually all the population speaks
Creole, about 20% are able to speak and write French, but only 5% use
French almost exclusively. All education has been in the French medium.
The use of French as the only language of teaching imposes on the rural
child a further learning and emotional barrier. The gap between the class-
room (francophone environment) and the home (creolophone environment) gen-
erates a duality in the early childhood experience negative to balanced
intellectual and affective development process. Creole should be used in
any new curriculum.
2.22      Learning Materials.  Learning materials, including textbooks,
notebooks and pencils, are to be purchased by the parents. These costs
often exceed the limited financial means of parents in rural areas. At
present, only one in four rural students owns a textbook. The average cost
is US$1-2 per book, or US$6-8 per grade per student. Textbooks produced
and distributed by the private sector are mostly in French and have
remained unchanged for years: some first editions, dating back to 1932,
are still in use. Missions or other private organizations have produced
materials in Creole for use in their schools.
2.23      Physical Facilities.  In most rural areas, schools are dilapi-
dated and not maintained to the point where they disturb teaching. For
example, in 1976/77 about 60% of the students had no desks or chairs. Even
in urban areas in 1978, 45% of public schools had no blackboards. Class-
rooms also tend to be overcrowded. The average number of children per
classroom approaches 100 in public primary schools and 50 in private
schools (1978/79). The rural student/teacher ratio in public schools is
80:1 vs. 37:1 for urban areas (1978/79).
2.24      The situation described above is especially discriminatory for
rural poorer regions, thereby losing a great potential in human resources.
As farming families, their limited--or lack of--literacy hinders their
ability to use information to improve their productivity or health. As
entrants to the urban labor force, their incomplete basic education limits
their ability to receive further instruction in vocational skills or pursue
further education to enhance their upward mobility. Low efficiency and low
quality now result in limiting rural youthst chances for upward mobility,
for example in giving access to secondary schools in urban areas, because,
with the exception of four agricultural (grades 7-9) schools, there are no
opportunities for education beyond grade 6 in rural areas.



- 10 -
2.25      The solution to the problem of low and unequal participation lies
in correcting the imbalances by concentrating government investments in the
disadvantaged rural areas, especially in those with the lowest representa-
tion indices. Based on a school mapping exercise, facilities should be
distributed to those areas which have the least access to schools. Any
expansion of the system, however, should be accompanied by improvements in
efficiency and quality.
Issues in Accountants' Training
2.26      One of the weak links in modernizing the Government's bureaucracy
is the unavailability of well-trained professionals. This is particularly
so with the accounting profession, because the rate at which modern finan-
cial management can be introduced is constrained by the availability of
well-trained accountants and bookkeepers. The lack of these professionals
perpetuates the use of an antiquated and elaborate check and balance system
for financial transactions. This particularly influences the rate and
level at which, e.g., disbursement requests for IDA-financed projects are
prepared.
2.27      Training for accountants is currently being provided at three
levels:
(a)  university training of full-time student at the National Insti-
tute for Management Administration and International Higher
Studies (INAGHEI), a unit of the University of Haiti. This pro-
gram is intended to produce graduate accountants who would
receive automatic accreditation from a professional body esta-
blished by law in 1981;
(b)  university training of part-time students at INAGHEI, designed to
grant diplomas to persons who have several years of on-the-job
experience in accounting; and
(c)  vocational training by approximately 30 private commercial
schools.
2.28      INAGHEI has been receiving technical assistance from CIDA in-
cluding two advisers who assist in teaching and curriculum development, as
well as the provision of short-term teaching support by the University of
Ottawa. These activities have made a substantial contribution to the deve-
lopment of professional training; at their current level, however, they are
insufficient to cope with the increased number of students moving into the
more advanced subjects. Physical facilities are strained and the existing
library is particularly inadequate. CIDA is currently evaluating its
assistance to INAGHEI and it is hoped that the project will be extended and
appropriately strengthened.
2.29      The quality of the training offered by the private commercial
schools varies widely. Some of the schools are generally regarded as being
superior, and their graduates, consequently, have better chances of
obtaining employment. There is no minimum required curriculum and only
nominal regulation by DEN. Many of the schools are oriented towards
preparing students for careers abroad; they conduct classes in English,



- 11 -
using foreign textbooks.  Despite some negative features, the commercial
schools are providing a badly needed form of instruction at no cost to the
Government. They are, therefore, a potentially important segment of
Haiti's educational system. In order to realize this potential without
reducing the incentive for private initiative, it is recommended that the
Government administer an examination (on a voluntary basis) to graduates
of commercial schools. This would provide a common standard of quality
which prospective employers (including the Government) now lack when
considering commercial school graduates.
2.30      The existence of a standard curriculum for the examination would
encourage the weaker schools to strengthen their offerings, so as to
achieve a higher success ratio among their students in taking it.  Over
time, some weaker schools can be expected to disappear, making it possible
for the better ones to achieve economies in the use of scarce teachers.
The examination should also improve the efficiency of INAGHEI. At present,
the institute cannot rely on commercial school training and puts all
students through the same introductory courses. Once the examination is
instituted, successful commercial school graduates could be given
appropriate credit for pre-university training; this would reduce the
pressure on INAGHEI's teaching staff and physical facilities, which is
greatest at the preparatory level.
III. GOVERNMENT PLANS AND PROGRAMS
Overview
3.01      Over the last three years, formal education in Haiti has under-
gone a profound change. In 1978, the two autonomous primary education
systems (urban and rural) merged into one under DEN. A decree established
Creole as the main language of teaching and learning. A review of the
primary school curriculum was started to develop a curriculum responsive to
the socioeconomic and cultural challenges of the Haitian society. In 1979
an Organic Law gave the basis for reorganization of DEN, which is gradually
being implemented. In March 1982, a new education system was established
consisting of ten years of basic education. The next five years (1982-86)
will be crucial in consolidating and extending the changes already under
way.
Five-Year Development Plan and Constraints
3.02      The Government plans for the next five years are ambitious.
During the Third Five-Year Development Plan (1981/82-1985/86), the
Government plans to carry out three major undertakings:
(a) to increase the gross enrollment rate from 70% to 83% by 1983, an
increase in 168,500 student places, and to increase the gross
enrollment rate in rural areas from 54% to 71% by 1987, or by
128,500 student places;



- 12 -
(b) to implement gradually the reform of the educational structure
starting in October 1982;
(c) to modernize education administration through:
(i) reorganization of the central structures of DEN; and
(ii) decentralization and regionalization of tasks, functions
and responsibilities.
These three undertakings are important and necessary steps in the process
of adapting the education system to requirements of the present society.                    4
But the Government is faced with financial, human and managerial con-
straints which are difficult to overcome. The timetable for reaching the
targets may well have to be extended.
3.03      Increase in Enrollments.  In order to introduce 10 years of basic
education to all Haitian children by the year 2000, the Government plans to
increase enrollments by about 5% per year, or about 34,000 new students per
year. This is higher than the target for the last five years (22,300 stu-
dents per year) and considerably higher than the achievements (about 13,600
students per year).

3.04      In percentage annual growth, rather than absolute numbers, it is
clear that it was the public sector performance with 1.7% annual growth
rather than the 5.1% foreseen which caused the shortfall. The public sec-
tor lacked funds to construct additional urban schools and pay additional
teacher salaries.

3.05      In view of the performance under the Second Development Plan, the
targets for-the Third Development Plan are unrealistically high. It is
unlikely that the public sector could reach these targets, because the
public sector budgets, both development and recurrent, are likely to be
lower than expected by DEN, and DEN is unlikely to have the capacity to
implement the expansion foreseen. In addition, the growth of the private
sector is unpredictable.
3.06      DEN's share of the public sector budget is likely to be lower
than the one foreseen by DEN for the next five years. First, DEN expects
80% of its development budget of US$100 million to come from foreign re-
sources, which are not yet committed. If resources were assured, DEN's
proposed allocation to primary education (60%) and to expansion of the sys-
tem (80%) would ensure adequate availability of funds for expansion of the
primary education system. Second, the recurrent budget is likely to be
lower than that foreseen by DEN. DEN expects the education sector's share
to increase from 15% to 22%, while the Department of Planning assumes a
decrease in education's share. The rate of increase determines the number
of new teachers that can be paid (teacher salaries form 95% of the budget),
and this, in turn, determines the rate of enrollment increases. Given the
Department of Planning's less optimistic projection, certainly for the
first three years, DEN's projected enrollment growth is unlikely to be
reached.
3.07      Based on projected enrollment increases and a replacement rate of
9% annually, DEN plans to construct about 2,500 new classrooms. It expects
the private sector to build an additional 3,700 new classrooms, mostly in
urban areas. However, with the existing implementation capacity, an
estimated 1,400 classrooms (400 urban and 1,000 rural) seem the maximum
feasible for the Plan period. There are no assurances, or government
incentives, that the private sector will actually build these classrooms.



- 14 -
3.08      Lastly, the performance of the private sector is unpredictable.
In its projections, DEN assumes a private sector growth of 6.5%, lower than
that in previous years (about 9%). However, the urban private sector's
growth responds to parents' demand, and in the present economic circum-
stances that may slacken. In rural areas, where many private schools are
funded through foreign charitable or community sources, growth patterns are
unpredictable. DEN, through its policy of treating rural private schools
as public schools in the educational reform, may provide a stimulus to the
rural private sector. No government incentive is expected for the urban
sector.
3.09      Education Reform.  The Government plans to introduce the new
educational structure gradually over a period of 3 years, starting with 40%
of the grade 1 classes in October 1982. This educational reform was
prepared during the last three years by DEN and IPN staff, the Curriculum
Committee 3/ and UNESCO technical assistance. Experimentation with some
of its features was financed under Credit 770-HA. The educational reform
as it now stands has grown out of the deliberations and experiments
conducted over the last several years. It was not clear from the outset
that it would lead to a major restructuring of the whole education system.
3.10      The education reform consists of the introduction of a new school
structure comprising ten years of basic education in three cycles (4+3+3)
followed by three years of secondary education (Chart 1 compares the exist-
ing and new systems). In addition to structural changes, the education
reform features the following points:
(a)   new curricula and syllabi;
(b)   new teaching methods;
(c)   introduction of the "Teacher Charter";
(d)   automatic promotion from grades 1 to 2 and 3 to 4; and
(e)   improved school supervision and inspection.
The restructuring of the system and dividing the ten years of basic
education in three cycles is an important step forward towards the goal of
providing education for all. In this system children who abandon school
after four years will have finished a self-contained education package.
Research has shown that permanent literacy can be achieved with four years
of basic education. In addition, the reform features qualitative
improvements.
3.11      New curricula and syllabi have been developed for grades 1 to 3
and are in various stages of being tested. Curriculum objectives and con-
tent for grades 1 to 4 have been agreed upon.  Objectives for grades 5 to 7
will be established later. The new curriculum differs from the old in that
it is taught in Creole, includes 3 months of schoolreadiness skills in the
first grade, and has only four subjects: reading, writing, mathematics and
environmental sciences. The latter are geared toward learning through
observation of the natural and social environment.
3/   An independent advisory body of education professionals set up under
Credit 618-HA to establish guidelines for curriculum development.

*  Reading and writing would be in Creole; oral French would be introduced

3.12      The new syllabi, textbooks, workbooks, teacher guides and teacher
aids would be developed by the Government (IPN's Curriculum and Educational
Materials Unit). These and some existing materials which have been
reviewed by the Curriculum Committee and DEN and which are consistent with
the objectives would be the only materials allowed for use in both public
and private schools. The Government wants to ensure that eventually all
classrooms have teacher guides, teaching aids, texts and workbooks for the
children. However, it would provide only the teacher guides and teaching
aids to all public and rural private schools. Urban private schools would
have to buy these materials themselves. Parents would have to purchase the
texts and workbooks for their children from commercial channels. At
present, books are often too expensive for parents (para. 2.24); therefore,
the Government wants to ensure that better and cheaper texts and workbooks
are for sale. It would ensure this by: (a) developing the materials
without charging royalties or author fees; (b) limiting IPN to strict
specifications on length, colors, etc.; (c) developing prototypes, to the
point where private industry needs only to print them; and (d) ensuring a
maximum price. After three years, the Government would allow the private
sector to develop competitive materials or to adapt IPN's materials. All
new texts would be reviewed by DEN and approved for consistency with
curriculum objectives.
3.13      The teaching innovations under the reform program would consist
of:
(a) use of Creole as language of instruction in grades 1 to 4;
(b) a teacher staying with a cohort for two years;
(c) grouping children in classrooms according to levels of ability;
(d) evaluating children by intermediate trimestral objectives and
moving them accordingly among groups; and
(e) increasing participation of children, utilizing their individual
experiences and capabilities, discovery learning rather than
memorization.
All teachers would be trained in these innovations and the curricula.

3.14      In November 1981, the DEN issued a new training policy with a
view to preparing all teachers involved in the reform. The new policy
introduces a sequence of teacher upgrading courses to be linked to
increased responsibilities and salary differentials. To free the pedago-
gical advisors (para. 2.21), it makes the teacher training colleges, rather
than the regional pedagogical centers, responsible for teacher training;
and it introduces a role for educational radio. From September 1981 on,
this dual objective of training for the reform and teacher upgrading would
be met by training teachers in eight-week (240 hours) courses followed by
one year of training through radio broadcasts (30 hours/year) (Table 3.4).

Phase 3        240 hours       20 hours  Teacher Training        Grades 1-7
College equivalency
After three phases, a teacher would receive the equivalent of a diploma of
attendance at a teacher training college. This teacher training sequence
has started in February 1982. Faculty of teacher training colleges who
provide the in-service teacher training courses were trained by IPN staff
in December 1981 under Credit 770-HA.
3.15      A draft Teacher Charter spelling out a career path and salary
levels differentiated by years of service and qualifications has been pre-
pared, financed under Credit 618-HA. As a first step towards its implemen-
tation, a 1981 survey was made of all public teachers, identifying level of
qualification, pedagogical experience, family size, etc. As a second step,
the Administrative Committee on Civil Service approved the Charter in March
1982. In September 1982, a Civil Service Charter was established, includ-
ing teachers as civil servants. The need for a special Teacher Charter is
thereby removed, however the proposals to modify the remuneration and
grading would still be valid. A study of the financial implications of the
Charter's recommendations, financed under Cr. 770-HA, has been completed.
In view of government financial constraints, the salary proposals would
probably have to be phased in over a five-year period. However, the estab-
lishment of a legal basis for the profession and even modest modifications
of the salary structure, are important steps forward in attracting new
staff to the profession, improving the morale of existing staff and
motivating them to undertake the changes so important to the successful
implementation of the eductional reform.
3.16      The efficiency of the system is supposed to be improved by intro-
ducing automatic promotion between grades 1 and 2 and between grades 3 and
4. During a period of two years, children would be able to move at their
own pace in achieving the objectives set for grade 2 and grade 4. Children
would be grouped according to ability and each trimester the teacher would
reorganize groups as necessary. DEN predicts an average of only 20% fail-
ure at the end of such a two-year period, compared with 63% in rural areas
at present.
3.17      In the future, the supervision system (para. 2.19) would inte-
grate inspection and pedagogical functions of supervision. This would only
be possible, however, when the education reform is fully implemented in
1993.  The advisors could then turn to routine supervision instead of
supervision of experimental programs.

/a   Regional Centers would gradually become district offices, and advisors
and inspectors would have the same training and functions.
3.18      For 1981/82, under Credit 770-HA, all directors and all inspec-
tors would be trained for one month by IPN in pedagogical supervision tech-
niques; and new inspectors are already receiving the same pre-service
training as pedagogical advisors. The advisors' time for supervision would
increase (para 2.21), although during 1981/82 the advisors would still be
responsible for training the directors.
3.19      The constraints on reaching the educational reform objectives are
mostly human and managerial, although financial constraints may also
develop. The success of the reform depends on the teachers and to some
extent on the inputs teachers receive. These teachers are mostly unquali-
fied and not financially motivated (paras. 2.19 and 2.20). Thus, even
though they would be trained and better supervised, it adds particular
difficulties to implement the new curriculum and teaching innovations
successfully.
3.20      The teachers' success, in part, will be determined by timely
delivery of inputs, e.g., training, supervision, materials, and efficient
management of reform preparation. The reform preparation and implementa-
tion plans had no built-in time contingencies. They were, in fact, set up
as high priority emergency type programs in each unit, with only loose
coordination between the units. With the establishment of the Reform Coor-
dination Committee in September 1981 (with PPF financing under the proposed
project, para. 1.05), responsibility was assigned for the first time for
the overall management of reform preparation and implementation. Since
that time, the Reform Coordination Committee in coordination with the
Curriculum Committee has established a tight work program and review
procedures. The Curriculum Committee and DEN's Planning Department have
now taken over the responsibility for monitoring the reform preparation and
implementation. Commitment of staff at the central level is high, yet it
is optimistic to expect a full commitment to the reform from staff at all
levels because of low civil servant salaries and low management capacity at
all levels.



- 18 -
3.21      Financial constraints may also influence the outcome of the
educational reform. The direct costs of the reform represent about 10% of
the development budget (US$10.8 million) and should not cause any major
problems. The financial implications of introduction of the Teacher
Charter on the recurrent budget have been studied, and, given a likely slow
growth of DEN's recurrent budget, this element of the reform may have to be
phased over a long time period.
3.22      Modernize Education Administration.  The Government is in the
process of carrying out an administrative reform consisting of a reorgani-
zation of DEN and a decentralization of its functions by creating regional
departments. The reorganization of DEN, substantially carried out in the
fall of 1981, is in accordance with the Organic Law of 1979. This law
creates a Department of Education with a new structure and it describes the
new functions of all departments and sections. Chart 2 describes the new
structure. Under this structure, a Director General was appointed and five
functional Departments were created (Planning, Inspection and Pedagogical
Assistance, Education, Personnel and Administration). In the old
structure, DEN was organized in accordance with the educational structure
(e.g., Department for Primary Education), and it lacked functions a modern
administration should have, such as having a good data base on the
personnel of the sector, or educational planning. IPN, an autonomous
institution, was also reorganized, and it consists of four sections under
the Study Directorate: training, evaluation, preparation of curricula and
education materials and supervision. The formerly independent Educational
Radio and Teaching/Learning Materials Unit have also be incorporated in
IPN. The reorganizations are taking place in step-by-step fashion, as all
participants attempt to reach agreement on the many changes proposed.
Although the Organic Law is clear on the functions of each unit in DEN, the
blueprint does not exactly fit the existing situation or take into account,
for instance, the changes caused by the educational reform going forward
simultaneously. Some of IPN's functions in pedagogical supervision and in-
service training, for example, would have to go to the Department of
Inspection and Pedagogical Assistance. A period of three years, starting
October 1981, is foreseen for the introduction of the administrative
reform. Budget cuts for 1981/82 have already restricted the amount of new
staff that could be hired, although salary levels were raised to attract
qualified staff.
3.23      Simultaneously, under the Government's regionalization scheme,
DEN would decentralize and create nine regional departments with 10 dis-
tricts each. These departments would become responsible for the day-to-day
functioning of the education system, while the DEN's central departments
would retain policy-making and normative functions. Regionalization is a
recent policy; two educational regional departments were created in 1981/
82. Until the regionalization is complete, in three to four years, a
mixture of old and new procedures would be used, and new and existing
structures would exist side by side (e.g., district inspectors and regional
pedagogical centers).
3.24      To implement this administrative reform, DEN faces serious finan-
cial and managerial constraints. The reorganization and regionalization
both demand more and qualified staff. With a limited growth in recurrent



- 19 -
budgets and other demands on the increase in recurrent budget (e.g., new
teachers, Teacher Charter), it might be difficult to recruit enough staff.
Recruitment is also difficult because of low public sector salaries (para.
3.20). A general salary increase of 50% to 100% for professional staff and
20% for support staff at the central level in October 1981 should havp
improved the situation, yet the total pool of qualified professional staff
in Haiti remains small. Many professionals have gone into other careers or
gone abroad, where earnings are better and career prospects are more
clearly defined.
3.25      The management of the administrative reform lies with DEN's
Planning Department, and the reform is being carried out by reaching a
collegial consensus within the Ministry of each step. However, the need
for simultaneous high outputs from the units to be reorganized, to ensure a
successful educational reform, has not been taken into account. Before a
reorganization, staff focuses on the day-to-day implications of the reorga-
nization for their jobs and positions; afterwards it takes time for a reor-
ganized unit to become fully operational again. The simultaneous implemen-
tation of two major reforms is likely to slow both.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project would assist the Haitian Government in
implementing the educational reform. Implementation of the reform would be
a gradual process, starting in 1982 with 40% of the grade 1 classes. The
proposed program originally was conceived and appraised as a single project
covering the implementation of the reform for grades 1 to 4 and the
experimentation for grades 5 to 7, for a period of 4 years starting with
nationwide introduction of the reform in 1982. However, in view of budget
shortages and constraints in external funding, the nationwide introduction
of the reform was rescheduled to a progressive introduction starting with
40% of the grade 1 classrooms in 1982, 70% in 1983 and 100% in 1984. The
project was subsequently divided into two phases, broadly as follows:
Phase I            Phase II
82/83 - 84/85      85/86 - 89/90
Grades: Introduction of reform          1 - 3              4 - 7
Grades: Experimentation                 2 - 6              5 - 10
New Classrooms to be Provided            180                360
The following discussion covers the details of Phase I, for which a lending
commitment is now sought.  It is expected that based on positive results in
phase I, external financing would be sought in 1984 for a second phase to
continue the reform program to about 1990. The proposed project would
assist the Government in implementing a first phase consisting of the first
three years of basic education. The project would address three main
objectives, namely to improve access, quality and the management of the
system.  In addition, the project would provide assistance in improving the
accountant's training.



- 20 -
4.02      The project would increase enrollments in basic education in
three Departments where participation is lowest, mostly in rural areas
(para. 2.04)--Sud, Sud-Est, and Grand'Anse) by:
(a) distributing the construction of new infrastructure according to
the results of a school mapping exercise;
(b) providing replacement and new physical facilities and furniture
and equipment for grades 1-4 (totaling about 180 classrooms); and
(c) constructing and furnishing about 45 teachers' accommodations.
4.03      The project would improve the quality of basic education by:
(a) testing and revising curricula for grades 5 and 6, as a
continuation of the curricula revision for grades 1 to 4 being
carried out under Credit 770-HA (para. 2.21);
(b) developing prototype textbooks and workbooks; producing, printing
and distributing teacher guides and other teaching materials in
accordance with the revised curricula (para. 2.23); and providing
textbooks for classrooms use;
(c) training and upgrading teachers, school directors, and school
supervisors (para. 2.18); and
(d) introducing an effective school supervision system (para. 2.20).
4.04      The project would improve and strengthen management by:
(a) assisting to set up a Reform Coordination Committee for the
purpose of coordinating implementation of the reform (para 3.20);
(b) establishing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation program;
and
(c) studying the impact of the reform on students' performance and
achievements, with particular reference to grades 1-4.
Finally, the project would assist in strengthening the accountants' profes-
sion by setting up a comprehensive examination.
Description of Project Elements
Objective 1: Increase Enrollments and Access
4.05      In order to increase access to basic education, the project would
finance school construction, the locations of which would be determined by
school mapping, as well as teacher housing in the constructed schools.
4.06      School Mapping Exercise (Proposed Outlay: US$0.2 million).  The
school mapping exercise started under Credit 770-HA and would be completed
under the proposed project. The objective of this component would be to



- 21 -
determine the precise location for the project schools to be built in the
three Departments included in the project: Sud, Sud-Est and Grand'Anse.
Selection of the three project departments was made in accordance with
three basic principles: (a) to reduce existing inequalities in rural parti-
cipation rates (Table 2.1); (b) to complement actions financed under Cre-
dits 618-HA and 770-HA; and (c) to provide assistance in geographic areas
struck by recent hurricanes. Staff were appointed in September 1981. The
school location study started in October 1981 with funds from Credit
770-HA, is being carried on with funds from the Project Preparation
Facility (para. 1.05) and would be completed by October 1983 under the
proposed project. The project would finance staff salaries, operational
costs, printing, data processing and 12 staff-months of technical assis-
tance. The study would consist of an inventory of existing facilities,
collection of demographic data, surveys of the topographical situation in
the field, and interviews with teachers and parents. The school mapping
would provide necessary information allowing for efficient organization of
a variable number of four-classroom schools around a seven-classroom
central school, thus increasing opportunity of access to any level of
primary education for school-age children in rural areas. Criteria for
school location were agreed upon with the Borrower during the appraisal
mission. 4/ During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
decisions on the location of project schools would be made on the basis of
criteria acceptable to the Association.
4.07      Physical Facilities (Proposed Outlay:  US$2.7 million).  In order
to provide better access, the project would construct about 45 schools,the
exact location to be determined after completion of the school mapping
exercise. The schools would each accommodate 200 students in grades 1-4
with four teachers. Housing facilities for four teachers would be provided
in all 45 schools.
4/   The school location criteria are:
A.   For four classroom schools:
1.  Minimum population density of 1,000 in an area of 28 km2.
2.  Maximum distance students should walk between home and school
3 km.
3.  Year-round access.
4.  Maximum class size of 50.
B.   For seven classroom schools:
1.  Minimum population density of about 1,400, but with minimum
of 25 students in grades 5, 6 and 7.
2.  Maximum distance 3 km. for each of first cycle students,
5 km. for second cycle.
3.  Year-round access.
4.  Maximum class size of 50.



- 22 -
4.08       The project would finance the construction, furnishing and equip-
ping of these schools with a total of about 180 classrooms. About half
would replace existing unsatisfactory facilites (para. 2.06); the other
half would expand school places at the primary level (grades 1-4). The
proposed geographic distribution of these facilites reflects the replace-
ment need in Grand'Anse following the hurricane, and the relatively better
position of Sud-Est compared with the others.  The tentative distribution
of the facilities to be provided would be as follows:
Table 4.1: DISTRIBUTION OF SCHOOLS
Schools  Teacher Housing        Classrooms          Student Places
Region                                  New  Repl.  Total  Total  Of Which New
Sud-Est          10           10          20   20       40    2,000    1,000
Sud              13           13          28   24       52    2,600    1,400
Grand'Anse       22          22           44   44       88    4,400    2,200
45          45          92   88      180    9,000    4,600
The total number of classrooms to be built would meet about 8% of the
overall national requirements for new classrooms and 6% of the overall
requirements for replacements as identified in the Third Development Plan.
However, in each of the Departments the number of classrooms represents the
following proportions of total needs: 22% in Sud-Est; 14% in Sud; and 28%
in Grand'Anse. Expansion beyond these numbers is not considered
financially feasible in the near term (para. 3.06).
4.09       In view of positive experiences in the previous two projects,
housing for teachers would be included in all 45 schools. By providing
economical housing for teachers in schools located in remote villages under
Credit 618-HA, the operation of schools substantially improved because
attendance of teachers became regular. In addition, housing serves as an
incentive for attracting better teachers for small communities. Housing
would, however, be simpler than in previous projects. Since most teachers
leave their families in more urban settings and only live at the school
during weekdays, a one-classroom module would be constructed wich would
serve as simple sleeping quarters for four teachers, but could also be
converted to a classroom if there is no need for teacher housing. A
systematic analysis of the performance of teachers who benefit from housing
facilities has been included in the proposed school mapping exercise.
Objective 2: Improve Quality
4.10       The educational reform focuses on the improvement of quality.  In
order to facilitate the implementation of the reform, the project would
finance curriculum development, teaching materials, training programs, and
improvement of the supervision system.



- 23 -
4.11      Curriculum Development (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.4 million).
Introduction of a new curriculum (para. 3.11) is the core of the educa-
tional reform. To help ensure its proper implementation, the project would
finance:
(a) 100% of the salaries for 18 technical staff for the IPN Curri-
culum Unit. The staff would receive limited contracts of three
years;
(b) 24 staff-months of local specialist services in curriculum
theory, development and content;
(c) twenty-one staff months of international technical assistance in
curriculum development; and
(d) three staff-months of international technical assistance in
health, nutrition and population education.
In addition, UNDP would finance technical assistance of about US$0.5
million comprising 52 staff-months of foreign specialist services and 30
staff-months of local specialist services.
4.12      The Government's program for introducing the new curriculum in
grades 1 to 3 and developing it for grades 4 to 6 is considered feasible
during the project implementation period (1982-85) because procedures for
developing, testing and revising the curriculum were established under
Credit 770-HA. These same procedures would be applied in the proposed
project. Implementation of the curriculum on a nationwide basis would be
facilitated by training programs for teachers and supervisors.
4.13      IPN, Curriculum and Educational Materials Unit (para. 3.12),
divided into task forces for each subject made up of Haitian staff, would
be responsible for this component. These task forces would design content
and curriculum materials per grade and would be assisted by French
bilateral subject matter specialists. Task forces already exist for the
subjects taught in grades 1 to 4; new ones would be established for grades
5 to 7. The Curriculum Committee (para. 3.09) would review the integrated
package for consistency with the official objectives and curriculum
content.
4.14      The draft curriculum would then be tested during a three-year
period, according to the schedule currently in use--namely, starting with
70 classrooms in the first year, extending to 230 and then 600 classrooms.
In 1981/82, IPN's regional centers would select one school, and observe one
classroom per grade following the experimental curricula for intensive
experimentation and almost daily observation. IPN staff and pedagogical
advisors in the regional centers would observe other classrooms weekly and
discuss problems at monthly meetings with all participating teachers.



- 24 -
In addition, the teachers of the experimental classes have all gone through
the two months training course and would receive periodic follow-up
training days on specific topics. All teachers keep logs with
observations. Based on these systematic observations, the curriculum would
be revised and then experimented with on a larger scale. From 1982/83 to
1984/85 the following experimental schedule would be implemented, as shown
in Table 4.2 below. Also, the IPN Curriculum and Educational Materials
Unit would be responsible for conducting experiments with curricula for
overage students. During 1981/82 the first grade curriculum would be
tested on classes consisting only of overage children; it would be adapted
subsequently.

4.15      The introduction of the reform, starting with about 40% of all
grade 1 classrooms in October 1982, and extending it to 70% grade 1 classes
by October 1983 and to all grade classes by October 1984, is considered
feasible because during 1981/82 under Credit 770-HA about 1,000 teachers
for grade 1 received the in-service training course, and about half of the
directors were trained in supervision techniques at the regional centers by
the pedagogical advisors. From October 1982 on, grade 1 teachers who
underwent the basic training several years ago, would be given a refresher
course, so that by October 1984 all grade 1 teachers would have received up
to date training. From October 1982 on, the pedagogical advisors would be



- 25 -
able to devote full time to supervision. For subsequent years, adequate
training and supervision programs would ensure introduction on a nationwide
basis for the new grades.
4.16      Educational Materials (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.8 million),  The
objective of this component is to provide better and cheaper books to all
school children (para. 3.12). Under the proposed project 16 titles would
be developed. About 3 million texts and workbooks would be produced and
subsequently distributed by private enterprises for sale to some 400,000 in
grade 1 to 3 children. In addition, under the project some 175,000 teacher
guides and experimental materials would be produced for distribution free
of charge to public schools, and some 105,000 textbooks would be purchased
for classroom use in grade 1 to 3 (Table 4.3). The project would finance
development of textbooks and workbooks, and development, production and
distribution of teacher guides and teaching aids. It would finance six
staff for the Teaching/Learning Materials Unit in IPN as well as 21
staff-months of international technical assistance. The project would
provide 16 staff-months of local consultancy in textbook publishing,
specialized staff in administration and editing, the service of typesetting
composing the experimental materials, and the cost of distributing the
latter. UNDP would finance about 12 staff-months of expatriate specialist
services and about 12 staff-months of local specialist services amounting
to about US$0.1 million.
4.17      The IPN Curriculum and Educational Materials Unit would be res-
ponsible for the first stage of the production process: development and
testing of the educational materials during the experimental stages. It
would also produce the final version of the materials prior to nationwide
introduction. The Teaching/Learning Materials Unit would then be responsi-
ble for the development of the manuscripts to prototype stage. At that
point private printers would be invited to bid for production and distribu-
tion contracts. Inspectors and regional pedagogical centers would be
responsible for the distribution of the teacher guides and aids and of the
textbooks for classroom use. Textbooks and workbooks would be sold through
regular commercial channels, which are well-developed and could serve both
the rural and urban markets.
4.18      The textbooks, workbooks and teacher guides would be produced at
lower cost than similar materials at present. For instance, under the pro-
ject, texts and workbooks would become available at US$2.00-5.00 per grade
per child, maximally US$6 during the life of the project, instead of US$6-8
per grade per child charged at present (Table 4.4). This would be possible
for four reasons. First, IPN would develop the materials and would not
charge author fees or royalties. Second, IPN would adhere to strict
specifications developed at appraisal and listed in Annex 2, which would
limit the cost of the materials. Third, the Teaching/Learning Materials
Unit would develop prototypes for all materials before handing them over to
the private sector for printing, thereby eliminating development, e.g.,
typesetting costs, from the cost of the materials. This unit would also
develop teaching aids such as posters, rubber stamps, which would bring
down the need for expensive textbooks. For instance, rubber stamps for
arithmetic (i.e., rubber stamps with numbers and arithmetic signs) would be

distributed to all teachers so they could make up worksheets, thereby
eliminating the need for an arithmetic workbook in the first two grades.
Fourth, the sale price the private sector would be allowed to charge would
be subject to a maximum controlled price.  The lower prices of the texts
and workbooks would mean that parents would be able to buy these more
easily for their children than at present. Even now, with high prices,
parents often sacrifice other necessities to be able to buy books because
education is seen as the avenue for upward mobility. Offering the books at
lower prices is expected to increase demand significantly.  These prices
were tentatively established at appraisal in coordination with the private
sector (Table 4.4).  During negotiations, the Government agreed to a
maximum price of US$6 per student per year, based on the agreed titles and
number of books according to agreed specifications. The Government also
gave assurances that it would operate a monitoring and control mechanism to
enforce the maximum price.

4.19      With major private sector involvement, the Government would
finance mainly the development costs of new textbooks for the reform.  The
private sector, consisting of three major companies, has the capacity to
undertake printing and distribution and would be responsible for the print-
ing and distribution costs. Private firms would be allowed a reasonable
profit margin on sales. This arrangement would be attracti-e to the
private sector because it would have a reasonably assured market. The
Government would already have tested the texts (para. 4.18), and in order
to assure the teaching of the new curriculum, they would be the only ones
allowed for use in all schools, public or private, for three years. After
that the private sector would be able to develop its own materials or to
revise IPN's materials. DEN plans to set up a review committee to review
all new texts in accordance with the curriculum objectives.
4.20      Classroom use of the books would be facilitated because all
teachers would receive training prior to the beginning of the school year
on the utilization of the materials, and all urban and rural private
teachers would receive teacher guides and teaching aids based on the
materials. Urban private schools would have to buy these teacher guides
and aids.
4.21      In order to ensure that all children have access to the new
materials, eleven copies of each textbook would be placed in each classroom
(on average, one per four students). Parents would still have to purchase
the workbooks, but having the textbooks available would ease the burden for
the poorest families. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances
that it would provide by August each year for the duration of the project
textbooks in a ratio of one per four students for grades 1 to 3 in the
classrooms involved in the education reform.
4.22      Training Programs (Proposed Outlay:  US$2.0 million).  Success of
the reform would depend to a large extent on changes in teacher attitude
and in supervision methodology. In order to make such changes, it would be
necessary to train all levels of staff. Specifically, teachers would have
to be trained in the new curriculum and the use of teaching materials and
methodologies; directors and inspectors in supervisory skills; and pedago-
gical advisors in new supervisory and teaching methodologies (Table 4.5).
In order to assist in implementing the reform, the project would finance:
(a)  for all participants of traning courses:  allowances, materials
and transportation costs (Table 4.5);
(b)  for teacher in-service training courses:  salaries of trainers
and teacher replacements in public and rural private schools;
(c)  for IPN:  ten staff members, six months of technical assistance,
three vehicles and their operational costs; and
(d)  for the educational radio:  20 staff-months of local consultants,
and twelve staff-months of international technical assistance and
support for broadcasts, printed materials and training courses
for educational radio's teacher training program.
Urban private schools would be able to send their teachers to the teacher
training courses. They themselves would have to pay for teacher replace-
ment, transport and course allowances. UNDP would finance about
US$0.2 million of international technical assistance comprised of 26 staff-
months of radio experts in production and evaluation.

4.23      Most training courses already exist; the two-month, in-service
teacher training course would be adapted from the existing three-month
course, and the radio training courses would be developed and experimented
with during 1981/82. Based on an evaluation of the outcomes of the
previous year's training program, annual training programs would be
adjusted and developed.
4.24      The teacher training courses would take place at the teacher
training colleges, which are large enough to handle some 3,200 teachers per
year. Three training courses would take place in afternoons during the
school year, and one during school vacation. Three faculty members, each
earning US$200 per month, would handle a group of about 30 teachers.
Teacher training colleges do not operate during afternoons, and this would
be a second job for faculty members.
4.25      The radio would broadcast weekly training programs for teachers.
School directors would receive training on how to utilize these broadcasts,
and each director and teacher would receive questionnaires to determine the
broadcasts' effectiveness. During their monthly meeting, radio training
would be given by advisors. All programs would be developed by a joint
Radio/IPN training team, which has already been formed.
4.26      As a result of the proposed training plan and the training
financed under Credit 770-HA during 1981/82, virtually 100% of the
participants in the educational reform would be trained in its objectives
and content.
4.27      Pedagogical Supervision (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.6 million).
Success of the reform would depend on close pedagogical supervision of the
implementation of the new curriculum. IPN's regional centers would be
responsible for this task. The pedagogical advisors would be the key
people monitoring the introduction of the reform. The project would
finance improvements to the regional centers, enabling the advisors to work
more efficiently. Specifically, the project would finance:
(a) equipment, furniture and office supplies for the offices and
training facilities at the regional centers; and
(b) four motorcycles per center and their operational costs and US$30
per month for travel expenses per advisor to enable the advisor
to reach outlying schools.
4.28      The functions of the advisors and the regional centers are under-
going changes, preparing the centers to play a more effective role in the
introduction of the reform.  Advisors were freed from giving in-service
teacher training courses (para. 3.14), and a new system of supervision of
the experimental curriculum (para. 2.20) should also free the advisors for
other tasks.
4.29      These changes, together with facilities, vehicles and travel
expenses, should improve the advisor's ability to supervise the schools
around the centers effectively. As new centers are created, the intensity
of supervision would be increased. IPN graduates 25 new advisors a year, a



- 31 -
rate wllich would enable it to establish four new regional centers per
year. This would gradually increase the intensity of supervision and de-
crease the number of teachers each advisor would have to supervise from 127
in 1980/81 to about 100 in 1985/86. Moreover, supervision at the school
level would improve as a result of the gradual integration of the inspec-
tion and pedagogical supervision system (para. 3.17) and the graduation of
15 inspectors per year trained in supervision. IPN recently created a
Pedagogical Supervision Unit, responsible for coordination and control of
activities of the Regional Supervision Centers. Monthly work and travel
programs for each advisor are required and carefully monitored; e.g., gaso-
line allowances are distributed in the form of coupons.
Objective 3: Improve Management
4.30      In order to carry out the reform efficiently, it would be neces-
sary to strengthen and improve the Government's management capabilities.
In view of this, the project would finance the establishment of the Reform
Coordination Committee, project administration, and monitoring and evalua-
tion studies.
4.31      Reform Coordination Committee (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.05 mil-
lion). In order to ensure that the nationwide introduction of the educa-
tional reform would be prepared and carried out on schedule, it was neces-
sary that one unit be specifically in charge of coordination of the reform
(para. 3.20).  Only the Minister himself had that role and function at the
time of appraisal. A Reform Coordination Committee, established in
September 1981 directly under the Minister, was in charge of preparing
policy analyses on decisions required to be taken by the Minister. It
also, in the Minister's name, instructed all units implementing the reform
to take specific action and monitor preparation and implementation. Its
members were respected, independent education authorities who had no direct
line of responsibility for the implementation of the reform. Prompted by
the establishment of this committee existing organizations such as the
Curriculum Committee and DEN, Planning Department have strengthened their
monitoring functions. With a more gradual introduction of the reform, they
are now capable of the necessary coordination, and the Reform Coordination
Committee would be abolished after one year. The project, under the
Project Preparation Facility (para. 1.05), would finance the salaries of
five committee members and two support staff during one year (1981/82) as
well as office supplies and furniture.
4.32      Project Administration (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.7 million).  The
project would finance the staff and operational costs of the Project Imple-
mentation Unit from December 1982 to December 1985. Before that date all
costs, including cost of new staff hired, would be financed under Credit
770-HA. In addition, funds would be available to employ consultants (10-12
staffmonths) as necessary to assist the project unit in project implementa-
tion, e.g. in establishing a more efficient system of accounts. Costs of
the audit of project accounts (US$50,000) has also been included in this
component. It would be financed by the Government.
4.33      Monitoring and Evaluation Studies (Proposed Outlay:  US$0.2 mil-
lion). This project element includes financing of monitoring and evalua-
tion studies to be carried out by DEN's Evaluation Unit and the IPN
Research Unit and financing of preinvestment studies as needed. The moni-
toring study, to be carried out by IPN, would focus on the productivity of
the key educational inputs. In the study four sets of variables would be
monitored:



- 32 -
(a) the work conditions in the classroom, including number and age of
students, dropout rates, number of hours of instruction given,
and physical condition;
(b) the effectiveness of the curriculum, education materials, radio
and automatic promotion measures;
(c) the effectiveness of the production and distribution system for
educational materials, i.e., how many and at what price books are
sold; and
(d) the effectiveness of the training and supervision programs,
including actual data on schoolvisits and their impact.
In addition DEN's Evaluation Unit would monitor:
(a) the effects of the introduction of the Teacher Charter (para.
3.15), e.g., less attrition, more teachers following in-service
training courses; and
(b) the reaction of the private sector to the educational reform,
e.g., number of teachers trained, use of curriculum.
4.34      The project would finance staff, operational costs, printing and
data processing for these studies. The cost for 1981/82 and 1982/83 would
be financed under Credit 770-HA. Research coordinators responsible for the
monitoring studies in the evaluation unit and in the IPN Research Unit were
appointed in September 1981. Before negotiations, the Government provided
terms of reference and work programs for all monitoring and evaluation
studies satisfactory to IDA.  It also provided IDA with the draft Teacher
Charter and analysis of its financial implications.
4.35      IPN's Research Unit would evaluate the impact of the reform on
student performance and achievement during the first four years of basic
education. Terms of Reference for this study were discussed and agreed
during appraisal. The study would assess the impact of reform measures
(i.e., including Creole, automatic promotion, new teaching methods) on
student cognitive, attitudinal and behavioral patterns. The assessment
would also take into account family background, social environment and
individual capabilities. The study would be carried out in a representa-
tive sample of 21 classrooms throughout the country. The project would
finance the purchase of one vehicle and its operation, four staff members,
local consultants and interviewers, the purchase of tests and materials,
and administrative costs. Quarterly work programs and progress reports
would be presented to DEN, the Reform Coordination Committee and all other
organizations involved in the reform. Before negotiations, staff members
of IPN's Research Unit were hired and a detailed research design covering
the impact of the reform on student performance and achievement was
presented to the IDA.
4.36      Accountants' Examination (Proposed Outlay US$0.1 million).  This
project element would finance the technical assistance necessary to:  (a)
develop a standard curriculum and procedures for an examination which would
lead to a government certificate for accountants, and (b) review the
results annually. The examination should be administered on a self-
financing basis. The fee necessary to cover the cost of the examination
and subsequent grading would be a small fraction of the tuition which



- 33 -
commercial school students currently pay. The list of topics to be covered
by the examination would be based on the outline for a certificate program
prepared for INAGHEI by CIDA technical assistance staff. During negotia-
tions the Government agreed to establish the fee and publish the standard
curriculum for the examination by July 1983.
4.37      The project would finance 8-10 staff months of technical
assistance; six of those would be required to develop the procedures for
examination (jointly with DEN, INAGHEI and the commercial schools),
proposing the curriculum, establishing an organization and work program to
administer the examination; and recruiting and training the necessary
staff.  The consultant should review the program at the time the first
examination is administered and at 12-month intervals over the following
years. During negotiations the Government agreed to:
(a)  engage a qualified consultant no later than June 30, 1983;
(b)  administer the first examination in the summer of 1984;
(c)  discuss with IDA the results of the annual reviews no later than
September 1985; and
(d)  introduce adjustments agreed upon before the subsequent session.
4.38      Technical Assistance.  A total of about 287 staff-months of
technical assistance would be provided to assist in the implementation of
the educational reform (Table 4.6). This technical assistance would come
from IDA and from UNDP. In both cases it would be provided by Unesco (with
the exception of the technical assistance to be provided to the project
unit and the accountants' examination). Contracts were signed in March
1982. The contract to be financed under this project is divided in two
phases; one covered under the Project Preparation Facility, the other going
into effect only when the proposed project would become effective. The
UNDP-financed technical assistance contract is for a period of four years,
effective April 1982.

4.39      The Association's component of technical assistance would finance
155 staff-months at an estimated total cost of about US$810,000; or a
staff-month cost of US$300 to US$500 for local consultants and of about
US$7,800 to US$9,000 for international consultants. The costs for the



- 34 -
international consultants include salary, costs, fees, subsistence and
international travel. The technical assistance would be in support of
school mapping, curriculum development, educational materials development,
training programs, project administration and accountants' examination
(paras. 4.06, 4.11, 4.16, 4.22,4.32, and 4.36 respectively). Employment of
such consultants through a contract with Unesco is acceptable to IDA in
accordance with the guidelines of August 1981. The other consultants would
be hired in accordance with IDA guidelines (para. 4.32 and 4.37). UNDP
would finance 90 staff-months of international consultants and about 42
staff-months of national consultants for a total of about US$860,000 in
curriculum development, educational materials, educational radio, and
subject matter specialists. UNDP staff month's costs range from US$6,700
to US$11,000 for international experts and US$1,000 for local experts.
4.40      Parallel Actions.  It is likely that construction of the success-
ful preschool nutrition centers on the premises of project schools,
financed by CARE with USAID assistance, would be continued under this
project. CARE is currently constructing these centers parallel to con-
struction of schools under Credit 770-HA. UNICEF, in its next four-year
program, would also focus on preschool education centers with an estimated
investment of US$5.5 million. Under the proposed Forestry Project IPN
would receive technical assistance in developing curriculum units for
grades 1 to 7 dealing with environment, notably erosion control and
importance of reforestation. In addition, some 400 teacher training
college faculty members and rural school teachers would be trained in
forestry aspects, and demonstration woodlots would be planted in selected
rural areas.
V. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
Cost of the Project
5.01      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$10.9
million, net of taxes. In order to conserve on the use of expensive
technical assistance and foreign exchange:
(a)   the educational programs would make use of local staff and
consultants as much as possible; and
(b)   school construction would make use of local materials,
architects/ engineers, standardized designs and community
participation in construction.
A Project Preparation Facility of US$550,000 was approved in September 1981
(para. 1.05). The cost of this PPF is included in the cost of the
project. The breakdown of total cost by project item and type of expendi-
ture is summarized below:

/a   Includes about US$1 million for implementation of the training courses, e.g. course
and transport allowances for participants.

5.02      Base Cost.  Cost estimates are based on July 1981 prices (updated
to estimated July 1982 prices) and the actual costs obtained under Credits
618-HA and 770-HA. Except for the cost of school sites, total project cost
includes, in addition to capital expenditures, virtually all implementation
expenditures (salaries, consumable goods, transportation, telex, training
costs etc.). Special attention has been given to estimating staff and
implementation expenditures, representing about 26% and 13% of total
project cost, respectively. All staff hired under the project would have
three-year contracts, with option of renewal if necessary for one year.
Implementation costs occur in the implementation of the educational reform,
and project administration. Estimates for administration costs have been
based on the PIU accounting of Credit 618-HA and Credit 770-HA.  Teacher
training costs range from US$70 to US$185 per month, depending on replace-
ment and travel costs. Teachers' guides are estimated at an average unit
cost of US$2.00; students' experimental textbooks and workbooks for grades
5 and 6 have unit costs ranging from US$0.40 to US$0.60.
5.03      Construction costs for school facilities have been estimated on
the basis of the similar design of schools being built under Credit
770-HA. The designs are simplified by using hinged windows instead of
jalousies, roof beams instead of roof trusses, and making cement blocks at
the construction site. This simplification would promote fuller partici-
pation of communities in school building and greater use of local
materials. Building costs for rural primary schools, which are low by any
standards, would be about US$150 per square meter, ranging from US$140 to
US$155 per square meter of gross construction area. The variation in
price is due to difficult access to certain sites. Maximum use of:
(a) community participation in school construction; (b) local materials;
and (c) prefabricated elements would be sought to counterbalance such
factors. It is common practice in Haiti to build community facilities with
community participation; usually some skilled and mostly unskilled labor is
available in each community, and the cost of local labor is lower than the
average wage. Community participation and contracts with small contractors
or entrepreneurs should result in costs which are about 20% below conven-
tional contracting prices. Salaries of architects/engineers (estimated at
US$600 to US$700 per staff-month), PIU support staff, and the cost of other
professional services (soil testing, surveying, etc.) represent about 7% of
construction costs included in the PIU budget.
5.04      Furniture and equipment lists have been reviewed and approved
during appraisal and have been found reasonable in scope and cost, which
amounts to 11% and 15%, respectively, of the construction cost.  Transpor-
tation costs will be monitored through monthly comparison of actual expen-
ditures against project costs based on the PIU experience in Credit 618-HA.



- 38 -
5.05      Foreign Exchange Component.  The total foreign exchange component
is estimated at about US$5.1 million or about 47% of total project cost net
of taxes. Foreign exchange costs were estimated at 50% for construction
and site development, 70% for furniture, 95% for equipment and foreign
technical assistance, 80% for educational materials and 40% for implementa-
tion costs excluding salaries (para. 5.02). No foreign exchange component
has been estimated for local experts.
5.06      Duties and Taxes.  Taxes are expected to be negligible since all
items imported specifically for the project would be exempt from customs
duties and taxes under current regulations.
5.07      Contingency Allowances.  Physical contingencies (US$0.6 million)
have been estimated at 5% of construction, furniture, equipment and consul-
tant services and 10% of staff, teaching materials, and implementation
costs. Price contingencies (US$1.9 million) are based on the following
assumptions: (a) activities in all components except construction would
start by end-1982; (b) construction would start by January 1984, and
procurement of furniture and equipment by October 1983; (c) local costs
are expected to increase 10% in 1982, 9% in 1983, and 8% in 1984/86; and
(d) annual increases in foreign costs are expected to be: 8.5% for 1982,
7.5% for 1983-85, and 6% for 1986.
Financing and Disbursement Plans
5.08      Financin  Plan.  The total project cost of about US$10.9 million

March on the proposed budget allocations for the project and would review
annually before August 15 the adequacy thereof.

5.09      Disbursement Plan.  The schedule of estimated disbursements is
shown in the following table:

2     2,340    9,000       100.0
This disbursement profile is based on the actual profiles of Credits 618-HA
and 770-HA and the education sector in Latin America and Caribbean Region
over FY70-80.
h.10      Recurrent Costs.  The annual recurrent expenditure likely to be
generated by the project upon its completion is estimated to reach about
G2.5 million in constant 1981 prices. This represents 2.5% of the recur-
rent budget of the Department of Education in 1986/87 and 3.8% of the
primary education recurrent budget projected for 1986/87 (first year after
completion of the project). It would represent about 13% of the increment
of the education recurrent budget between 1980-81 and 1986-87. The Govern-
ment gives priority to the project, and is expected to be able to accommo-
date the incremental costs without undue difficulty. However, the Govern-
ment would also have to set aside from its development budget, which is
estimated to be about US$4 million per year according to the Education
Sector Plan, about US$2 million for the period 1985-88 in order to complete
the implementation of the reform on a nationwide scale for the full first
cycle.
Project Administration and Implementation
5.11      Administration of the project (coordination, implementation,
supervision, and monitoring) would be the responsibility of the existing
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), originally established under CONADEP to
implement Credit 618-HA. The PIU was expanded to implement Credits 618-HA
and 770-HA simultaneously, and it has been reassigned under DEN since
November 1979. The PIU is expected to complete implementation of Credit
770-HA by December 31, 1984, one year behind schedule. Consequently,
strengthened with a few additional staff, the PIU would have adequate
capacity to implement the proposed project. Current staffing of the PIU
is as follows: one project director (educator), one deputy director



- 40 -
(architect), one civil engineer, two assistant engineers, two accountants,
one procurement officer, one educator, one community promoter, and support-
ing staff. In addition, for the implementation of the proposed project the
following staff would be recruited: (a) one educator; (b) two assistant
educators; (c) one assistant accountant, and (d) one assistant procurement
officer.
5.12      Besides directly implementing and supervising school construction
activities, the PIU would coordinate the activities of IPN, and DEN's
Planning, Programming and Evaluation Department, which share the responsi-
bility of implementing the project, especially the educational aspects.
IPN consists of four divisions, involved in project implementation: train-
ing unit, curriculum-learning materials unit, evaluation unit and pedago-
gical supervision unit, each responsible for the respective programs.
Recently, the Teaching/learning Materials Unit and the Educational Radio
were also incorporated in IPN; they would be responsible for the develop-
ment of the teaching/learning materials and the distribution of the experi-
mental materials and of the teachers guides, and for implementing the radio
teacher training program respectively. DEN's Planning, Programming and
Evaluation Department would be responsible for the school mapping exercise
and, with IPN, for the monitoring and evaluation studies. The Reform
Coordination Committee is directly placed under the Minister.
5.13      Project Monitoring and Evaluation.  The PIU would be responsible
for preparing periodic progress reports which would provide information on
the quantitative aspects of the project. The standard forms developed
under Credit 770-HA for this purpose would be revised to suit the reporting
requirements of this proposed project, and the relevant information would
be sent on a quarterly basis to the Bank and the DEN departments. Monitor-
ing of the reform preparation and implementation would be the specific
responsibility of the Curriculum Committee and DEN's Planning Department.
They would receive quarterly progress reports on the monitoring studies to
be carried out by research units of IPN and the Department of Planning
(para. 3.24). A project completion report would be prepared by the Govern-
ment within six months of project completion. Funding for this final
project evaluation is included in the project administration budget. DEN's
Evaluation Unit would be responsible for the overall evaluation of the two
reforms. The research unit with IPN would be responsible for student and
school evaluation; it would carry out a national study of academic achieve-
ments.
5.14      Readiness for Implementation.  The project is at an advanced
stage of preparation because of the provision of the Project Preparation
Facility (para. 1.05). Staff for curriculum development, educational
materials, IPN's Research Unit and the Reform Coordination Committee have
already been hired in part. Programs for all the software components would
be ready for implementation in September 1982, since almost all of these
programs are continuations of existing work programs. The Government has
established curriculum objectives and a study plan for Grades 1 to 4.
Construction of the first schools would start January 1984. Master lists



- 41 -
of equipment were approved during appraisal for all project components.
Detailed training programs were approved during appraisal. The first phase
of the school mapping exercise should be completed by September 1982; the
exercise for all three departments would be finished by December 1983.
5.15      Implementation.  Project implementation is expected to be com-
pleted in about four years including implementation under the Project
Preparation Facility. A summarized implementation schedule, shown in
Chart 3, was discussed with DEN officials during appraisal and agreed upon
as a project implementation and monitoring tool, which will be followed by
a CPM chart to be prepared by the PIU. The project completion date would
be June 30, 1986; the closing date, December 31, 1986.
Procurement
5.16      Construction.  Due to the small sizes and dispersed locations of
project schools, the contract packages are not expected to attract foreign
contractors, but foreign bidders will not be precluded from offering con-
struction proposals. Experience under Credits 618-HA and 770-HA shows that
civil works contractors operating in Port-au-Prince find it inconvenient
and unprofitable to construct schools in remote, isolated communities which
characterize project school sites. Consequently, they do not participate
in regular local bidding procedures. Construction contracts would be
awarded on a negotiated basis with small local contractors prequalified by
the PIU.  Tho bulk of building materials (cement, steel, lumber, roofing
sheets, electrical and plumbing materials, etc.) amounting to about
US$850,000 would be procured through ICB and provided to local contractors
by the PIU. Support from the Public Works road engineers (in terms of
building materials delivery and construction supervision) would be secured,
and a fixed fee for supervising engineers and delivery costs, where
incurred, would be financed under the project.
5.17      Furniture, Equipment and Materials.  Contracts for furniture,
equipment and school materials, including textbook printing, (about
US$600,000) would be procured through ICB in accordance with IDA guidelines
(the use of the facilities of UNICEF for procurement of primary school fur-
niture, equipment and materials would be considered). Furniture, equipment
and materials which cannot be grouped in packages of at least US$50,000
expected to aggregate about US$250,000, would be procured through LCB pro-
cedures, which have been found acceptable to IDA. Items not exceeding
US$3,000 per contract, amounting to about US$100,000, unsuitable for pro-
curement through competitive bidding would be procured through local shop-
ping and would include to the extent possible, quotations from at least
three manufacturers or suppliers. In the case of ICB, domestic manufac-
turers would be allowed a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal to
the prevailing tariff or 15% of the CIF price of competing foreign sup-
pliers, whichever is lower.
5.18      IDA Review of Tender Documents Contracts and Work Programs.
Draft tender and contract documents for building materials, school
materials, furniture, equipment and textbook printing and purchasing
contracts would be forwarded for IDA review and approval. IDA approval of
tender evaluation documents would be required prior to the award of all
such contracts. For civil works the P.I.U. would prepare and submit for

approved estimates would be the ceiling cost for each phase.  For the
reform implementation components, PIU would prepare and submit for approval
annual implementation plans and detailed cost estimates.
Disbursement
5.19      The proposed credit, which would finance 83% of total project
costs, is expected to be disbursed over a period of four years (para.
5.09). Through the Project Preparation Facility up to US$0.55 million
will be disbursed by December 31, 1982. Since experience with other
projects has shown that budgetary constraints limit the capacity of Govern-
ment to pre-finance expenditures to be reimbursed under IDA credits, a
working fund of US$0.5 million equivalent, to be opened and maintained by
withdrawal from the Credit Account, would be established in a special
account opened in an appropriate bank. IDA would commence recovery of the
initial deposit when the undisbursed credit amount plus any commitments to
commercial banks has reached the level of US$1.0 million. The special
account shall be subject to specific audit each fiscal year in accordance
with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied, by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA. Establishment of the special account and of a
regular project account by the Government would be conditions for credit
effectiveness.
5.20      The table below indicates the categories which would be financed
out of the proceeds of the credit, the amounts allocated to each category
and the percentages to be financed.

Disbursements would be made against withdrawal applications prepared by the
PIU and submitted to the Bank, with standard documentation covering
procurement of building materials, furniture and equipment. Statement of
expenditures with an aggregate value of US$3.4 million would be utilized
for disbursing on salaries, labour for construction and implementation
expenditures of: (a) school construction; (b) project administration;
(c) six items related to the educational reform; and (d) the school mapping
exercise, all seven items to be implemented under the responsibility of IPN
and DEN staff.  Statements of expenditures would follow detailed official
working agreements 5/ prepared for each item in a fashion satisfactory to
IDA and would be subject to specific auditing.  In addition, withdrawal
applications for payments for items procured using LCB or local shopping
procedures in amounts less than US$3,000 for project administration,
studies, training, and professional services would be supported by
statements of expenditures. Supporting documentation for such statements
would not be sent to IDA but would be available for review during
supervision missions.
Accounts and Audit
5.21      The PIU would maintain a separate account for the project, in
accordance with acceptable accounting practices. Expenditures incurred for
each project element would be recorded separately to facilitate monitoring
of project costs. A quarterly summary of project accounts reflecting
cumulative expenditures incurred by the end of the quarter would accompany
progress reports sent to IDA for information. Annual auditing would be
required for all expenditures financed under the project, in particular,
for those expenditures reimbursed under SOE procedures. General auditing
of the PIU's accounts would be made by the Cour Superieure de Comptes (CSC)
in accordance with government auditing procedures. During negotiations,
the Government would be asked to provide assurances that, the special
account, project accounts and statements of expenditures would be audited
annually by qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and a
certified copy of the annual audit report would be sent to IDA within six
months following the end of each fiscal year during project implementation.
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The proposed project would help consolidate changes being brought
about in primary education so that a greater number of children, particu-
larly in rural areas, would be able to complete the first four grades with
at least minimum learning achievement. As a result of the proposed invest-
ment, 4,600 rural Haitian children, half of them girls, who otherwise would
not have had a school to enter, would be able to attend primary school each
year. In addition, investments in improved teaching and curricula are
expected to reach 600,000 children in grades 1-4 by 1987/88. These changes
in quality would enable a greater proportion of children who start school
5/   These working agreements are legally binding contracts in Haiti;
however, since they are between two government agencies, they are not
considered legally binding contracts by IDA.

to complete it.  Estimates are difficult, but it is projected that the
completion rate for the first grades of rural primary education would
increase from 20% at present to about 40%. Thus, about twice as many
children at present are expected to complete primary school each year from
1988 onwards. Improvements in the quality of education through improved
curricula and teaching are expected to ensure that children become literate
and numerate by the time they leave school after grade four.  Studies
during the course of implementation would establish a baseline against
which to measure quantitatively the learning benefits of the project. The
proposed investment, thus, would generate increased numbers of literate and
numerate people in rural areas which, over time, would contribute to
increased farmer productivity, reduced fertility rates among women, better
rural health and increased upward occupational mobility for rural youth
though improved access to further education.
Risks
6.02      Because this project basically finances the implementation of an
education reform there are several identifiable risks inherent to dealing
with a major restructuring of an education system. First, this is a long-
term program which during its implementation could well be changed in
either its major objectives or in more minor policy decisions. Secondly, a
dilution of the quality of the reform could occur as it becomes a nation-
wide effort, i.e., implementation of the reform on a national level may
prove to be too ambitious, in which case the number of teachers and schools
affected would need to be reduced or the implementation schedule extended.
Another risk is the fact that the project only covers nationwide introduc-
tion of the reform for grade 1, and that additional investments for grade
2-4 would be needed in order to fully realize the benefits inherent in this
project. Finally, the situation with counterpart funds is presently
constrained and there is the general risk that counterpart funds would not
be forthcoming timely or in the amounts required which in turn would
influence the planned implementation period. The Government intends to
monitor these risks carefully. Early detection, together with intensive
supervision by the Association, would help the government take corrective
action.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, the Government gave assurances on the
following matters: school location criteria (para. 4.06); textbook price
control mechanism (para. 4.18); provision of textbooks in classrooms
(para. 4.21); accountant's examination (para. 4.37); budget consultation
meetings (para. 5.08); Special and Project Account (para. 5.19); and audits
(para. 5.19).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be the establishment of the
Special and Project Accounts (para. 5.19).
7.03      Subject to the above conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for a credit of US$9 million equivalent to the
Government of Haiti on standards IDA terms.
