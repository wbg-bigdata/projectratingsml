MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA FOR A
FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed investment loan to Tunisia for
US$20 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate. It would help finance a forestry development project that
would establish the basis for comprehensive conservation, development and
exploitation of the forestry resources and intensify wood production.
2.       Background.  Tunisia's 900,000 ha of forests are estimated to provide
about 4% of the agricultural GDP, but at least 10,000 ha are being lost
annually mostly because of over-grazing by livestock and uncontrolled cuttings
for fuel. Poor forest management, unauthorized harvest of trees and lack of
appropriate tree species and planting techniques are common problems of the
subsector. In the absence of a clear national strategy to deal with these
wide-ranbing problems, the funding for forestry has decreased sharply and
annual planting for wood production has been reduced to one-fifth of its level
of 15,000 ha in 1978. Izaorts now account for 95% of Tunisian needs for
industrial wood, valued at some $38 million equivalent per year. The
consequences of this neglect are severe on soil/water conservation. Roughly
80% of Tunis:a is subject to erosion. Although Tunisia cannot expect to
become self-sufficient for wood and wood products, it could effectively meet a
substantially larger part of its needs, thereby contributing to a reduced
sector trade deficit, and better protect its environment. The Government's
strategy is to rectify this situation through improved national forest grazing
programs, reseeding, planting with appropriate species, and natural
regeneration. In the framework of the medium-term sector adjustment program
agreed under the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL), the Government
has prepared a program to achieve greater dynamism and cost effectiveness in
the forest subsector. The Project would finance part of the program.
3.       Project obiectives.  The project objectives are to improve the cost
effectiveness of a restructured forest resource development and management
program which would help: (a) increase fuelwood and industrial wood
production; (b) improve forest grasslands and range management to reduce
damage to forest areas from grazing; (c) reduce soil erosion and increase
water retention to protect productivity of agricultural lands; and (d)
preserve and expand the country's nature and wildlife heritage.
4.       Project description.  The proposed Project would comprise five main
components:
(a) Forest Exploitation and Regeneration would include thinning of
existing plantations, exploitation and regeneration of natural
forests, improvement of exploitation means and techniques;
(3 24 2E )



- 2 -
(b) Forest Plantations and Private Tree Planting would establish
fast-growing and linear plantations, thereby increasing production
and contributing to soil conservation; simultaneously it would expand
seed production and seedling sales to the private sector;
(c)  Intensified Forest Management would address the rehabilitation and
management of two highly degraded natural forest areas;
(d) Forest Pasture and Range Improvement would include the establishment
of prairies and improved natural pastures adjacent to the
regeneration and plantation areas, thus contributing to the success
of these programs; and
(e) Institutional Development and Support would provide participating
agencies with technical assistance support and means to fulfill their
assigned roles in the new forest strategy, particularly in the fields
of inventory and planning for the development of forest resources,
improvement of natioiial forest management and preservation of
wildlife, applied research and training.
The Project, to be carried out over seven years, provides funds for works,
vehicles and equipment, training, technical assistance and incremental
operating costs. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$50.2
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$20 million (401).
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of the key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Tunisia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
6730-TUN, dated July 2, 1987, is being distributed separately.
5.       Rationale for Bank involvement.  The Bank's lending strategy aims to
support Tunisia's transition from reliance on petroleum exports to a
sectorially balanced development program. Bank lending, therefore,
concentrates on projects that have a direct and rapid impact on production,
employment, exports and/or import substitution, and that minimize government
net contributions. The Bank has been working closely with the Government in
reviewing past agricultural expenditure policies and in developing the
strategy for investments under the VIITH Development Plan, with particular
focus on the adjustments needed to maintain growth and to reduce the sector
trade deficit. The improved management of forestry resources is an integral
part of this program. While the reorientation of sector policies is being
addressed through the ASAL, a forestry development project would both
strengthe-. this policy reform effort and provide the essential mechanism to
develop, implement and monitor the detailed technical and managerial
innovations needed to achieve the full benefit of the agreed reorientation in
subsector expenditures. The Bank's involvement would also facilitate the
transfer of experience gained in other Mediterranean countrie8 and help ir
preserving natural resources.
6.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following actions:
(a) to promulgate the new Forest Code and to create within the Directorate of
Forests (DF) a special unit to prepare the Forest/Pastureland Inventory before
the loan effectiveness; (b) to open its auctions for all categories of wood to
all licensed wood buyers before December 31, 1988; (c) each year starting with
(3242E)



- 3 -
1989, to determine reference prices for all types of wood to be sold directly
to wood users, based on prices obtained under auctions undertaken the
preceding year, and taking into account the ability of such users to pay;
(d) by December 31, 1989, to sell cork through auctions, open to both the
parastatal and the private sector; (e) to select any new major investment in
the forestry sector in accordance with criteria set forth in its program for
the adjustment of its agricultural sector; (f) by December 31, 1988, to sign a
protocol between the DF and the National Institute for Forestry Research
(INRF' to assure the inclusion of selected research programs considered
essential for the project in INRF's work program; (g) by December 31, 1988, to
ensure the preparation and implementation by the Professional Training Centre
at Remel (CFPR) of a training program for staff of DF and the Directorate of
Forest Exploitation (DREF) in forest exploitation; (h) to complete a
Forestry/Pastureland Inventory and a Master Plan for Development of the
Forestry Resources by December 31, 1990; (i) to estimate the operation and
maintenance costs of improved pastures implemented under the Project and set
up procedures to recover such costs from the beneficiaries, taking into
account their ability to pay, by December 31, 1991; and (j) to identify in the
DF and DREF annual budgets the cost of forestry programs financed under
nationally subsidized programs not later than December 31, 1988.
7.       Justification and Risks.  The Project would have an important long
term positive impact on the environment and in the near term would help reduce
the sector trade deficit by increasing wood production, starting as early as
1989, while laying the basis for medium-term improvement in efficient
livestock production and longer-term protection of the productivity of
agricultural lands. The ERR is 18X. Net foreign exchange savings are
expected to reach some $6 million/year within two years. Some 10,000
man-years of employment would be created during the project period. The main
risks are associated with the participation of the beneficiaries in the range
management program and in rationalizing stock grazing in forest regeneration
areas. In spite of new legal measures adopted to help minimize this risk, it
is expected that populations which have traditionally used forest rangelands
may be slow to respond to measures designed to protect forest undergoing
regeneration or to provide improved range quality. To minimize these risks
further, measures will be taken under the Project to ensure that local
authorities will work closely with and seek to strengthen producer
organizations, and extension efforts will be intensified to introduce
alternative livestock production systems.
8.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
