FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Ln. 2870-TUN)
PREFACE
1.    This is an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the first Forestry Development
Project in Tunisia, for which a loan in the amount of US$ 20 million equivalent was approved
on 28 September 1987. The loan became effective on 28 April 1988, and as scheduled in the
Loan Agreement, the loan closed on 31 December 1995.
2.    This report was prepared by a mission from FAO/World Bank Cooperative Programme"
which visited Tunisia from 12 to 26 June 1995. It is based on material gathered from project
fles and supervision reports in the World Bank, Washington, and on substantive discussions
with the Bank and GOT staff. The mission's preliminary findings were presented to the
Government in an Aide M6moire (see Appendix A). The report was discussed with the
Government in December 1995 and comments received have been incorporated in this report.
The report was reviewed by T.P.N. Sinha, Acting Division Chief, MN1NE, and by Ms. Laurie
Effron, Acting Project Advisor.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (FIP)
(Ln. 2870-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A. Introduction
1.    Tunisia's trade deficit in wood and wood products nearly doubled in the first part of the
1980s, but the country's potential to produce wood had been largely ignored. Since 1985, the
Bank has been working closely with the Government to increase the production of wood and
forest-related products, better safeguard the environment, and revitalize public involvement in
forestry. The FDP was prepared in 1985/86", appraised in December 1986 and represented the
core of the Government's Seventh Development Plan in the forestry sector.
2.    The project's objectives were to: (a) increase fuelwood and industrial wood production;
(b) improve forest grasslands and range management to compensate for grazing areas lost to the
closure of forest lands for natural forest regeneration and tree planting; (c) reduce soil erosion
and increase water retention to protect the productivity of agricultural lands; and (d) preserve
and expand the country's nature and wildlife heritage. The five main components of the project
are as follows: (a) forest exploitation and regeneration (mainly thinning of conifer plantations,
regeneration of natural forests, and promotion of private sector); (b) forest plantations and
private tree planting, improvement of forest nurseries and seed collection; (c) intensified forest
management (construction of infrastructure and provision of logistical facilities; (d) forest pasture
and range improvement (establishment of permanent and improved natural pastures); and (e)
institutional development/support (preparation of a national forest and range inventory,
improvement of national park management, training and research).
B. Implementation Experiences
3.    Thinning of pine plantations has been realized over 45,501 ha (91 % of the target) and
forest regeneration has covered 16,310 ha (76% of the target). On the other hand, the
mechanized plantations programme has covered only 4,880 ha (as opposed to 8,100 ha foreseen
in the SAR) mainly because of shortage of suitable areas for planting in the selected zones.
Nevertheless, the survival rate is over 80% and initial growth is good. As planned, 2,608 ha
(100% of the target) of poplar, eucalyptus and acacia have been planted along the "oueds" and
the survival rates are reported to be excellent. New production techniques in nurseries (mainly
"  A Forestry Sector Study (Projet de developpement forestier et lutte contre la desertification - 2 volumes -
March 1986) was carried out in 1985/86 by FAO through a Trust Fund Agreement and assistance under FAO's
Technical Cooperative Programme.

the use of cement tanks) have been developed and thus has increased both the quality of the
plants produced and the overall productive capability.
4.    The provision of infrastructure and facilities for forest management has proceeded as
envisaged. Around 3,000 ha of pastures have been established (82% of objective), although the
quality is poor and no appropriate forage/range management systems have yet been put in place.
A national inventory of forest and range lands has been carried out and plans for forest and
pasture development have been prepared. A monitoring and evaluation system has been
established, but its performance has been disappointing because of the poor quality of incoming
information, the inadequacy of indicators for project performance assessment and the shortage
of trained staff. The project implementation benefitted from the research, training and technical
assistance components of the project. The population living in the project areas have benefited
from the project through the provision of about 4.8 million person-days of labour. The objective
of involving the private sector in forestry has been successful.
5.    Actual project costs are estimated at US$ 40.3 million, 20% less than in the SAR mainly
due to the reduced expenditure of the plantations and road programmes. About US$ 2.6 million,
out of the US$ 20 million loan, remained undisbursed and was cancelled. The Government has
disbursed US$ 22.2 million of counterpart funds compared to the US$ 30.2 planned at appraisal.
All major legal covenants have been fulfilled. The economic rate of return has been estimated
at 9% excluding non quantifiable environmental and social benefits, which are substantial.
Inclusion of such benefits are likely to raise the ERR to 11 %. Although satisfactory the ERR
is lower than the SAR estimate of 18%, mainly because the assumptions for incremental wood
production were over optimistic.
6.    Key factors affecting project achievement. The inadequate delimitation of suitable lands
for mechanized plantations in the selected zones and the 1993-94 drought in Tunisia slowed
down the plantations programme. In addition, the much delayed recruitment of forestry
technicians in 1991 resulted in the postponement of tree marking operations and slowed down
the thinning/regeneration programmes. The 1992 partial restructuring of the Ministry of
Agriculture disturbed the project's institutional set-up and has had a negative impact on field
operations. Finally, delays in selection of consultants created difficulties in executing forest
inventory and mechanized plantation components of the project.
7.    Sustainability. The sustainability of most project components is directly linked to the
execution of the second phase of the FDP. The first phase has demonstrated that commercial
operations, such as mechanized and riverine plantations, can be financially sustainable. On the
other hand, the sustainability of the forest pastures and range improvement activities associated
with the protection of the planted and regenerated areas appears doubtful mainly because the
socio-economic conditions of the livestock owners are poorly understood.
8.    Bank and borrower's performance. The project did not experience major problems and
was regularly supervised. The supervision record is satisfactory. Some difficulties were created
at the time of a restructuring in 1992. The Ministry of Agriculture could have been more
sensitive to the institutional needs of the project at the time of its restructuring in 1992. The



iii
Ministry should also have made more effort to provide better staffing for project monitoring and
implementation.
C. Assessment of Outcome
9.    Despite its pilot nature and the inherent risks and information gaps, the project has been
successful. The evolution and progress made in managing the forestry sector have been
significant. The project has accelerated technical improvements and institutional changes needed
for the sector development. It has introduced more progressive (commercially-oriented) policies
and managerial practices in forestry operations, with the increased involvement of the private
sector. New techniques have also been adopted in soil preparation before planting, forest
exploitation and seedling production. Furthermore, monopolistic situations have been practically
eliminated by liberalizing cork sales, promoting auction systems and reducing wood price
distortions.
D. Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
10.   Findings. The project was largely successful, especially in promoting sectoral reform.
However, some activities failed to meet their targets. The mechanized plantation programme,
for example, met limited success, mainly because of a lack of availability of lands suitable for
mechanized land preparation. In addition, project monitoring and evaluation was not given
sufficient importance and therefore some components - such as the establishment of pastures -
were not successful as remedial action could not be taken in time. A further problem was that
project management was concentrated in the Forestry Directorate, even though some of the
components, particularly the establishment of pastures, required the close participation of other
sectors, e.g. for livestock development. Unfortunately, the coordination committee set up to
address this problem failed to develop the necessary appropriate multi-sectoral linkages.
11.   Future operations. The management and protection of forests created under this project
is adequate and is being handled by Provincial Forestry Services.
12.   Key lessons learnt. The main lessons learnt are as follows: (a) forest plantation schemes
are strongly influenced by socioeconomic, and topographic conditions which have to be carefully
assessed when planning large programmes; (b) efficient project management requires an adequate
performance monitoring and evaluation system (particularly early on); (c) complex multi-sectoral
projects need special institutional arrangements to develop inter-sectoral linkages or the design
needs to be simplified; (d) when consecutive projects overlap additional resources are needed
to cater for the work required for the preparation of the follow on project.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Ln. 2870-TUN)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.   In 1986, the strategy of the 7th Development Plan for the Agricultural Sector (including
forestry), focused on increasing production and reducing the sector trade deficit. At that time,
Tunisia's 900,000 ha of forest land (pine and oak) were poorly managed and degraded because
of overgrazing and uncontrolled cutting for fuel. As a result Tunisia imported about 95 % of
industrial wood needs. To exacerbate matters, the investment budget for forestry and soil
conservation was decreasing and managerial capacity weak. The consequences of this were
serious. However, studies showed that the potential for increased wood production existed and
the proposed project aimed at establishing the basis for the comprehensive development of forest
resources and the conservation of the natural heritage.
2.    The project's objectives (Staff Appraisal Report, July 1987), were to improve the cost
effectiveness of a forest resources management by: (a) increasing fuelwood and industrial wood
production; (b) improving forest grasslands and range management to compensate for grazing
areas lost due to the closure of forest lands for natural regeneration and tree planting; (c)
reducing soil erosion and increasing water retention to protect the productivity of agricultural
lands; and (d) preserving and expanding the country's nature and wildlife heritage and improving
the country's cultural and recreational facilities.
3.    The project had five main components: (a) forest exploitation and regeneration; (b) forest
plantations and private tree planting; (c) intensified forest management; (d) forest pasture and
range management; (e) institutional development support, including a national forest inventory
and development plans, nature conservation, technical assistance, training and provision for
equipment.
4.    The objectives of the project were valid. However, because of its pilot nature and the
introduction of new technology the project was inherently risky. In view of this, some physical
targets were also over-ambitious, like the 8,100 ha of mechanised plantations, the pasture
improvement programme and the 21,500 ha of forest regeneration. The use of new techniques,
an absence of information on social conditions, and the limited managerial capacity of the
Tunisian forest institutions should have been taken more into account in setting project targets.



2               PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
B. ACHIVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.    Project achievements were difficult to assess because the monitoring and evaluation
system did not provide comprehensive figures and data. Project results were therefore judged
on the basis of supervision reports, the project's annual reports, and information provided by
the Project Management Unit (PMU).
Sectoral Results
6.    The sectoral achievements are significant. The project succeeded in promoting the
development of new techniques such as the mechanisation of forest operations and the adoption
of improved nursery techniques. The project was also successful in increasing private sector
involvement in forest activities (thinning, exploitation) and made important advances in involving
communities in the management and protection of forested areas.
7.   In addition, the availability of forest inventory data, the preparation of strategies for
forest and pasture resources development, the establishment of a computerised monitoring
systems for all forest activities, and the adoption of commercially oriented policies in forest
operations have improved considerably. The project has also initiated a development process
inside the forestry sector and has enhanced relations between the headquarters and the regions
in the Forestry Directorate (FD). Furthermore, the project has contributed to eliminating
monopolistic situations by, for example, liberalizing cork sales, promoting timber auction system
and has reduced the price distortions in wood sales through better price monitoring.
Physical Results
8.    The achievement of the physical objectives varies with the type of activity. The lack of
experience of the PMU and the FD staff in project management and new methodologies explain
this. These are explained in more detail below.
9.    Forest exploitation and regeneration. The thinning programme of pine plantations has
been realised on 45,501 ha (91% of objective) in 10 Forest Arrondissements. These activities
have had a positive effects on the forest stands, they have also had an important social impact
by providing employment in rural areas.
10.   The forest regeneration programme covered a total of 16,310 ha (76% of objective). The
regeneration programme of the oak stands was unsuccessful because the techniques adopted
under the project (direct seeding and coppice shoots) were not completely successful.
11.   Wood sold by the R6gie d'Exploitation Foresti6re (REF) reached 323,000 m3 in 1994
(objective 260,000 m3/year) of which 52% was sold by auction to the private sector and 48%
was processed by FD. However, annual output varied greatly. This is attributed to the variation
of access and quality of forest stands sold at auction. The 1994 Report of the REF shows that



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                      3
the degree of mechanization was about 49 % (objective 70%) in the exploitation operations
implemented by the FD (including the works done by the small enterprises). The shortfall was
due mainly to the thinning operations.
12.   Forest plantations. 4,880 ha of mechanized plantations (60% of objective) have been
planted on a total area of 6,130 ha including access roads, swaths and fire breaks. The shortfall
was due mainly to an inadequate delimitation of suitable zones for planting and delays in finding
grazing areas in compensation for areas to be planted. The plantations have been realised on
three main areas (Sedjenane, Nefza, Tegma) and main species planted are Pinus pinea (70%)
and Eucalyptus spp. (30%). The rate of survival is satisfactory (80 to 90%) and the initial
growth is good. Silvicultural techniques seem appropriate and well managed. The expected total
wood production within the next 50 years will be around 1,300,000 m3.
13.   2,608 ha of riverine plantations have also been planted along the "oueds" (objective:
2,600 ha). This activity was successful, although some difficulties occurred at the beginning due
to technical and land tenure problems. The rate of survival of the trees - poplar, eucalyptus and
acacia - and their growth are reported to be excellent. The expected wood production within the
next 24 years is estimated at 750,000 m3.
14.   Forest management. All management activities of 6,600 ha in the forest districts of El
Feidja (Jendouba) and Oum Djeddour (Kasserine) have been done. This component included the
construction and rehabilitation of housing and forest stations (9), a research centre and a fire
tower; a sociological study has also been started, as well as the preparation of forest
management plans; the districts have been supplied with vehicles and equipment; the programme
of roads construction (85 km) and rehabilitation (35 km) has only recently been achieved due
to the difficulty of obtaining suitable contractors.
15.   Forest pasture and range improvement. A total area of about 3,002 ha of pasture have
been improved (82%  of objective). Permanent pastures have been established on 973 ha
(objective: 1100 ha); 1664 ha of natural range land have been rehabilitated (objective: 2,180 ha).
Acacias and cactus have been planted on 365 ha. Pasture quality is reported to be currently poor
because appropriate forage and range management systems have not been put in place. This
partial success is attributed to: (a) a lack of technical capacity of forest staff in pasture and forest
range improvement; and (b) local people did not fully understand the project objectives and were
reluctant to accept the restrictions on grazing attached to the proper management of the pastures
and ranges provided to them.
16.   Other activities. The national inventory of forest and range lands covering about
110,000 km2, was completed in 1994. Modem mapping and computerised equipment have been
provided. Forest and pasture cover maps (1/50,000, 1/200,000, 1/500,000) are available. The
inventory and the development plan for the pasture land were published in June 1995. The forest
inventory is complete but the forest development plan has to be finalised and published. This



4               PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
operation should have been completed in 1990 but was delayed mainly due to delays in
consultant selection.
17.   Nature conservation: proposed activities consisted mainly of support to the regular
programme of activities, and this has been achieved. Hunting brigades in all forest
arrondissements have been equipped to control poaching and to monitor bird migrations, etc.
The premises of three national park have been improved. The proposed mobile extension unit
has been placed under a specialised extension agency (AVFA), in accordance with the forest
extension strategy.
18.   Nurseries and tree seeds collection: some 11 nurseries near to the project plantation sites
and urban centres (including two poplar nurseries) have been equipped. The techniques to raise
seedlings have been improved, as has the quality of forest plants produced. The Tree Seed
Centre has been provided with vehicles and adequate equipment (such as tree climbing sets) and
the quality of technical operations (seed collection, sorting, storage and distribution to nurseries)
has been improved.
Institutional Development
19.   The project has provided 137 vehicles (cars, 4-WD, pick-up 4-WD and trucks),
equipment and materials in support of forest management, silvicultural operations and nature
conservation. Vehicles and equipment appear to be properly used and maintained.
20.   The training of staff (46 rn/m) and technical assistance (33 m/m) were provided by
agreement with FAO. The agreement was amended and enlarged to recruit experts needed to do
the forest and pasture land inventory, and to prepare the second forestry development project.
The services provided were satisfactory. Training and expertise were generally appreciated and
well organized. However, full advantage of training and technical assistance was not taken
because follow-up action was inadequate. It is worth noting that FAO complemented the project
technical assistance programme with a Technical Cooperative Project (TCP/TUN (A) 8852)
which included priority activities such as forestry economics, wood technology, fire protection
and forest education.
21.   Under the project a Management Information System (GESFOR) has been established.
The system should have been used as a tool for project management but, unfortunately, the
project has not succeeded in establishing an efficient monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.
Accurate data and analysis of project activities are still lacking. For example, financial
monitoring is weak. Project achievements are not accurately documented, the 1993 and 1994
annual reports were published only in mid-1995, and there is no evaluation done by the
Government of the impact and quality of project activities. This shortcoming is attributed to: (a)
the poor quality of incoming information from forest arrondissements; (b) the indicators of
project activities were limited to physical performance, while the environmental and social
impacts were not included; (c) the staff in charge of the M&E was insufficient and not



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                        5
appropriately trained; and (d) at the end of the project, the first and the second projects
overlapped, and this placed to much pressure on project staff.
22.    An agreement was signed between the project and the National Forest Research Institute
(INRF) to support project activities and appropriate forest research and results have been
documented. However research programmes were too broad and the budgets too limited.
23.   The FD has prepared a strategy for pasture and range development but the forest
development strategy is still to be finalised, although these were discussed in a seminar in June
1995. These were prepared exclusively by FD staff but, to be effective, they also need to be
discussed with other sectors interested in forestry development.
Financial and Economic Results
24.   Total project costs are estimated at US$ 40.3 million, 20% less than in the SAR. About
US$ 2.6 million, out of the US$ 20 million loan, remained undisbursed and were cancelled.
Although the project must be seen as a pilot exercise, whose main achievement has been to
introduce more progressive (commercially-oriented) policies and managerial approaches to
forestry operations, it has nevertheless demonstrated that managed plantation activities and
particularly riverine plantations can (and will probably) be financially viable as the private sector
becomes gradually more involved.
25.   For now, the public nurseries are being managed more as a means of disseminating
improved planting material than on a commercial basis, but the project has resulted in substantial
cost savings through the introduction of improved production techniques. These savings, along
with the adopted practice by the Forestry Directorate of charging to private entrepreneurs
adequate fees and "redevances' for exploiting the state forests, have substantially improved the
FD's budgetary situation.
26.   The project's economic rate of return is estimated at 9% over 57 years and must be
considered as a minimum since it does not include the less-easily-quantifiable social and
environmental benefits (Appendix B). Inclusion of such externalities would raise the ERR to
about 11%. This rate is somewhat lower than in the SAR (18%), mainly because the ICR
assumptions for the production buildup are less optimistic". On the other hand, about 4.8 million
person-days of manual/field work were contracted under the project and close to US$ 14 million
were paid in daily salaries, generating even more jobs and incomes in the economy through a
multiplier effect.
if  Although more in line with those used for the formulation of the Second Forestry Development Project.



6              PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Social and Environmental Impacts
27.   The project's impact on the population living in the project area has been significant. The
most obvious benefits - though very difficult to evaluate - are in terms of the positive impact on
the environment by slowing/arresting soil erosion. This, in turn, will lead to increased
agricultural production. Activities related to nature conservation have contributed to the
protection of the national heritage and have heightened public awareness as to the importance
of their environment. Project activities have also improved incomes through employment.
28.   The social and environmental impacts of the project will be the subject of a specific study
being carried out by a Tunisian fimn.
Promotion of the Private Sector
29.   The project has been successful in promoting the involvement of the private sector in
forestry activities. For instance, some 50 enterprises are now involved and account for around
16% of national wood production. It is estimated that half these activities have been generated
through the project, largely the result of the extensive training provided to the enterprises. In
addition to increasing the efficiency/profitability of forestry operations, these enterprises are also
generating jobs and incomes in rural areas.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Factors Not Generally Subject to Government Control
30.   The drought which occurred in 1993/1994 slowed down the plantations programmes;
although all soils were prepared for plantations in 1994, part of the area could only be planted
in the first half of 1995.
Factors Generally Subject to Government Control
31.   Difficulties in recruiting forestry technicians in 1991 considerably delayed forest tree
marking operations needed for the thinning and regeneration works. However this backlog has
since been done.
32.   The reform of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1992, which involved numerous transfers
of DF staff - particularly the chiefs of the forest arrondissements, had a negative effect on the
project. The PMU staff were integrated into the administrative structure of the DF, thus adding
to their responsibilities and reducing time available for the project. However, young
professionals have since been recruited to augment the PMU and to mitigate the negative effects
of this.



PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT                     7
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
33.   The delays in the selection of consultants for technical assistance in forest and range land
inventory and for land preparation for the mechanised plantation programme have caused delays
in project execution. Procurement procedures took long, and this created delays at the beginning
of the project. The under-utilization of the Management Information System established at the
PMU also weakened management effectiveness. The planting sites should have been more
carefully selected in advance to provide sufficient and suitable area for mechanized plantation
or the programme targets should have been reduced.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
34.   The sustainability of many project activities will depend largely on the implementation
of the second project. The sustainability of commercially-oriented operations will, of course,
depend on their financial profitability. This is likely to improve in the future for three reasons:
(a) private enterprises involved in the thinning/cutting (and eventually planting) works are
becoming more efficient; and (b) some of the indirect investment costs, especially technical
assistance/training, will be proportionally lower in the next phases.
35.   Concerning the new plantations, clean weeding is imperative during the first three years
after planting until the young trees are able to compete with the natural vegetation. Management
plans must be prepared indicating which stands need to be weeded and when. Pruning and first
thinning will be done under the second project. Fire prevention and controls have to be
particularly reinforced in mechanized plantations.
36.   The sustainability of the forest pasture and range improvement operations will be assured
by involving the beneficiaries in the maintenance of pastures and natural ranges. A better
understanding of the socio-economic environment is also needed and institutional linkages
between Forestry and Livestock need to be improved. Revised grazing fees also need to be
introduced. Rules and conditions will be developed in the integrated development pilot operations
of the Second Forestry Development project.
37.   The NIFRL will need to be updated regularly. Financing this operation is justified if the
results of the inventory are used intensively by the FD and others interested in improved
management.



8              PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
38.   The project appraisal was satisfactory, and ambitious projections of yields were due to
information gaps inherent in a pilot project. During project implementation, close supervision
by the Bank ensured that the PMU and FD staff to took appropriate action to resolve problems
encountered by the project. Disbursements have occurred more-or-less as scheduled.
39.   During the 7-years of project implementation, 19 supervision missions assisted by 9 visits
of subject matter specialists monitored and guided project development. A full fledged mid-term
review would have been beneficial.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
40.   Considering the weak condition of the DF at the beginning of the project, the complex
and innovative nature of the project, borrower performance has been satisfactory. It is, however,
unfortunate that no measures were taken to improve/strengthen the M&E, of the project. The
project Coordination Committee met eight times during the project life and played an efficient
role in evaluating and coordinating project management.
41.   Many achievements of the project can be attributed to the dynamism and stability of the
PMU team which remained intact throughout. Project management was able to adapt itself to
any unexpected situation and to find appropriate solutions to problems encountered. However,
the restructuring of the Ministry of Agriculture in 1992 and the start-up of the second Forestry
Development Project slowed the progress over the last two years of the project.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
42.   The project's outcome has been satisfactory, notwithstanding some shortcoming in field
activities, the poor performance of the M&E system and certain social problems associated with
pasture development. The progress made in improving the management of the forestry sector
is considerable. The project has accelerated institutional changes needed for its development;
price distortions and monopolistic situations have been removed; rural people have started to
develop an awareness of sustainable use of forest resources; and the forest inventory has
demonstrated the need for further investment and improved management. The project has also
highlighted ways to exploit and sustainably regenerate the forests and ways to better involve
rural populations in their management.
43.   Under the second FDP, possibilities of replacing mechanized plantations with labour
intensive operations should be explored during mid-term review to provide additional benefits
such as employment. However, the case by case decision should be based on a pertinent analysis
of the financial, socio-economical and environmental conditions.

H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
44.   The second Forestry Development project was appraised (SAR no 11618-TUN) in
December 1992. The components of the new project are forest management, mechanised and
riverine plantations, forest pasture and range improvement, wood exploitation, national park and
reserves, forestry research and institutional development and integrated development pilot
operations. Most activities developed during the first project will be continued and consolidated
during the second project.
45.   Specific activities not covered by the second project, but which should be included, are:
(a) the clean weeding of plantations; (b) the determination of a plan and a budget to update the
NIFRL; and (c) the finalisation of the forest development plan.
46.   Although, the PMU has been strengthened for the day-to-day analysis of technical,
financial and social information, project monitoring is still deficient. This situation should be
addressed as a matter of urgency.
47.  Institutional aspects which should be considered during the planned mid-term review of
the second forestry project include:
(a)   the restructuring of the DF to enable it to take on those activities which the
private sector cannot handle;
(b)   a review of institutional arrangements related to forest range and pasture
management; better coordination is needed between Forestry and Livestock
institutions to avoid disparities in taxation and incentives for livestock production.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNT
48.   The first Forestry Development Project has made important sectorial advances and has
provided a valuable testing ground for new techniques and institutional development. Many
technical lessons have been learnt. They relate principally to methods for improving natural and
planted forest stands, preparing soil for tree planting and developing pasture and range land
techniques. From the institutional point-of-view, the project has improved the managerial
capacity of FD. It has also enabled the PMU to deal with procurement procedures, to monitor
forest activities (although the operational performance needs to be improved) to plan and budget
activities, and to develop collaboration with the private sector. These lessons and experiences
have already been taken into account when designing the second project.
49.   The key lessons are:



10              PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
(a)   Before starting large-scale plantations' programmes, a detailed study providing
a full description of the techniques to be applied, the land suitability for planting
and the socio-economic conditions should be carried out. Possible compensations
should be discussed and agreed with the concerned population as a prerequisite.
(b)   Where projects are broad in scope and operate in complex socio-economic
environments, it is essential to have a strong and efficient project monitoring and
evaluation system. However, this system has to be dimensioned in accordance
with the existing institutional capability and project performance indicators should
be limited in number, but carefully selected to be as meaningful as possible.
(c)   It is necessary to establish an adequate institutional set-up for the project in order
to develop efficient inter-sectoral linkages to deal with the various sectoral issues
under the project (livestock, land tenure, rural development and social affairs).
Without these inter-sectoral linkages, there is a great risk that the project would
be too narrowly focussed and would fail to adequately involve other sectors.
(d)   When two projects - a first phase followed immediately by a second phase - are
overlapping, it is the first project to compensate the supplementary work
requested for the preparation and the starting up of the second project.

The second phase - Second Forestry Development Project - will take care of the operations needed to
sustain the activities developed during the first phase.
However, two/three passages per year of clean weeding are needed in the young 1994 mechanised
plantations in Tegma, Bizerte and Beja for the next three years. The river in plantations planted in 1992,
1993 and 1994 need maintenance and surveillance for the next three years.
l     A plan to update the forest and pasture/range inventory and the budget in accordance should be defined
for end 1995 and included in the national programme and budget.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
The economic rate of return is 9 % over 57 years (see Appendix C). This rate is
satisfactory considering that the ERR calculation, based on a conventional use of present values,
tends to underestimate the future value of wood products as well as of any remaining standing
trees. Obviously, the rate does not include the project's beneficial impact on the environment,
particularly in terms of slowing/stopping soil erosion. This, in turn, will eventually lead to a
larger agricultural production than would be the case otherwise. The rate is relatively insensitive
to revenue and cost variations. For instance, an increase of 25 % in the revenues would bring
the rate up to "only" 11 %, the same level as with a decrease of 25% in the costs. It must be
pointed out that 9% is half the ERR estimated in the SAR. The main reason for the lower
economic (quantifiable) returns in the ICR is the assumptions made for the production buildup
which are less optimistic than in the SAR but more in line with those used for the formulation
of Phase II of the Forestry Development Project (see Table 5 of this appendix). Another
important reason is the fact that only 60% of the 8,100 ha under the mechanized plantations
program and 76% of the 21,500 ha under the forest regeneration program were covered. These
shortcomings are not compensated by the 20 % shortfall in the project costs (see Table 8B of Part
2).
In addition to the quantifiable economic revenues, there are other benefits which are
much more difficult to evaluate. About 4.8 million person-days of manuallfield work were
contracted under the project, for various activities such as tree thinning and cutting (for
regeneration). Close to D 13 million of daily salaries - equivalent to almost US$ 14 million -was
paid for the work, which must have generated even more jobs and incomes (through a multiplier
effect) in the economy. Furthermore, the project has been successful at promoting the private
sector in forestry. Some 50 small enterprises, with an average of ten employees each, are now
involved in forestry activities such as thinning. These enterprises already account for 16 % of the
national wood production. It is estimated that roughly half of the 16% has been financed directly
through the project since 1988. In addition to increasing the efficiency/profitability of forestry
operations, these enterprises are also generating jobs and incomes in the country.

APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE                              23
Appendice A Aide-memoire
A. Introduction
Une mission du Centre d'investissement de la FAO constituee de Mrs. J.L.
Blanchez (Forestier, chef de mission), J.M. Bisson (Economiste) et D. Crespo (Agrostologue)
s'est rendue en Tunisie du 12 Juin au 23 Juin 1995 en vue de pr6parer le rapport d'achevement
du Premier Projet de Developpement Forestier (PDF). La mission a discut6 des objectifs du
rapport d'achevement avec le Directeur Gen6ral des Forkts et a travaill6 en collaboration etroite
avec les membres du Bureau de Gestion du Projet ainsi que l'Institut de Recherche Forestiere.
La mission a pu visiter diff6rents sites du projet dans les arrondissements de Kasserine, El Kef,
Beja et Bizerte.
La mission tient a remercier les agents de la Direction Gen6rale des Forets et autres
personnes rencontr6es, ainsi que la representation de la FAO a Tunis, pour leur accueil et leur
collaboration.
B. Le contexte
Le Premier Projet de Developpement Forestier (PDF1) a et6 6value en novembre
1986; l'Accord de PrMt a ete sign6 le 28 septembre 1987 et mis en vigueur depuis le 28 avril
1988. Le couit total du projet 6tait estime6  US$ 50.2 millions dont la composante Prt BIRD
n 2870 6tait de US$ 20 millions. La duree du projet est de 7 ans avec la date de fm des
op6rations fix6e au 31-12-1994 et la date de cl6ture du Pret au 31-12-1995.
Un Deuxieme Projet de Developpement Forestier (PDF2) a ete evalu6 en avril 1993.
Il est signe depuis le mois de septembre 1993 et mis en vigueur a partir d'avril 1994. Le cout
total du projet s'eleve a US$ 148,1 millions dont US$ 69 millions sous forme de Pret de la
Banque Mondiale et la NIB-NDF.
C. Les objectifs et resultats du premier projet
Les objectifs g6neraux du projet definis par le Staff Appraisal Report sont: a)
l'augmentation de la production de bois de chauffage et d'industrie; b) I'am6lioration des
paturages forestiers et de leur gestion; c) la reduction de 1'erosion et l'augmentation de la
r6tention en eau des sols; d) la conservation et la protection de la nature et de la faune sauvage.
D'une facon g6n6rale, les objectifs du projet ont ete atteints: la production nationale
de bois de chauffage et d'industrie est passee de 125.000 m3 a plus de 260.000 m3 et les
plantations comme les travaux d'am6lioration des peuplements devraient apporter a terme du bois
d'oeuvre; les paturages forestiers ont et6 am6liores sans toutefois apporter de solutions aux



24                         APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE
problemes de leur gestion; 1'ensemble des interventions faites en foret participent a la protection
des sols; le projet a participe activement au contr6le et a la surveillance de la faune ainsi qu'a
la sensibilisation de la population pour la conservation de la nature.
Les couts totaux du projet s'elevent a US$ 40.3 millions dont US$ 18.1 millions
ont 6te d6bours6s sur le pret.
Les aspects sectoriels
Les r6sultats sectoriels du projet sont remarquables. Le projet a introduit de
nouvelles approches de travail en augmentant la participation du secteur prive dans les activit6s
forestieres. En outre, le projet a favorise le d6veloppement de nouvelles techniques telles la
preparation m6canique du sol, la realisation d'un inventaire national et la preparation d'un Plan
de D6veloppement des Ressources Forestieres et Pastorales, l'am6lioration des paturages, etc,
et l'utilisation d'une approche commerciale aux activit6s forestieres. Le projet a cr66 un
dynamisme de d6veloppement a l'int6rieur du secteur forestier.
Les aspects economiques et financiers
Les r6sultats 6conomiques et financiers ne sont pas encore clairement 6tablis. Les
premieres estimations montrent que les investissements ne pourront etre 6conomiquement
rentables qu'a long terme; le Gouvemement se donne cependant les moyens d'avoir une foret
productive et en bon 6tat.
En introduisant l'id6e d'exploiter les bois sur une base plus commerciale et de
r6duire les couits de production des travaux forestiers (6claircie, production des plants en
p6piniere), le projet participe a la r6duction du d6ficit budg6taire pour le secteur.
Le developpement institutionnel
Le projet a fourni des moyens logistiques importants (v6hicules, mat6riel) comme
appui a l'am6nagement, pour l'am6lioration et l'intensification des operations sylvicoles et la
conservation de la nature. La formation ainsi que les expertises-assistances techniques ont ete
dans l'ensemblejug6es satisfaisantes mais les resultats et recommandations donnees par certaines
de celles-ci ne semblent pas avoir ete exploit6es a fond.
Le projet a d6velopp6 un systeme de suivi-6valuation qu'il faut maintenant utiliser
I plein. Il est n6cessaire de se concentrer a pr6sent sur le renforcement de la capacit6 de gestion
du secteur plut6t que sur le d6veloppement technique.
Le projet a soutenu une recherche d'accompagnement dont le programme devra 8tre
renforc6 et mieux pr6cis6 a l'avenir. Un inventaire sylvo-pastoral national a et6 r6alis6; une
strat6gie de d6veloppement pastoral est pr&te; la strat6gie forestiere doit 8tre finalis6e sans



APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE                               25
retard. Le cadre l6gal du secteur forestier a ete modifi6 mais il demande encore des
ameliorations (voir point E).
Les realisations physiques
Les realisations physiques (operations de terrain) ont des r6sultats mitig6s pour les
plantations m6canis6es (4.880 ha realis6s pour 8.100 ha prevus), F'am6lioration des parcours
(3.002 ha pour 3.645 ha prevus) et les travaux de reg6neration (16.287 ha pour 21.500 ha
pr6vus). Le taux d'ex6cution global est estime a 60-70 %. Les 6carts sont en partie justifies par
la nature pilote de ces op6rations. Les programmes d'eclaircie (45.437 ha pour 50.000 ha
prevus), de plantations de berges d'oueds (2.608 ha pour 2.600 ha prevus) sont satisfaisants.
Les aspects sociaux et environnementaux
Les impacts du projet sur les populations vivant autour des forets, sur les exploitants
et les industriels du bois ainsi que sur le personnel du d6partement seront evalu6s en meme
temps que les effets sur 1'environnement par une 6tude sp6cifique. Cette etude, commencee le
14 juin 1995, devrait remettre ses resultats en d6cembre 1995.
La promotion du secteur prive
Le projet a eu un impact significatif sur le developpement du secteur prive dans le
contexte forestier. Le volume exploit6 par le secteur priv6 par la vente de bois sur pied par
adjudication represente 70% de la production totale et atteint les objectifs assignes par le projet
tandis que 16% de la production est gen6ree par environ 50 nouvelles unit6s d'exploitation
cr6ees dans le cadre du projet.
D. Les principaux facteurs qui ont affectes le projet
1) Facteurs non sujets au controle du Gouvernement
-      La secheresse qui a sevi en 1993 et 1994 a retarde les programmes de
plantations mecanisees.
2) Facteurs sujets au controle du Gouvernement
-      LLa restructuration en 1992 du Ministere de l'Agriculture accompagnee de
mutations diverses du personnel de la DGF (chefs d'arrondissements
forestiers et agents techniques) a eu des effets n6gatifs sur la realisation des
programmes d'activit6s dans les arrondissements.



26                         APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE
-      Le recrutement tardif de techniciens forestiers a retarde les op6rations de
martelage des arbres et par suite les travaux d'eclaircie et de regeneration
des peuplements.
3) Facteurs sujets au controle de l'agence d'e&xcution.
-      La s6lection malheureuse d'une societ6 d'assistance technique pour
l'inventaire et d'une soci6t6 de travaux de terrain qui ont causes des
problemes importants dans l'execution des composantes concemres.
-      Une utilisation insuffisante du systeme de suivi-evaluation en place qui
entraine une perte d'efficacite de gestion. Cette situation est compliqu6e
par le fait que la formulation du projet laisse a d6sirer sur certains points
comme le montage institutionnel et les aspects sociaux qui n'ont pas ete
suffisamment analyses.
E. La "durabilite" du projet
La durabilit6 des activit6s d'am6lioration des peuplements forestiers du premier
projet depend presque entierement de la bonne ex6cution du deuxieme projet. Cette premiere
phase a un caractere pilote; elle a tente de fixer ces conditions de durabilite. La deuxieme phase
devrait voir l'entreprise priv6e devenir de plus en plus efficace jusqu'a ce que le couit des
operations forestieres soit couvert par les ventes de produits. La durabilit6 des operations
forestieres sera d'autant mieux garantie que la rentabilite financiere et economique de celles-ci
sera grande.  Un equilibre entre ces deux elements assure la r6alisation des travaux,
l'opportunite d'emploi et le developpement des entreprises privees.
Concernant les nouvelles plantations, il est imperatif d'assurer les premiers
entretiens durant une p6riode suffisante (3 ans) pour assurer une reprise et une croissance
optimum des plants. Ces plantations doivent etre integr6es dans un plan d'am6nagement. Les
premiers degagements et 6claircies devraient etre realis6s durant la deuxieme phase du projet.
La protection anti-incendie doit etre organisee ou renforc6e dans les zones reboisees
m6caniquement.
Les travaux d'amelioration des paturages representent un effort important mais il
reste encore beaucoup a faire pour assurer la durabilit6 de cette operation. I1 faudra etudier de
facon approfondie les conditions socio-6conomiques des populations et repenser les relations
institutionnelles entre l'elevage et la foret. Egalement, la structure de tarification de l'usage des
diff6rents types de paturages devra etre reformulee. La participation d'organisations non-
gouvemementales serait souhaitable dans ce domaine.



APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE                               27
La durabilit6 de l'inventaire forestier sera assuree par son utilisation et son
actualisation. Une planification nationale des exploitations et autres operations forestieres devrait
faciliter les pr6visions budgetaires. Une strategie de mise a jour accompagnee d'une proposition
budg6taire pour cette activite qui n'est pas financ6e par la deuxieme phase doit etre d6termin6e
avant la fin 1995.
F. Les principales le,ons du ler projet
Une experience importante a et accumulee durant le premier projet dans les
domaines techniques (m6canisation des op6rations sylvicoles, valorisation du bois), de gestion
(appels d'offre, suivi-evaluation, n6cessit6 d'une meilleure connaissance des conditions socio-
economiques, petites entreprises), de l'organisation (BGP) et de la coordination entre secteurs
(Comite de Coordination forestier). Les lecons acquises ont deja et6 integrees dans le deuxieme
projet.
La mission d'achevement du premier projet confirme les lecons prec6dentes et
ajoute les elements suivants qui devraient etre prises en compte lors de l'evaluation a mi-
parcours du deuxieme projet forestier:
-      Le Bureau de Gestion du Projet doit 8tre renforc6 pour lui permettre de
traiter r6gulierement et pleinement les informations techniques et
financieres recues et de les utiliser comme outil de gestion. La mission
s'inquiete du suivi-evaluation du PDF2 vu que ce projet est plus important
que le premier et vu que te suivi-evaluation du PDFI connait deja certaines
difficult6s.
Le montage institutionnel de l'agence d'ex6cution devrait etre reformule
afm de tenir compte de la vocation commerciale qui lui est attribuee et lui
donner une plus grande autonomie operationnelle et fmanciere.
Les aspects institutionnels relatifs a l'elevage et aux plturages devraient
etre egalement analys6s et refonnules afm de cr6er une articulation
fonctionnelle entre toutes les parties interessees dans ces domaines.
Les formations et les expertises ne sont pas valoris6es pleinement. Les raisons sont
nombreuses, difficiles a cerner. Ces raisons m6ritent cependant d'8tre 6tudi6es s6rieusement pour
savoir comment ameliorer cette situation lors de l'evaluation a mi-parcours du deuxieme projet.
Les deux projets se concentrent sur des op6rations a haute intensite de capital. Or
1'exp6rience montre que ces op6rations sont technologiquement et sociologiquement peu viables
en certains endroits. La mission recommande que, dans le cadre du PDF2, les diverses



28                       APPENDIX A: AIDE-MEMOIRE
possibilites existant entre les extremes: op6rations a haute intensite de main d'oeuvre et
opemtions A haute intensite de capital, soient etudi6es.
G. Suite & donner
De retour a Rome, la mission va r&iiger le rapport d'achevement du premier projet
de d6veloppement forestier. Ce rapport sera soumis a I'approbation de la Banque Mondiale. Les
resultats de F'6tude d'impact du projet actuellement en cours seront integres dans le rapport
d'achevement de la partie tunisienne.



APPENDIX B: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS                       29
Appendix B: Financial and Economic Analysis
A. Financial Analysis
1.         The total project costs and their financing are given in Tables 8A and 8B of
Part 1111. The following is simply to give the main assumptions used in the calculations. FD
never kept track of the project costs as laid out in Table 8A, mainly because of the absence of
a proper monitoring/evaluation system. As a result, all the recurrent costs had to be
reconstructed during the mission's visit, mainly on the basis of the staff's best estimates and
recollections. The value of the Government's contribution in dinars has been converted into
dollars at the average exchange rate of D 0.9413 = US$ 1.00. This constitutes the average of
the annual rates, weighted by the respective annual disbursements over the project
implementation period.
2.         Although the project must be seen as a pilot exercise whose main achievement has
been to introduce more progressive (commercial-oriented) policies and managerial practices, it
is still worthwhile to discuss briefly the fincial viability of the main activities. As of now, the
nurseries are not financially viable because: (a) FD sees them as a means of disseminating
improved planting material and, to this end, distributes for free a non-negligible part of the
production each year (about 1/3), and (b) the standard price for forestry plants has been D 0.050
per unit until recently, whereas the (direct) production cost was of the order of D 0.150 per unit.
Therefore, plant production from the nurseries has constituted a net drain on FD's budget. The
project, however, has resulted in reducing the operating deficit through specific investments (see
para 4).
3.         Table 1 illustrates the impact of the main commercial-type of activities on the FD's
budget. The deficit generated by the thinning operations is gradually decreasing through the
project's investment period, to D 117 thousand in 1994. This is due to the increasing
involvement of the private enterprises which are also becoming more efficient with time. In
accordance with one of the loan conditions for the project (Section 5.03c), FD revised upward,
in January 1995 (one month after project completion), the official prices for the products
originating from the state forests. Assuming that the quantities of wood thinned would be the
same as in 1994, FD would then register a surplus of D 121 thousand in 1995. As a result, it
is likely that the thinning operations will be profitable for FD in the future.
4.         Much of the cutting operations (regeneration/maquis) are carried out under bidding
("adjudication"). Along with the sales of pine cones to individuals (for further processing by
them into seeds), the "redevances" constitute revenues which did not take place before and are
All the tables presented in this appendix are in French because they were constructed and discused with the
Tunisians during the mission's visit.



30             APPENDIX B: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
almost entirely due to the project; D 413 thousand (355 + 58) in 1994. The financial benefits
(deficit reduction) from the nurseries come from the sales of the plants (which was not the
normal practice before) and from the savings in the production costs (through the introduction
of cement tanks which practically eliminates the need for weeding). These benefits were
equivalent to D 256 thousand in 1994. The cumulative cash flow for all the activities covered
in Table 1 is positive throughout the project's investment period.
5.         Obviously, the project's overall impact on the public finance is negative since the
Government's total contribution (net of taxes/duties) was almost D 15 million (US$ 15.9
million). However, the commercial-type of activities, taken as a group, are self-financing and
could be individually so if and when the nurseries are managed on a more commercial basis. The
important point is that the financial sustainability of the activities is likely as long as FD is given
back, through its annual budget allocations, the equivalent of the revenues generated. In the long
term, the sustainability would be better assured if FD were given a legal status more in line with
its commercial vocation (ie. status of a semi-autonomous entity).
6.         Finally, as already mentioned in paragraph 3, the project has resulted in a 1995
upward revision of FD's official sales prices for the products originating from the state forests
and ranging from nursery plants, to sawlog and pine cones. For illustrative purposes, the 1995
price raises applied to the product quantities given in Table 1 for 1994 would have resulted in
a cash flow increase for 1995 of D 266 thousand (808 - 542). This brings the commercial value
of the state products in line with the private market and will reinforce the financial sustainability
of FD's future operations.
7.         A limited financial analysis of the mechanized and riverain plantations was carried
out and is briefly discussed in the Working Paper. The main observation is that the possible
financial rates of return for both types of plantations will probably be attractive in the future -
ie. well above 10%, considered to be the opportunity cost of capital in real terms - for the
following reasons: (a) the private enterprises increasingly involved in the thinning/cutting (and
eventually planting) works are gradually becoming more sophisticated/efficient, and (b) some
of the (indirect) investment costs, specially concerning the technical assistance/training, will be
substantially lower in next phases. Consequently, it is realistic to envisage a situation (relatively
soon) where the establishment of plantations will be financially profitable, particularly in the
case of riverain plantations where the production/revenues materialize earlier in the inflows
stream, with a greater present value.
8.         The establishment of improved and permanent pastures was part of the project.
Because of the absence of proper monitoring, the information available on the progress achieved
under this component is very sketchy. Nevertheless, a number of observations can be made
concerning the financial viability of establishing pastures. With the 1995 revision of FD's official
prices, the "redevances" for using the improved/permanent pastures are D2.5/head/month for
cattle and D2/head/month for small ruminants. This seems to discriminate heavily against the
owners of small ruminants since it takes around five heads of small ruminants to graze the



APPENDIX B: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS                        31
equivalent (per ha) of one head of cattle. Furthermore, the cost of maintaining such pastures is
roughly estimated at D35/ha/year plus the cost of the fence amortized over 10 years (DIO/year).
The total maintenance cost would then be D45/ha/year (35 + 10) and could not be recovered
with cattle which would bring only a maximum of D30 (2.5 for one head X 12 months) per ha.
The financial gap is even larger for improved (non-permanent) pastures. In addition, the
"redevances" are on a monthly basis, practically eliminating the possibility of removing the
livestock during the month if the carrying capacity is found to be exceeded. These simple
calculations suggest that the structure of the "redevances" must be totally reexamined if the
establishment/maintenance of pastures are to become financially sustainable, if and when the
many technical and institutional problems now being experienced are resolved.
B. Economic Analysis
9.         Table 2 gives the estimated economic cash flows for the project as a whole, in
thousands of dinars of 1995, and the resulting rate of return. The main assumptions are as
follows. In the case of wood production; the production estimates are given in Table 3, the
economic (import parity) prices used are shown in Table 4 and were calculated on the basis of
current CIF prices in dinars as observed in Tunis"1. In the case of almonds and bee-keeping
products, the current market prices were used as reliable proxies of the economic values. The
project revenues and costs, prior to 1995, were inflated using the composite indexes described
in the Working Paper. To take into account the evident surplus of manual/daily labour on the
free market, all such labour in the investment and maintenance costs was shadow-priced at the
level of 70% of the officially paid salary, the latter being slightly more than 3 D/day. The
operating costs, after the investment period, are estimated at 20% of those in 1994, the last year
of investment. The replacement costs are estimated at 10% (per year) of the total investments
(over the seven years) in vehicles and equipment.
10.        The economic rate of return is 9%  over 57 years. This rate is satisfactory
considering that the ERR calculation, based on a conventional use of present values, tends to
underestimate the future value of wood products as well as of any remaining standing trees.
Obviously, the rate does not include the project's beneficial impact on the environment,
particularly in terms of slowing/stopping soil erosion. This, in turn, will eventually lead to a
larger agricultural production than would be the case otherwise. On the basis of the limited
information available, it is practically impossible to estimate the opportunity costs of the yields
losses due to erosion, flooding and reduced soil moisture, and which have been avoided with the
project. However, a recent World Bank-financed study2 demonstrated that rates of return of
forestry projects can be substantially higher when all environmental/social benefits are taken into
account. For example, in the case of the Bou Hertma region, which covers part of the project
I/ Tunisia is already importing forestry products. The foreign exchange rate is not shadow-priced.

32             APPENDIX B: FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
area, the study estimated at 20% the overall economic rate of return of various selected forestry
investments using the conventional method of calculation, and at 28 % using the FORCES-MOD
method to capture the non-directly quantifiable benefits (including environmental). The 9 % base
rate should therefore be considered as a minimum.
11.       The base rate is relatively insensitive to revenue and cost variations. For instance,
an increase of 25 % in the revenues would bring the rate up to "only" 11%, the same level as
with a decrease of 25 % in the costs. Among the revenues, sales from wood production are the
most important and there is a concern that future thinning operations might not be undertaken
because of the low-quality/unattractiveness of the resulting wood. A sensitivity analysis was
carried out assuming that all the wood from the first (next) production cycle of pine, eucalyptus
and poplar for chipwood/poles is from thinning". It is expected that all the project's wood
production, afterwards, would decline due to tree stunting in the absence of thinning. Assuming
that half the wood from thinning will not materialize and that all wood production will decline
by 20% afterwards, the rate of return would still be at an acceptable level of 7%. Assuming that
no thinning will take place and that all wood production will decline by 40% afterwards, the rate
is 6%. The project's overall economic viability is therefore not greatly affected by future
thinning operations, particularly when taking into account the non-directly quantifiable benefits.
12.       It must be pointed out that the base rate of 9% is half the ERR estimated in the
SAR. The main reason for the lower economic (directly quantifiable) returns in the ICR is the
assumptions made for the production buildup which are less optimistic than in the SAR but more
in line with those used for the formulation of Phase II of the Forestry Development Project.
Another important reason is the fact that only 60% of the 8,100 ha under the mechanized
plantations program and 76% of the 21,500 ha under the forest regeneration program were
covered. These shortcomings are not compensated by the 20% shortfall in the project costs .
13.       In addition to the economic revenues previously discussed, there are other benefits
which are much more difficult to evaluate. About 4.8 million person-days of manual/field work
were contracted under the project, for various activities such as tree thinning and cutting (for
regeneration). Close to D 13 million of daily salaries - equivalent to almost US$ 14 million -was
paid for the work, which must have generated even more jobs and incomes (through a multiplier
effect) in the economy. Furthermore, the project has been successful at promoting the private
sector in forestry. Some 50 small enterprises, with an average of ten employees each, are now
involved in forestry activities such as thinning. These enterprises already account for 16 % of the
national wood production. It is estimated that roughly half of the 16 % has been financed directly
through the project since 1988. In addition to increasing the efficiency/profitability of forestry
operations, these enterprises are also generating jobs and incomes in the country.
I/  1998-2003 for pine, 2000-6 for eucalyptus and 2004-9 for poplar (see Table 2).
