INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMNIT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECO4I4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECIORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE SUDAN FOR THE RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation of a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of the Sudan for the equivalent
of $42 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the Rahad Irrigation
Project. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (Kuwait Fund) are also participating in
financing this project. The USAID loan of $11 million is for 40 years including
a ten-year grace period with 2 percent interest annually during the grace period
and 3 percent interest per annum thereafter for the next 30 years. The Kuwait
Fund loan of 3.3 million Kuwaiti Dinars equivalent to $11 million, is for 30
years including a five-year grace period with 2½5 percent interest and i percent
service charge annually. 1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       An economic mission from the Bank visited the Sudan in November/
December 1971 and its report entitled "The Economic Development and Prospects
of the Sudan" (Report No. AE-27, in four volumes, dated June 9, 1972) was
distributed on June 30, 1972. This was the first full economic mission to the
Sudan after a lapse of several years out, owing to continued political unrest
in the southern part of the country, the mission's coverage was limited to
northern Sudan. In March 1972 the government reached an agreement (the Addis
Ababa Accord) with the southern rebel elements as a result of which peace
returned to the south and a Southern Regional Self-Government was established
in Juba with a large measure of autonomy. The Bank was requested by the Sudan
to assist in the reconstruction and development of the Southern Region which has
suffered much physical destruction during the prolonged strife. A special
economic mission visited the Region in November/December 1972, and is currently
preparing a report on development problems and prospects in the Region.
3.       The Sudan's first effort at comprehensive development planning was the
Ten-Year Plan, FY62-71. However, owing to unsettled political conditions and
lack of well prepared projects, this Plan only served to provide quantitative
guidelines for the annual development budgets, and in July 1970 was replaced
by a new Five-Year Plan covering the period July 1971 to June 1975.   The Plan
has an investment target of Ls 427 million of which the shares of the public
and private sectors are 60 and 40 percent respectively. It projects that GDP
will increase at an average annual rate of 7.6 percent. The performnance during
the first two years of the Plan suggests that substantial shortfalls are likely
to occur with regard to both these targets.
1/   The financial plan for this project, including the cost estimates and the
contributions by IDA, USAID and the Kuwait Fhnd, have been based upon the
currency values prevailing before the recent dollar devaluation. The project
costs in terms of dollars are now expected to increase and for that reason
the amount of the IDA credit now recommended is $42 million rather than
the $40 million given in the remainder of this report and the appraisal
report. The Kuwait Fund loan of 3.3 million Dinars is now the equivalent
of about $11 million rather than the $10 million given in the documents.
The USAID $11 million loan remains unchanged.



4.       During the past five years, the econorny has shown little growth.
This is primarily due to the depressed level of investment, both public
and private. In addition to the low growth rate, the economy has suffered
from excessive monetary expansion to cover the public sector deficits.
*While the government has been successful in achieving a high rate of
growth of revenue, the rise in recurrent expencliture has absorbed most of
it. The surplus on the recurrent budget has consequently been small,
averaging about Ls 8 million a year, and has nfuctuated widely. If account
is taken of the major public enterprises then the aggregate public sector
savings has averaged about Ls 10.0 million a year over the last decade.
Prices have risen steadily, and the external position has been under
pressure owing to the rapid growth of imports and progressive decline in
net capital inflow. While there has been some growth of cotton exports,
there has been a stagnation in the export of gum arabic, sesame and ground-
nuts. Sudan's foreign assets were substantially depleted by 1968 and net
foreign assets are now negative. In FY71 (July 1, 1970 to June 30, 1971)
there was a net outflow of public capital.
5.       Public sector development expenditures totalled Ls 334 million
during the period FY62 - FY71, of which the share of the central government
was 72 percent, the balance representing investment by the public enl;erprises.
The average annual investment, as uell as saving, in the second half of the
1960s was lower than in the first, resulting largely from political uncertainty
and the consequent failure to assign high priority to economic development
and also to generate resources on an adequate scale. With regard to the
financing of investment, external sources provided about 41 percent, while
public sector savings and internal borrowing covered the remainder equally.
The decline in public sector savings is a particularly disquieting feature,
and has contributed significantly to the mounting deficit.

6.       In recent years the Sudanese balance of payments has been
characterized by (a) a heavy reliance on cotton as the major export, and (b)
a rising level of imports due to the inadequacy of local food production and
the limited range of local manufacturing industry. Although the growth of
imports has, on the average, been slower than that of exports, Sudan has had
a continuous deficit on the current account averaging Ls 19I4 million a year
throughout the 1960s. In contrast to many other African countries which
started the 1960s with large surpluses on the current account, for the period



- 3-
1957-61 Sudan had an average annual deficit on its current account of Ls 9
million. The problem was aggravated by the closure of the Suez Canal in
1967, since it raised the impori; bill and reduced export receipts. Further-
more, owing principally to political instability, the net inflow of capital,
which averaged only about Ls 8.9 million a year in the period began to
decline until it became negative in FY71. These factors led to a rapid
depletion of Sudan's foreign reserves, and forced the government to contract
short-term loans on less than favorable terms.
7.       The 1971 Bank economic mission concluded that the Dresent economic
stagnation could be overcome if the government were to take appropriate
steps to curtail expenditure, increase revenues and export earnings and
reactivate the private sector. The IMF has had a series of stand-by
arrangements with the Sudan, the latest of which is a stand-by for 40
million SDR's up to March 1973. Both in the IMF consultations and the
Bank mission's discussions with the government, specific recommendations
have been made regarding budgetary and fiscal measures needed to improve the
economic situation; the stand-by agreement with the IMF stipulates credit
ceilings and hence acts as a check on unbridled increases in public sector
expenditurBs,
8.       It had originally been expected that there would be a significant
improvement in public sector finances in FY73, particularly in view of the
end of the prolonged strife in the Southern Region. The best hope for a
financial improvement was the decrease in military expenditure following
the cessation of hostilities. However, the terms of the Addis Ababa Accord
and the financial obligations which the Khartoum government has undertaken
as part of it have created a substantial burden which it is ill-equipped to
bear. In the first place, as part of the Accord some 6,000 Anyanya (southern
guerilla fighters) have had to be absorbed into the regular Sudanese army
and some 4,000 into the ranks of the police and warders, while an additional
3,500 - 4,000 men have been put on the payroll of the civilian ministries.
The absorption of so many Anyanya has more than offset the savings on direct
military expenditure. The bulk of the Southern Region's financial requirements
- both for recurrent and capital expenditures - have to be met by the
central government. It is estimated that in FY73 the central government will
be required to incur various types of expenditure in the Southern Region
amounting to about Ls 22 million, of which somewhat over a third represents
a net increase in expenditure directly attributable to the provisions of the
Addis Ababa Accord. Expenditure on this scale will almost certainly preclude
any improvement in the financial situation in the short run, unless a way is
found by which a large increase in revenues can be generated. The government
is reluctant at this time to increase taxation, but expects that a variety
of measures it proposes to undertake will reactivate the economy and thereby
augment revenue.
9,.      In 1972 the government adopted some policies which could have a
far reaching effect on the long term growth of the Sudanese economy. Private
assets which had been confiscated a few years ago are being returned to their
owners and private investment is being actively encouraged. The government
is making a serious effort to attract foreign private en,terprise and there
are indications that some private investment may be forthcoming. The SudaiB.



- h -
close ties with some of the oil-rich Arab states have led to significant
amounts of aid from the latter, and there are indications that more aid will
follow. As efforts to rehabilitate and develop the economy of the south
materialize, a complementary economic relationship between the north and south
will eventually develop, which will improve the balance of payments situation
by increasing exports and reducing imports. A:ll these developments should
improve the outlook for the Sudanese economy. The flow of external assistance
is crucial if these steps are to succeed. In 1970 the government
nationalized a number of financial, commercial and industrial privately
owned companies. Many were essentially foreign owned, the bulk of them by
British nationals. The Nationalization Acts provide for compensation and
agreement on compensation has been reached respecting two foreign Banks.
Several other cases are under negotiation. The government has kept us
informed of progress.
10.   Th.e urgent need to increase the flow of external assistance to the
Sudan despite the unsatisfactory performance of the public sector presents
a dilemma for aid donors. Improving the performance of the public sector
will be a slow process in view of the conditions mentioned above and can
proceed more easily if the productive base of the economy is expanded
sufficiently to provide an increased flow of revenue and foreign exchange
earnings. Therefore, it is our view that by financing high priority projects
which have a direct impact on government revenues and foreign exchange
earnings, such as the Rahad Irrigation Project, the Bank can help the Sudan
government to improve its finances and can encourage it to take steps within
its control in the same direction. Country data are attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE SUDAN
11.        Since the Sudan became independent in 1956, the Bank Group has
made commitments totalling $168.75 million and has been the country's largest
source of foreign aid. A major portion of our past lending was to help finance
irrigation and rai1way projects, but we also financed a power project and an
education project. Agriculture has also benefitted from two mechanized
farming projects and a highway maintenance pro;ject was approved in August 1972.
Annex  II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IA credits and IFC
investments as of January 31, 1973 and notes oIn the execution of on-going
projects.
12.       Our economic missions have enabled us to prepare detailed analyses
of the major economic sector s and identify several high priority projects,
some of which could be suitable for Bank Group lending. While no loans or
credits were made to the Sudan between September 1968 and June 1972, largely
because of the government's failure to take measures necessary to overcome
its economic difficulties, we believe the situation is improving. The
government has given more attention to the resolution of its domestic economic
and political problems. The ending of the conf'lict in the south has been
a substantial achievement although it is bound to add to the immediate
development resource requirements of the country. Resumption of diplomatic
relations with West Germany and the U.S. and efforts at continuing stand-by
arrangements with the IlMF are further evidence of the government's genuine
determination to find solutions to the Sudan's pressing problems. A clearly
more receptive attitude to the Bank and the pressing needs of the south
are strong justification for more active Bank Group operations in the Sudan



- 5 -
13.       While the Southern Region has special requirements to rehabilitate
its economy, for the country as a whole it is evident that our lending
strategy in the near future should continue to emphasize agriculture and
transportation, which hold the key to increasing both production and exports.
In addition to the Rahad Irrigation Project which will substantially help
agriculture, we are also planning a third railway project to improve rail
transport and port facilities and a development finance companies project
oased on the Industrial Bank of Sudan to help reactivate the private sector.
Future projects include second power and highway projects, a domestic aviation
project and a project to provide for rural development in the Southern Region.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN THE SUDAN
1h.       The Sudan has tremendous agricultural potential.  While much of the
country is desert or semi-desert, there is a substantial margin of land which
is suitable for both crop and livestock raising. The White Nile and the Blue
Nile have endowed the country with sufficient water to enable it already to
have the biggest irrigation system in tropical Africa.
15.       The Sudan's economy is predominantly agricultural and the overwhelming
majority of the population live in the rural areas. About 200 million feddans 1/
or a little over a third of the total area is potentially usable. With range
lands accounting for some 80 million feddans the total cultivable area is
120 million feddans. Of this area only about 16 million feddans are presently
under cultivation, the irrigated area being about 4 million feddams. There is
therefore great scope for expanding agricultural production through both an
extension of rainfed cultivation and further irrigation.
16.       In the past five or six decades, economic development in the Sudan
has been influenced more by the expansion of agricultural production under
irrigation than any other factor. The best known of the Sudan's irrigation
projects is the Gezira Scheme on the Blue Nile, which, since its inception
in 1925, has been steadily expanded and now covers nearly 2 million feddans.
The Gezira changed a way of living which had prevailed for centuries and laid
the foundation for the Sudan's entry into the modern world. The second
biggest gravity irrigation project is the Kashm El Girba Scheme covering
about 450,000 feddans, for which water is provided from a dam on the Atbara
River. In addition to these gravity schemes, large areas are covered by
pump irrigation schemes like the Guneid Project (45,000 feddans) and the
Es Suki Project (90,000 feddans). A furbher 540,000 feddans are irrigated
by smaller pumps along the Nile and its tributaries. During the 1960s the
1/        One feddan equals 1.038 acres or 0.420 hectares.



-6-
use of the Nile waters for irrigated agriculture increased from 4 to 11.7
milliard cubic meters, and the area under irrigation expanded by 980,00C
feddans or about 86 percent. The Mianagil and Roseires irrigation projects,
which the Bank helped finance, contributed substantially to this development.
However, the storage capacity of the Roseires Dam, completed in 1966, is not
yet fully utilized and the Sudan currently uses only about 63 percent of its
entitlement of 18.5 milliard cubic meters under the 1959 Nile Waters
Agreement with Egypt.
17.      Cotton, oil seeds and cereals are the major crops. Acacia trees,
the source of gum arabic, mostly growing wild, are also important.  The
principal exports are cotton, oil seeds, vegetable oils, gum, oil cakes,
livestock, hides and skins, and, in years of surplus, sorghum. Cotton
accounts for about 60 percent of exports and is the government's main
source of revenue. The country is self-sufficient in sorghum, its staple
food grain. Wheat, second in importance toasrghum, now accounts for a fifth
of food requirements and its consumption is increasing, necessitating some
imports. Other main food imports are sugar, tea, coffee and canned food.
Inputs such as fertilizer, pesticides and machinery are also imported.
Together food and agricultural inputs account for about one-fifth of total
imports.
18.      In their Development Plan the Sudanese have rightly given high
priority to agriculture.  The investment targets for agriculture are, however,
optimistic and do not take sufficient account of the transportation constraints
and of marketing limitations for specific products. Moreover, some
reorganization of the existing machinery for plannring and administration of
agriculture is needed. As many as four Ministries, several departments and
six corporations hold responsibilities for different agricultural activities.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
19.      A report entitled "Appraisal of the Rahad Irrigation Project -
Sudan" (No. PA-139b dated February 16, 1973) is being circulated separately.
Please see map and Annex III - The Credit and Project Summary.
20.      The Rahad Irrigation Project has been under consideration by the
Bank Group for some years. In 1965 the Sudan sought Bank Group financing
for the first nhase of the Rahad Scheme consisting of the irrigation of
a bout 4lO,000 feddans by gravity from the Roseires reservoir.  The project
was appraised in 1967 but difficulties arose over the size of the investment
(3110 million), the lack of a comprehensive national development plan, and
the technical and economic justification of the project. After nurnerous
exchanges of views, a modified project was appraised in February 1970.
Althcugh the cost was lower (US$110 million), it was still formidable in
relation to the Sudan's financial resources. The need for foreign assistance
was too large to be met by IDA alone and sufficient extemal assistance was
not forthcoming. As a result, no credit was negotiated. Despite unsettled
political conditions, the Bank Group continued to maintain close contact with
the project. For a time in 1.970 the government decided to proceed with the
Rahad Scheme without IDA assistance but the size of investment needed for a
viable first phase gravity scheme was found to be an insuperable obstacle.



- 7 -
To reduce size and cost of the first phase project the Sudanese then proposed
to replace the gravity supply from the Roseires Dam, which required a
190 km supply canal, by a pumped supply taking water from a point downstream
on the Blue Nile nearer to the area to be irrigated, thereby reducing the
length of the supply canal to only 84 km. This system would command a smaller
area for irrigation initially but without affecting the economic justification
of the eventual full development. In September 1971 the government submitted
to IDA the outline of a 300,000 feddan pump scheme first phase which was
appraised in February 1972 and forms the basis of the present project.
Negotiations were held in Washington in January 1973. The Borrower's delegation
was led by Dr. Nasreldin Mubarak, Undersecretary in the Sudanese Ministry of
Planning.
21.       The proposed project is planned to irrigate an area of about
300,000 feddans which are now sparsely populated semi-desert on the east bank
of the Rahad River. It would use water pumped from the Blue Nile and would
include the construction of irrigation supply, distribution and drainage works,
the provision of agricultural processing equipment, storage facilities, and
the settlement of about 14,000 tenant families (about 70,000 people) with all
the necessary infrastructure and supporting services. More specifically, the
project would comprise:-
(a) The construction of irrigation and drainage wiorks comprising:
(i)    a 105 m 3/sec electrically powered pumping station at
Meina on the Blue Nile, some 200 km downstream from
Roseires Dam;
(ii)   a supply canal, 84 km long, carrying water from Meina
to an out-fall on the Rahad River;
(iii) a barrage and head regulator on the Rahad, 6 km
downstream of the supply canal outfall; and
(iv)   an irrigation distribution and drainage system supplying
300,000 feddans net;
(b)  The construction of headquarters, offices and staff houses with
the necessary utilities and roads;
(c)  The provision of transmission lines to supply the pumping station
and the project area;
(d)  The provision of agricultural equipment and processing facilities,
incluading farm machinery, ginneries, decorticators, warehouses,
and a light railway;
(e)  Wlater supply and public health facilities for new settlers'
villages and an initial inventory of chemicals and equipment
for bilharzia and malaria control;
(f) The settlement of the area in three years including bush
clearance and land levelling;
(g)  The provision of seed pmduction and research farms;



- 8 -
(h) Consultant services for the irrigation system and associated
works; andc
(i)  Preparation of a feasibility study by consultants for a second
phase project including studies of the optimum use of the
remainLng Roseires storage waters.
22.      The Sudanese government would carry out this project through its
Ministry of Irrigation (MOI) and an autonomous government agency, the Rahad
Corporation, established after detailed discussion with IDA. As large
irrigation schemes have existed in the Sudan since 1925, MOI has considerable
experience in the design and construction of irrigation distribution systems.
Its experience of canals as large as the project supply canal and in the
design and construction of major structures is, however, limited. Consultants
acceptable to IDA would be retained to advise MOI engineers on the detailed
designs of the supply and main canals and to take full responsibility for
design of the pumping station, supply canal structures and the Rahad barrage and
headworks. The consultants would also help evaluate bids, supervise all works
awarded after international competitive bidding and certify all payment
vouchers eligible for reimbursement from the proposed external financing.
23.      The Rahad Corporation established under the Rahad Corporation Act
of April 1972, would undertake agricultural development and management of the
Rahad Project and its future extensions. Its C(ouncil, responsible to the Minister
of Agriculture, would include representatives of the various ministries, the
Sudan Gezira Board, the Cotton I14arketing Corporation, the Agricultural Research
Corporation, the provinces of Blue Nile and Kassala and the tenants.   While
the Corporation would have its own staff and powers to carry out any works, MOI
would construct, operate and maintain the irrigation and drainage system. The
organization of the project duplicates the provren pattern evolved over
45 years in the Gezira. For administrative purposes the project area would be
divided into three groups each of 100,000 feddans and each group would comprise
three 33,000 feddan blocks with appropraite staff. The tenants would be
settled on holdings of 24 feddans each and given materials to build a house
on an allotted village site. The tenancy agreement with the Rahad Corporation
would continue in force indefinitely and could be terminated only in case of
default by the tenant. The crops grown on an approved rotation would be
mainly cotton and groundnuts. The Corporation would purchase and distribute
on credit most inputs required by farmers, especially fertilizer, pesticides
and'spraying services. It would purchase and collect farmers' crops and
deliver to Port Sudan the produce to be exported. Storage and marketing would
be undertaken by the Cotton Marketing Corporation.
21j.     Th-e proposed project constitutes the f'irst phase in providing irrigation
to the Rahad area, is expected to be completed in five years and is estimated
to cost $96 million with a foreign exchange component of about $64 million.
Contingencies have been provided on the basis of 15 percent of the physical
construction work and 5 percent per annum for price increases.   The main items
of expenditure would be on the irrigation works and' related materials and
equipment; buildings, services and utilities; agricultural equipment and
vehicles; and processing and storage. The proportion of foreign costs for
construction is high because the Sudan imports not only most of the machinery,
vehicles and equipment but even most building materials including timber.
The project involves substantial use of machinery in the construction of the
canals. More labor-intensive construction methods would be unsuitable and time-
consuming because of the difficult climate and soil conditions in the area.



-9-
The sparsely populated Sudan does not suffer from rural unemployment and
in many regions the harvesting of crops is handicapped by a seasonal shortage
of agricultural labor, necessitating increased mechanization and the use
of itinerant laborers from other areas. These seasonal labor shortages
coincide with the peak construction season in the Rahad area.
25.      The financing plan for the proposed project as negotiated included
external assistance from IDA and two other co-lenders, the USAID and the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development.   In addition, the World Food
Program (WFP) would provide commodities' valued at $2.3 million for use by the
government to pay construction labor and provide initial subsistence for
newly settled tenants in the project area. The Sudan would provide most
of its share of financing by supplying existing MOI equipment and labor force
for force account work. On this basis the financing plan agreed was:

Total              96.0
26.      Works valued at $18 million would be carried out by force account
with MOI equipment and labor force. The government places high priority
on using these resources which they have had for some years.   On the
completion of the 800,000 feddan Managil Scheme in 1968 the government
decided for social and economic reasons that the MOI should maintain its
labor force of over 7,000 which was subsequently used to construct several
smaller gravity and pump irrigation schemes in the country. By 1972 the
labor force had been reduced through attrition to 5,000 of which 2,000 are
working on the Northwest Sennar Irrigation scheme and about 3,000 are
virtually unemployed. With additional equipment worth about $4.7 million,
and using existing equipment with a book value of $2.6 million, these 3,000
men could be usefully employed on the distribution and drainage system of the
project. The force account works would be financed by the government and in
negotiations it was agreed that an adequate supply of spare parts for MOI
equipment would be maintained. In order to avoid a fixed recurring burden on
the government's budget and to encourage the development of local contractors
to carry out such projects in future, it was also agreed that the Ministry's
permanent labor force would not be expanded further.
27.      Construction anj agricultural equipment and vehicles valued at $11
million and financed by USAID would be procured under their own procedures
but to specifications agieed with the Borrower and IDA. International
competitive bidding wvould apply to all civil works, materials and equipment
covered by external financing from the Kuwait Fund and IDA. Smaller
contracts amounting to $h03 million, consiting of unrelated items of work
scattered over the project area and scheduled to be completed as settlement
progresses, would be of interest to large contractors already working in the
area and to local contractors but would not be large enough to justify

intermational advertising.
28.      Disbursement of the proceeds of the credit and the Kuwait Fund
loan against contracte for supply of directly imported materials,
equipment and vehicles would cover 100 percent of cif cost, but for
locally manufactured items like gates and siphons disbursements would be
70 percent of contract price in order to exclucde customs duties and
surcharges on imported components and materials. The foreign cost of
consultants would be 100 percent eligible for disbursement.  For civil
works, disbursements would be based on percentages of the monthly payments
as certified by the consultants. These percentages are 70 percent for large
works and 50 percent for small works. Retroactive financing not exceeding
$200,000 has been included to cover consultants' services since March 1972.
29.      The project is expected to benefit thei national economy significantly.
It will change unproductive semi-desert into irrigated farmland. It will
almost triple the incomes of about 14,000 households in the area and
provide seasonal employment for 90,000 laborers in addition to the
substantial con;struction labor employed for the first five years. The direct
economic benefits would consist of the export value of ootton and groundnuts
and the farmgate value of domestically consumed crops. The net foreign
exchange earnings are expected to increase as a result of this project by
about $27 million annually at full development. Indirect benefits of the
project would include increasing the level of agricultural technology in the
Sudan and the training of Sudanese staff who cou:Ld later use the improved
methods in future development schemes.  The economic rate of return is
expected to be about 13.5 percent. After a three year grace period following
initial settlement, an annual land and water charge would be levied rising
from Ls h4.00 per feddan to Ls 7.00 per feddan within a further four years.
These charges, together with export duties, are expected to recover, over
the lifetime of the project, currelit costs and investment costs with 3
percent interest. The land and w-ater charge wou-Ld be revieved at least
once in every five years to ensure the 3 percent rate of return.
30.      The large increase in irrigated area which the project will bring
about is likely to affect the incidence of malaria and bilharzia, which are
endemic in the region. The project therefore includes public health measures
for treatment, prevention and control of these diseases and provides for
necessary facilities, chemicals and equipment. Other ecological aspects of
the project relate to the Dinder Game Park, the use of aerial spraying and
the possibility of aflatoxin fungus infection of groundnuts. A study made
by UNTDP on behalf of the governmnent has indicatecd that game migration from
and to the Dinder Game Park will not be affected by the supply canal proposed
inI the project as it is over 100 Ian to the north of the Game Park. Aerial
spraying of pesticides over large areas of cotton cultivation is already well
established in the neighboring Gezira Scheme as the most effective method
of pest control. The technical personnel, rnostly European contractors, are
highly skilled and their equipment well maintained. Since all tenants live
in villages away from the fields, and the fields are cleared before spraying,
accidental exposure to chemical spraying has been effectively prevented.  The
same care-fl practices will be continued in the proposed project.  Fungus
infection of groundnuts causing aflatoxin will be minimized as the Rahad
Project envisages groundnut harvesting by machines. This el-iminates the need
for pre-harvest irrigation and wasqing which cause the fungus infection.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
31.      The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Democratic
Republic of the Sudan and the Association, the Recommendation of the
committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms substantially
to the pattern of the Association's agreements for irrigation projects.
32.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOINIENDATION
33.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the p-oposed
development credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
The Bank and IDA have so far made six loans and three credits to the
Sudan. Disbursements are in progress or will shortly commence for four projects.
Loan No. 522 Power Project; US$1f9.0 Million Loan of January 15, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The 1968 loan to the Central Electricity and Water Corporation (CEWC),
a semi-autonomous government agency, was for a power project comprising a 90 MW
hydroelectric powerhouse at Roseires, related transmission lines and substations,
as well as management consulting services. The project is now completed, but
accounting and administrative inadequacies of the CEWC continue to require
special attention of supervision missions. The project has successfully made
additional power available to the Khartoum area~
Credit No. 122 Education Project; US$8.5 Millioni Credit of June 24, 1968;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Changes in the original school sites, modifications in the general
educational system and delays commencing construction of the secondary schools
have resulted in very slow progress.   However, the Ministry of Education is
now devoting more attention to the project and the rate of disbursement is
expected to increase rapidly after the award of civil works contracts.
Credit No. 311 Mechanized Farming Project; US$lL.25 Million Credit of June 12,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first mechanized farming project (Loan 556-SU) to establish about
1h0 farms of 1000 feddans each (1 feddan = 1.03 acres) was completed in
July 1971, one year ahead of sche(lule and with substantial savings. Encouraged
by this success the area of the original project was extended by 75,000 feddans
and a second mechanized farming project covering a further 420,000 feddans was
approved for which Credit 311-SU was signed orn June 12, 1972. Because of
delay in appointing an accounting firm the credit is not yet effective.
Credit 331 Highway Project; US$7.0 Million Credit of September 29, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project comprises assistance to the Department of Roads (DOR) in
irmiproving its organization, in preparing a highway betterment and maintenance
program and purchases of related equipment spares and materials. Also included
arm feasibility studies of about 500 km of roads followed by detailed engineer-

ANNEX III
rage 2
Financing Plan:         The equivalent of all foreign exchange (except for
US13 million worth of equipment which Sudan already
has on hand) would be financed by IDA, the Kuwait Fund
and USAID.
Estimated
Disbursements:                             (US$ million)
1973/74      1974/75      1975/76      1976/77       1977/78

Procurement
Arrangements:         Procurement of goods and construction contracts by
international competitive bidding would total US$42
million without contingencies and about US$50 million
with contingencies. The government would carry out work
worth US$18 million using its own equipment. USAID
would provide US$11 million for equipment and machinery
to be purchased in the U.S.A.
Consultants:            Consultants would be employed to design, prepare tender
documents and supervise construction of the major
irrigation works, main roads and bridges, railway and
ginneries and other major buildings, and equipment and
machinery.  They would also review and propose any
necessary changes to the major canals constructed by
governmnent and advise where requested on any other work.
Rate of Return:         The economic rate of return is estimated at about 13.5%.
