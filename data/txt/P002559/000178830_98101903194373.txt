APPRAISAL OF THE
RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Government of Sudan has asked the Bank Group to assist in fi-
nancing the Rahad Irrigation Project, the first stage of the proposed devel-
opment of an area of 820,000 feddans (fed) (328,000 ha) by irrigation from
the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile. The Bank Group has been involved in the
development of irrigation in Sudan since the 1959 Nile Water Agreement pro-
vided the legal framework for further irrigation development.
ii.       Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy of Sudan, accounting
for 40% of GDP and almost all export earnings. It provides employment for
90% of the population of 15.7 million. Of the 16 million fed cropped, about
4 million fed are irrigated. The Ministry of Irrigation (QOI) has constructed
many projects, and irrigated area has been expanding at about 5% per year,
from 2,790,000 fed but there are no more small projects left to develop.
Cropping intensities have risen in the past decade, mostly by the introduction
of wheat and/or groundnuts into the rotation.
iii.      The Rahad project was proposed by consultants engaged under the
Bank Group's Loan (284-SU) and Credit (2-SU) for the Roseires Dam project
completed in 1966. The Rahad project was appraised in 1968, 1970 and 1972.
Between appraisals, Bank Group staff have worked closely with Sudanese of-
ficials to devise a project which is technically sound and which would in
resource use and implementation capacity be appropriate to the economy of
the Sudan. The present project alternative is smaller than the two previ-
ously appraised, has a shorter supply canal fed by pumping rather than
gravity, and would produce benefits sooner. It would increase utilization
of the Roseires water and employ the MOI's existing resources of staff and
machinery.
iv.       The project would develop a net area of 300,000 fed that is now
a sparsely-populated semi-desert. Water would be pumped from the Blue Nile
downstream of Roseires, into an 84 km canal leading to the Rahad river,
using hydro-electric power from the dam. Construction, which would take
five years, would include: the pumping station and a 105 m3/sec supply
canal, 84 km long; the irrigation distribution and drainage system; staff
housing and offices; water supplies for sixty new villages; crop transport,
processing and storage facilities; and land clearing and preparation at a
rate of 100,000 fed per year.  The irrigation system would be mainly the
responsibility of MOI while the agricultural aspects would be managed by the
Rahad Corporation, a new agency which has been modeled on the lines of the
successful Sudan Gezira Board. The Corporation would purchase equipment
and vehicles and would provide mechanized cultivation, pest control and all
other services and inputs needed as well as granting seasonal credit to its
13,700 tenants. Tenancies, mostly of 24 fed, would not be mortgageable and
tenants would be obliged to follow a six-course rotation of cotton and ground-
nuts and to sell their produce to the Corporation.



- ii -
v.        The cost of the project without duties is estimated at ESd 33.5
million (US$96.1 million) with a foreign exchange component of 66% (US$64.0
million). Duties, import surcharges and foreign exchange taxes would total
ESd 10.1 million (US$28.9 million). The foreign exchange cost would be fi-
nanced by IDA US$40 million, United States Agency for International Devel-
opment (USAID) US$11 million, the Kuwait Fund US$10 million and Sudan US$3
million (the value of equipment already on hand).  Sudan would finance the
local currency costs including taxes and duties.
vi.       Engineering consultants (US$3 million) would have full responsi-
bility for major works, advise on location and design of large canals and
certify work executed by the MOI. Studies would be made for a second stage
project, including a review of the optimum utilization of Roseires water.
vii.      Procurement through international competitive bidding (ICB) would
be about US$42 million plus contingencies. It would include agricultural
and construction equipment, vehicles, locomotives and rolling stock for the
light railway and all other materials and equipment (US$13 million) and con-
tracts for major irrigation structures, ginneries and most buildings and power
lines (US$25 million). Government would carry out the irrigation distribu-
tion system (US$15 million) by force account in order to provide employment
for the MOI's permanent labor force and equipment and land development (US$3.3
million). Miscellaneous buildings, small construction contracts, erection of
warehouses, light railway construction and other such works (US$4 million)
would be included in ICB but, because of their scattered nature, would prob-
ably be won by local contractors. Equipment and machinery with a foreign
exchange cost of US$11 million would be procured under USAID's normal pro-
cedures.
viii.     The cost of inputs and services supplied by the Corporation would
be charged to tenants' individual accounts. Assurances were obtained that a
"land and water charge" - required by the Rahad Corporation Act - would be
levied on an increasing scale; these are expected to reach ESd 170 per farmer,
or 41% of gross income, at full development. This would maintain tenant's
net incomes at ESd 200-240 (US$575-690) as gross incomes improve. The
tenant's net income would be about the national average family income and
comparable with those on other irrigation schemes: however, it would be
two to three times present family incomes in the project area and would
provide adequate incentive.
ix.       The project would produce cotton lint, cotton seed and grounduuts
for export and vegetables and other crops for domestic use. Annual foreign
exchange earnings at full development would be US$42 million gross (US$27
million net). The economic rate of return would be between 9% and 16%. If
projected 1980 world crop prices are realized and the project is constructed
on schedule, the economic rate of return would be 13.5Z. The project would
include staff and farmer training and would introduce higher levels of agri-
cultural technology than are now found on irrigated schemes in Sudan.
x.        Irrigation of this large tract of semi-desert would entail many
ecological changes. In particular, irrigation would encourage spread of
the vectors of two very serious endemic diseases, malaria and bilharzia.



- iii -
The project would include a rural hospital, health centers and clinics and
materials for controlling the vectors and the program for controlling and
treating the diseases would be agreed with the Association.
xi.       The project would be suitable for an IDA credit totalling US$40
million, or 42% of the total cost. The Government would be the borrower and
would assume the foreizn exchange risk.

APPRAISAL OF THE
RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The 1959 Nile Water Agreement between Egypt and Sudan provided that
Sudan's share of the available 84 milliard m3 of Nile water would increase
from 4 to 18.5 milliard m3 and authorized construction of two new dams in
Sudan. The Roseires dam on the Blue Nile has permitted expansion of the
Gezira scheme from one million to two million feddans (fed) and adoption of
more intensive cropping while the Khashm el Girba dam irrigates 400,000 fed
from Atbara River.
1.02      The Roseires dam was completed in 1966 with financial assistance
from IBRD/IDA (284-SU (IBRD): USS19.5 million and 2-SU (IDA): US$13 million;
1961) and the Federal Republic of Germany (US$18.4 million). The projected
benefits included expansion and intensification of 1.8 million fed of exist-
ing irrigation schemes. However, the dam commands over seven million fed of
unused land and 0.8 milliard m3 of storage water were reserved for development
of new areas. Consultants (Sir M. MacDonald and Partners and Hunting Tech-
nical Services:  UK) and the Soil Survey Division of the Ministry of Agri-
culture (established with the assistance of UNDP) identified 4 million fed
as irrigable and prepared proposals for schemes totalling over 2 million
fed. One of these is the Rahad scheme, covering 820,000 fed on the east
bank of the Rahad River, a seasonal tributary of the Blue Nile (Map 1).
1.03      In 1965 the Sudan sought IDA's assistance in financing the first
part of the Rahad scheme, consisting of the irrigation of 410,000 fed by
gravity from Roseires. The project was appraised in February 1967 but
difficulties arose over the size of the investment (US$140 million), the
lack of a comprehensive national development plan, and the technical and
economic justification of parts of the project. After numerous exchanges of
views, a somewhat modified project was appraised in February 1970. Although
the cost was lower (US$110 million), it was still formidable in relation to
the Sudan's resources. The need for foreign assistance was too large to be
met by IDA alone and sufficient external resources were not available. Fur-
thermore a number of issues - notably international competitive bidding (ICB)
for civil works - were not resolved. No credit was negotiated but, despite
unsettled political conditions, IDA staff maintained contact with the proj-
ect. Funds from the Roseires loans were used to finance consultants (ILACO,
Netherlands) to operate an experimental farm established by the Ministry of
Agriculture at Tambul, near the project area, to investigate the technical
problems.
1.04      Government decided in 1970 that it would proceed with the Rahad
scheme without IDA assistance. About 15 km of a supply canal was excavated
but the size of investment needed for a viable first phase gravity scheme
was an insuperable obstacle and work was stopped. MOI engineers then pro-
posed to replace the gravity supply from Roseires, which required a 190 km



- 2 -
canal, by pumping from a nearer point on the Blue Nile, reducing the length
of the canal to 84 km. In September 1971, Government submitted to the Asso-
ciation the outline of a 300,000 fed pump scheme which IDA agreed to appraise
as soon as its economic mission had formulated its views on the Sudan's devel-
opment plan. A brief summary of the various proposals is given in Annex 1.
1.05      During the recent appraisal, it was found that three factors had
improved the economic viability of the project. Firstly, the decision to
use saw-gins (para 4.12) halved the cost of the ginneries. Secondly, while
longer experience on existing schemes showed that yields of Acala 4-42 1/
cotton projected during the 1970 appraisal were being obtained on a large
scale, a newly-introduced, disease-resistant variety, Barac (para 6.03) is
expected to improve yields by 20%. Thirdly, recent trends in world cotton
markets, and increased acceptability of Sudanese Acala to buyers, have led
to an increase in the long-term projected price from 27 £ to 29 1 per pound
cif Liverpool.  The cost per unit area, at the time of appraisal, of the
1972 pumped scheme was ESd 97 per feddan, compared with ESd 93 for the 1970
gravity scheme (see Annex 1, Table 1). However, the shorter supply canal
reduces the unit cost of irrigation works, which can be completed in less
time, producing benefits a year earlier. The net result of all these fac-
tors was to raise the economic rate of return to 15%, as compared with 12%
in 19 70.
1.06      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal missiQn which
visited Sudan in February 1972, consisting of Messrs. D.W.M. Haynes, M.
Fireman, B. de Ponteves and H.J. Tennent (IDA) and Messrs. J. Delauzun,
and L. Holt (consultants).
IBIRDIDA Support to the Agricultural Sector
1.07      IBRD and IDA have made eight loans and credits, totalling more
than US$150 million to the Sudan, including US$53 million to the agriculJ:-
ural sector.  In addition to the Roseires project, IBRD/IDA have helped fi-
nance the Managil extension to the Gezira irrigation scheme (Loan 258-SU:
US$15.5 million; 1960) and expansion of mechanized farming (Credit 556-SU:
US$5 million; 1968). A recent Credit (US$11.25 million: April, 1972) for
a se.cond stage of the mechanized farming project includes provision of
.US$750,000 for the Tozi Center which would train tractor drivers for the
Rahad and -other projects.
1.0.8     Progress on the Managil and Roseires projects was satisfactory
.although disbur&ements were held up by slow procedures.  The first mechanized
farming project was completed in July 1971, a year ahead of schedule, with
substantial cost savings.

Water Rights
1.09      Use of the Nile and its tributaries is regulated by the 1959 Agree-
ment between Egypt and Sudan. The other riparians, Ethiopia and Uganda, are
not parties to the Agreement but provision was made for the adjustments of
EgyptIs and Sudan's shares in the event of any dispute with a third party.
The present project would require less than 10% of the total Nile water
alloted to the Sudan. To save pumping costs the project would draw a part
of its water from the Rahad River, a Blue Nile tributary rising in Ethiopia.
There is no formal agreement between the Sudan and Ethiopia on the use of
Rahad waters. However as the Rahad river is seasonal and can only supply
water for 3 to 4 months each year, the project design is such that the total
water requirements could be drawn from the Blue Nile (para 4.06) if necessary.
II. BACKGROUND
General
2
2.01      Sudan, the largest country in Africa, covers about 2.5 million km
The northern third is desert with only 20 mm annual rainfall; annual rainfall
increases southward to about 200 mm around Khartoum, 400-800 mm in the central
clay plains (in which the project is located) and up to 1,500 mm in the extreme
south.
2.02      The population is about 15.7 million, growing at 2.8% per year;
per capita income averages about US$110. Agriculture and livestock dominate
the economy and accounted for about 40% of GDP, and almost all export earnings,
in 1970. They employ nearly 90% of the working population and, while there
is seasonal underemployment throughout the Sudan, labor is scarce during
cotton harvesting (January-March). Cotton (60% of exports) is the dominant
cash and export crop, followed by gum arabic (10%), sesame (8%), livestock
(7%) and groundnuts (6%). Sorghum, the staple food, is grown on nearly half
the cropped area.
2.03      At present, 80 million fed are used by nomads as rangeland.  Only
about 16 million fed are sown to crops and of these nearly 4 million are ir-
rigated. The Gezira-Managil scheme is the biggest single irrigation system.
It covers nearly two million fed, provides a livelihood for almost 100,000
tenants and produces 66% of the extra long staple (ELS) cotton, 47% of the
wheat, 14% of the groundnuts and 12% of the sorghum grown in the Sudan. The
second largest scheme at Khashm el Girba, 400,000 fed, has been producing
medium staple Acala cotton, groundnuts, wheat and sugarcane since 1965. In
1968, about a million fed of privately-owned pumping schemes bordering the
Niles were nationalized, compensation being paid in 20 year 4% interest
government bonds.
Recent Irrigation Development
2.04      Stage I of the Roseires dam (there is design provision for raising
the height in Stage II) was completed in 1966 a year ahead of schedule and



-4-
stores about 2.7 milliard m : provision is made for seven generators and
irrigation offtakes were built into the left and right abutments. The trans-
mission line to Khartoum has been commissioned and the first three 30MW hydro-
electric units are on line, ensuring adequate power for the project.
2.05      Before the dam was completed 2,790,000 fed were irrigated in the
Sudan, of which 1,770,000 fed were in the Blue Nile basin. Shortly before
completion of the Gezira-Managil scheme and extensions in 1967/68, the MOI
designed and built the Wad-el-Haddad pumping scheme (35,000 fed) followed by
the Guneid extension (45,000 fed) and the Es Suki pumping scheme (1970/71:
about 85,000 fed net). The Es Suki scheme had very serious troubles in its
first year, such as late allocation of tenancies, very late planting and
faulty irrigation canals, largely due to the lack of cooperation between
the Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation. An autonomous corporation
has been set up to solve such problems in the future. The irrigated area
along the Blue Nile affected by the Roseires dam storage has thus been in-
creased to 2,320,000 fed, and the dam has also enabled average cropping
intensitv to be increased from 50% in 1964 to over 60% (75% in Gezira) today
(see Annex 1, Table 2).
2.06      Sudan is presently using about half its annual wqater allocation of
18.5 milliard m3. Irrigable area has increased by 5% per year while overall
crop production has increased by about 4.6% annually. Much of this increase
is attributable to the Roseires dam but development has not followed the
pattern projected during appraisal. There is adequate storage water for the
present project but additional development will require critical decisions
regarding the optimum use of the unallocated water. This could be used to
increase the intensity of cropping in the completed projects or to expand the
area being cropped by developing new lands. Potential areas for development
include Kenana, south of the Gezira; Stage II of the Rahad Project; and
extensions of N.W. Sennar, Guneid and other schemes. However, none of these
alternatives have been critically compared: hence relevant studies would be
included in the project (para 4.05).
Construction Equipment and Labor Force
2.07      On completion of Managil in 1968 the 2DI was unable for political
reasons to dismiss its labor force of over 7,000. All schemes listed in
para 2.05 were built by this labor force. By 1972 it had been reduced by
attrition to 5,000, deployed as follows: Northwest Sennar, 2,000; Northern
Provinces, 500; Headquaters, 500; and idle, 2,000. In 1970-71, government
purchased scrapers and draglines to construct the Rahad project; some were
purchoased from Bank member countries but most were obtained from Eastern
Europe. Some of this new equipment is working in Northwest Sennar but, apart
from Rahad, there is little other irrigation work of significance where it
can be used.
Development Strategy in the Agricultural Sector
2.08      The 1970-74 Development Plan proposes a public investment of ESd 98
million (US$280 million) in the agricultural sector, more than double the



- 5 -
actual achievement in 1965-69. Priorities within the sector are unchanged:
irrigation, which absorbed 85% of public investment in the sector over the
past decade, enjoys first priority followed by mechanized rainfed farming,
livestock and agricultural services.  These priorities reflect present needs
of the economy although the targets set are unduly optimistic in view of the
financial, institutional and staff constraints. Over the next five years
agricultural strategy should aim at removal of institutional constraints,
maximum use of the limited skills and equipment already available, concentra-
tion on projects including some in southern Sudan that will produce rapid
benefits and generate savings, and optimum use of existing infrastructure.
2.09      In the irrigation sub-sector, development strategy should concen-
trate on diversion of a larger proportion of Sudan's share of Nile waters,
fuller utilization of existing diversion and storage works, and improved
on-farm development and water use. The Rahad project fits this strategy and
deserves high priority.
Transportation
2.10      The project would depend on Sudan Railways whose service in recent
years has been unsatisfactory. The Bank Group has been discussing with Gov-
ernment various ways to eliminate bottlenecks and a third Bank Group railway
project is planned. In part the railway's difficulties are due to peak loads
between January and June. Ample storage would, therefore, be provided to
relieve the situation (para 4.13).
III. THE PROJECT AREA
General
3.01      The Rahad project, 25 km wide and 130 km long, lies along the east
bank of the Rahad River about 160 km southeast of Khartoum. An all-weather
road connects the town of Wad Medani to Khartoum but, although small ferries
cross the Blue Nile, there are only dry-season tracks in the project area.
A bridge and a tarmac road between Wad Medani and Gedaref will be completed
by 1975. A railway line passes through Wad Medani and through Hawata, 50 km
upstream of the proposed barrage, but there are no railways in the area itself.
3.02      Lack of drinking water has limited settlement to the riverine
strip. The 1969 cadastral survey and farm census showed that 16,000 house-
holds, totalling about 80,000 persons, live in the immediate vicinity, two-
thirds of them in the northern third of the area. Sorghum is grown during
the rainy season, particularly in the north of the project area, but the
clay desert provides sparse grazing for local and nomadic herds in the dry
season.



-6-
Climate
3.03      The area is semi-arid.  Rain occurs only from late June to early
October. Annual rainfall varies from 350 mm in the northern part of the
project to 650 mm in the south. Temperatures are highest in April, 429C,
and lowest in January, 13°C. Annex 2, Table 1, gives climatic data at Wad
Nedani and Mafaza.
Topography and Soils
3.04      The project area is a flat alluvial plain, almost bare in the
north but with low bushes and small trees in the south. The general slope
is 0.5 m per km to the west and there is little discernible surface micro-
relief except in the eroded riverine strip that would be excluded from the
project.
3.05      The soils are similar to those that have been irrigated and studied
in the Gezira for 45 years. They are very deep, cracking, self-mulching
clays, with high-water holding capacities but low permeabilities,  Wlhen dry,
the deep cracks permit very rapid initial intake of water but the soil swells
on wetting, sealing the cracks and becoming almost impermeable. The soils are
friable in the surface layer but very sticky when wet. They can be effectively
cultivated only when their moisture content is within a narrow range and cul-
tivation under irrigation requires special skills and careful water management.
Annex 2 gives details of soils and agricultural practices.
3.06      Salinity and internal drainage difficulties ordinarily arise when
soils of this type are irrigated. However, although water movement is ex-
tremely slow, it seems sufficient to leach salt into the subsoil and main-
tain a satisfactory salt balance. Moreover, the waters of the Blue Nile and
Rahad are of such excellent quality that it should be possible to irrigate
for a 100 years or more before salt levels seriously affect crop production.
Internal drainage problems are unlikely since so little excess irrigation
wqater reaches the water table.
Land Tenure
3,07      All land belongs to Government, although individuals may register
title to land fa=med for more than twenty years, or may establish cultivation
rights after five. Rights may be established for grazing, wood-cutting, and
other uses of natural resources but are more often held communally than
individually.
3.08      Government has completed cadastral surveys and registration to
avoid speculative efforts to establish titles and rights in the project area.
These would be extinguished by compensation, either by payment or by the
awfard of tenancies in the project (see para 5.08).



- 7-
Marketing, Credit and Agricultural Services
3.09      There are weekly markets in a few major villages and many merchants
provide high-interest credit against the security of crops, resulting in poor
prices to the farmers. All the facilities and institutions are scaled to a
very low level of rainfed farming and agricultural services are almost totally
lacking.
Public Health
3.10      Many diseases are endemic in the region but malaria and schisto-
somiasis (bilharzia) probably cause the most human misery and economic loss
(para 5.11). Irrigation of the project area could increase the incidence of
both diseases (Annex 3). There are no hospitals or clinics in the area and
most of the population obtain water from the Blue Nile or from the few places
on the Rahad where there are perennial pools.
IV. THE PROJECT
General Description
4.01      The project is the development of irrigated agriculture on a net
area of about 300,000 fed on the east bank of the Rahad river using water
pumped from the Blue Nile. The project, which would take about five years to
develop, would involve construction of all irrigation supply, distribution
and drainage works; installation of agricultural processing equipment and
storage facilities; and settlement of some 13,700 tenant families (70,000
people) with all the necessary infrastructure. The project would be executed
and operated by MOI and a new semi-autonomous government agency, the Rahad
Corporation, which would provide agricultural services and advice to its tenants.
Prolect Works
4.02      The project would consist of the following major parts (described
in detail in Annex 4):
(a) Construction of irrigation and drainage works comprising -
(i)   a 105 m 3/sec electrically powered pumping station
at Meina on tlhe Blue Nile, some 200 km downstream
from Roseires dam;
(ii)   a supply canal, 84 km long, carrying water from Meina
to an out-fall on the Rahad river;
(iii)   a barrage and head regulator on the Rahad, 6 km
downstream of the supply canal outfall; and



-8 -
(iv)   the irrigation disi:ribution and drainage system supplying
300,000 fed net:
(b) Construction of headquarters, offices and staff houses with
the necessary utilities and roads;
(c)  Construction of transmission lines for the Central Electricity
and Water Corporation (CEWC) -
(i) across the Blue Nile at Meina supplied by a
sub-station at Singha;
(ii) from a sub-station south of Wad Medani to
project headquarters and the ginneries.
(d)  Procurement of construction equipment and vehicles for MOI;
(e) Procurement of agricultural equipment and vehicles for the
Rahad Corporation;
(f) Construction of transportation anid processing facilities,
including ginneries, decorticators, warehouses, and a
light railway;
(g) Provision of public health facilities for new settlers'
villages comprising village water supplies, a central
hos-pital, six clinics and health centers and an initial
inventory of molluscicides and equipment for bilharzia and
malaria control;
(h)  Settlement of the area in three years (100,000 fed per year)
including bush clearanace and land levelling. Tenants
would receive a settlement allowance and most would be
allocated 24 fed and would be required to fol-low a six crop
rotation;
(i) Development of seed production and research farms;
(j) Provision of consultant services for the irrigation system
and associated works; and
(k) Preparation of a feasibility study by consultants for a second
phase, including studies of the optimum use of the Roseires
storage waters.
Annexes 5 and 6 give details of the construction and agricultural equipment
and vehicles: the list of buildings is given in Annex 7. In addition to the
facilities provided in the project, schools would be required. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that these would be provided in accordance
with appropriate Sudanese government standards following a phased program to be
agreed by the Association.



-9-
Status of Engineering
4.03      Topographic maps (1:10,000), with 25 cm contours, have been prepared
for the whole project area including the supply canal. The 1965 feasibility
study included preliminary engineering designs which, with suitable modifica-
tions, could be applied to the distribution system. Outline designs have been
prepared for the supply canal and its associated structures. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the optimum type and size of pumps would be
selected by consultants and that the design of the pump station would be ac-
ceptable to the Association.
Consulting Services and Feasibility Study
4.04      MOI has considerable experience in the design and construction of
distribution systems (para 2.05) but limited experience of canals as large
as the supply canal and in the design and construction of major structures.
Consultants would be required to advise MOI engineers on the designs and
location of the supply and main canals and to take full responsibility for
design of the pumping station, supply canal structures and the Rahad barrage
and headworks. In April 1972, MOI retained Sir M. MacDonald and Partners (UK)
to prepare designs and tender documents for these works. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the Government would continue to retain
consultants, acceptable to the Association, to advise MOI, the Rahad Cor-
poration and other Government agencies; to evaluate bids and supervise all
works awarded after international competitive bidding; and to certify all
payment vouchers eligible for reimbursement from the proposed credit. The
Government retained Sir M. MacDonald and Partners in view of their long as-
sociation with irrigation works in the Sudan, and with this project in par-
ticular; this choice is acceptable to the Association. The consultants terms
of reference given in Annex 8 include all the items required for the project.
4.05      Updating of the study of the optimum use of Roseires made in 1965
(Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners and Sir M. MacDonald and Partners: UK) is
necessary before decisions can be made on the optimum use of unallocated
storage water. This work would be the first phase of the feasibility study
included in the project: assurances were obtained during negotiations that
the study would be made by consultants acceptable to the Association under
terms of reference to be approved by the Association within six months of
signing of the credit. Annex 8 contains an outline of these terms of
reference.
Water Quality, Supply and Demand
4.06      The water from the Blue Nile and Rahad rivers is of excellent qual-
ity, proven suitable for irrigation. The effective rainfall is small, and
is negligible in the peak demand month of October. Provision would be made
for pre-irrigation of cotton and post-irrigation of groundnuts, which affect
the amount of water required for the project but not the system's capacity
or cost. The pumping station on the Blue Nile and the distribution system
would be designed to provide the peak monthly and the full annual requirement



- 10 -
of the proposed cropping pattern at a cropping intensity of 84%, i.e. 100
m3/sec and 1.4 milliard m3 per year.  If in future it is considered advisa-
ble to increase the cropping intensity to 100% (by replacing fallow with 50%
cotton and 50% mixed crops), the annual requirement of about 1.6 milliard m3
could be delivered, but there might be a shortage of 8% in the peak month.
Even this tolerable shortage probably would be eliminated either by the in-
troduction of new crops or by changing the planting dates for cotton, both
almost certain to occur in future. Because of the nature of the soil, seep-
age losses from the unlined canals would be insignificant. The conveyance
efficiency is estimated at 93% (86% in months of low flow) and, with basin
irrigation, field efficiency at 70%, giving an annual overall efficiency
averaging just under 65%. Water requirements are given in Annex 9. Although
water from the Rahad would not be needed for the project, in practice Rahad
water would be used whenever available to reduce pumping costs.
Irrigation and Drainage System
4.07      The Consultant would check the alignment and design of the supply
canal, which would be siphoned under the Dinder river and deliver water
through an outfall structure into the Rahad river. Drainage escapes and
about 10 bridges would be provided. After flowing six kilometers down the
Rahad, water would be diverted into the project main canal (100 m3/sec) by
a composite masonry concrete barrage 50 m wide with nine gates (to control
level and release flood waters) and a 35 m wide head regulator controlling
diversions to the main canal. Nine major canals and appropriate minor canals,
controls and water courses would distribute water to the area (Map 2). Fig-
ures 1 and 2 show typical distribution systems. Drainage to the river would
be provided for rainfall and excess irrigation and would also allow for drain-
age from future developments to the east of the main canal. The extra cost
(about USS120,000) of provision for drainage of possible extensions would be
insignificant compared to the loss of production entailed in closing the main
canal to enlarge cross drainage structures if and when it is decided to con-
struct Stage II.
4.08      The Gezira and most of Khashm el Girba systems are designed for
night storage, i.e. field irrigation is carried out during daytime only and
the nighttime flow stored in oversized minor canals. A small area of Khashm
el Girba scheme was designed for continuous 24 hour irrigation but the ex-
periment was a failure because the tenants refused to work at night. Aside
from social customs and superstitions, night irrigation involves real prac-
tical difficulties. Under the normal regime, the laborer must direct water
to three basins spread over 900 m simultaneously and irrigate 18 basins in
an 8-12 hour period once a week. Even after land levelling, each basin re-
quires individual attention and thus constant watching. While the cost of
a aight storage system is greater than that of a continuous system, the dif-
ference is too small (ESd 0.8 or $2.40 per fed) to affect significantly the
rate of return of the project. Maintenance costs are also increased some-
what, not only because of the larger cross section of the night storage
canal but also because siltation and weeding increase; again, however, the
effect on the project is negligible. Finally, night storage canals offer



- 11 -
a particularly attractive habitat for snails although this does not increase
the cost of molluscicide treatment and may even increase its efficacy. There-
fore, although a night storage system is more costly, it's disadvantages would
be small compared to the risks involved in trying to force new settlers to
adopt a system which runs counter to their customs and traditions. Since a
passage in the Development Plan implies that continuous irrigation will be
used in future projects, the project description of the proposed credit agree-
ment will refer specifically to night storage.
Agricultural Systems and Services
4.09      All irrigable land would be cleared and levelled before settlement.
Equipment would be procured and the operating costs of initial levelling cap-
italized in project costs. The 1968 and 1970 appraisal reports recommended
"long furrow" irrigation in which water would be siphoned to 150 or 300 m
furrows by plastic tube. This sytem has been tested at Khartoum University,
in Gezira and Khashm el Girba and, particularly, at the Tambul Farm. It fa-
cilitates mechanization and increases efficiency of field irrigation by about
5%. As yet, however, there is no proof that long furrow irrigation per
se increases crop yields as compared to the basin (angaya) system trad-
itionally used in the Sudan. Training tenants in an unknown irrigation sys-
tem would be a formidable undertaking and government proposes that long fur-
row system be introduced gradually, initially on about 10,000 fed per year.
However, assurances were obtained during negotiations that the irrigation
and drainage system would be designed so that the size of irrigation units
and the watercourse would permit the eventual introduction of long furrow
irrigation to the entire area.
4.10      The Rahad Corporation would provide a full range of mechanized
cultivations as well as credit, advisory services, and crop processing and
storage facilities. The list of cultivation equipment (Annex 6) was agreed
during negotiations and incorporated in a schedule to the proposed Credit
Agreement.
4.11      The mechanization proposed for the project and, particularly, the
need for aerial spraying of cotton require that individual crops be grown in
relatively large contiguous fields. A holding of 24 fed would be the minimum
that would provide an adequate income to tenants growing diversified crops,
and 5 fed for those growing vegetables and fruits ("gardens"). Further, 24
fed is the smallest unit that would give each tenant a permanent holding of
contigious plots while still retaining economies of scale. Each 24 fed hold-
ing would consist of six contiguous plots, one in each of the six 88 fed
strips, or "numbers" (Figs. 1 and 2), planted to a single crop, these strips
being large enough for economic aerial spraying and other mechanized opera-
tions. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that normal tenancies
would consist of six contiguous plots totalling 24 fed, and that "gardens"
would be allocated in 5 fed units.
4.12      Seed cotton and groundnuts would be delivered from the fields to
collection centres by means of donkeys and camels and taken to the ginneries



- 12 -
by a light railway system. Such a rail system operates successfully in the
Gezira and is considered the best method of transporting crops, supplies and
fertilizer around the project area, in which there would be no all-weather
roads. Recent studies have shown that the cost per ton km is lower with this
type of railway than with road transport.
4.13      Since buyers no longer pay premiums for roller-sinned Acala cotton
lint. the project would provide more efficient saw-gins 1 Assurances were ob-
tained during negotiations that government would carry out studies, to be sub-
mitted to the Association for approval within six months of signing, on the
location of the ginneries in relation to electrical supplies, roads, railways,
and potential development of the Rahad area. The study would also make rec-
ommendations on the optimum siting and sufficiency (para 2.10) in the project
area and at Port Sudan of the proposed 200,000-bale storage facilities pro-
vided in the project.
Implementation Schedule
4.14      Extremely high rates of settlement have been achieved on previous
irrigation schemes, averaging 95,000 fed per year from 1966 to 1971. The
rate proposed for this project, 100,000 fed per year, is ambitious but is
well below the peak of 136,000 fed achieved in 1967/68. The success of
settlement depends on the quality of management and the number of families
involved; special care would be taken to train staff in settlement methods
(para 5.05). The number of families involved - 4,000 per year - is less
than half the peak of 8,600 families settled in 1967/68. The construction
schedule is largely independent of the rate of settlement since the major
works need to be provided to irrigate the first crop. To achieve the pro-
posed schedule of a first crop in 1976, pumps would have to be ordered
in early 1974 and the ginneries by the end of 1974. The supply canal
would have to be completed by early 1976. Settlement would commence late
in 1975. Thereafter, construction of the distribution system, housing
and staff build-up would keep pace with the actual rate of settlement achieved.
The construction schedule (Annex 10) is realistic: the influence of delays
on the economics of the project are discussed in Chapter VII.
Cost Estimates
4.15      The estimated cost of the Project is ESd 33.5 million (US$96.1 mil-
lion). Duties, import surcharges and foreign exchange tax would be levied on
all imports and are estimated at ESd 10.1 million (US$28-.9 million). Detailed
estimates are given in Annex 11, Table 1 and summarized below:
1/   Cost of construction halved.

4.16      Cost estimates are based on figures prepared by the appraisal mission
in conjunction with the Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation and updated
to January, 1973 levels during negotiations. An allowance of 15% for physical
contingencies has been made on the construction work since detailed designs



- 14 -
are not yet available. Price escalation has been calculated at 5% per annum
on both local and foreign costs. The estimated foreign exchange cost includ-
ing equipment (LSd 1 million) Sudan already has procured is ESd 22.3 million
(US$64 million) or 66% of the total cost without duties. The proportion of
foreign costs for construction is high because Sudan imports most building
materials, even timber. The cost estimates assume that major contracts would
be awarded to foreign firms. In the event local contractors were successful,
foreign exchange requirements would be reduced by up to US$5 million and local
costs correspondingly increased.
Financing
4.17      The external lenders, the Association, the Kuwait Fund and the
USAID would finance the estimated equivalent of the foreign exchange cost
(US$61 million), excluding the equipment which Sudan already has on hand.
The Association's assistance of US$40 million would finance about 70% of the
cost of items subject to ICB and of the consultants. The Kuwait Fund under
joint financing arrangements would finance about US$10 million (17%) of the
same items i.e. in the ratio of 4:1 with IDA; terms of the loan would be 30
years including 5 years of grace and interest at 2-1/2% (plus 1/2% service
charge). The USAID would provide US$11 million, for the foreign exchange
costs of construction and agricultural machinery, to be supplied from US
sources; repayment terms of the loan would be 40 years including 10 years
of grace and interest at 2% during the grace period and 3% thereafter. The
Government would finance the force account work, excluding machinery, equip-
ment and materials financed by the external lenders, and a portion of all
other costs; its total cost would be US$35.2 million. Under an agreement
signed in 1971, the World Food Program is expected to provide commodities,
valued at US$2.3 million, that may be used to help pay Ministry staff and
provide subsistence for newly s4ttled tenants.
4.18      The construction of transmission lines would be undertaken by the
CEWC and the capital cost recovered from the Corporation in the unit cost of
power. The Sudanese Government would on-lend to CEWC about US$1.9 million at
an interest rate of 7.25% for a period of 23 years including a 3-year grace
period.
Procurement
4.19      ICB would apply to all works, materials and equipment except those
to be financed by USAID and those to be carried out by force account using
MOI labor force and equipment. Government places high priority on using
these MIOI resources for which it has limited alternative opportunities and
the Association considers that with additional equipment and vehicles costing
US$4.7 million (some of which would be procured through ICB and some through
USAID) it can carry out the work as scheduled. About 3,000 men could
be usefully employed on the distribution and drainage system together with
equipment which has a depreciated value of ESd 1,050,000 (US$3.0 million)
including duties. These works by force account estimated to total US$18.0
million would not be financed by the Association. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that (a) an adequate inventory of spare parts for MOI's



- 15 -
equipment purchased from non-member countries would be maintained and (b)
there would be no expansion of the M0I's permanent labor force except for
professional and technical staff.

4.21      The major irrigation civil works amounting to ESd 6.8 million (US$19.5
million) and the substation and power lines ESd 0.6 million (US$1.65 million)
should be attractive to international competitive bidding.  The Ginneries would
be a "turnkey" contract under which the prime contractor would be required to
furnish and install gins, buildings, fire control equipment and all other
ancillaries; to provide all necessary training; and to guarantee performance.
No preference would be allowed to local bidders on evaluating the ginnery
"turnkey" contract. The smaller contracts ESd 1.5 million (US$4.3 million)
consisting of work scattered over the project area and scheduled to be com-
pleted as settlement progresses would be of interest to large contractors
already working in the area and to local contractors but would not be large
enough to justify international advertising. The transmission line and sub-
station constructed by CEWC would be subject to ICB.



- 16 -
4.22     .,1olluscides and Larvacides for the public health program would be
procured under negotiated contracts with the manufacturer whose formulation
has been proven effective in Sudan. It is therefore expected that contracts
for about ESd 230,000 (US$600,000) would be awarded to Shell (UK/Netherlands)
who have cooperated in successful field tests in the Gezira. Other material
contracts would be by ICB except for sluice gates and hydraulic equipment
for the main canal and irrigation distribution system totalling ESd 150,000
(US$400,000) which would be procured by direct order from suppliers who manu-
facture standardized items in use throughout the remainder of the Sudan's
irrigation system.
4.23      Procurement of farm equipment, light railway equipment and vehicles,
and communication equipment with a foreign exchange cost of ESd 3.1 million
(US$8.8 million) to be financed by IDA and the Kuwait Fund would be by ICB.
The major items of farm equipment would be tractors (over 400) in the 65-75
hp range, ploughs, planters and 4 wheel drive vehicles. Experience has shown
that certain implements (notably ridges and planters) are highly specialized
to Sudan's heavy clay soils and these implements would therefore be specified
by make. Tender documents would require that bids would include the named
accessory implements together with the tractors to assure compatability.
Other equipment and vehicles with a foreign exchange cost of US$11 million
would be financed by USAID and procured, mainly from US sources using USAID
normal procurement procedures which involve competitive bidding restricted
to US suppliers.
4.24      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the procurement pro-
cedures outlined in paras. 4.19 to 4.23 would be carried out.  In cases of
ICB a preference level equal to the lower of 15% or the level of customs
duties (exclusive of surcharge or foreign exchange tax would be allowed to
local manufacturers during evaluation of bids for gates, pipes and plastic
siphons. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that under IDA pro-
curement foreign bids for equipment and supplies would be evaluated on the
basis of cif costs. The Sudan does not currently allow preferential treat-
ment to any country in assessing import duties.
Disbursement
4.25      Disbursements by IDA and the Kuwait Fund against contracts for supply
of imported materials, equipment and vehicles would cover 100% (80% IDA) of
cif cost, but for gates, pipes or siphons manufactured locally disbursement
would be 70% (56% IDA) of contract price to exclude customs duties and sur-
charges. The foreign costs of consultants would be 100% (80% IDA) eligible
for disbursement, retroactive to the date of signing of an approved contract,
not previous to March 15, 1972. Such costs are not expected to exceed US$200,000.
4.26      Disbursement against contracts for civil works would be based on a
70% (56% IDA) of major civil works and 50% (40% IDA) of smaller civil works of
the monthly payments as certified by the consultants. As duties and surcharges
are less than 30%, this percentage would automatically exclude IDA reimbursement
of these items. No disbursements would be made against contracts awarded over
the Association's objection. The phasing af investments and the estimated
quarterlv schedule of disbursements are given in Annex 11. Any savings would
be cancelled.



- 17 -
Accounts, Audit and Insurance
4.27      The Rahad Corporation Act (Annex 12) requires satisfactory budget-
ing and accounting procedures and audits. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that audited accounts would be submitted to the Association
within four months of the close of each financial year.
4.28      Although the government of Sudan normally carries its own insurance,
to safeguard the project, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
all items required for the project would be insured against all reasonable
risks during the construction period and that foreign exchange, and local
funds for duties, surcharges and foreign exchange tax, would be available
immediately in case of loss or damage.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      The Project would be carried out by the MOI and a newly created
corporation, the Rahad Corporation, with the Ministry of Planning having
overall responsibility for implementation. The MOI would be responsible
for construction, operation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
system.  The MOI has the necessary capacity for this work as the completed
Rahad scheme would represent only a small percentage of MOI's total
responsibility for all irrigation systems in the Sudan. The Rahad
Corporation, would undertake the agriculture development of the Rahad Project
and its future extensions. Its council, responsible to the Minister of
Agriculture, would include representatives of the various Ministries, the
Sudan Gezira Board, the Cotton Marketing Corporation (CMC), the Agricultural
Research Corporation, Blue Nile and Kassala Provinces, and the tenants.
5.02      The nationalized enterprises in the agricultural sector are mainly
operated by corporations, modeled on the successful Sudan Gezira Board. These
include the Mechanized Farming Corporation; the Agricultural Production Cor-
poration, which operates Khashm el Girba Scheme; marketing corporations (one
for cotton and three which handle, inter alia, groundnut exports); and an
agricultural research corporation. Each is legally independent but, the
various councils (boards) all consist of the same representatives of the
concerned Ministries (Agriculture, Irrigation, Treasury, etc.). The
corporations have provided an effective means for coordinating the activities
of different Ministries and for career development and incentives outside of
the normal departmental structure of the Ministries.
The Rahad Corporation
5.03      Legislation establishing the Corporation was discussed with the
Association on several occasions and the Rahad Corporation Act, (Annex 12)
passed by the Council of Ministers on April 22, 1972, provides all powers
necessary for the execution of the project. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Association's approval would be obtained prior to any
substantial modification.



- 18 -
5.04      Rahad Corporation's organization, which would largely duplicate
the proven pattern evolved over 45 years on the Gezira, is shown in Figure
3. For administrative purposes the project area would be divided into three
groups each 100,000 fed net in area, and each group would comprise three
blocks of about 30,000 fed, all appropriately staffed.  The Corporation would
purchase inputs required by farmers, especially fertilizer, pesticides and
spraying services. It would purchase farmer's crops and deliver produce
to Port Sudan but storage and marketing would be undertaken by the CMC and
other corporations.
Staffing and Training
5.05      While the work of the Corporation would be very similar to that in
the Gezira, it is not possible for the Sudan Gezira Board to transfer sig-
nificant numbers of experienced staff. Adequate numbers of suitably quali-
fied men are available from other corporations and ministries but they will
require special training in irrigation techniques, the Corporation's proce-
dures, and in the difficult problem of establishing a fruitful relationship
with tenants. The project presents no technical problems which have not been
successfully overcome in Sudan; its success will depend almost entirely on
the caliber of its staff, their training, and their motivation. The diffi-
culties at Es Suki have proved that serious problems can occur when staff are
posted at the last moment into an unfamiliar area to carry out duties for which
they have not been properly trained. To avoid similar shortcomings the following
assurances on staff and training were obtained during negotiations:
(a) appointment of a managing director and two managers (for
agriculture and administration) acceptable to the Associa-
tion as a condition of effectiveness;
(b) appointment of suitably qualified key personnel, including
three group inspectors, a senior agricultural engineer and
the chief processing engineer, together with adequate sup-
porting staff, by December 31, 1973;
(c) nine block inspectors would be appointed fifteen months
before settlement of their particular block and would be
trained during a full crop cycle by the Sudan Gezira Board;
(d) junior and field inspectors would be appointed in October
of each year and would be given in-service training, in-
cluding field trips to the Gezira and other schemes; and
(e) fieldmen would attend two-week courses to be arranged by
Sudan Gezira Board.
Relations between the Rahad Corporation and its Tenants
5.06      The relationship between the Sudan Gezira Board and its tenants in-
volves a subtle blend of persuasion, discipline and legally-enforced sanctions
(Annex 13). The original concept was a tripartite partnership in which



- 19 -
government supplied land and water, the company supplied management and the
tenant supplied labor. The company - later the Board - concerned itself only
with cotton and shared the proceeds with Government and tenants according to
an agreed formula. Over the years, this concept has become rather blurred,
especially as a result of seasonal labor scarcity and of intensified cropping.
5.08      The Rahad Corporation Act specifies relationships between the
Corporation and its tenants:-
(a) the Corporation has power to reject applications from
unsuitable persons, even if they held title or rights
to land in the area;
(b) the Corporation will provide inputs and services for,
and would market cotton, groundnuts and any other cash
crops which might be adopted in future;
(c) the Corporation will provide a full range of mechanized
field operations, including land levelling, planting of
crops and harvesting of groundnuts; and
(d) the tenant will pay a fixed "Land and Water Charge" in lieu
of a share of the proceeds of crop sales.
The tenancv agreement would be for an indefinite period but could be termi-
nated only in case of default by the tenant: it would not be mortgagable or
assignable. The agreement would provide that the tenant must grow approved
crops only and follow the Corporation's approved rotation, initially:Cotton:
groundnuts:cotton:groundnuts:cotton:fallow.
5.08      About 13,700 tenants would be required.  The cadastral survey shows
that this is approximately the numbers of title and right holders in the area.
On arrival tenants would be allocated a 24-fed holding (or 5 fed for gardens)
and issued with materials to build a house on an allotted site in a village
and with subsistence rations from the WFP project. In view of experiences
at Es Suki, tenancies should be allotted by December each year and each tenant
should occupy his holding by the end of February; and housing sites should be
allotted within 5 km of holdings. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that the Corporation would use a form of tenancy agreement satisfactory to
the Association and that tenants would be settled in villages sited where
possible within 5 km of their holdings.
Ecology
5.09      The project would profoundly modify the ecology of the region, not
only by the direct effect of irrigation but also because of interruption of
traditional migrations of men, cattle and game. Experience in other schemes
shows that tenants and nomadic herdsmen quickly adapt to new conditions. Game
experts and conservationists had been seriously concerned that the gravity
supply canal from Roseires would cut game migration routes from Dinder Game
Park but the project supply canal now proposed, which is much further north,
would have little effect (Annex 3).



- 20 -
5.10      By far the most serious ecological effect would be the danger of
increasing the incidence of bilharzia and malaria in the project area. The
cost of health facilities, transport and initial inventory of chemicals would
be included in the project and assurances were obtained during negotiations
that government, through its Ministry of Health, would submit to the Associa-
tion by December 31, 1975 a program for control and treatment of these diseases,
and would thereafter implement it to the satisfaction of the Association. The
Ministry would also monitor health statistics.
Recovery of Project Costs
5.11      The annual cost of inputs supplied, services performed and cash
advanced by the Corporation would be about ESd 9 million at full development.
W4hen tenants deliver crops, valued at about ESd 13 million, to the Corporation,
their accounts would be credited at rates announced at the beginning of the
season.
5.12      The Rahad Corporation Act requires that tenants be charged a flat
rate "land and water charge" having regard to provisions for covering the
annual expenses of the Corporation depreciation of assets and an adequate
return to the Government on its investment. The annual operation and main-
tenance (O & M) cost of irrigation is estimated at ESd 900,000, or VSd 3 per
fed. Other recurrent expenses of the Corporation (management, extension,
training and other items) would amount to ESd 760,000 per year, or about
ESd 2.50 per fed.  The part of the charge required by the Act to cover annual
expenses would thus be ESd 5.50 per fed.  The Government and the Association
consider that, at full development, tenants could afford to pay ESd 7 (US$20)
per fed, or a total of ESd 170 (US$488) per 24 ha tenancy.  This charge
would be 41% of the gross farm income but would leave the farmer a net cash
in-come of ESd 200 - 240 (US$575 - 690). This is about the national average
family income and is comparable with incomes on other irrigation schemes.
However, this charge could not be borne by the tenants in the first three
years and consequently it would be prudent to allow a grace period followed
by a rising scale. Assurances were therefore obtained during negotiations
that the Corporation would, after initial settlement, allow a three-year
grace period and would thereafter levy an annual land and water charge of at
least ESd 4.00 per fed, rising to ESd 7.00 per fed within a further four years.
On the basis of present estimates, this level of charge (together with export
duties) would recover, over the lifetime of the project, current costs and
investment costs with 3% interest. The assurance further provides that the
land and water charge would be reviewed by the Government, the Corporation and
the Association at least once every five years to ensure it is adequate to
provide the 3% rate of return.
5.13      Using a discount rate of 10%, and comparing the discounted present
worth of investment, O&M costs, on the one hand, and revenues from the Land
and Water Charge, on the other, over a period of 45 years, the net present
value of the subsidy would be ESd 17.2 million (US$49.4 million). Expressing



- 21 -
the present value of the project charges as a percentage of the present value
of the costs as a recovery index to indicate the proportion of costs recovered,
this would be 44%. However, this takes no account of the vary high duties
paid by tenants: at full development, import duties on inputs would total
ESd 95, and export duties on produce almost ESd 90, per holding. If these
duties, totalling ESd 7.70 (US$22) per fed, are considered as "recovery"
the index rises to 88%.
Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project
5.14      The Rahad Corporation Act makes provision for monitoring project
and economic research and evaluation. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that the Economics Section of the Corporation would be adequately
staffed (Annex 2) and that the annual report of the Section would be published
within six months of the end of the crop year.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKET PROSPECTS AND TENANTS' INCOME
Crop Production
6.01      Present production of the project area is about 45,000 m tons of
sorghum, valued at ESd 430,000, plus a small but unquantifiable contribution
from other crops and grazing of nomad's herds.
6.02      At full development, the project would produce some 220,000 bales
of Acala cotton lint, 70,000 m tons of cotton seed and 50,000 m tons of
shelled Ashford groundnuts, mainly for export. In addition, the project
would produce vegetables for domestic consumption.
6.03      Since none of these crops are now grown ia the area, yield projec-
tions have been extrapolated from other projects. In 1970-71, the yield from
15,000 fed of Acala 4-42 cotton at nearby C-uneid was 5.7 kantars per fed (kpf)
and the average for the first four crops was 4.6 kpf. Over a much larger
area (105,000 fed) at Khashm el Girba, the same variety has averaged 4.9 kpf
over the past four years. However, Barac, a new black arm resistant variety,
is now ready for release. Even in disease-free conditions Barac outyields
Acala 4-42 by 10-15%: under field conditions, an increase of 20% in total
production can be expected. Therefore it is projected that yields of Barac
would increase from 3.5 kpf initially to 6 kpf seed cotton at full development
in the eighth year.
V
6.04      Yields of Ashford groundnuts have been disappointing in the Gezira,
averaging about 1/2 m ton per fed, in part because the Board takes no direct
interest in this crop. Somewhat better results have been obtained in Guneid
(0.73 m tons per fed in 1970) and Khashm el Girba (0.8 m tons). Higher yields
are expected on the Rahad project: groundnuts would be a Corporation crop, and
seed would be planted mechanically, promoting the close spacing essential for
high yields. It is projected that yields of Ashford would increase from 0.40
m tons initially to 0.9 m tons at full development.



- 22 -
6.05      Many different vegetables, fodder and grains could be grown in the
irrigated gardens: it is not possible to project cropping patterns or yields
but the net value of production is estimated at ESd 32 per fed. No attempt
has been made to estimate the value of grazing crop residues or fallow land,
which would more than offset the loss of the present rough grazing.
6.06      Yields and production at full development would be as follows:
Crop                 Area                 Yield                Production
(fed)                (per fed)
Cotton             140,000              6 kantars      119,000 m tons seed cotton
(1,872 lb)    equivalent to 48,000 m tons
lint, 70,000 m tons cotton
seed
Groundnuts          93,000              0.9 m tons    84,000 m tons in shell
(2,000 lb)    equivalent to 50,000 m tons
kernels.

(Cropping intensity 84%)
Market Prospects and Prices
6.07      Sudan is a relatively minor producer of cotton, accounting for only
about 2% of the world's production and about 5% of exports. Until recently
Sudan produced extra long staple (ELS) almost exclusively. The market for
ELS has weakened in recent years due to competition from man-made fibers
and improved spinning machinery. Acala-type cotton has been less affected
by this technological change. Sudan is trying to diversify production by
adding more Acala, which at present accounts for 15-20% of production, with-
out substituting for ELS. Even though the Rahad project will approximately
double Sudan's production of Acala, the influence on world markets will be
insignificant. However, Sudan's market will be influenced by world supply
and demand conditions (Annex 14).
6.08      For the past four or five years there has been a shortage of cotton
on the world market that has resulted in higher than normal prices.  By 1980,
when the project approaches full production, the more normal long-term situa-
tions of 5-7% surplus appear probable. The price projected for 1980 by the
Division of Trade Policies and Export Projections for MIexican SM 1-1/16in, a
representative grade of medium-long staple cotton which normally accounts for
more than 60% of total world cotton output, is around 294 per pound, cif
Liverpool. The price of US SM1-1/16in cotton has usually been about one
cent higher than the price of Mexican cotton. Sudanese Acala has not yet



- 23 -
become well established in the market, and there have been some quality prob-
lems. Therefore, Sudanese Acala has generally sold a little below Mexican
cotton. However, as it becomes better known in world markets, and as quality
problems are overcome, Sudanese Acala is expected to sell at about the same
price as Mexican cotton.
6.09      The prospects for cottonseed and groundnuts are more favorable.
Vegetable oils are not expected to be in chronic oversupply in the future
and denand is expected to hold up well. Ilowever, the recent high price for
groundnuts and cottonseed are not expected to continue. Sudan is not a major
supplier of either commodity in world markets, hence, an increase in Sudanese
production would have little influence on the world supply-demand-price situa-
tion. The projected price in 1980, cif European ports, of shelled groundnuts
is E (Sterling) 68-73 per long ton and of cottonseed, t(Sterling) 38-42 per
long ton.
Tenants' Income
6.10      In the third year of settlement, the tenant's average gross income
would be about ESd 200 but, at full development, it would have risen to
ESd 410. Project charges would be increased progressively (para 5.14) to
maintain net tenant incomes at about ESd 200-240 (US$575-690), or two to
three times the estimated present farm family income in the project area.
ilowever, since sorghum would not be included in the permitted rotation,
tenant families would need to purchase staple foods at an estimated cost
of ESd 15 per year. Farm budgets are given in Annex 15 and the tenant's
projected income is summarized below:

VII. ECONOMIIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The project would have a favorable impact on the national economy,
especially the annual earnings of foreign exchange which would be increased
by US$42 million gross (US$27 million net). The project benefits would be
realized by changing unproductive near-arid lands into irrigated farmland.
It would almost triple incomes of the 16,000 households in the area and
provide seasonal employment for 90,000 laborers. The Corporation would create
jobs for 2,300, of which about 1,000 would be for unskilled laborers.
Economic Benefits and Costs
7.02      The direct economic benefits of the project consist of the export
value of cotton and groundnuts and the farmgate value of domestically consumed
crops. Project economic costs include all costs associated with irrigation,
crop production, processing, and transportation to Port Sudan. Farm labor is
valued at ESd 0.30 per man-day, a rate which approximates the average oppor-
tunity cost and allows for the loss of the present output of both tenants'
families and hired labor. Full details of the calculation of costs and bene-
fits are given in Annex 16.
Economic Rate of Return
7.03      The economic rate of return (ERR) would be between 9% and 16%,
depending mainly on the future price of cotton. The ERR is less sensitive
to yield variations because of corresponding changes in harvesting and proc-
essing costs. Construction delays and cost overruns have less effect on the
ERR than variations of crop prices. On the basis of the Trade Policies and
Export Projections Division's projections of crop prices and the proposed
implementation schedule, the ERR would be 13.6%.
7.04      A total of seven variations were tested to determine the sensitivity
of the project (Annex 16, table 1): the project would still be economically
viable under a combination of adverse conditions. A 10% reduction of future
crop prices would reduce the ERR to about 10.4%. A combination of decreased
crop prices, increased capital costs, and a delay in getting the project
into operation would reduce the ERR to about 9.0%. On the other hand, an
increase of 10% in future crop prices would raise the ERR to 16%.
7.05      Indirect benefits of the project include increasing the level of
agricultural technology in the Sudan and training Sudanese staff, who could
later employ the improved methods in future development schemes. The project
would introduce irrigated farming into an area most of which is now sparsely
populated, inhospitable semi-desert and bush. It would further the efficient
utilization of the Sudan's most valuable, but still under-utilized, natural
resources - Nile waters and arable land - and improve the productivity, income
and general living conditions of a large number of impoverished families who
seek their subsistence at present under extremely primitive conditions, or

eke it out by seasonal employment in existing schemes. It would provide
productive work for the MOI's permanent labor force and equipment for which
there presently are no alternative uses.

SUDAN
RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
Historical Review of the Project
I. BACKGROUND
1.        All of the important agricultural land in the Sudan lies in the
Nile Basin. The White Nile, rising at Lake Victoria in Uganda, and the
Blue Nile, whose source is Lake Tana in Ethiopia, converge at Khartoum. From
Khartoum to the Egyptian border at Wadi Halfa, the river is known as the
Nile. The flow of the White Nile is considerable throughout the year but the
Blue Nile is mDre seasonal, with a period of low flows from January to June.
A dam was built in 1925 at Sennar, on the Blue Nile (Map 1), to divert and -
store water for the Gezira irrigation scheme. A second dam at Jebel Aulia on
the White Nile is a part of the system for controlling flows and irrigation
in Egypt, which financed its construction, and is not a part of the Sudan's
irrigation system.
2.        Until 1959, the Gezira was the only major gravity irrigation scheme
in the Sudan, the remainder relying upon pumps. Under the 1929 Nile Water
Agreement the Sudan was obliged to restrict her use of water during January
15 to June 15 and the licenses of most pump schemes imposed limitations on
the use of water. Both the extent of gravity irrigation and the cropping
pattern on the Gezira scheme were limited by the capacity of the Sennar
Reservoir, 0.8 milliard m3. These restrictions inevitably resulted in an
agricultural system with a rather low intensity of cropping.
3.        Proposals for the construction of new dams at Aswan in Egypt and
at Khashm el Girba and Roseires in the Sudan led to the negotiation of a new
agreement, the 1959 Nile Water Agreement, between Egypt and the Sudan. The
new agreement removed the seasonal restrictions, replacing them with limits
on the total annual usage of water. In essence, the Sudan may use about
18.5 milliard m3 of water from the Niles and their tributaries, although she
has agreed to limit withdrawals to about 17 milliard m3 until 1977.
4.        Existing schemes along the Blue Nile require about 5.3 milliard m3
for their traditional cropping and could use as much as 7.6 milliard m3 if
cropping intensities were increased to levels known to be feasible. The
development of all potentially irrigable land would require a further 8.8
milliard m3.
5.        Total annual requirements are not the limiting factor, however, in
the Blue NIle. The low season flow of the river is not sufficient to bring
even the present area of cotton on existing schemesto maturity and stored
water is essential for the growing of either extra long staple or upland



ANNEX 1
Page 2
varieties; stored water is also required for growing wheat and for the
production of livestock fodder during the dry season. The intensification
of existing schemes and the development of known potentially irrigable land
would require 4.8 milliard m3 stored water. The available storage capacity
has been increased to about 3.9 milliard m3 by the completion, in 1966, of
the Roseires Dam. However, the storage capacity would be increased to 7.7
milliard m3 if the water level of the Roseires reservoir were raised by the
construction of Stage 2 of the Roseires Dam, a 10 m increase in height.
II. THE RAHAD AREA
6.        The Roseires Dam commands a large area of the Blue Nile basin,
including a tract of land, nearly 300 km long, on the east bank of the Rahad
River-(Map 1) commonly called the "Rahad Area."
7.        The Rahad river, whose catchment is in the Ethiopian uplands, is
entirely seasonal: the first flow starts in mid-July, the flood reaches its
peak in the last week of September and flow ceases by the end of November. In
a normal year the Rahad flood could supply the full requirements of the project
during August and the greater part of September, but not during the peak month
of October. It would be possible to grow crops of sorghum and possibly
groundnuts planted at normal times without drawing supplemental water from the
Blue Nile. Cotton could only be grown without supplemental water if it were
possible to advance the planting date by some three months, and wheat could
not be grown at all using Rahad waters alone. Without transfer of suppple-
mental waters from the Blue Nile, especially stored, it would thus not be
possible to introduce a reasonably remunerative cropping pattern.
8.        The Rahad area was studied by consultants (Sir M.MacDonald and
Partners and Hunting Technical Services, U.K.) financed under the Bank
Group/KFW loans and credits for the Roseires Dam (284-SU and 2-SU).
They found that some 820,000 fed were irrigable and recommended several
alternative schemes which were appraised by the Bank Group in February 1967.
The project selected provided for gravity irrigation from Roseires of a first
stage area of 410,000 fed, but included some investments required for a
second stage of the same size, also supplied from Roseires. Key issues were
reliance on water from the Rahad River in the absence of agreement with the
upstream riparian (Ethiopia); the size of the project in relation to fiscal
and other resources; land tenure; recovery of project costs; and project
management and organization.
9.        Following policy and technical discussions with the Government of
Sudan, the Bank Group reappraised this Stage I gravity project in February
1970. The revised appraisal report included modified cost and benefit
estimates and cropping patterns but did not propose any major changes in the
concept of the project. This revised report was discussed with Government but
no agreement was reached on a financing plan.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
10.       In September 1971, the Government of Sudan requested Bank Group
assistance in financing a different project with a first stage supplied from
a pumping station at Meina on the Blue Nile. The Meina supply canal would
be less than half the length of that from Roseires but would command only
300,000 fed: the remainder of the Rahad area (520,000 fed) could be
irrigated by gravity from Roseires at a later date. Neither stage would rely
on use of Rahad water, although the first stage would use any available flow.
III. PROJECT DESIGN
The 1968/70 Gravity Scheme
11.       The consultants submitted two interim reports and a final report
describing four alternative designs for the Rahad Project. All of these
designs made use of the flow of the Rahad river, but included a supply canal
from the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile. The designs fell into two groups -
those in which one main canal served both phases of the project, and those
in which each phase was served by a separate canal. Each group was subdivided
into designs which did or did not provide a gravity supply to the existing
pump schemes in the Guneid area to the north of the project.
12.       The consultants worked out detailed proposals for the alternative
designs which allowed comparisons to be made. At 1970 prices, the combined
cost of Stages I and II served by two separate canals was approximately
_Sd 65.9 million and the cost per fed about fSd 80.52. The one-canal design
cost slightly more - ESd 66.4 million - but the canal commanded an additional
46,000 fed, resulting in a lower cost per fed - ESd 76.80. However, the land
would be brought into cultivation at a rather slower rate than the one-canal
design and there was practically no difference between the estimated benefit/
cost ratios or rates of return of the alternative designs.
13.       The Bank therefore accepted the gravity, two-canal design, and the
project considered during the 1967 and 1970 appraisals consisted of:-
Stage I 410,000 fed, fed by gravity by a 190 km long,
150 in3/sec capacity, supply canal from Roseires. From the
supply canal, water would flow down the Rahad channel to
a barrage where it would be diverted into a 163 km main
canal with a capacity of 140 m3/sec in the head reach.
This stage would be completed in six years and benefits
would begin in the fifth year.
Stage II, 410,000 fed, fed by gravity by a second 150 m3/sec
supply canal. Water would be siphoned under the Rahad to a
200 km main canal, also with a head-reach capacity of 140 m3/sec.
This stage would be completed in a further six years with
benefits accruing from the fifth year.
14.       In 1970, the total cost of Stage I was estimated at USd 38 million
(US$109 million) with a foreign exchange component of 60%. The economic rate



ANNEX 1
Page 4
of return (ERR) was estimated at 12%: while a combination of adverse
circumstances might have reduced the ERR to 7%, the appraisal report concluded
that the most likely range was 10-14%. Because the cost of the supply canal
and barrage would not be much affected by changes in the irrigated area, it
was not possible to reduce markedly the size or cost of Stage I.  Equally, it
was not possible to devise an acceptable financial plan which would divide
Stage I into two self-sufficient tranches. Since the cost of the gravity
scheme was formidable in relation to Sudan's resources, MOI engineers began
in 1970 to study alternative designs which would be supplied by pumping from
the Blue Nile. The rationale was that (a) power for pumping would be
generated by release of the water needed for Rahad through the newly-installed
generators at Roseires dam, and (b) the pumps and supply canal could be sited
so that the supply canal would be shorter and the irrigated area smaller.
The 1971 Pump Scheme
15.       Several different proposals were evolved and reviewed and in
September 1971 Government submitted to the Association an outline of a
project comprising:-
Stage I, 300,000 fed, supplied through an 84 km 105 m3/sec
canal from a pumping station at Meina on the Blue Nile.
The station would have 13 electric pumps, supplying a total
of 105 m3/sec against 10 m head, drawing power from the
Roseires hydro-electric plant. From the supply canal water
would pass six kilometers down the Rahad channel before
being diverted by a barrage into a main canal with a capacity
of 100 m3/sec in the head reach. This stage would be completed
in five years and benefits would begin in the fourth year.
Stage II, 520,000 fed, fed by gravity by a 190 km 190 m3/sec canal
from Roseires. Water would be siphoned under the Rahad to a main
canal, constructed on the same line as that for the gravity scheme,
but with an initial capacity of 180 m3/sec. This stage would be
completed in a further seven years with benefits accruing from
the fifth year.
16.       This proposal, together with proposals for agricultural management,
formed the basis of the present appraisal. However, before accepting it, the
Association made a detailed comparison of the economic viability of the
gravity and pump alternatives. Analyses were based on 1970 costs, prices,
yields and management proposals and the figures in the following extract from
the report of the study therefore differ in detail from the final figures
given in this appraisal report:-
"....Benefit cost analyses indicate that the margin of difference
between the gravity and pump schemes is small enough that the
choice between them can be made on other criteria.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
On the basis of our cost estimates, and considering the
Roseires Dam as a sunk cost, the economic rate of return
(ERR), of the gravity scheme is about 12%, or the same as
that shown in the 1970 appraisal report. With similar
assumptions the ERR of the pump scheme is about 12.5%
if Rahad flood water is used or 12% if all water is pumped.
If only the first stages are considered, the pumping scheme
has a slightly higher ERR, 13% as against 12% for Stage I
of the gravity scheme.
The gravity and pump schemes have similar benefit/cost
(B/c) ratios at discount rates of 8% this
remains true whether the B/C ratio is calculated on
the basis of net benefits over investment costs or gross
benefits over gross expenditure. At discount rates of 8%-
15%, the present value of net benefits from the pump scheme
exceeds those from the gravity scheme by about £Sd 2 million.
If only the first stages are considered, the present value of
net benefits from the gravity scheme exceeds those of the pump
schemes by ESd 2.8 million at 8% discount rate. However, at
10% and 12% discount rates, which approximate more closely to
the opportunity cost of capital in the Sudan, the position is
reversed: the present value of net benefits from Stage I of
the pump scheme exceeds those of Stage I of the gravity scheme
by about ESd 1 million at 10%, and about LSd 3 million at 12%.
At 15% discount rate, the gap widens to ESd 5 million.
Varying our assumptions altered the magnitude but not the
direction of differences; the pump scheme gave values equal to
or higher than those of the gravity scheme. Similarly, apart
from the exception noted in the previous paragraph (present
value of net benefits at 8% discount), the values for Stage I of
the pump scheme were higher than those of Stage I of the gravity
scheme. The tests made included:
(a) Recent purchases of departmental equipment (%Sd 1.12
million) regarded as sunk cost and labor shadow priced
at 75%: the ERR increased to 15% for the gravity, and
16% for the pump, schemes;
(b)  foreign exchange components shadow priced at 125%: the
ERR increased to 15% for the gravity, and 16% for the
pump schemes, and there was a wider gap in present value
of net benefits;
(c) power costs for the pump scheme shadow priced at zero:
insignificant effect on the ERR; and
(d) total loss (after incurring production costs up to
harvest) of the first crop from the pump scheme:
insignificant changes in the ERR and the present value
of net benefits.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
We also tested the sensitivity to changes in cost and benefits:
(a) an increase of 15% in costs reduced the ERR to about 11%
in each case; and
(b) an increase of 25% in benefits increased the ERR to 18%
for the gravity, and 20% for the pump schemes.
In general both schemes are more sensitive to reduction in
benefits than to any other factor. The 1970 appraisal report
reached a similar conclusion for Stage I of the gravity scheme
and concluded:
"..In the extremely unlikely event that cost overruns
of 20% accompanied a year's delay and were followed by a
102 reduction in gross benefits the rate of return would
still be more than 7%..".
In similar circumstances, the ERR of Stage I would be just over
7% if Rahad water is used or under 6.5% if all water is pumped.
We see no reason to differ from the conclusion of the 1970
appraisal report on Stage I of the gravity scheme:
"..The most likely range for the rate of return would
be between 10% and 14% which is satisfactory..".
Subject to field appraisal, we expect that the ERR of Stage I
of the pump scheme would fall in the same range.
17.       As noted in Chapter VII and Annex 16, the ERR is estimated, at 1972
costs and prices, at 10-18%: if the projected 1980 world prices are realized,
and if the project is implemented on schedule, the-ERR is estimated at 15%.

Agriculture
1.        Sudan, the largest country in Africa, has an area of 2.5 million
km2 (600 million fed) and a population of about 15.7 million. The average
annual per capita income is about US$110, but in the agricultural sector
the average income is considerably less. Agriculture, including animal
husbandry, is the principal economic activity, accounting for almost half
the GDP, 95% of the value of exports, and 90% of total employment. While
underemployment is general throughout Sudan, labor appears to be in short
supply in the cotton growing areas during harvesting, January through March.
2.        The traditional agricultural sector, which is primarily subsistence
oriented, consists mainly of farming and pastoral enterprises which depend
upon rainfall for growth of crops and forage. The traditionalists farm
perhaps 75% of the land annually cropped in Sudan, but account for only
about 30% of agricultural production, while the pastoralists produce an
additional 20 to 25%.  Commercial, or cash-crop, farming (almost all of which
is irrigated), now amounts to somewhat more than 2 million fed, or about 25%
of Sudan's yearly cropland, but produces about 50% of total production. The
principal cash crop activity is production of cotton for export with ground-
nuts increasing in importance.
3.        Present stated Government policy is aimed at broadening the basis
of the economy by increasing the area under irrigation and by diversifying
agricultural production. Virtual completion of Khashm el Girba (400,000 fed)
and Es Suki (85,000 fed) projects has greatly expanded the area under irrigation.
Crop diversification, however, is mainly in the planning stage.
Present Agriculture in the Project Area
4.        Agriculture in the project area now depends entirely on rainfall and
is subsistence oriented; primarily owing to the low average and highly variable
annual rainfall (see Table 1), yields are low. The proportion of the land
that is cropped annually is also highly variable, ranging from 15 or 20 to
95% and averaging perhaps 50%, depending largely on crop prices in the
previous season. Many farmers bund small fields to retain rainfall and/or
to collect surface run-off, but most cultivation is crudely mechanized in
large blocks. At present the land is almost as valuable for pasturage as for
cropping. A detailed sample agricultural survey was carried out by the Sudan
Department of Statistics in 1967-68 (a particularly favorable rainfall year)
in the proposed Stage I Rahad Project area. The survey covered an area of
319,000 fed with a total population of 79,000 and comprised 149 Sheikships.
It included 14,781 agricultural households, with an average holding of



ANNEX 2
Page 2
21.6 fed and 1,207 landless families. Approximately 95% of the land
was cropped in 1967: 86% to- dura, 8% to sesame and less than 2% to all
other crops. Extensive crop cutting experiments by the survey group
indicated that in 1967/68 the yield of dura average 444 kg per fed and
that the total production for the year was 122,000 tons. However, in the
following, low rainfall year, the area cropped to dura in Blue Nile and
Kassala Provinces in which the project is located, decreased by more than
half and yields decreased by about half. Less than a fourth of the project
area appeared to be cropped in the 1971/72 season.
5.        On the assumption that about 50% of the project area, or about
150,000 fed, is cropped in an average year, that most of this is planted
to dura, and that the average yield is 0.3 m ton/fed, production averages
about 45,000 tons and is valued at ESd 0.43 mil/year, at a farm gate price
of ESd 9.6 m ton. On the further assumption that all other crops return
an additional 12% and that the returns from animal husbandry equal those
from cropping, the present annual value of agriculture in the project area
is about ESd 1.0 mil, or ESd 65 per family of about five.
Resource Base
6.        The Rahad Project area features a favorable climate for perennial
agriculture, abundant arable lands which can be developed for irrigation;
a plentiful supply of high quality water available from the Blue Nile and
a large rural population seeking an improved standard of living.
7.        Climate.  Very little meteorological data have been collected
from the project area, but its climate can be inferred from records avail-
able from surrounding stations, particularly those from Wad Medani and
from Mafaza which is just to the south of the Rahad project area (Table 1).
The mean monthly minimum temperatures probably range from about 13C in
January to about 24°C in June, the mean monthly maxima from about 33C in
August to 42C in April, and the mean diurnal variation ranges from about
13C in August to 21°C in March.  December, January and February are the
months of lowest temperature and April, May and June the highest.
8.        Rainfall at Wad Medani, which is close to the northern and
driest portion of the Project area, averages about 380 mm per year,
virtually all of it in the six months from May through October, with an
average of 120 mm in July and 145 mm in August. By interpolation it is
inferred that the rainfall ranges from about 350 mm in the north to 650 mm
in the southern portion of the project area. Dependable precipitation,
the amount of rain that almost certainly will fall four years out of five,
is about 70% of the mean monthly and the mean annual values.
Soils
9.        A semi-detailed soil survey was made of the area by the consultant
mostly at density of one site per 250 fed and the remainder at one site per



ANNEX 2
Page 3
1,000 fed. The land classification criteria included topography, clay
percentage, exchangeable sodium and salinity, with a high clay percentage
being considered most desirable. Thus, the soils were not classified in
relation to their suitability for irrigation or productive capacity nor were
any relevant economic parameters considered, at least directly. However,
these soils are similar in origin, characteristics, and productive capacity
to those of the nearby Gezira Scheme which have been irrigated successfully
for decades. From experience in the Gezira, it is possible to combine soil
survey and laboratory data with relevant economic criteria and infer suit-
ability for irrigation with reasonable precision. Owing to overall drainage
limitations, none were graded Class 1, whilst Class 4 included soils with
marginal exchangeable sodium content or coarser textures "which may require
special treatment." The following table gives the land classes as listed
by the consultant (over a somewhat larger area) and a revised estimate by
the mission, the latter obtained by re-evaluating the low clay and the saline
soils and eliminating Class 4.

10.       The Central Sudan consists mostly of a vast, almost flat, dark
brown clay plain between 450 and 380 m above sea level, which slopes
gently (0.5 m per km) to the west and northwest. The soils were formed
largely from sediments deposited by the Nile and its tributaries, mostly
derived from the basic rocks of the Ethiopian highlands. These soils are
remarkably uniform, having relatively narrow ranges in color, texture, clay
minerology, and in chemical and physical properties. There is little
evidence of soil profile development or of layering, the latter owing to
alternate swelling and shrinking of the soils during seasonal wetting
and drying. Small areas of sandier pinkish residual soils are found where
the Nubian Sandstones, lavas and other formations outcrop.
11.       Most of the Rahad soils are similar to the "regur" soils of
India and the "black cracking" or "black cotton" soils of Australia, the
United States and elsewhere. According to the 7th Approximation (U.S.D.A.
Soil Conservation Service, August 1960) these are vertisols, i.e. soils that



ANNEX 2
Page 4
upon wetting swell greatly and upon drying crack widely and have a loose
granular surface mulch, some of which drops into the cracks so that they
are "self-mulching". Such soils have a high clay content (mostly mont-
morillonitic) a high cation exchange capacity, are very sticky when wet, and
can be satisfactorily cultivated only over a narrow moisture range.
12.       The most striking visible characteristics of these soils are their
apparent uniformity, the thin loose surface mulch, and the wide cracking.
The cracks commonly are 3 to 6 cm wide at the surface and 60 to 100 cm in
depth, with some up to 20 cm wide and 150-200 cm deep. The surface mulch,
usually 2 to 5 cm deep, overlies large blocks or prisms of soil extending
between cracks and showing secondary blockiness and laminations. The soils
are somewhat darker brown and cracking may be less pronounced in the south
than in the north. In places below a depth of 30 to 50 cm are found thin
lime (calcium carbonate) streaks or layers, lime and manganese nodules,
gypsum crystals, or a dense greyish brown layer which apparently hinders
water penetration and root elongation.
13.       As is common in the clay plain, a large proportion of the soils
of the project area are high in exchangeable sodium but only a few of them
(less than 1%) are saline. According to a survey made by the consultants
27% of the soils in the 0-45 cm layer and 72% in the 45-90 cm layer have
an exchangeable sodium percentage of 15 or more -- i.e. are alkali soils.
Experience in the Gezira, however, indicates that in the Sudan the produc-
tivity of alkali soils is not seriously reduced unless the exchangeable
sodium content exceeds 20% in the surface layer and 25% in the subsoil.
On this basis, only a small proportion (perhaps one-quarter) of the alkali
soils were considered non-irrigable.
14.       More than 977% of the soils have a clay content in excess of 50%,
with silt and fine sand in about equal proportions making up the remainder.
The cation exchangeable capacities are very close to 1 meq. per gram of
clay. Soil pH values range from 7.5 to 8.5 for pastes and 8 to 9.5 for
1:5 soil:water suspensions. Lime (calcium carbonate) varies from 1 to 2% in
the upper 30 cm. and from 2 to 5% or more at 2 m. Gypsum ranges from none
(particularly in the surface) to about 27% at the 1 to 2 m depth. The organic
matter content is moderate to low, ranging from about 0.5 to 2% and averag-
ing about 1%. Total nitrogen is low, generally ranging from 0.02 to 0.03%.
Phosphate apparently is in moderately high supply, and potassium definitely
is plentiful.
15.       The physical properties of these soils are most important,
particularly the swelling and shrinking they exhibit on wetting and drying
and the virtual impermeability of the deep subsoil layers. To a large
extent, the amount and depth of cracking determines the amount of water
that can be applied at any one time, as once the cracks close the rate of
water movement through these soils is very low. While this increases
water application problems, it prevents over-irrigation and waterlogging.
In fact, the permeabilities are so low that these soils would be unsuitable
for irrigated agriculture if it were not for the fact that most of the
water enters the soil via the cracks.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
16.       Water.  Under the 1959 Nile Water Agreement between the Arab Republic
of Egypt and Sudan, the latter has a total allotment of 18.5 milliard m3
from the Nile system, About half of which is now committed to the irrigation
of about 2.1 million fed. On this basis the irrigation potential for the
country appears to be 4 to 5 million fed.
17.       As indicated above, the virtual impermeability of the soils of
the clay plains prevents (or makes exceedingly difficult) the leaching
out of the salts which are added in the irrigation process. Fortunately,
the water of the Blue Nile and the Rahad rivers are very low in total salt
content, ranging from about 115 parts per million (ppm) at flood to 180 ppm
during low flow, equivalent to electrical conductivities ranging from 180
to 280 micromhos per cm. Most of the salts are the bicarbonates of calcium
and of magnesium, and when the soil dries a high proportion of these salts
precipitate to form lime. As a result, a third or less of the added salts
actually contribute to the salinity problem. And at a cropping intensity
of 100% with no leaching, it would require more than 100 years of irrigation
to increase the soluble salt content of these soils to a level definitely
harmful to most of the crops now grown. Through normal soil forming pro-
cesses, alkalization of these soils has proceeded further than salinization
and with irrigation this trend will persevere, so that alkali will continue
to be a more pressing problem than salinity. Alkali does not affect plant
growth directly but results in deterioration of physical properties such
as infiltration, permeability, drainability and ease of management.
Fortunately, cracking minimizes the importance of the first two and the low
salt content of the water the need for drainage. Improvements in crop
management practices and in crop varieties should keep pace with the build-
up of alkali so that soil management should not become more difficult for
many decades to come.
Human Resources
18.       Burgeoning population is cited as a major obstacle to development
of a viable agricultural economy. This pessimistic attitude arises because
population commonly increases in proportion to economic growth, particularly
in the agricultural sector, leaving the economy in the same relative
position. That was the experience of the Sudan during the years to 1960
when progress in the agricultural sector actually trailed population
increase. However, during the last 10 years agriculture has grown at an
annual compound rate exceeding 4%. Considering the basic resources of
the area it is evident that, with proper direction and impetus, the agri-
cultural economy can grow at a faster rate than population. It is also
evident that rapid, intensive development of agriculture will require a
large labor force in lieu of complete mechanization: the latter is infeasible
at present levels of local technology, available capital and market prospects.
Accordingly, the local population, which is traditionally oriented towards
non-intensive subsistence agricultural pursuits, comprises a positive asset
to the proposed development program.



ANNEX 2
Page  6
Development Plan
19.       National and regional considerations are involved in the
justification of irrigation development in the Rahad area. With respect
to national considerations, of paramount importance is the matter of meet-
ing Sudan's future requirements for agricultural production to increase
foreign exchange earnings. According to the current five-year plan, agri-
cultural production must be increased at a rate of almost 11% per year,
an obviously unrealistic objective. Rainfall agriculture can be improved
only slowly and so whatever growth is attained must be largely the result
of improved technology in which irrigation plays a dominant role. And as
the Rahad area has a high productive potential and adequate water supplies can
be made available it could contribute materially to national economic growth.
20.       With respect to regional considerations, the need for development
is obvious. The local economy is entirely agricultural, but it is sub-
sistence oriented, stagnant and perhaps even deteriorating as population
growth continues to absorb any small increases in agricultural production
which may occur. Irrigation would exploit the only significant resources
of the region -- land, water, climate, and people. And it would bear on
the entire economy and population of the area thus assuring the widest
distribution of direct benefits and the generation of maximum indirect
benefits.
Potential for Development
21.       As regards three of the basic agricultural resources -- climate,
water and labor - there are no serious constraints to high crop yields
and production; however, the fourth resource, soil, does limit the yields
of most crops because of their characteristic swelling and shrinking and
low permeabilities which make water management difficult. Otherwise,
attainment of optimum yields, technically speaking, is largely a matter of
incorporating the necessary inputs -- sufficient water; improved seed
varieties, adequate fertilizers, suitable pest control - into a modern
crop management program.
Land Preparation and Irrigation
22.       The land would be cleared, levelled, and the major on-farm water
distribution ditches (abu ishreens) and surface drainage ditches would be
constructed by the Rahad Corporation. Crops would be grown on ridges in
small enclosed basins, irrigated as a unit (angaya irrigation). The
necessary smaller irrigation ditches (abu sittas) most of which would
serve an irrigation unit of 8 fed, and the field drains would be constructed
by the farmers. These and the abu ishreens would be maintained by the
farmers. The 8 fed irrigation units (howashas) and the 4 fed cropping units
would be laid out to permit easy conversion in the future to 150 m or 300 m
long-furrow irrigation.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
23.       The main canal would feed the project night-storage distribution
network through an appropriate system of regulators and major and minor
canals. The capacity of the system would be sufficient to provide water for
a cropping intensity of 100% although present plans calls for a cropping
intensity of about 84%. Water would be distributed from a minor canal to
each 528 fed rotational unit by six offtaking channels (abu ishreens), one
for each of the six 88 fed numbers in a unit. Twelve water courses (abu
sittas) offtaking from each abu ishreen would deliver water to the 12
irrigation units in a number, ten of 8 fed each and two of 4 fed each. The
basins (angayas) making up each irrigation unit would receive water from an
abu sitta by means of a system of small channels (gadwels) and earth ridges
(tagnets) constructed by the farmers. There is evidence that, with this
system, uneven watering and temporary waterlogging are common and surface
drainage is seriously impeded. As a result crop yields are reduced somewhat
by water stress, temporary waterlogging or flooding. Agriculture extension
emphasizing improvement in water management practices and eventual conversion
to long furrow irrigation would improve this situation.
24.       Land to be planted to cotton would be preirrigated and groundnut
land would be irrigated after harvest, at least until diversion requirements
for additional planned irrigation projects makes this infeasible. Thus,
irrigation water would be available to all tenancies by the end of May.
Land Allocation and Cropping
25.       About 280,000 fed would be divided into 24 fed tenancies, each
comprising 6 cropping units of 4 fed each. Most of the remaining 20,000
fed of irrigated land, including odd-shaped pieces not suitable for rotation,
would be reserved for 5 fed holdings cropped to vegetables and fruits (gardens)
and for "forests" and pastures. Plans have not been finalized for allocation of
the 5 fed holdings, but in view of the probable demand and the marketing
possibilities for garden produce it is expected that not over 10,000 fed will
be reserved for gardens.
26.       The annual cropping pattern on the 24 fed tenancies would be
black-arm resistant (Barac) Acala-type cotton, Ashford groundnuts and
fallow in 4 fed cropping units in the proportion 3:2:1, (see para 34).
About half of the 5 fed gardens would be irrigated in summer and half in
winter. Thus the composite of gardens and the above would result in a
cropping intensity of about 84%.
Mechanization
27.       Among the mechanized operations provided by the corporation would
be the cultivation of all land (including land levelling and planing), harrow-
ing, dry ridging, fertilizing, planting of cotton and groundnuts, green
ridging (weeding), spraying mainly by airplane, harvesting of groundnuts,
and the blading (cutting off of the roots) of cotton stalks after conclusion
of picking.



ANNEX 2
Page 8
Labor
28.       The statements in para 18 concerning people as a resource does
not mean to imply that seasonal farm labor is plentiful. In fact, in central
Sudan, it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit farm workers owing to
wage rates, the short working season, and the growing need for itinerant
laborers as agricultural projects proliferate. To minimize future labor con-
straints and to obtain high yields in the Rahad project, it appears necessary
to mechanize critical farm operations, including land preparation, planting,
weeding, harvesting groundnuts, and spraying. Even with the proposed
mechanization, at full development the project would require, under the pre-
vailing conditions, about 90,000 hired laborers in the peak season. It was
formerly assumed in the Sudan that the tenant family would do most of the
farm labor and government adjusted the size of holdings and the land annually
planted to cotton accordingly. However, experience has shown that tenant
families do relatively little for two related reasons. Firstly, there is
a strong local tradition against landowner families doing farm labor; secondly,
farm wages are so low that most tenants can afford more laborers than neces-
sary. In the central Sudan, laborers are hired at a rate of about one per
1.5 fed planted to cotton. About a third of the laborers in the Gezira Scheme
are local 1 andless residents who are employed much of the year; another
third migrate seasonally from Kordofan and Darfur, to the west; and the
remainder are mainly pastoralists from the right bank of the Blue Nile. Of
the latter, 15,000 to 20,000 are from the Rahad area, most of whom would
become tenants in the project. Thus, the number of laborers regularly
available to the area would decrease by about 13,000 while the hired labor
requirement would increase about 90,000 owing to the project.
Fertilization
29.       Nitrogen in the form of urea would be applied to cotton at a rate
of at least 50 kg nitrogen (N) per fed, with field trials exploring the
feasibility of 75 kg although this much may not be economic when cotton follows
a legume such as groundnuts. Groundnuts are said to benefit from an applica-
tion of 25 kg N per fed although this appears unlikely except for the first
year for thereafter the soil would be thoroughly inoculated with the symbiotic
bacteria that "fix" nitrogen. No provision is made for applying phosphate for
cotton or groundnuts although it will be required eventually. Potash would
not be required. Gardens would require 50 to 100 kg N per fed and perhaps
phosphate.
30.       At the above rates, approximately 22,000 m tons of urea would be
required annually for all crops. It should be noted that hand distribution
of fertilizers to commercial crops has been very uneven and the results
generally disappointing, hence the recent decision for mechanical distribution
by management. There is some disagreement in the Gezira regarding the
optimum time to apply fertilizers to crops; however, practical considerations
appear to limit applications to the planting (i.e. pre-germination) period.



ANNEX 2
Page 9
Crop Protection
31.       The methods established for protection of crops in the Gezira
would be rigidly enforced. Crops and weeds which may serve as hosts to any
disease or insect would be eliminated. All seed (cotton and groundnut)
would be treated to minimize or eliminate potential disease problems. All
cotton debris would be gathered and burned as soon as possible after harvest.
Back-pack sprayers would be available to farmers for times when aerial or
large-scale ground spraying is unavailable. However, major dependence will
continue to be on contract aerial spraying, particularly of cotton. The
number of sprayings continues to increase, and it now appears that six or
more is a minimum requirement for adequate control of insects and diseases
of cotton.
Crop Varieties
32.       The cotton variety that would be used in the project is Barac, a
local black-arm resistant development from Acala 4-42. This shows great promise,
appearing to outyield ordinary Acala 4-42 even in the absence of the bacterial
blight "black-arm". However, high standards of husbandry are needed to realize
the full potential of Acala. Specifically because Acala has fewer and larger
bolls than extra long staple varieties and a shorter season, the loss of bolls
through water stress, waterlogging, insect damage, etc., would have a pro-
portionately greater effect. The improved management to be incorporated into
the Rahad project would enable the higher potential of Acala to be realized,
and the annual fluctuations in yield which are a feature of other projects
in the Sudan are expected to be reduced. The ginningout-turnof Barac has
averaged 40% with both roller and saw gins.
33.       The Ashford variety of groundnuts has been chosen for the project
because of its convenient maturation period (190 days) and because it has out-
yielded the next best variety, Barberton. However, this advantage is offset
by higher harvesting losses, greater difficulty in decorticating, lower oil
content, and less desireable taste of Ashford. In fact, recent trials seem
to have improved the prospects of Barberton so that it may well supplant
Ashford as the favored variety by the time the project receives irrigation
water. It should be noted that groundnuts seldom are planted in fine
textured soils such as those of the Rahad because yields are not as high
and harvesting is more difficult. Hence, yields in the Rahad would be low
as compared to most other countries. Shelled nuts comprise 60% of the weight
of the harvested product.
Rotations
34.       A better understanding of the cracking clay soils and of the
potential of adequate water, fertilizer and pest control has led to the
conclusion that the Rahad may safely adopt a more intensive rotation than
used in the Gezira, provided that there is an adequate drying-out period
between successive crops. Selected is a three-course six-year rotation:
Cotton - groundnuts - cotton - groundnuts - cotton - fallow



ANNEX 2
Page 10
35.       One year in six the land would be fallow to allow for mechanical
control particularly of nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus) but also of other weeds
and possible insects, and to permit periodic land levelling.
Potential and Projected Yields of Crops
36.       With knowledge of the soils, climate and productivity of
comparable irrigated areas, the potential yields of crops can be estimated
with some precision. However, the realization of potential yields depends
upon a number of factors, most of which are beyond the control of the
farmers, such as adequate incentives, a complete and efficient infrastruc-
ture, effective dissemination of technological information, an efficient
surface drainage system, and ideal operation of the irrigation system.
37.       In practice, the various requirements for attaining high levels
of production cannot be effectively separated. For example, along with
adequate and timely water supplies is required sufficient necessary
fertilizers. Fertilizer applications, however, would be relatively in-
effective without adequate water supplies as well as improved seed
varieties which can respond to fertilizer efficiently. The compound benefits
of these three primary inputs, in turn, rely heavily on modern protective
measures for the control of plant diseases, and insect and weed infestations
that inevitably accompany bountiful crop production. In addition, vigorous
educational and extension efforts will be required to assist the farmers
in keeping abreast of technological advances, and credit will be needed to
facilitate some aspects of the development program.
38.       The following table g*.ves the estimated potential and anticipated
yields for the project area.

The potential yields are attainable with sufficient and timely water
supplies, adequate inputs, good management and known technology. The
anticipated yields take into account the attendant production problems
as judged by consideration of soils, climate, pests, farmer's skills,
incentives, etc., supplemented by information on yields in similar
nearby areas.
Water Requirements
39.       An estimate of irrigation water requirements has been prepared
(Annex 9) based on the annual cropping pattern: 140,000 fed cotton,
93,000 fed groundnuts, 20,000 fed gardens, and 47,000 fed fallow (no
water use). The crop water requirements have been calculated by the
Blaney-Criddle method, modified in accordance with U.S. Soil Conservation
Service Technical Bulletin 21. Effective monthly precipitation was assumed
to be from 80 to 95% of the corresponding 80-percentile value (i.e. the
amount statistically assured four years out of five). Also included are
a presowing irrigation for cotton (100 mm) and a post-harvesting irrigation
for groundnuts (100 mm), the latter to germinate unharvested nuts and
permit their elimination as a later weed problem.
40.       The magnitude and seasonal distribution of the various losses
that occur in an irrigation system are related to manner of operation of
works and soil characteristics. Seepage and operational losses from the
conveyance and distribution canals were estimated to be 7% (i.e. conveyance
efficiency = 93%) during the months of moderate and high flow and 14% during
the few months of very low flow. Farm losses comprise direct seepage losses
from farm ditches and fields, evaporation, non-beneficial consumption and
waste and are estimated to be 30% (i.e. field irrigation efficiency = 70%).
Thus over-all irrigation efficiencies are estimated to be 65% (.93 x .70)
most months and 60% (.86 x .70) in months of very low flow. Although an
overall irrigation effiency of 70% would be attainable with long-furrow
irrigation, experience in the Gezira has shown that with the local basin
(angaya) system the irrigation efficiency is unlikely to exceed 65%.
41.       Annual diversion requirements would be 1.4 milliard m3 or about
5,500 m3 per fed of irrigated land. Peak water requirements would occur
in October and amount to 97.5 m3 per sec for the projected cropping in-
tensity of 84%. If the cropping intensity should be increased to 100%,
the peak requirement would be 107.5 m3 per sec. or less depending upon
the introduced crops and their planting dates, assuming conversion from
basin to long furrow irrigation.
Monitoring and Evaluation
42.       The Rahad Corporation Act requires the Corporation to keep detailed
accounts of all transactions, including the supply of inputs. An individual
account would be maintained for each tenant at his block headquarters. The
Act also requires submission to the Minister of an annual progress report,
describing problems faced. There would thus be adequate collection of
financial data.



ANNEX 2
Page 12
43.       The Act also prescribes that the objectives of the Corporation
include:-
"  .(g) (ii) agricultural economics research with special
emphasis on production economics, farm management, market-
ing and collection of relevant statistics (iii) social
development research..."
This research would be carried out by the Economics Section. Its staff would
include:-
Chief Agricultural Economist
Farm Management Economist
Statistician
6 Assistant Statisticians
6 Enumerators.
Housing, office equipment and vehicles for the Economics Section would be
provided under the project.
44.       The University of Khartoum have always shown a lively interest in
agricultural and economic research on irrigation schemes and many studies
and papers have been published. This interest is likely to be stimulated,
rather than diminished, by the Rahad project and no formal association between
the Corporation and the University is necessary.

RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
Settlement, Public Health and Ecology
A. Settlement of the Project Area
1.        The population of the project area is about 70,000, comprising
about 16,000 households. Lack of perennial water has limited settlement
to the riverine strip and two-thirds of the families live in the northern
third of the project, where water backs up in the Rahad from the Blue Nile,
and along the Blue Nile itself. Following age-old tradition, families
live in villages, travelling daily to their fields when necessary.
2.        The project would require about 13,700 tenant families.  Most of
them would be drawn from the present population of the area but, if a short-
age should occur, there are large numbers of families in other provinces
who would welcome the opportunity to settle in Rahad.
3.        As in all irrigation schemes in Sudan, the traditional-type
villages would be established for the tenants. The 1965 feasibility study
selected provisional sites, about 60 of which fall within the boundaries
of the present project (thirteen further sites have been provisionally chosen
for Block and Group headquarters and other housing for Corporation staff).
While every effort would be made to give tenants land within reasonable
distance - 5 km - of their present homes, many would be required to move
into project villages. They would be allocated sites, provided with building
materials valued at about ESD 20 ($55), and when necessary provided with food
under the World Food Program project.
4.        Government agencies in the Sudan have considerable experience in
settling tenants on irrigation schemes and have learned much, especially
from the difficult operation of resettling the inhabitants of Wadi Halfa,
which was submerged by the reservoir of the Aswan High Dam. As many as
8,800 families were settled in 1967/68 and the average for three years
1966169 was 7,900 per year. By comparison, the project would require
settlement of only about 4,000 families per year, the remainder staying in
their existing homes. The lure of high incomes, piped water supplies and
schools should prove a strong incentive to settlement while the knowledge
gained from the Gezira (see Annex 13, page 6, "Local Government") should
help in building a social and political structure in the new villages.
5.        Following the successful example of the Sudan Gezira Board the
Rahad Corporation Act (Annex 12) provides for establishment of a Social
Development Committee comprising representatives of concerned ministries,
tenants and other local people. The specific functions of the Committee
include promotion of home economics and child care; youth class and training;



ANNEX 3
Page 2
consumer cooperatives; literacy campaigns; cleanliness and sanitary campaigns;
and scholarships. The plans of the Committee would be executed by the staff
of the Corporation's Social Development Section (Fig. 3) and financed by a
small levy on crops, which would be matched by funds from the Corporation's
profits.
6.        In the final analysis, the most pronounced influence on the
success of settlement may prove to be the demonstration effect of the
highly successful settlement of the Gezira Scheme, a few kilometers away
across the Blue Nile.
B. Public Health
7.        M1any diseases are endemic in the region but malaria and
schistosomiasis (bilharzia) probably cause the most human misery and econo-
mic loss. Both these diseases are associated directly with water and irri-
gation of the project area would cause a great increase in their incidence.
The project would include control measures against the mosquitoes and snails
which are the vectors and alternate hosts of the causative parasites. The
Ministry of Health, which would be represented on the Social Development
Committee, would be responsible for execution of control measures as well
as for the staffing and operation of the project hospital and clinics.
Malaria
8.        Control measures against the mosquito vector are well understood
and widely practiced in the Sudan. Aerial spraying of crops has been general
practice in the Gezira and pump schemes for ten years. Mosquitoes have
developed very high resistance to common insecticides as a result of long
exposure to low dosages from drifting residues. Control measures therefore
center on identification of potential breeding grounds and treament with
larvicidal oils applied with simple sprayers. The project would include
purchase of larvicides during the four-year construction period.
Bilharzia
9.        Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease.  It is caused by worms
that lodge in the blood vessels in the intestine and around the urinary
bladder and lay millions of eggs, some of which are excreted in the urine
and feces of the infected person. If the eggs reach fresh water, they
hatch into larvae (miracidia) that infect snails living there. The
miracidia multiply inside the snail, and develop into a different kind of
larva, called a cercaria, which is shed by the snail by the thousands and
can swim. If the cercaria reaches a person in contact with the water, it
can dissolve its way through the skin and migrate through the circulatory
system to its permanent resting and breeding places.
10.       Although WHO has estimated that 150 million people world-wide
suffer from schistosomiasis, the feeling among most experts is that in



ANNEX 3
Page 3
areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, an equilibrium is set up between
the infected person, the schistosome worms inside the body, and the many
other debilitating conditions affecting that person, including malnutrition
and other parasites. Under these conditions, it becomes difficult to
separate out the effects of schistosomiasis in such a way as to prove its
economic effects.
11.       The most critical problem comes when a new population is infected
with schistosomiasis, for example, as a result of a new irrigation project.
This can come about in two ways. Either previously infected snails spread
into new habitats created by the project, or else new (human) migrants,
encouraged by the project, move in and infect previously uninfected snails,
thus infecting the adult population previously resident in the area.  Thus
introduced into a new population, schistosomiasis becomes a severely
debilitating disease.
12.       Bilharzia (primarily S. Haematobium) has been present in the Sudan
since ancient times but it's history prior to 1925 is not well documented.
The disease attracted attention when it reached endemic proportions with
the start of irrigation from Sennar Dam in 1925. Construction of dams at
Jebel Aulia on the While Nile; Roseries, Blue Nile; and Khashm el Girba,
Atbara River; and the extension of the irrigated area have increased the
hazard while the annual migrations of cotton harvesters, other laborers and
nomads have spread bilharzia to every part of the Sudan.
13.       Ministry of Health statistics show that in 1970 there were 92,115
cases and 2,989 deaths from bilharzia in the Sudan. Several authorities
consider that these official statistics reveal only the "tip of the icebergs"
and that bilharzia is second only to malaria as a cause of morbidity. As
noted above, bilharzia is associated with irrigation, which provides the
ideal habitat for the snail vectors. Floating snails are spread by water
movement in canals. The human population is exposed to infection while
in the fields and while carrying out domestic chores, such as laundry, or
bathing in canals. Children are often infected while playing or swimming:
in one survey the marked difference in prevalence between 7-10 year old
urban boys (30%) and girls (almost nil) was attributed to social customs
which do not allow girls to bathe in the public canals.
14.       There have been no "before and after" studies in the Sudan but two
surveys give an indication of the influence of irrigation:
-    in 1964, 19,000 people were examined in the then undeveloped
riverine area which is now submerged by the reservoir of
Roseires dam. The prevalence of bilharzia was men, 7%;
women, 5% and children, 9%.
-    recent surveys in southern Gezira, which has been irrigated
for 40 years, showed that the prevalence of bilharzia ranged
between 62% and 100% in some villages.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Experience at Khashm el Girba has followed the same pattern. Before the dam
and irrigation scheme were constructed, the Atbara River was free of snails and
there was little or no bilharzia. Now, after six crop seasons, snails are
very common and bilharzia has been brought in by settlers from Wadi Halfa.
15.       Control of Snails.  The main method of controlling the disease is
by reducing or eliminating the population of snails, which are the alternate
host of the causative organism. Since snails are most abundant in the presence
of aquatic weeds, good canal maintenance is a prerequisite for control but is
not enough by itself. The two main control methods are trapping floating
snails and use of chemicals (molluscicides). Both methods have been used
since about 1940 in the Gezira, although it was not until 1955 that a major
snail control program, with annual budgets which reached ESd 250,000, was
launched. Snail traps are still used but there is controversy over their
effectiveness. One official claims that it costs E10,000 to trap 5,000
snails. The wire mesh of the traps is comparatively fragile and maintenance
costs are high.
16.       Copper sulfate is the only molluscicide now in routine use in the
Sudan: cloth bags containing crystals are suspended in the water at each
canal regulator for one day twice per year. The aim is to obtain a concentra-
tion of 20-30 parts per million (ppm) throughout the canal but copper sul-
phate is absorbed by mud and does not travel far.
17.       Two new synthetic organic molluscicides, Bayluscide (Bayer) and
Frescon (Shell), are effective in killing snails in the laboratory and, under
some conditions, in the field. It is possible under laboratory conditions to
kill snails with concentrations of molluscicides that do not harm fish and
other wildlife. Under field conditions, fish will be killed at least near
the dispensers. There is no evidence that these synthetic molluscicide
formulations affect humans, even when canals are used as sources of drinking
water. However, the Association would require the Ministry of Health to
review toxicological tests of any formulation and its decomposition products
before authorizing its use in the project's control program.
18.       Trials with Frescon are being carried out in the Northern Group of
the Gezira scheme. Frescon, an emulsifiable concentrate containing 16-1/2%
of the active ingredient (n-trityl morpholine), is fed into a canal with a
simple constant-flow dispenser to obtain a concentration of 0.075 ppm. The
active ingredient is almost insoluble in water and travels in the form of
minute crystals. Under certain conditions (ph 6) it hydrolyses rapidly to
an inactive chemical (triphenyl carbinol) and it is also precipitated out on
silt particles. In the Gezira experiment, the half-life has been estimated
at 30-40 hours.
19.       In the Gezira trials, Frescon has been found to travel 40 km under
favorable flow conditions, i.e. when the irrigation demand is high. Over
100,000 fed have been treated from a dispenser on the main canal with
boosters at appropriate points. The optimum regime has not yet been esta-
blished but results to date suggest that effective control may be attainable
with three applications per year at a cost, for chemical alone, of ESd 0.350
per fed.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
20.       Public Health Measures.  Control of snails must be complemented by
sanitary engineering measures including:
(a) Siting of villages and, particularly, latrines so as to
reduce the danger of contamination of canals and drains:
(b) Arrangements which minimize the need for people to come in
contact with water in canals, fields and drains. Most
important of these are suitable water supplies which make it
unnecesary to draw water directly from canals; and
(c) provision of carefully sited bathing and laundering places.
21.       The Corporation would exercise due care in selecting sites for new
villages and the project includes provision of water supplies for both existing
and new villages in the project area.  Provision of other facilities, and also
for providing health education, would be the responsibility of the Social
Development Committee and the Corporation's Social Development office.
Rural Health Service
22.       The Ministry of Health would provide treatment for bilharzia
at a 60-bed rural hospital, situated at Project Headquarters; Health Centers
at eachi of three Group Headquarters; and at 15 dispensaries situated in major
villages. Existing government designs of appropriate standard would be
used. The buildings and equipment would be provided by the project but the
staff and operating costs would be financed from the 'Ministry's annual budget.
C. Ecology
23.       The public health aspects of modifying the ecology of the area
have been discussed above. Other changes in the flora and fauna of the
area may occur but are unlikely to be of major significance. Three aspects
of the project, however, are noteworthy; its effect on the Dinder Game Park,
the use of aerial spraying, and the possibility of development of alflatoxin
on groundnuts.
The Dinder National Park
24.       The Dinder National Park, about 120 km south of the southern end of
the project (Map 1) was established in 1935 and covers 2,470 sq km. While
it is the nearest Park to Europe, it is not very accessible and can be
reached only by a rather arduous drive or by light aircraft. The resident
species (bucks, kudu, warthog, buffalo, lion, hyaena and buffalo) normally
stay within the boundaries of the park and would not be affected by the
project. However, concern was expressed in 1965 that the gravity proposal
then being considered by the MOI would interfere with the migration of four
species; tiang (Damaliscus korrigum); roan antelope (Hlippotragus equinus);
giraffe; and ostrich. Two further immigrant species, Sommering Gazelle and
Singa Gazelle, were not thought to be threatened since they migrate north-
eastwards to Butana area.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
25.       In 1967, the Mlinistry of Planning asked UNDP to provide a wildlife
expert to review the problem. His report, and subsequent studies by the
Game Department and resident UNDP experts emphasized that the problem was
related to the supply canal from Roseires Dam to the Rahad and not to the
irrigated area itself. There was general agreement that the best solution
was to move the supply canal as far north as possible since alternative
solutions (bridges 300 m wide every 10 km; broad, shallow reaches in the
canal) would be very expensive, or impractical.
26.       The design of the present project moves the supply canal almost
100 km north of the old route where it will pose no threat to game. While
the area through which it passes is not densely populated there is much
movement of people, especially along the railway, and any wild animals which
penetrated so far north would be hunted for food.
Aerial Spraying
27.       Irrigated schemes in the Sudan provide an ideal habitat for crop
pests. Since the earliest days of the Gezira scheme, crop hygiene methods
have been adopted to try to reduce carry-over of pests from one year to the
next. Cotton planting dates have been prescribed by law -and weeds which are
alternative hosts have been destroyed. Serious attempts to control pests
by spraying were started in the 1950's. Tractor-mounted sprayers were only
moderately successful, causing much damage to the crop and being unable to
work on newly-irrigated fields.
23.       In the mid-1950's, experiments had been made with helicopter
spraying and, by the early 1960's fixed wing spraying aircraft were in general
use on all government, and most private, schemes. The Plant Protection
Department's small fleet of aircraft is used mainly for training and special
tasks such as water hyacinth control. Spraying of cotton and wheat is done
by contractors, mostly from Europe. Ground equipment is deployed in August
and the aircraft arrive in mid-September when the unchangina, perfect flying
conditios permit very high utilization of equipment.
29.       Much research has been done on the use of different insecticides.
i)uring the 1970/71 season in Gezira, the basic regime was five applications
of DDT and/or Dimethoate. Various other formulations were used in selected
areas, e.g. DDT and/or Endosulfan; Sevin-Anthio; DDT and/or Bidrin. Some
areas received eight applications.
30.       Because spraying has been the general practice for nearly two
decades, it is difficult to assess the reductions in yield and quality that
would occur if the practice were stopped. However, an indication is given
by the results of large scale trials of different insecticides in the Gezira

31.       It is certain that cotton would not be profitable in the Sudan
without chemical pest control and that aerial spraying will continue until
satisfactory alternatives, such as biological control, have been fully
proven. Widespread spraying entails inevitable long-term risks but the
chances of accidental short-term exposure are reduced by several factors.
The contractors personnel are highly experienced: their equipment is well
maintained and both air and ground crews are adequately protected. Since
all tenants live in villages, the Block Inspectors are able to ensure that
nobody is in the fields during spraying. Under the terms of the contracts,
aircraft must fly 2-3 meters above the crop, minimizing drift. Finally,
during the spraying there is no drainage at all from the fields and thus
little chance that chemicals will find their way into the river.
32.       So long as chemical control is necessary, aircraft are the safest,
as well as the most efficacious method of spraying. A very large number of
tractor-mounted sprayers would be needed to obtain equivalent coverage, thus
increasing the personnel exposed to hazard. Further, since the high-volume
tractor sprayers are filled directly from canals, there would be a greatly
increased risk of contaminating the water supply by spillage. Knapsack
sprayers would involve unacceptable risks, not only because the operators
clothes would be saturated by spillage but also because supplies of insecticide
would have to be distributed in advance to each tenant and there would be
no control over its use.
D. Aflatoxin on Groundnuts
33.       Importers of groundnuts are now well aware of the dangers
associated with aflatoxin, a substance produced by the common fungus
Aspergillus flavus. UNDP financed a study of Aflatoxin in the Sudan during
the 1969/70 harvest season. Contrary to expectations, it was found that
there was a higher level of contamination in samples from rain lands than in
artificially dried samples from irrigated areas. The critical factor in
development of the fungus is proper drying of the nuts during the first week
after harvest. In the past the normal practice on the Gezira scheme has been
to irrigate the fields just before harvest, to soften the soil, and to wash
the harvested nuts in canals to remove mud. The practice makes proper drying
difficult. In the Rahad project groundnuts would be harvested by machine,
eliminating the need for pre-irrigation and washing and it is not expected
that Aflatoxin will be a serious problem.

RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
The Project Works
A. General Description
1.        The project is the development of irrigated agriculture on a net
area of 300,000 fed on the east bank of the Rahad river (Map 1). The area
is presently a clay desert with some scrub and small trees. The project would
be implemented and operated by a semi-autonomous authority (the Rahad Corpora-
tion). It would involve the construction of all irrigation distribution and
drainage facilities, agricultural processing equipment and storage facilities,
and the settlement of some 13,700 tenants (70,000 people) with the necessary
infrastructure. Studies and preliminary engineering would be made for Stage
II of the project, which is expected to cover 520,000 fed to the east of
the present project.
B. The Irrigation Works
Supply Canal
2.        Water would be pumped from the Blue Nile at Meina, some 200 km down-
stream from Roseires. The pumps, total capacity 105 m3/sec, would be elect-
rically operated with power from Roseires hydro-electric station transmitted
across the Nile from a substation at Singha. The sub-station and transmission
line would be undertaken by CEWC, and subject to ICB. The maximum head would
be 17 m in February and the minimum would be 10 m in October, the peak
demand month. The 84km supply canal, with a capacity of 105 m3/sec, would
cross the Dinder river in a 200 m long siphon and would be provided with 10
bridges (including a railway bridge) and adequate cross drainage structures.
The supply canal would terminate at an outfall on the Rahad river, water would
flow six kilometers downstream before being diverted by a 50m long concrete
and masonry barrage with nine gates to control water level and pass floods,
and a 35m wide head regulator into the project main canal (100 m3/sec). All
work on pumping station, supply canal structures and Rahad Barrage would be
designed and supervised by consultants and would be subject to ICB. The
excavation for the supply canal would be carried out by the MOI, but the
consultant would review and approve designs.
Distribution, Drainage and Roads
3.        The irrigation distribution and drainage system is shown in IIap 2.
The main canal, with a capacity of 100 m3/sec and about 140 km long, would feed



ANNEX 4
Page 2
the project night storage distribution network through an appropriate system of
regulators, controls and unlined major and minor canals. Figures 1 and 2
show the arrangement for field irrigation and drainage for tenants' plots.
A surface drainage system emptying into the Rahad river would be provided to
remove excess rainfall and irrigation water. Cross drainage would be included
on the main canal and main drains would be designed with sufficient capacity
to accommodate anticipated drainage from Stage II. A farm network of graded
earth roads would follow the canal system, culvert pipes being included in
irrigation control structures and bridges being built over the major canals.
Apart from the main canal regulators, all control structures would be
constructed from standard drawings. MOI would design and construct the
distribution system, but the consultant would approve designs for the main
canal. The system would be completed at the rate of 100,000 fed per year.
Materials
4.        Structural steel and plate for fabrication of regulator gates and
piped controls in the distribution system would be purchased by ICB. Fabri-
cation would be also through ICB, with the local manufacturers receiving pre-
ference.
Equipment and Vehicles
5.        MOI equipment, much of it purchased from non-member countries,
would be used for all excavation work. Some additional equipment and vehicles
needed to execute the work would be procured by MOI after ICB.
Buildings
6.        The project includes all the offices and houses necessary for the
Corporation's staff to execute and operate the project, in all about 1,500
buildings. The project headquarters, close to the project main canal, would
include the Corporation's head office, workshops, ginneries, some of the
decorticators, storage, staff housing and facilities.
7.        There would be three administrative Groups and irrigation subdivi-
sions, constructed in a phased program to keep pace with settlement. Build-
ings at project headquarters, groups and subdivisions would be subject to ICB
and the consultant would certify payments.
8.        There would be nine administrative Blocks 1/ and irrigation
sections spread over the area.  These would also be subject to ICB but because
they are scattered in space and time, would most likely be awarded to local
contractors. The pumphouse colony would be included in this category.
1/   Actually three block headquarters would be built alongside group head-
quarters for centralization.



ANNEX 4

Services and Utilities
9.        Electric Power.  Electric power to project headquarters, the ginneries
and the Group areas would be supplied from Roseires hydro-electric station via
a substation near Wad Medani and a 33 kv transmission line. The length of this
capacity line is limited to 60 km from the substation, which is a constraint
on the siting of project headquarters and the ginneries. The sub-station
and transmission line would be undertaken by CEWC and subject to ICB. Power
distribution would be included in ICB contracts for buildings.
10.       Water Supply. All buildings constructed for the Corporation would
be provided with water supply. Tube-wells would be installed in the northern
part of the project where suitable aquifers occur. Elsewhere small filtering
plants would be erected and water drawn from the irrigation canals. Water
supply would be included in ICB contracts for buildings.
11.       Road and Bridge to Project Headquarters.  Under bilateral aid the
Chinese are designing and building a new tarmac road from Wad Medani to
Gedaref, crossing the project area north of Jebel Fau (Map 2). To facilitate
communication and transportation of crops and supplies, the project would
provide a tarmac spur road from Project Headquarters to this road, which
would include a bridge over the Rahad. This work would be included in the
supply canal contract.
12.       Communications.  A system of telephone communications would be
installed throughout the project area and to the pumphouse for irrigation
control purposes. The materials would be procured ,after ICB but installation
would be through local arrangements.
C. Agricultural Equipment, Vehicles and Processing Facilities
Equipment and Vehicles
13.       Agricultural equipment for land levelling, ploughing, and ridging,
planting, harvesting groundnuts and other necessary farming operations and the
vehicles needed for agricultural and irrigation staff would be procured
through ICB. Special arrangements would be made for specific farm implements
that have been found to work well in the soils of Sudan.
Processing Facilities
14.       Five saw ginneries with a capacity of 20 bales per hour each and
the necessary receiving yards and ancillary equipment would be provided at
project headquarters. Eighteen groundnut decorticators with a capacity of two
tons per hour each, would be installed in various centres throughout the pro-
ject area. Four 100 m x 40 m warehouses would be constructed in the project
area to store baled cotton awaiting shipment to Port Sudan. Four similar
warehouses would be constructed at Port Sudan to take care of baled cotton
storage needs whilst awaiting shipment. Stores would also be constructed for



ANNEX 4
Page 4
fertilizers and pesticides both at Project headquarters and over the project
area. Gins, decorticators and warehouse materials would be procured after
ICB and warehouse construction would be included under ICB.
Light Railway
15.       A light railway, totalling 220 km, would provide transport for crops
and supplies. Materials, locomotives, wagons and signalling equipment would
be procured after ICB and construction would be included under ICB.
Public Health
16.       Scattered throughout the project area there would be about 60 new
villages to accommodate the tenants and their families. Each village would
contain about 1,200 people. Each family would be given materials valued at
about ESd 20 to construct houses. Essential public health facilities would
be included. Materials for village water supplies -- mostly tube-well
materials, pumps and motors -- would be purchased under ICB and the instal-
lation would be carried out under the Ministry of Rural Development. A
central hospital at Project headquarters with clinics in each block would
be included under ICB. Molluscicides and larvicides would be provided for
control of schistosomiasis and malaria.
Settlement, Seed Production and Research
17.       Settlement.   Tenant farmers would be allowed to lease 24 fed,
each on permanent basis, provided they farmed the land efficiently in accord-
ance with the Corporation's timetable of crops. The project would include the
clearance of bush and levelling of land where necessary. Initially, the crops
would be grown in the "Gezira type" arrangement. The tenants would have their
24 fed divided in six plots to produce a six crop rotation of cotton,
groundnuts, cotton, groundnuts, cotton, fallow. The irrigation layout would
allow for a ready conversion to long furrow (280 m) planting. Tenants would
be settled at the rate of 100,000 fed a year and both irrigation construc-
tion and the building and staffing program would be phased to this rate of
development. Farmers would receive food during their first year from the
World Food Program. The Corporation would provide, by the mechanical opera-
tions, for all cultivation of the land, including land planning, harrowing,
dry ridging and fertilizing, planting of cotton and groundnuts, green ridging,
spraying, harvesting of groundnuts and blading of cotton stalks after picking.
18.       Seed Production and Research.   A seed multiplication farm would be
operated by the Corporation in the project area to supply good quality seeds.
A research farm would be established in the area to investigate agronomic
problems, such as feasibility of long furrow irrigation, alternative planting
dates, pre-emergent herbicides, and mechanical cotton picking.
Consultants
19.       Consultants would be provided in the project to take full responsi-
bility for the design and construction, supervision of the pumping station,

including electrical supply, supply canal structures and the Rahad barrage,
ginneries, decorticators and their electrical supply, road to HQ and bridges,
light railway, equipment and vehicles, housing and materials under ICB; to
give technical advice in the design and location of the supply canal and pro-
ject main canal; and to give advice as required on the remainder of the project.
Terms of Reference are given in Annex 8.
Feasibility Study
20.       Consultants would also be provided for a feasibility study for a
futute project, including a detailed analysis of the optimum use of the
remaining Roseires waters. This study would also cover the effects and desira-
bility of heightening the Roseires dam. Brief draft terms of reference are
included at the end of Annex 8.

RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
Board/Tenant Relationships in the Gezira Scheme 1/
1.        Before the early 1900's, the semi-nomadic peoples of the Gezira
region eked out a precarious subsistence tending migratory herds and flocks
and growing dura during the very short rainy season. The development of
the Gezira Scheme completely changed the way of life of everybody in the
area: landowners -- although having "rights" to tenancies -- found them-
selves with far less land; farmers had to accept a tore settled life. Above
all, everyone had to be taught to grow irrigated crops, especially the cotton
on which the finances of the Scheme depended, and to take special and arduous
measures to combat the pests and diseases which menaced the crop during the
first decade. The new way of life created novel needs (such as sacking for
the produce, tools, the services of the ploughs sections, etc.) and a com-
plete system for handling supplies. The change to a money economy necessi-
tated the establishment of a system of accounts for each farm and arrange-
ments for making and accounting for cash payments.
2.        The nature of the irrigation scheme, with its inherent restraints
upon individual freedom of action, dictated that these changes must be
made abruptly; there was no time for long training courses for farmers nor
even for the staff. The Sudan Plantations Syndicate, therefore, introduced
a centralized system of control, issuing detailed instructions for th,e
conduct of business by its staff'and work schedules for the farmers. The
Syndicate's field staff were responsible for ensuring, by a subtle blend
of persuasion, discipline, and legally-enforced sanctions, that the farmers
and their laborers carried out correctly the field work on cotton.
3.        It may be doubted whether the Scheme could have survived th,e
catastrophies of the 1930's without such a system of centralized control and
enforceable restraints. Nevertheless, the system has many drawbacks and
its success (whether measured in financial or human terms) is a great
tribute to the skill, tact, and devotion of the staff of the Syndicate and
later of the Sudan Gezira Board.
4.        The pros and cons of the system have been widely debated, but
profound changes would hardly have been feasible until recent years. The
system was essential in the early years, during the period of rapid expansion
and also allowed to overcome the difficulties of the 1930's. The lack of

staff prevented any innovations during and after the War. During the 1950's
and early 1960's the introduction of modern techniques (fertilizers,
spraying, etc.) and the rapid expansion of area in the Managil Extension
again demanded close supervision of farm work and increased the workload
of the administration.
5.        But, if profound changes have not been possible, there has
certainly been evolution both in the organization and in tenant/Board
relations. Most striking is the policy of devolution, initiated by the
Syndicate and pursued with great vigor by the Board, aimed at "the stimula-
tion of a sense of agricultural and civic responsibility among their
tenants, the training of samads and assisting members of such bodies as
the village councils in the performance of their duties." 1/
The Block Inspector System
6.        The irrigation area is divided into twelve Groups (six each in
Gezira Main and Managil) ranging in size from about 120,000 to about 180,000
fed. These, in turn, are divided into Blocks of about 20,000 - 30,000
fed; there are 91 Blocks, 47 in Gezira Main and 44 in Managil. 2/
7.        Each Group is supervised by a Group Inspector, but there is little
delegation of power and his duties are mainly those of supervision and
coordination of the work of Block Inspectors. The Block Inspector, who is
assisted on the agricultural side by field inspectors and samads, and in
routine administration work by accountants and clerks, is responsible to
the Board for virtually everything which is happening in his Block. This
Annex is concerned specifically with his agricultural work and relations
with the farmers, local Government, etc. Only passing reference is made
to his administrative duties (which are discussed in Chapter 2), but it
must be stressed that the basic operational rules of the Board 3/ lay down
categorically the manner in which he carries out these routine duties
and he is compelled to undertake personally a great number of office tasks
that sometimes make it difficult for him to take any direct part in field
work.

9.        Obviously, the area served and the number of farmers with whom
they are in contact differ widely from case to case; in particular, there
are differences between the Gezira Main (where many of the 40-fed tenancies
have been split into 20-fed units) and in Managil (with 15-fed tenancies).
The following table illustrates this point:

10.       The background of the inspectors varies considerably.  A number of
them were schoolmasters before joining the Board; many were appointed as
accountants and later transferred to the Inspectorate; yet others came from
various government agencies. The mission was informed that less than 30
had graduated from the normal course at Shambat Institute for Agriculture.
11.       Although the Gezira Scheme Act of 1960 indicates that the employees
of the Scheme are not civil servants, when the mission was in the Sudan,
there seemed to be a certain degree of discontent among the Inspectorate,
who seek benefits identical with those of established civil servants. The
recently approved increase in salaries may do something to alleviate this
feeling.
The Duties of the Inspectorate
12.       There is a high degree of centralization in the management of the
Scheme. At present many directives on both agricultural and other matters
are sent from central headquarters directly to Block Inspectors. Group
Inspectors and their assistants act mainly as supervisors and coordinators:
staff and financial matters occupy much of their time. The Block Inspectors'
many tasks and duties fall into four broad categories:
(a) He is responsible for the preparation of the agricul-
tural program for his Block and for the supervision
of its execution. This covers all farming activities,
from the preparation of routine and emergency water
indents and supervision of gaffirs, through the organiza-
tion of common services such as ploughing, fertilizing



ANNEX 13
Page 5
and spraying to the drawing up of programs for hand work
on the crops. Last but not least, he is required to
inspect the progress of all cotton crops.  In this latter
work, especially, he is assisted by the Junior Inspectors
and, at the lowest level, by the samads whose functions
are discussed later in this chapter.  The Block ½nspector
is required to give priority to the cotton crop in all
his work and, If other methods fail, he is required to
apply sanctions against farmers whose work does not rea,ch
the necessary standards. Block Inspectors can impose
fines for certain types of offence (such as allowing
irrigation water to flood roads) or can use toulba
labor 1/ to cultivate neglected fields. He can also
warn farmers who continually neglect their farm and, if
this is to no avail, can initiate action (through the
Board and the Provincial Commissioner) to apply the
ultimate sanction - reduction of holding or eviction. A
further sanction, the witholding of irrigation water from
the tenants' own crops of dura, etc. exists; so far as
the Mission could ascertain this sanction is now seldom
if ever applied but the threat of its existence is a sore
point in tenant/Inspector relations and its abolition has
been advocated bv the Mission (Chapter 5 of the Main Report).
(b)  He is responsible for the administration of the Block and
devotes much of his time ta writing routine reports on
everything from crop prospects to car mileage, to the
keeping of records, to the custody of stores, and to many
other routine matters. Above all, he is responsible for
keeping accounts of all types and for disbursing cash.
Although the junior inspectors take some part in this
routine, and every block has at least one clerk and
accountant, the final responsibility (especially for
cash) lies with the Block Inspector who is thus compelled
to undertake personally many office tasks.
(c) He is responsible for devolution (see below) and for social
welfare 2/ in his block. This involves many time-consuming
obligations towards Village, Block and Rural Councils
1 / Toulba: the Inspector employs labor to undertake work in the! farmer's
field and charges the actual cost to the farmer's account. Toulba
labor may be more expensive and less efficient than that hired and
supervised by the farmer himself, so that the cost of the operation
is usually inereased.
2/   The terms of service signed by Inspectors state, inter alia, that
"active support of the Board's policy on devolution and social develop-
ment is an essential part of the official duties".



ANNEX 13
Page 6
and towards institutions such as cooperative societies and
the Farmers' Union as well as day-to-day dealings with
farmers.  The Board's policy of intensification and diversi-
fication, by introducing situations for which there are
no precedents, has greatly added to the time needed for
this phase of the Inspector's work.
(d) He is supposed to personally supervise a certain number of
tenants (usually over about 800 feddans) but he rarely
has time to give enough attention to this task.
(e)  He is responsible for helping and sometimes for the direct
supervision of staff from other sections of the Scheme
management or from outside bodies (Plant Protection and
Research Divisions of the Ministry, University, etc.) who
are working in his block.
13.       The Field Inspectors, or Junior Inspectors, are the assistants of
the Block Inspectors. Allowing for leave reserves, special assignments, etc.
there is an average of two Field Inspectors per Block, each having contact
with an average of about 375 farmers.
14.       The Block Inspector is physically incapable of carrying out the
various tasks allotted to him as well as maintaining contact with farmers.
The actual extent to which he delegates his tasks to Field Inspectors
depends on his personality and interests. Some may ask Field Inspectors
to carry out a large proportion of routine office work; others ask juniors
to maintain close contact with farmers. The latter is more common and,
in general, it is the Field Inspectors who deal with the day-to-day agricul-
tural and social problems of farmers and samads. This contact is, increas-
ingly, confined to maintaining supervision over the more negligent farmers
only.
Local Government
15.       At one time the Scheme management was the ultimate authority for
most matters within the irrigation area but, even before nationalization,
the official policy has been to devolve progressively responsibility to
local institutions.
16.       The Scheme lies entirely within the Blue Nile Province, whose
administration consists of a Commissioner (the representative of the
Government of the Republic of the Sudan) and a Province Council including,
in 1965, 60 members, of whom 36 are elected. The Province Council, deriving
its powers from the Council of Ministers, can make laws, levy taxes, approve
budgets and carry out public works and is responsible for carrying out
the policies of the Government of the Republic.
17.       The Province Council delegates many of its powers, especially the
assessment and collection of taxes, local services, etc., to 18 Rural



ANNEX 13
Page 7
Councils. In other areas, Rural Councils finance their operations from
taxes on land or crops but the seven councils located in the Gezira area
receive a grant-in-aid from the Board. 1/ Other sources of revenue
include house, animal and education taxes and various fees and licences
but within the scheme the Board's grant is about 50Z of their total revenue
(e.g. ESd 520,248 out of ES 1,089,478 in 1964/5).,
18.       The Board's devolution policy has led to the creation of ovrer
585 Village Councils. These are considered as a step towards the ultimate
aim of villagers assuming responsibility for many of their own affairs,
and not as an end in themselves. Thus, logically, they are divided into
different categories reflecting the civic awareness of the villagers and
the council's record of achievement:
(a)  The Class I Village Councils have been given statutory
powers by warrant from the Rural Council, and are thus
often called Warranted Councils. One-third of the
members are nominated after consultation with the Group
Inspector but the majority are elected (1% of the village
population up to a maximum of six members). Each Council
hais an Agricultural Committee which is encouraged to
accept responsibility "... so that in the end they can
competently manage most of their own agricultural affairs,
the long term view being that the field inspector will
very gradually shed his role as direct controller and
emerge as a coordinator and adviser". 2/
(b) The Class II Agricultural Councils do not receive any
delegation of powers from the Rural Council and their
monthly meetings serve mainly as a forum for discussion
of agricultural and other local problems and as a source
of recommendations and requests to the Block Inspector
on the one hand and to the Rural Council on the other.
Minor fines and sanctions against farmers are invariably
discussed by the Council but they cannot themselves impose
any penalty and can merely recommend or endorse action
by the Block Inspector.
(c)  The Class III Councils, or Councils of Elders, represent
the traditional authority in certain villages:  their
power is confined to advising the Block Inspector on the
allocation of tenancies.
1/   The Rural Councils in the Gezira area are Meilig, Meheiriba, Hassa-
Reissa, Medina, Hoah, Managil and Northern White Nile (part only). The
grants-in-aid are provided by the 2% of the proceeds of the cotton crop
allocated to "Local Government".

Block Councils
19.       The Rural and Village Councils, although primarily administrative,
serve as an important channel of communication between the Government,
the Scheme and the people, and vice versa.
20.       As has been seen, the Inspectorate plays an active role in their
affairs, but the Block Council is a potentially more important channel for
purely agricultural matters. The Block Council is presided over by the
Block Inspector and has 18 to 20 representatives of the Village Councils
in the area. It is a consultative group whose prime function is to provide
for exchange of experience and information. Like the Village Councils,
they are a two-way channel of communication:  on the one hand they disseminate
agricultural directions, advice and information - from government as well
as from the Scheme - to farmers and to such institutions as the Farmers'
Union and Cooperative Societies; on the other, they serve as a forum
for discussion of agricultural problems which affect more than one village
(e.g. the shortcomings of the local irrigation supply, the adequacy (or
otherwise) of the number of private tractors in the area, etc.).
Samads
21.       The samads are the agents of the Village Council, which appoints
them on the recommendation of the Block Inspector. They are farmers who
are chosen for the efficient way in which they have carried out the work
on their own land and they are supposed to possess the essential qualities
of persuasion and authority. They receive no special training, their
practical experience being considered sufficient for the tasks they perform.
22.       There are 1,580 samads in the Scheme, i.e., an average of about
17 to a Block. Although marked differences exist, the average samad super-
vises the work of about 50 tenancies distributed over an area of some
1,100 feddans, of which about 330 feddans are devoted to cotton growing.
The ratio of samads to the total force of inspectors is five to one,
but the ratio is seven to one if only the junior field inspectors with
whom the samad has most contact are taken into account.
23.       The samaAs are part-time workers and they draw a monthly wage of
between ESd 2.5 and £Sd 6.5 depending on the area of land which they are
required to supervise. The starting point for wage calculations is ESd 0.75
per fed, but every three months the grading of each samad is examined by the
Block Inspector who may promote him to a higher grade, demote or even discharge
him. This regular review has replaced the output bonuses that were awarded
to samads in the past and it is intended to foster a constant spirit of
competition among them. The only remnant of the bonus system is an annual
award of ESd 5 which is given every year to the best samad in each Block.
24.       The cost of the samads' wages is borne by the Scheme.  In 1965/66
the total cost was £Sd 69,710, i.e., an average of about ESd 44 per samad



ANNEX 13
Page 9
per year. Half of this expenditure is charged to the Joint Account, the
other half being a charge upon the Board's share of proceeds of the cotton
crop.
25.       Although paid by the Scheme, the samads are in theory
subordinate only to the Village Councils. Their duties include the super-
vision of the manner in which farmers cultivate their cotton, persuading
negligent farmers to take more trouble and, where necessary, proposing
to the Village Council that penalties should be imposed. In practice,
samads are the channel through which the Block Inspectors' influence may
be brought to bear on the individual farmer in the field. Their influence
can be quite effectual. During the war, the number of samads and their
range of responsibilities were increased to mitigate for the shortage of
inspectors. While production was held at a high level during the war
years, it is often said that the increased powers granted to samads at that
time had led to a certian deterioration in their relations with the
farmers.
26.       Even today, the samad is in a difficult position.  Both a part-time
worker and a farmer and member of the village, he finds it difficult to
recommend sanctions against other members of his community. Althoug]h
nominally only responsible to the Village Council, he has in fact divided
loyalties: he is employed by the Village Council but he is paid by the
Scheme and is concerned not to displease either of them. To quote a remark
heard in the Gezira, the conscientious samad may inspire more respect than
friendship, while the less strict samad may inspire more friendship than
respect.

Cotton Outlook
1.        World cotton prices are expected to decline by 10-15% from recent
high levels by the mid-seventies and perhaps by another 5% by the late
seventies.  In terms of Mexican SM 1-1/16", a representative grade of medium-
long cotton which normally accounts for more than 60% of total world cotton
output, this means a price of around 26 cents per pound, c.i.f. Liverpool, in
1970 U.S. dollars, by about 1975 and a price in the neighborhood of, 25 cents
per pound by 1980.
2.        The expected downward trend in price over the medium-term reflects
a number of assumptions: (a) that the current high prices are temporary and
reflect a demand-supply imbalance caused largely by a temporary supply
shortage; (b) that in the absence of a decline in prices production will
tend again to outpace consumption in the mid-seventies; 1/ (c) that inter-
fiber competition will continue to limit the growth of cotton consumption
but that no major breakthrough in man-made fiber technology will greatly
accelerate recent substitution trends; and (d) that price adjustments iwill
take place within the framework of a relatively freer, more competitivie
market. This in turn implies continued competition among some sixty exporting
countries (many of them heavily dependent on cotton exports); absence, in
future U.S. price support and cotton export policies, of the elements which
made that country a residual supplier in the world market and led to rseur-
ring stock accumulation in the United States; and, finally no international
cotton agreement.
3.        The present shortage of cotton was largely caused by substantial,
intentional cutbacks in U.S. acreage and low yields in the United States
and other key producing countries (e.g., Brazil). World cotton production,
which had increased at an average annual rate of 2.4% between 1955/56 and
1965/66, decline by roughly 0.7% a year during the past five seasons. Quite
suddenly, the oversupply situation which had persisted (and worsened) during
the early and mid-sixties turned into and remained one of shortage in ithe
late sixties. These changes in the demand-supply balance considerably
altered both the overall world stock position and the pattern of distr:Lbution
of cotton stocks. (see Table 1.) The price response to these changes began
1/   Available information on government plans or intentions (as supplLed
to the International Cotton Advisory Committee in June 1971) indicate
that world cotton production could exceed demand in the mid-seventies
by some 5-72.

to be felt in the second half of 1970 and fully in 1971 after world stocks
declined to less than 20 million bales. 1/ (see Table 2.)
4.        The future growth of cotton production depends not only on the
natural supply response to changes in price but also - and quite crucially -
on the cotton policies of the major producers. The United States and the
USSR account together for almost 39% of world cotton production. Their
production policies necessarily influence the growth path of world cotton
supply. In our supply projections we have assumed a "normalization" of
U.S. cotton output by 1975 to about 13 million bales (in line with U.S.
stated intentions and current policies) and total output of about 11 mil-
lion bales in the Soviet Union (again in line with its expansion plans).
The combined output share of the two countries would therefore remain the
same as during the past five seasons. Although in a number of producing
countries - especially those where cotton competes with other cash crops
and the planting decision is influenced by expected relative profitability -
the price elasticity of supply seems to be rising and approaching unity,
the policy decisions of the two major producers are bound to affect signi-
ficantly the future demand-supply balance. Should the U.S. cotton output
remain around the 10-11 bales of the past three seasons and the USSR out-
put stabilize at 10 million bales, the 1975 projected surplus situation
would turn, other things being equal, into one of rough demand-supply equi-
librium. Cotton prices (always in terms of Mexican SM 1-1/16", c.i.f.
Liverpoo., in 1970 U.S. dollars) would probably be in 1975 around 28 cents
a pound. The ceteris paribus assumption is justified on two grounds: (a)
world consumption growth is expected to be slow and producers' expectations
are not very bullish; and (b) within the projected cost of production struc-
ture, producers are likely to remain quite sensitive to small changes in
cotton prices in either direction. Both cost of production and supply elas-
ticities analyses indicate that the critical supply price range is likely
to remain between 26 and 29 cents per pound for SM 1-1/16", c.i.f. Liverpool.
5.        Cbnsumption growth uncertainties highlight another sensitive
point in the forecast. World cotton consumption is projected to grow at an
average annual rate of 1.6% during the next ten years. Even this modest
growth rate of cotton consumption presupposes some further improvement in
the quality composition of cotton and progress in promotional activity and,
furthermore, that no new breakthrough in the production of man-made fibers
would occur - and lead to a faster substitution of cotton with man-made
(especially synthetic) fibers.  Cotton consumption did in fact slow down
considerably in the last sixties and grew at a very modest average annual
rate of 0.8% between 1966/67 and 1970/71. (see Table 1.) This compares
the average annual growth of 2.2% of the preceding 11 years. The declining
trend in cotton utilization in developed countries since the mid-sixties -
largely due to greater competition from man-made (especially non-cellulosic)
fibers - was less than fully compensated for by increased consumption in
developing and centrally planned countries. Competition from synthetic
_/  World cotton stocks declined from a peak of 30.7 million bales in
August 1971. While the desirable level of world stocks required to
maintain price stability is considered to be 5-6 months' consumption,
world stocks held in August 1971 were equivalent to little more than
four months' consumption.

substitutes, although particularly strong in industrialized countries, is
by no means restricted to these markets. In Central America, South America
and South Asia synthetic fibers have already penetrated the market and
further inroads are expected during the next decade. During the past: ten
years, while cotton's share of the world total fiber market fell from nearly
66-44%, the market share of man-made fibers increased from 29-50%. 1/^
6.        Inter-fiber competition hinges upon two main factors:  relative
prices and quality performance. Prices of man-made fibers (especially poly-
ester fibers) declined considerably in the past five years thereby moving
price parities in favor of mnn-made fibers. Recent high cotton prices,
moreover, are likely to accelerate the trend in substitution of cotton with
polyester fibers, particularly in developed countries. The quality or
product performance of man-made fibers is superior to cotton in some cru-
cial end-uses (e.g., apparel) where cotton lacks the "easy-care" properties
characteristic of synthetic fibers (alone or blended with cotton). Although
further sharp declines in the prices of the most important non-cellu:losic
fibers do not appear very likely in the short run, the possibility of in-
creased competition from these fibers still remains quite strong, givren
the technical advantages that man-made fibers have in new high-speed knitting
machines.  This could seriously affect cotton demand and slow down its growth
to a very modest 1 percent per annum over the next ten years.
7.        The projected further decline of cotton prices over the long term
is intended to guard against this possibility and implies that the weight of
assumption (d) in paragrah 2 will be fully felt by 1980.  Cotton prices are
expected to move in the late seventies towards long-term equilibrium levels
in the framework of a freer, competitive market.
8.        Actual prices for cotton in 1975 and 1980 are expected to differ
only slightly from forecast cotton prices expressed in 1970 U.S. dollars.
Inflation in developed countries in recent years seems to have had little
effect on unit costs of cotton production in development producing countries.
The cost of inputs such as fertilizers and other chemical products (e.g.,
pesticides) which are at least in part imported and account for some 20-30%
of total cost per unit of output has declined over the past ten years. 2/
The cost of imported machinery, 3/ which probably accounts for 5-10% of-total
1/   In making these market share comparisons, man-made fibers were considered
on a "cotton equivalent" basis. Only when man-made fibers' consumption
is converted into its cotton equivalent does comparison with cotton con-
sumption become meaningful. A pound of man-made fiber in fact, because
of the difference in specific gravity and processing waste, displaces
more than one pound of cotton.
2/   The U.N. unit value index of chemicals and fertilizers exported by the
developed to the developing countries declined from 109 in 1960 to 96
in 1970 (1963 = 100).
3/  In fact, as in the case of fertilizers, not all the machinery used in
cotton production is imported by developing countries from developed
countries. For lack of consistent information on this point, it is
here assumed that the cost of this factor in developing cotton produc-
ing countries is reflected by the U.N. unit value index of machinery
exported from developed to developing countries.



ANNEX 14

unit costs of cotton, increased over the same period at a rate approximately
equal to one half of the average rate of inflation in OECD countries. 1/
Analysis of costs of production developments in key cotton producing countries
indicates that cotton costs of production (and the supply price) should
increase over the next ten years at a much slower rate than the price level
in developed countries. On this basis the actual price of Mexican 1-1/16"
is forecast to be around 27.5 U.S. cents per pount by 1975 and around 19.5
U.S. cents per pound by 1980. 2/
9.        At projected equilibrium levels of demand, supply and price for
the mid-seventies, world raw cotton exports would experience a growth rate
of around 1.2% per annum between 1967-68 and 1975, although developing
countries' exports may grow at a higher rate (between 1.5 and 2.0% per
annum). Assuming that world cotton prices move in the late seventies
towards long-term equilibrium levels, world raw cotton exports may continue
to grow throughout the late seventies at approximately the same rate envisaged
for the earlier period. Export shares, however, become more difficult to
predict, given their dependence on possible future policy actions by major
producing and exporting countries such as the United States and the USSR.
10.       The export performance and prospects of individual developing
countries will continue to vary depending, inter alia, on availability of
land, trends in yields, quality and marketability of cotton grown, domestic
consumption trends and cotton textiles trade balances. Competition among
producing countries is expected to continue and small producing countries
with limited production alternatives are likely to push output and succeed
in expanding their small shares. The world market growth, however, is ex-
pexted to be a slow one throughout the seventies. Competing man-made fibers
will contint.e to exert pressure on cotton and to limit its growth. The
balance between advancements in cotton agronomy and man-made fiber technology,
although difficult to predict, is likely to remain tilted in favor of com-
peting man-made fibers.
1/  As measured by the implicit GNP deflator for OECD countries.
2/  These actual prices compare to the prices expressed in 1970 U.S. dol-
lars in our basic forecast. (See page 1).

RAHAD IRRIGATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated using export
values of commodities delivered to Port Sudan (fob less port handling costs).
These values are based on price projections cif European ports, made by the
Trade policies and Export Projection's Division, less actual 1972 shipping
costs. Export duties have not been deducted since these are a part of the
value to the,national economy. The Sudanese government expects to export
all of the production (except garden produce) from the project. Project
costs are net of import duties and surcharges, and without price escalation.
All costs are included up to the point of delivery to Port Sudan. The
following specific assumptions were made (except where otherwise stated in
the sensitivity analysis):
(a) That present production on project lands is small, con-
sisting of only scattered subsistence agriculture, and is
adequately compensated for in the analysis by including
all farm labor, including that of the tenants, in the
cost of production.
(b) That the official rate of exchange, ESd 1.00 - US$2.872,
is applicable.
(c) That one-third of the project lands can be settled and
brought into production in the fourth year and an additional
one-third each of the succeeding two years.
(d) That full projected yields will be attained for cotton in the
eight year and for groundnuts in the tenth year.
(e)  That Rahad River water will be available to the project.
(f) That the project economic life will be at least 50 years.
(g) That all taxes, surcharges, and import and export duties
are internal financial transfers and do not represent true
economic costs.
2.        Under the above assumptions, the project would have an economic
rate of return of 13.6%    The sensitivity of the project to variations in the
above assumptions was tested for those conditions which have the greater

possibility of occurrence. The project was relatively insensitive to most
variations but was moderately sensitive to commodity price variations. How-
ever, none of the variations tested resulted in an unacceptable ERR. The
results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Table 1 of this Annex.
3.        The derivation of project benefits is-shown in Tables 2 to 6.
4.        The derivation of the economic construction costs, from the cost
estimates, is shown in Table 7.
5.        The cost and benefit flows, as shown in Table 8, were used to
derive the 'tbest estimate" economic rate of return, and served as the basis
from which to vary in all sensitivity tests.

Base           Rahad R:Lver water is available to the project -
projected prices (1980) and yields of cotton and
groundnuts - exchange rate of LSd 1.00 = US$2.872.-
costs are without escalation - costs of Ministry of
Irrigation equipment and overhead included.              13.60
1:            Same as Base, except Rahad River water assumed not
available - pumping costs are LSd 320,000 per year
at full development - pump replacements are
LSd 10,000 per year more.                                12.90
2:            Same as Base, except part of the costs of Roseires
Dam are included as sunk costs.                          12.10
3:            Sahdow price local construction labor and all
0 & M labor at zero, and off-peak crop production
labor at 50%.                                            16.20
4:            Vary prices of commodities produced;
A. Prices 10% above Base analysis                        16.20
B. Prices 10% below Base analysis.                       10.40
5:            Vary yields - costs of production varied accord-
ingly:
A. Yields 10% above Base.                                14.80
B. Yields 10% below Base.                                11.50
6:.           Delay start of benefits, with no recovery to Base
schedule - some accompanying stretch-out of costs:
A. Delay of 1 year                                       12.90
B.  Delay of 2 years                                     11.40
7:            Combination of adverse effects: 1 year delay in
start of benefits; 10% decrease in prices of
commodities; and 10% increase in capital costs.           8.90
