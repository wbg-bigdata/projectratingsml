SANTA CRUZ WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMN.IRY
Borrower:            The Republic of Bolivia
Beneficiary:         Servicios de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado de Santa Cruz
(SAGUAPAC)
Amount:              US$9.0 million
Terms:               Standard
Relending Terms:    20 years including 5 years of grace at 0.75% per annum
during the grace period and 7.9% per annum thereafter.
After the grace period, SAGIJAPAC will effectively pay
the Borrower 5% per annum and retain the remaining 2.9%
per annum as a grant to capitalize a revolving fund for
in-house plumbing and lot lines.
Project
Description:         The project would (i) help :improve the health and sanitary
conditions of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra by pro-
viding water supply services to about 108,000 inhabitants
and sewerage facilities to about 66,000 inhabitants, about
one-third of whom are expected to be the urban poor; and
(ii) strengthen SAGUAPAC's management, organization and
planning capacity. The project consists of: (a) expan-
sion of the water supply system comprising the cornstruction
of a pumping station of about 300 liters per second
capacity in the northeast wellfield of the city and instal-
lation of about 200 kilometers of distribution lines and
about 20,000 metered connections; (b) the expansion of the
sanitary sewer system including the construction of a sewer
treatment plant with about 25 hectares of oxidation ponds
and associated pumping station and emissary, construction
of about 4,450 meters of trunk sewer and installation of
60 kilometers of sewer lines and lateral sewers and
about 10,000 new house connections; (c) installation of
in-house plumbing and lot lines; (d) data processing
and laboratory and communications equipment and vehicles
needed for (a) and (b) above; and (e) technical assistance
for determining the future major sources of water supply
for Santa Cruz, improving SAGUAPAC's organization, manage-
ment and planning and the training of SAGUAPAC's staff.
The works to be built are technically simple and offer
limited risks. Financial risks are minimized by the commit-
ment by the Santa Cruz Development Corporation to provide
its share of the project cost, and the Government's approval
of SAGUAPAC's new tariff and revenue package.

-2-
1969/71, when political instability led to declining private investment and
deteriorating public finances. The deterioration of public finances reflected
a structural problem in the economy. Bolivia's public sector is proportionately
one of the largest in South America and a source of livelihood for a sizeable
segment of the population. With scarce employment opportunities in the
private sector, pressures to expand public employment proved difficult to
resist. Large expenditures on wages and salaries, combined with a weak tax
system, have limited the resources available for public investment. Moreover,
the inability of the public sector to generate adequate savings limited its
capacity to utilize available external capital assistance effectively.
5.        From mid-1971 to mid-1978, political stability and the Government's
encouragement of private sector investment raised hopes for a more rapid pace
of economic development. In addition, during the early 1970s Bolivia's
exports of petroleum increased considerably, and it was generally expected
that this upward trend would continue in the future. Public investment and
external lending decisions were largely based on this expectation which seemed
reasonable at the time. The Government launched an ambitious public investment
program financed largely through external borrowing, expecting to have no
difficulty servicing the loans out of future petroleum revenues. Petroleum
exports began to decline, however, in 1975, because of insufficient output in
the face of rapidly rising internal demand. Through 1976 this decline was
largely offset by increased exports of natural gas to Argentina, but in 1977
petroleum exports dropped to a point where current earnings from all hydro-
carbon exports declined. At the end of 1978 petroleum exports came to a
virtual halt. As a result, Bolivia has become even more dependent on exports
of minerals, mainly of tin.
6.        Since most of the ongoing public investment projects were initiated
when petroleum prospects seemed favorable, they cannot now be stopped without
economic loss. The Government has therefore tried to make up the export
shortfall through additional external borrowing. As a consequence, Bolivia's
public debt outstanding and disbursed increased rapidly; the end-1978 estimate
is US$1.8 billion. As a result of increased borrowing from commercial banks
and suppliers, the structure of the external debt has worsened; the grant
element of new loans fell from 40% in 1974 to 16% in 1978.
Recent Economic Performance and Prospects
7.        The Bolivian economy is going through a very difficult phase.  The
overall public deficit has increased from about 1% of GDP in 1974 to 11-12% in
1978. The current account deficit of the balance of payments has widened from
5.3% of GDP in 1974 to 8.4% in 1978. 1/ During the last two years, the rate
of GDP growth has been declining and the rate of inflation has been acceler-
ating. According to the La Paz consumer price index (the only official price
index in Bolivia), prices increased by 10% in 1978; estimates made by the
Central Bank indicate an inflation rate of about 19%. Indications are that
the rate of inflation has been increasing further in 1979. The new Government
1/   These figures are but orders of magnitude because the statistics on
which they are based suffer from considerable error, but they are
indicative of a serious deterioration.



is expected to take measures in order to bring the rate of inflation down to
an average of about 15% over the next years, the same as the average during
1970-1977.
8.        The service on external debt now absorbs about 30% of exports of
goods and services. This ratio cannot be expected to improv, during the next
few years and will probably fluctuate around 35%, an undesirable figure for a
country so dependent on a single export, tin, which is characterized by wide
fluctuations in demand and price. The country's balance-of-payments prospects
are not encouraging for the immediate future.  The volume of mineral exports
has been stagnating and even with production-stimulating changes in mining
taxes no sharp increase in volume is to be expected during 1979 and 1980.
However, a more favorable environment for private mining enterprises, modern-
ization investment in the Bolivian Mining Corporation, and greater exploration
efforts could bring about substantial increases in output and exports in the
medium term. Non-traditional exports account for a small share of all exports
and while encouragement is also required in this area, favorable effects will
only affect exports significantly in the longer term.
9.        Bolivia's most promising export potential lies in natural gas.
Exports to Argentina are expected to increase as additional pumps begin to
operate on the pipeline during 1979. The construction of a natural gas pipe-
line to Brazil could improve Bolivia's balance-of-payments position substan-
tially. A letter of intent has been signed by the Bolivian and Brazilian
Governments, laying down the principles regarding the pipeline. While further
studies are required to prove the existence of sufficient gas reserves, once
this is done the way would be open for an increase in total exports in the
order of 25-30% in the mid-1980s. The petroleum situation is less clear;
exports cannot be expected to resume on a substantial scale before additional
reserves are confirmed.
10.       In sum, while Bolivia's medium-term export prospects are moderately
favorable if efforts are made to promote them, it is difficult to see much
scope for improvement during the next two to three years. The vagaries of
international mineral prices will continue to have a decisive effect on the
country's export earnings during that time.
11.       The main internal cause of financial strain is the weak position
of the principal state enterprises. Foremost among them is the State Petro-
leum Corporation (YPFB), whose finances have been damaged by the Government
policy to maintain domestic prices of petroleum products at a fraction of
the world market level. Since YPFB is also one of the largest taxpayers
in Bolivia, its financial weakness is reflected in Central Government revenue
shortfalls. Other state corporations such as COMIBOL, which owns and operates
the country's major mines, and ENAF, the State Smelting Corporation, which has
embarked on a large-scale investment effort, have large overall deficits
caused by considerable investment expenditures, low productivity and/or
inappropriate wage policies, rather than depressed prices. The financial
situation of the railroads has deteriorated because of the severe damage
resulting from the recent floods. As noted above, because many of these
investments are already well advanced, it is unrealistic to expect a drastic
decline in expenditure in less than two to three years; nor would such a
decline be rational when many projects are expected to show satisfactory rates



- 4 -
of return once they are completed. As on-going investment projects are
gradually completed it should become possible to reduce the amounts spent and
to bring public investment into line with the country's public savings and
export capacity.
12.       A new Government is scheduled to take office in August 1979.  The
present administration considers itself a caretaker; this is the main reason
why some of the remedial actions that the present financial situation requires
have not been taken yet. The administration is fully aware of the seriousness
of the situation and has outlined elements of a stabilization program aimed at
reducing the public deficit, narrowing down the balance-of-payments deficit
on current account, and restricting external borrowing. The major measures
contemplated are a much needed increase in the domestic price of petroleum
products and a series of tax and tariff adjustments. For the reasons outlined
above, and because of the temporary character of the present Government,
significant improvement cannot be expected before late summer at the earliest.
13.       Bolivia's creditworthiness for lending on conventional terms is
limited at present. Emphasis should be given to projects in the hydrocarbon
sector with a clearly identifiable effect on production for export. Because
of the need to improve Bolivia's debt management--and the reluctance of commer-
cial lenders to increase their exposure in the country--Bolivia will have to
limit its foreign borrowing to priority projects and make maximum use of soft-
term lending from international and bilateral institutions to get through
the difficult next two or three years. We are following economic developments
very closely and are engaged in a detailed and frank dialogue with the Bolivian
authorities with a view to assisting them during the difficult situation.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOLIVIA
14.       Although Bolivia is an original member of the Bank, it did not obtain
any Bank Group financing until 1964. Because of Bolivia's restricted capacity
to service external debt, Bank Group financing was, except for a US$23.25
million Gas Pipeline loan, exclusively on IDA terms until Bolivia started to
export small quantities of natural gas and petroleum. In view of promising
prospects for rapid expansion, Bolivia was graduated from IDA in 1975. In
1978, however, it became apparent that the expectations of large petroleum
exports, and with it dynamic economic development, would not materialize.
Starting with the Ulla Ulla rural development project, financed in equal
shares on Bank and IDA terms, Bolivia was made a blend country. Bolivia's
economic situation has deteriorated significantly since then; petroleum
production has declined and the country is expected to become a net importer
in the near future. Development is still seriously constrained by the dual
structure of the economy; a large part of the population continues to live
in extreme poverty. Limited creditworthiness and low per capita income
qualify Bolivia for IDA eligibility. To date, the Bank and IDA have approved
23 operations (10 credits and 12 loans and one blend operation) for Bolivia
amounting to US$313.8 million, of which 8 have been fully disbursed.
15.       Bank Group lending to Bolivia has assisted in the development of
infrastructure and social sectors. In the agricultural sector (7 operations
amounting to US$45.2 million), the Bank Group has helped the Government to



- 5 -
develop a viable livestock industry, to increase agricultural production, to
improve living conditions on the Altiplano and to promote the development of
the alpaca/llama industry; efforts to strengthen the Agricultural Bank of
Bolivia have met with limited success. In the power sector, through
5 operations amounting to US$53.4 million, the Bank Group has been instrumental
in modernizing the sector, expanding electricity supply, improving the quality
of service and setting up a regulatory agency and a public power company,
which has been operated in an efficient and financially sound manner. In the
transportation sector, Bank Group assistance to the railways (3 operations
amounting to US$75.0 million of which US$3.3 million were cancelled) has
helped to improve the railways' quality of management, efficiency of operations
and financial condition; a US$23.3 million loan was made for the construction
of a gas pipeline from the Santa Cruz area to the border with Argentina;
a US$25.0 million loan for an aviation development project is assisting
Bolivia's efforts to develop hitherto isolated areas by providing safe and
efficient freight and passenger transportation; a US$25.0 million loan for a
highway maintenance project is helping Bolivia protect its investments in
highways. In the mining sector, 3 operations amounting to US$28.2 million
have aimed at increased exploration and production and improved sectoral
coordination. A US$11.5 million loan for a water supply and sewerage project,
of which US$6.3 million was cancelled as two cities withdrew from the project,
is improving services in 70 rural communities. A US$15 million loan for an
education and vocational training project is assisting Bolivia to develop its
human resources in a more effective way. A US$17 million loan is helping
Bolivia to improve the living conditions of the urban poor in the city of La Paz.
16.       Because of the narrow scope for private investment, IFC became active
in Bolivia only in 1973 through an investment of US$400,000 in a firm producing
cables and plastic products. Two IFC investments since then have contributed
to the establishment of a local market for long-term securities: an equity
participation of up to US$550,000 in Banco Industrial S.A. (BISA) in conjunc-
tion with a Bank loan of US$10.0 million for the same institution to assist in
financing medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises, and US$337,500 in
Banco Hipotecario Nacional to assist in the development of mortgage banking.
Annex II contains a summary statement of the status of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments in Bolivia as of April 30, 1979, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Bank Group lending to Bolivia during the recent past has been sup-
portive of a broadly based Government effort to expand and upgrade Bolivia's
economic and social infrastructure. Until recently, the Government had
established an excellent record in providing the required local funds; in
general, projects have been adequately carried out. However, the recent
deterioration in the public finances and the balance of payments have made it
necessary to reexamine Bank Group lending objectives. Special efforts will be
made in supporting projects that would help Bolivia to increase exports. In
the longer run, Bank Group volume and composition of lending will depend on
the measures taken by the Government to raise additional revenues, stabilize
the economy and improve the balance of payments.

18.       For the period 1974-77, total official development assistance to
Bolivia has been as follows: Bank, US$192.0 million; IDA, US$13.7 million;
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), US$188.8 million; US Agency for Inter-
national Development US$157.5 million; other, US$203.3 million. Net of
undisbursed balances, Bolivia's debt to the Bank and IDA in 1978 represented
7.2% of its public debt. Bank and IDA's share of the Bolivian debt service
was 3% in 1977.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR
General
19.       Bolivia's population in 1976 was estimated at 4.8 million, growing
at a rate of 2.6% per year. About 42% of the population lives in urban areas,
defined as communities of 2,000 people and over; the urban population is
growing at a rate of 3.9% per year. Water supply is available to 38% of the
urban population through house connections and to 10% through public stand-
pipes; only 6% of the rural population has access to public water supply of
proven quality. Public sewerage is available to 20% of the urban population;
it is virtually unavailable in rural areas. The quality of the water supply
is often low even in urban areas as water chlorination is not widely used.
The unavailability of adequate water supply and sewerage for the majority
of the population is reflected in the high mortality rate due to diarrhea and
enteric diseases of 87/100,000, one of the highest rates in Latin America.
Sector Organization and Finances
20.       Responsibility for policy formulation and implementation in the
water supply and sewerage sector rests with the Ministry of Public Health
and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MWUV). The Ministry of Public
Health, through its Division of Environmental Sanitation (DSA), is respon-
sible for providing water and sewerage services to communities with less
than 2,000 inhabitants; and the MUV through its Water Corporation (CORPAGUAS),
to communities between 200 and 10,000 inhabitants. The large level of unsatis-
fied demand has permitted both institutions to carry out programs without
duplication of efforts. The Departmental Development Corporations are also
important in the financing and construction of water supply facilities, espe-
cially for small communities. In each department, except Pando, municipal
entities are responsible for the provision of water supply and sewerage services
in the departmental capital. In the departments of Beni and Tarija, each
urban community has a water supply entity. The Bolivian Mining Corporation,
the Bolivian Armed Forces and the National Community Development Service also
construct minor works for village water supply and sanitation.
21.       Sector institutions, particularly those serving the rural areas, are
weak in terms of management, finances and long-term planning. Operations
and maintenance are inadequate. Staffing is generally sufficient although
efficiency is affected by high staff turnover caused by low salaries, and
lack of experience in project preparation and evaluation.



22.       Investments in the sector have not kept pace with the growth of the
population. Coverage of water supply and sewerage services, expressed as
a percentage of population served to total population, has fallen since 1950.
Loss of potential revenues because of lack of adequate water metering, high
levels of unaccounted-for water and low tariffs have made the sector dependent
on Government contributions to cover operational deficits. Investments for
expansion of services have been financed mainly by multinational agencies and
bilateral donors which provided about US$100 million equivalent in grants and
loans during the last twelve years mostly at concessionary terms. Government
has not coordinated this financing very well. Its own contributions for
sector expansions have been modest and on an ad hoc basis, mostly in response
to foreign loan proposals or local political pressures.
23.       In an effort to strengthen the sector financially, the Government
established in 1974 a system of national standards for tariff classifica-
tion and a new rate structure, which would enable the smaller communities
to recover at least operating and maintenance costs and larger communities
operating, maintenance and financial costs. The system was revised in 1976
and a National Tariff Council was established under the MUV. Local political
considerations, however, have affected adversely its implementation.
24.       The Government intends to improve progressively the coverage and
quality of the water supply and sewerage services throughout the country.
The Government is aware that these improvements are not likely to be realized
unless the institutional deficiencies and financial constraints in the sector
are overcome, as is evident from the failure of the ongoing 1976-80 plan to
expand water supply and sewerage services. The MUV has been assigned
responsibility to prepare a national development plan for the expansion of
water supply and sewerage services during the 1980s. A strong Government
commitment to promote and complete the plan will be required to bring about
improvements in the sector.
Bank Group Role in the Sector
25.       The proposed project would be the second Bank Group operation
in the water supply and sewerage sector in Bolivia. The first one was the
Urban and Rural Water Supply and Sewerage Project for which a Bank loan
of US$11.5 million was signed on October 15, 1978 (Loan 1324-BO). The loan
financed (a) the design and construction of water supply systems in 70 rural
communities; (b) improvement and expansion of water supply systems in Potosi;
(c) improvement and expansion of the water supply and sewerage system of
Sucre; and (d) technical assistance to the Government and the three executing
agencies charged with the carrying out of the project. By mid-1977 it became
apparent that the loan funds allocated to Sucre and Potosi would not be used
because of the cities' reluctance to raise tariffs as covenanted in the loan
documents, and the prospect of obtaining funds on concessionary terms from
other sources. Consequently, and as requested by Government, US$6.29 million
of the loan was cancelled in December 1978. In spite of initial delays, the
rural component of the project is being carried out satisfactorily by CORPAGUAS.
A WHO/IBRD mission visited Bolivia in December 1978 and updated the water supply
and sewerage sector report prepared by the two institutions in 1975. A further
updating of the sector study is being carried out with funds provided in the
ongoing Bank financed water supply and sewerage project (Loan 1324-BO).

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       The Government originally requested that the Bank assist in the
financing of the urgently needed expansion of the water supply and sewerage
system of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Santa Cruz) by transferring the
funds allocated to the cities of Potosi and Sucre in Loan 1324-BO.  However,
following a preliminary evaluation of SAGUAPAC, the entity responsible for
water supply and sewerage in the city of Santa Cruz, and discussions with the
Government, it was determined that a separate project would suit better the
objectives of strengthening SAGUAPAC's finances and operation. The water
supply component of the project was prepared by SAGUAPAC's staff; the sewerage
component is the first stage of the Santa Cruz sewerage master plan prepared
by the consulting firm of F.A. Kocks A.G. (Germany). The project was appraised
by a Bank mission which visited Bolivia in November 1978. A report entitled
Santa Cruz Water Supply and Sewerage Project, Staff Appraisal Report No.
2409c-BO, dated May 29, 1979 is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. A credit and project summary is presented in Annex III.
Negotiations took place in Washington from May 7 - 11, 1979. The Bolivian
delegation was headed by Mr. Alfonso Criales and SAGUAPAC was represented by
Mr. Constantino Weise, General Manager.
27.       Santa Cruz is the capital of the Department of Santa Cruz and
the second largest city in Bolivia, with an estimated population of 280,800
in 1978. The city had been growing at nearly 11% until recently as a result
of rapid in-migration of people seeking increased employment opportunities.
The growth seems to have declined to about 7% in the last two years. Santa
Cruz is the administrative, financial and educational center for a vast region
of great agricultural potential and of oil and gas production, and by 1990,
its population is expected to reach 650,000 inhabitants. Demand for public
services, including water supply and sewerage, is growing rapidly.
28.       Santa Cruz uses groundwater resources which, at the present rate
of consumption and population growth, will be developed to their capacity by
1986. New and ample sources of both surface and groundwater are available at
varying distances from the city. The extent and yield of these sources,
however, need to be evaluated before a decision can be made on which sources
to develop next. SAGUAPAC would hire before July 31, 1980 qualified consul-
tants on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, to carry out such evaluation
(Section 2.02(ii) of the draft Project Agreement). Although present water
quality is adequate, about 8% is not chlorinated, posing a potential health
hazard. In a few parts of the city, water pressure is insufficient during
hours of peak consumption. Unaccounted-for water is 50% of all water produced.
Public water supply is available to 82% of the population; and the remainder
of the population relies on shallow wells and street vendors.
29.       Sewage from the present system, serving about 33% of the population,
is treated in oxidation ponds before it is discharged into the Pirai River.
The ponds are overloaded and need to be expanded. However, the treatment
is still of adequate quality and the effluent discharge has not damaged the
ecology of the Pirai River. The majority of the population uses septic



tanks, soakage pits or sanitary latrines. In general, these alternatives have
given satisfactory results and have not yet affected the groundwater discharge.
To ensure that raw sewage does not become a health hazard in areas without
d public sewer sys(-La  and that adequate dispu-i means are used, SAGUAPAC
would prepare by December 31, 1980 a preventive program for IDA review and
approval, and woul,d carry oujt the program t'erearcer  So,tion 3.07 of the
draft Project Agreement).
Project Objectives and Description
30.        The overall objective of the project is (i) to improve the health
and environmental conditions of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz by expanding the
city's water supply and sanitary sewerage facilities, and (ii) to strengthen
SAGUAPAC's management and organization by the provision of technical assistance
and the training of SAGUAPAC's staff. In addition, it is expected that the
actions to be taken for the institutional and financial strengthening of
SAGUAPAC would have a demonstration effect on other water and sewerage com-
panies, thus furthering the Government's objectives in strengthening the sector
as a whole.
31.        The project consists of:
(a)  water supply works (LAP IBRD 14126) comprising (i) the construction
of a pumping station of about 300 liters per second capacity in a
well field located northeast of the city including two concrete
storage tanks with a capacity of about 4,000 cubic meters each; and
(ii) the installation of about 200 km of distribution lines and
about 20,000 metered connections;
(b)  sewerage system works (MAP IBRD 14127) comprising (i) the con-
struction of a sewerage treatment plant with about 25 hectares of
oxidation ponds and related pumping station and emissary; and
(ii) the installation of about 4.5 km of trunk sewer and about
60 km of sewer lines;
(c)  installation of lot lines (connections) and in-house plumbing
facilities;
(d)  procurement of data processing, laboratory and communications
equipment and vehicles; and
(e)  technical assistance comprising (i) cdetermination of new sources of
water supply, (ii) improvement of SAGUAPAC's organization and
management, (iii) development of SAGUJAPAC's engineering and planning
units, and (iv) training of personnel.
32.        The project would provide public water supply to about 108,000 people
and improve existing service to about 22,0O0 people. About one third of the
beneficiaries are estimated to be the urban poor. By the end of the project in
1983, public water supply coverage in Santa Cruz is expected to reach 85%.
Water pressures would be stabilized during peak consumption hours. Metering of
house connections would reduce unaccounted-for water from 50% to 27% in 1983.
Sewerage services would be provided to about 66,000 people; the service level
is expected to reach 40% in 1983. The proposed ground water sources are the



- 10 -
closest available; the water requires no treatment other than chlorination.
The cost of installing minimum household plumbing (kitchen and sanitary
fixtures) combined with connection fees are currently estimated at about
US$450, which is expensive for most low-income households. Since there is no
financing available, many low income families are unable to benefit even from
the existing water supply and sewerage system. Hence, a revolving fund to
finance in-house plumbing and lot lines (paragraph 41) would benefit about
1,500-2,000 households per year most of which belong to the lowest income
groups.
The Santa Cruz Water Supply and Sewerage Company (SAGUAPAC)
33.       SAGUAPAC is an autonomous public enterprise under the jurisdiction
of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. It was established by the
Government in 1973 and began its operations in September 1975. It took over
the water supply and sewerage system built by the Santa Cruz Development
Corporation (Corporation) with the help of IDB. Transformation of SAGUAPAC
into a cooperative, based on a recent organization study carried out by
the Corporation, and in accordance with the Government policy for decentrali-
zation, is expected shortly. The change would give SAGUAPAC more autonomy
and is not expected to affect adversely the project execution.
34.       SAGUAPAC is managed by a six member Board of Directors, chaired
by the President of the Corporation; other members are representatives of
MUV, the municipality of Santa Cruz, the Ministry of Public Health, private
businesses and consumers, with the General Manager serving as secretary. The
General Manager, assisted by the Technical Manager and the Administrative
Manager, is responsible for day-to-day operations. He is designated by the
Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs from a list of three candidates presented
by the Board. SAGUAPAC would consult with IDA before changing its General
Manager (Section 3.04 of the Draft Project Agreement).
35.       SAGUAPAC's management is competent and its professional staff is
adequate. SAGUAPAC has about 160 employees, or 4.9 employees for 1,000 con-
nections, which compares well with other Latin American utilities. Since
1977, 30% of SAGUAPAC's personnel received training at various levels. A
study for improving organization and management has been recently carried out
and is being reviewed by a committee which would propose company policies on
recruitment, salary scales and promotion, and prepare a manual of functions.
SAGUAPAC would present a statement on its personnel policies to IDA for review
by December 31, 1979 (Section 3.05 (a)(i) of the draft Project Agreement). Until
recently, planning and engineering was carried out for SAGUAPAC by the Corpora-
tion. As a condition of credit effectiveness, SAGUAPAC would establish plan-
ning and engineering units with functions satisfactory to IDA (Section 3.06
of the draft Project Agreement and Section 5.01(b) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
36.       SAGUAPAC's accounting system is satisfactory, although its
fixed assets have not yet been properly valued, distorting the balance
sheets; a competent consultant has been retained to study this matter.
SAGUAPAC would value its fixed assets by November 30, 1979 and, at the
end of each fiscal year thereafter, revalue them in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA (Section 4.03 of the
draft Project Agreement). Billing and collection is satisfactory with



- 11 -
only 10% of the bills outstanding more than 60 days. SAGUAPAC would ensure
that accounts receivable for its water and sewerage services would not exceed
an average of two months' billings (Section 4.07 of the draft Project Agreement).
37.       SAGUAPAC's accounts are audited adequately by qualified independent
auditors. Internal auditing is adequate with the auditing group reporting to
the General Manager. SAGUAPAC would send to IDA, for review by March 31,
1980, a statement on its internal auditing procedures and corresponding
manuals (Section 3.05(a)(ii) of the draft Project Agreement).
Project Execution
38.       The project would be carried out by SAGUAPAC with the assistance
of qualified consultants. The installation of in-house plumbing and lot lines
would be contracted by the consumers and supervised by SAGUAPAC. Final
engineering designs for the project works are practically completed. As a
condition of credit effectiveness, SAGUAPAC would contract (a) about 36
man-months of engineering consultants on terms and conditions satisfactory to
IDA to prepare the bidding documents, to help in bid evaluation and to super-
vise construction; and (b) about 14 man-months of management consultants to
help improve its organization and management (Section 2.02 of the draft
Project Agreement and Section 5.01(c) of the draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). The works under the project are expected to be completed by the end of
1982. During project execution, SAGUAPAC would provide IDA quarterly progress
reports on its operating and financial performance.
39.       To assist in its program of institutional strengthening and to
prepare the water resource studies, SAGUAPAC would contract, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, (a) by January 1, 1980, engineering consultants
(6 man-months) to assist in developing the engineering and planning units; and
(b) by July 31, 1980, consultants (30 man-months) to carry out the study for
determining the next major sources of water supply for Santa Cruz (Section
2.02(ii) of the draft Project Agreement). In total, about 80 man-months of
consultant services are foreseen at an average cost of US$5,000 per man-month.
By December 31, 1979, SAGUAPAC would furnish for IDA approval, a three year
training program to be initiated by March 31, 1980 (Section 2.03 of the draft
Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing Plan
40.       The estimated cost of the project is US$16.0 million including
contingencies, with a foreign exchange component of US$6.2 million. The
costs are based on June 1978 contract prices updated by SAGUAPAC to December
1978. Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15% of base cost (US$1.7
million) and price contingencies at 15% per year for local costs and 7% per
year for foreign costs (US$3.5 million).
41.       The project would be financed by the proposed IDA credit (52%), by
SAGUAPAC's internal cash generation (30%) and by the grant from the Santa Cruz
Development Corporation (18%). Formal agreement between the Corporation and
SAGUAPAC whereby the Corporation would contribute US$2.5 million, in accordance
with a schedule agreeable to IDA, would be a condition of loan effectiveness
(Section 5.01(e) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The proposed IDA
credit is expected to finance the foreign exchange costs and US$2.8 million of



- 12 -
local costs. Financing of local costs is justified in light of Bolivia's
poverty and the need to help meet the country's external capital requirements.
Proceeds from the IDA credit would be relent to SAGUAPAC through a subsidiary
loan agreement between the Borrower and SAGUAPAC to be executed as a conditioni
of credit effectiveness (Section 5.01(a) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).  The Borrower would relend to SAGUAPAC in peso equivalent of US
dollar for 20 years including 5 years of grace with interest at 0.75% per
annum during the grace period and 7.9% per annum thereafter (Section 3.01(b)
of the draft Development Credit Agreement). SAGUAPAC would assume the foreign
exchange risk. After the grace period, SAGUAPAC would effectively pay the
Borrower 5% per annum and retain the remaining 2.9% per annum as a grant from
the Government to capitalize a revolving fund to help new low-income cosumers
to finance the installation of in-house plumbing and lot lines (Section 3.01
(b) of the draft Credit Agreement and Section 2.05 (c) (iii) of the draft
Project Agreement). SAGUAPAC would service the entire US$9 million including
US$2.0 million that would be used to set up the revolving fund. SAGUAPAC would
establish the aforementioned revolving fund on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA by January 1, 1980 and deposit   an initial amount of US$50,000 equivalent
(Section 2.05(a) of the draft Project Agreement). The beneficiaries would
repay SAGUAPAC in less than ten years and  at a minimum of 12% per annum
interest rate on the unpaid balance (Section 2.05(b) of the draft Project
Agreement). The interest rate would be slightly negative in real terms com-
pared to the expected average rate of inflation during 1979-83; it would be
justified in view of the objective of the revolving fund to benefit low-income
families. SAGUAPAC would review the interest rate from time to time, and if
necessary, would adjust the rate in order to maintain, along with other
resources which would become available for the fund, the dollar value of the
proceeds of the IDA Credit used to set up the fund (Section 2.05 (d) of the
draft Project Agreement).
Financial Position
42.        SAGUAPAC's original assets (US$14.5 million) were financed by
contributions of US$8.7 million from the Corporation and a loan of US$5.8
million in 1968 from IDB to the Corporation. The Corporation has agreed to
continue servicing the IDB loan. From the start of its operations, SAGUAPAC's
revenues have been insufficient to cover its operating costs, mostly because
of delays in implementing approved tariff levels. As a condition of credit
effectiveness, SAGUAPAC would implement water and sewerage charges in pesos of
US$0.175 equivalent ($b3.50) per cubic meter and take all steps necessary to
enable it to collect fixed charges for water supply and sewerage services in
the case of new service connections (Section 5.01(d) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement and Section 4.05 of the draft Project Agreement).
43.        In September 1978, SAGUAPAC hired a consultant to carry out a
tariff study based on socio-economic grounds and consumption patterns. On
the basis of the study, differential tariffs with five principal categories:
residential, commercial, residential/commercial, industrial and official
have been designed. Five subcategories for residential and residential/
commercial categories have been established in accordance with their co sump-
tion level. The minimum monThly water consumption would vary from 15 m for
residential category to 30 m  for industrial.  The average revenue from water
and sewerage charges under the new tariff system, approved by the National



- 13 -
Tariff Council, would be increased by 67% over the present level to $b5.00/m3
by June 30, 1980 (Section 4.04(a) of the draft Project Agreement). Revenues
per cubic meter sold are expected to increase by 22% per year in nominal terms
or about 6% per year in real terms during 1979-1983. Operating costs are
expected to increase by about 10% per year.
44.       The financial projections have been based on the assumption that
the proposed revenue package would be implemented as stated above. SAGUAPAC
would adjust its tariffs so as to attain annual rates of return on revalued
fixed assets of 1.5% in 1980, 5.0% in 1981, 5.5% in 1982, and 6% thereafter
(Section 4.04(b) of the draft Project Agreement). During the construction
period the debt equity ratio would remain below 26% and the current ratio at
about 4:1. Until the Closing Date of the Project (June 30, 1983), SAGUAPAC
would not undertake any investment, other than those included in the project,
of over US$0.5 million without prior consultation with IDA (Section 4.06 of
the draft Project Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       Contracts for equipment and materials would be awarded through
international competitive bidding according to IDA guidelines. Local manufac-
turers would be accorded a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price
or the actual import tariff, whichever is lower. Contracts for civil
works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and contracts for equipment
and materials estimated to cost less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate amount
of US$1,000,000, would be awarded on the basis of local bidding procedures
acceptable to IDA. Minor civil works contracts of less than US$10,000 up to
an aggregate amount of US$200,000 for the installation of sewerage and water
supply distribution lines would be awarded after obtaining price quotations
from registered local contractors. Installation of in-house plumbing and lot
lines would be carried out by local contractors contracted by individual
households and approved by SAGUAPAC. It is expected that most of the civil
works contracts would be won by local firms and most of the equipment and
materials supply contracts by foreign firms. After considering a number of
alternatives, it was determined that the purchase for US$320,000 of the
computer now being leased by SAGUAPAC would be the most economical.
46.       Disbursements of the IDA credit would be for 35% of civil works
expenditures; 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment,
materials and vehicles; and 40% of local expenditures for locally procured
goods; 100% of expenditures for in-house plumbing and lot lines; and 100% of
expenditures for technical assistance and consultants. Retroactive financing
of up to US$300,000 is considered for expenditures after January 1, 1979, for
the hiring of consultants (US$50,000) and the purchase of data processing
equipment (US$250,000). The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by
June 30, 1983.
Benefits and Risks
47.       The rate of return, calculated on the basis of increased revenues
from the water supply and sewerage components, which account for 72% of the
total project cost, is 12%. The cost of the technical assistance component,
which is designed to improve SAGUAPAC's performance, has been included in the
calculation. The use of a shadow exchange rate of 1.25 and a shadow price



- 14 -
factor for unskilled labor of 0.80 would decrease the rate of return to about
10%. Both the water supply and sewerage components are least-cost solutions.
The proposed ground water sources are the closest ones to Santa Cruz and
require no treatment other than chlorination. In view of the rapid growth
and increasing density of the population of Santa Cruz, the water borne
sewerage with oxidation ponds is the safest least-cost method compared to
septic tanks or soakage pits. The project is expected to yieid a number of
benefits whose value cannot be quantified such as better overall living
standards for the people of Santa Cruz, prevention of water borne diseases,
general public health improvements, water pollution control and the improvement
in the management, operation and planning capacity of SAGUAPAC.
48.       Under the project, by 1983, about 108,300 inhabitants of Santa Cruz
would receive access to safe, reliable water supply and about 22,000 people
would benefit from increased reliability of existing water supply. The
proposed project also constitutes the first phase of the Master Sewerage
Expansion Plan and would provide access to the sewerage system to about 66,000
people. About one-third of the population to benefit from the project are
estimated to be the urban poor. Also, since Santa Cruz relies heavily on
ground water resources for its water supply, the project is urgently needed to
reduce the risk of contamination by untreated sewage.
49.       An innovative feature of the project, which would help low-income
people to overcome the high costs of initial connection and in-house plumbing,
is the establishment of the revolving fund for in-house plumbing and lot
connections. About 8,000 households are expected to utilize this fund during
the project period; it would assist low income households which would other-
wise not be able to afford connections to SAGUAPAC's expanded system. SAGUAPAC's
past performance in obtaining payments on time (and the punctuality of its
residential customers in making service payments) indicate that with careful
monitoring of installation costs and terms of financing, SAGUAPAC would be
able to ensure the continuity of the fund.
50.       By promoting the orderly expansion of the vital physical infrastruc-
ture for Santa Cruz, the project would help increase the absorptive capacity
of the city for additional in-migration. The city is the most important
growth pole of Bolivia and would be the staging area for the planned export of
natural gas to Brazil and the stepped-up program for oil and gas exploration.
It is also the marketing center for the vast agricultural hinterland of the
Bolivian lowlands. The provision of safe water supply and basic sanitation in
the medium- and long-term would be necessary if Santa Cruz is to continue
serving as the development hub of Bolivia.
51.       The works to be built are technically simple and offer limited risks.
Financial risks are minimized by the commitment by the Development Corporation
to provide its share of the construction cost and the approval by the National
Tariff Council of a new tariff and revenue package. Management and organiza-
tion of SAGUAPAC would be strengthened by a carefully planned technical
assistance program provided under the project, consisting of consultant
services and the training of SAGUAPAC's staff.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Bolivia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and Servicios de Agua Potable y AlcantariLllado de Santa uruz (SAGUAPAC),
and the Report of the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1(d) of the Association's Articles of Agreement are being distrib-
uted to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the project
are listed in Section III of Annex III. Additional conditions of effectiveness
would be that: (a) SAGUAPAC has established planning and engineering units
with functions satisfactory to IDA (para. 35); (b) SAGUAPAC has contracted (i)
engineering consultants to prepare the bidding documents, to help in bid
evaluation and to supervise construction; and (ii) management consultants to
help improve its management and organization (para. 38); (c) the Santa Cruz
Development Corporation and SAGUAPAC have executed an agreement whereby the
Corporation would provide US$2.5 million to help finance the project in
accordance with a schedule acceptable to IDA (para. 41); (d) the Borrower and
SAGUAPAC have executed the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (para. 41); and (e)
SAGUAPAC has implemented water supply and sewerage charges in pesos of US$0.175
equivalent ($b3.50) per cubic meter and has taken all steps necessary to
collect fixed charges for new service connections (para. 42).
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit 261-BO - Third Livestock Development Project, US$6.8 million, June 23, 1971;
Effective Date: September 15, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The credit portion of the project has been almost fully disbursed;
only about US$800,000 including about US$400,000 for technical assistance
remains to be disbursed and the credit should be fully disbursed by the
Closing Date.
Credit 455-BO - Mining Credit Project, US$6.2 million, January 18, 1974;
Effective Date: June 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and the credit should be
fully disbursed by the Closing Date or shortly thereafter.
Credit 561-BO - Agricultural Credit I, US$7.5 million, June 20, 1975;
Effective Date: December 15, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
Funds originally allocated for cattle are fully committed; credit
demand for grape production has been as anticipated, whereas demand for sheep,
annual crops and sugarcane has been less than anticipated. Demand for sheep
and annual crops funds is expected to accelerate but the demand for sugarcane
is not expected to materialize in the near future.
Loan 1121-BO - Second Railway Project, US$28.7 million, June 5, 1975;
Effective Date: August 6, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
Project progress has been satisfactory with performance targets
either having been attained or exceeded. The loan is now almost fully
committed.

Loan 1211-BO - Ingavi Rural Development Project, US$9.5 million, March 8, 1976;
Effective Date: October 7, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
There have been delays in the implementation of some components of
the project. Corrective measures have been taken and the project is now
proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1238-BO - Fourth ENDE Power Project, US$25 million, June 2, 1976;
Effective Date: August 23, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
The project has recently been delayed somewhat by poor performance
of local contractors and difficulties experienced in the transportation of
a major equipment component. Overall progress of the project has been
satisfactorily.
Loan 1290-BO - Banco Industrial Mining and Industrial Credit Project,
US$10 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: April 14, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
After initial delays, the project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1324-BO - Urban and Rural Communities Water Supply and Sewerage Project;
US$11.5 million, October 15, 1976; Effective Date: December 10, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The Government has requested that the water supply and sewerage
investments for the cities of Sucre and Potosi be cancelled inasmuch as these
cities are not prepared to proceed- without substantial Government subsidies.
In spite of initial delays, the rural component of the project is now
proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan 1331-BO - Small-Scale Mining Development Project, US$12 million,
October 15, 1976; Effective Date: July 15, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Due to institutional and managerial problems, the preparation of
subprojects was delayed about 15 months. To facilitate loan utilization
a number of measures were taken in mid 1978; the first disbursement under
the credit component was authorized November 1978.
Loan 1404-BO - Education and Vocational Training Project, US$15 million,
May 11, 1977; Effective Date: September 7, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1981.
The project has experienced some initial delays but is now proceeding
satisfactorily.

Loan 1422-BO - Third Railway Project, US$35 million, June 6, 1977;
Effective Date: September 29, 1977; Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The progress of the project has been seriously impaired by
recent heavy rains and extensive floodings. A reduction in the project
scope is expected as the railways have to divert funds to repair damages.
The Bank is discussing with Government on how best to proceed.
Loan 1423-BO - Aviation Development Project; US$25 million, June 9, 1977;
Effective Date: September 29, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The project has been delayed by about nine months because of poor
