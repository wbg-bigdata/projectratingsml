SANTA CRUZ WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 948-BO)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Santa Cruz
Water Supply and Sewerage Project, for which Credit 948-BO in the amount of
US$ 9.0 million was approved on July 12, 1979. The Credit was closed on
June 30, 1986, three years behind schedule. It was fully disbursed and the
last disbursement was on February 3, 1987.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Division,
Country Department III, of Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office
and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Credit,
Guarantee, and Project Agreements; supervision reports; a final report
prepared by the Cooperativa de Servicios P6blicos Santa Cruz Limitada
(SAGUAPAC); correspondence between the Bank and SAGUAPAC; and internal Bank
memoranda.
The draft PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED), and sent to the Borrower for comments on February 26, 1990. The
comments from SAGUAPAC, dated April 20, 1990, have been incorporated into
the text of the PCR and also set forth in Annex 12.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
S  TA CRUZ WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 948-BO)
Highlights
1.       Credit 948-BO (US$ 9 million equivalent) helped to finance the
expansior of the water supply and sewerage system of Santa Cruz. Water
supply works included: a) the construction of two new wells and pumping
equipment, a storage tank of 4,000 m3 and 173 km of distribution network;
b) the acquisition of 258 km of pipelines, 30,000 water meters and
communication equipment; and c) the installation of 16,000 new house
connections. The sewerage works included: a) the construction of an
oxidation pond, a pumping station, 2.2 km of main effluent channel, 2 km of
trunk sewer and 97 km of sewer lines and laterals; and b) the installation
of 7,500 new house connections. The Project also included the acquisition
of 24 vehicles, and technical, administrative and management assistance
compor.ents.
2.       The majority of the Project's components were completed in
September 1987, or about five years later than the target completion date.
Due to this delay, the Project was partially successful in meeting its
objectives of: a) providing water to an additional 108,000 inhabitants by
1983 and increasing the population served from 822 in 1978 to 852 in 1983;
b) providing sanitary sewer services for an additional 66,100 inhabitants
by 1983 and thus increasing the population served from 33Z in 1978 to 402
in 1983; c) assuring a more even water dibtribution and pressure, and d)
improving the management efficiency and financial position of SAGUAPAC.
3.       At the end of 1987, there were approximately 128,000 and 60,000
additional inhabitants with water supply and sewerage service,
respectively, which can be attributed to the Project. The additional
inhabitants with water service were higher and the additional inhabitants
with sewerage service were somewhat lower than the targets established in
the SAR for 1983, which was the year expected for full operation of the
Project. However, at the end of 1987, the total population with access to
water and sewerage service had declined to 712 and 292, respectively. This
decline in service coverage was mainly caused by the higlh increase in
population experienced by Santa Cruz in the period 1978-87. The other
objectives of the Project achieved, were the following: the water pressure
has improved, the area serviced by SAGUAPAC has water supply 24 hours a
day, management efficiency has improved substantially and the financial
position of SAGUAPAC has started to get better since 1986.
4.       The main reasons for delay was the hyperinflation and the
difficult economic problems faced by Bolivia in the period 1982-1985. These
facts seriously affected the SAGUAPAC's finances, because, due to a large
extent to these problems the costs of the Project, the operating expenses
and the accounts receivable increased substantially, while tariff



(v)
adjustments did not keep pace with the rise in operating costs. However,
as was stated above, since 1986 the finances and the operating efficiency
of SAGUAPAC have improved. In 1987, the rate of return on fixed assets in
operation was the first positive one in the period (2.02), accounts
receivable were reduced to 97 days of sales, the operating ratio was 762
and water losses, 27Z. This trend of improvements continued in 1988.
S.       The Project faced daunting problems, because in addition to
hyperinflation and country economic problems, SAGUAPAC confronted the
suspension of disbursements from the Credit account for about 13 months
(para. 3.1.5) and a flood of the River Pirai that destroyed part of the
works of the oxidation pond that was under construction (para. 3.1.4). Even
under these circumstances, the Project was completed and is operating
satisfactorily. The problems were overcome due in large part to the skill
and dedication of SAGUAPAC's management and staff, and the active
cooperation of the Corporacion Regional de Desarrollo de Santa Cruz
(CORDECRUZ).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
SANTA CRUZ WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT (CREDIT 948-BO)
I - BACKGROUND
1.1      The Bank and the Association Lending to the Sector
1.1.1    The Bank and the Association have made two lending operations to
the water supply and sewerage sector to Bolivia. The first was Loan
1324-BO (US$11.5 million, 1976), which helped to finance a project designed
to improve and extend water supply in 70 rural communities and two cities
(Potosi and Sucre), and to extend sewerage in the city of Sucre. The
Project Completion Report for this Project was issued in September 1987,
and indicated that the Project was successful in expanding and improving
water supply services in rural areas, although there was a completion delay
of about f:.ve years, the components of two cities (Potosi and Sucre) were
never implemented and the institutional objectives were not achieved. The
second operation, Credit 948-BO (US$9.0 million, 1979), which is the
subject of this report, was made to the Government of Bolivia, which relent
the proceeds of the Credit to SAGUAPAC. It also has to be mentioned that in
August 1987, the Association approved a Project Preparation Facility in the
amount of US$750,000, to help the Republic of Bolivia in the preparation of
the Major Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Rehabilitation r oject. The aim
of this project is to improve and expand the water and sewerage services in
La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, and it is expected to be appraised in
the last quarter of 1989.
1.2      Sector Organization
1.2.1    The water and sanitation sector in Bolivia is complex, comprising
many institutions. At the central government level, three ministries,
Planning (MP), Urban Affairs and Housing (MUV) and Health (MH), share
responsibilities for formulating sector policies. Although not specialized
in the sector, MP is the effective head of the sector overall, as it
coordinates all external and government financing to the sector and
endorses tariff adjustments. The MUV is responsible for the oversight of
the urban sub-sector, especially for approving urban water and sewerage
tariffs, subject to consultation with the MP. The MH is responsible for
formulating sector health and sanitation policies. Autonomous companies are
responsible for providing water and sewerage services and carrying out
investments in the nine departmental capitals of Bolivia. These companies
are private cooperatives in Santa Cruz and Tarija, and are semi-autonomous
water utilities owned by the municipalities in the other seven Departmental
capitals, including La Paz. The Corporacion de Agua Potable y Saneamiento
(CORPAGUAS), a department of the 1NUV with a staff of about 250, is
responsible for carrying out investments and overseeing the operation of
the water systems of towns of over 2,000 people. The Direcci6n Nacional de
Saneamiento Ambiental. (DSA), a Department of the MH with a staff of about



-2-
400, is responsible for carrying out water and sanitation investments and
overseeing the provision of services for communities of less than 2,000
people and for the dispersed rural population.
1.3      SAGUAPAC System
1.3.1    At the time of the appraisal, SAGUAPAC was a decentralized public
utility under the jurisdiction of the MUV. In August 1979, it became a
private cooperative with the same responsibilities of providing water and
sewerage services to the city of Santa Cruz. It is also in charge of street
paving activity, which is financed by contributions from the Municipality
of Santa Cruz and CORDECRUZ. The Association agreed with this change in
legal status. SAGUAPAC is owned and ultimately controlled by all the users
of services, and governed by a Board composed of members elected among and
by the members of the cooperative. The decision to become a cooperative was
influenced by the fact that Santa Cruz has been successful in ha..dling
other publ c services (electricity and telephones) with this type of
society.
1.3.2    Santa Cruz (departmental capital) is built in four concentric
arings", but in recent years the population has settled beyond the fourth
ring. The area populated is estimated at about 14,000 ha. In 1987, the city
had a population of 577,000 inhabitants, which grew at an average rate of
8.62 p.a. in the period 1979-87. This fast growth was produced by large
unemployment in other areas of the country and by the overexpectation
created by the oil, gas and agricultural development. The population
located within the four inner rings of the city obtains water of very good
quality from house connections (almost all metered). The remaining
population obtains water mainly from shallow wells, which are often
contaminated by latrini on account of the high water table. Water and
sewerage service cover&ae in 1987 was about 712 and 29Z, respectively,
which were below the targets expected at appraisal (paras. 4.1.1 and
4.1.2).
1.3.3    Santa Cruz obtains its water supply from fourteen wells situated
in the north and south of the city. The average depth of the wells is 300 m
and the average combined production capacity is 1400 lps (compared to 790
lps at appraisal). From the wells the water is pumped into underground
storage tanks of 14,000 m3. Here, it is chlorinated and pumped into the
distribution networks, of about 800 km. The network consists of pipe of 50
mm to 500 mm of different materials (PVC, asbestos-cement and ductile
iron). As of January 1989, the number of connections was 53,000
approximately.
1.3.4    Santa Cruz has separate sanitary ani storm sewer systems.  The
network has about 350 km of length, with diameter between 150 mm and 1200
mm. Most of the sanitary sewage is conducted by gravity; however, because
of the topography some of the sewage has to be pumped through three pumping
stations and transported to a treatment plant. Once treated, the effluent
is discharged into the River Pirai. Sewerage service level is very low.
People not connected to the sewerage system have bore-hole latrines, septic
tanks or no service at all.

II - PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATION
2.1 Origin and Rationale for the Project
2.1.1    The  Project had its origin in discussions held in June 1978
between SAGUAPAC and the Association staff during the supervision of Loan
1324-BO. This mission was undertaken to study the request of the Ministry
of Urban Affairs and Housing (MUV) to transfer funds allocated to the
cities of Sucre and Potosi to SAGUAPAC. After studying the matter, the
Association and the Bolivian Government agreed that it would be preferable
to consider a new and separate loan. The Project was selected on the basis
of the urgent needs to improve water and sewerage service in Santa Cruz; a
Government decision not to subsidize public ser ices (including water
supply and sewerage in the city of Santa Cruz), and the advance stage of
project preparation. The aim of the Project was to increase the service
levels in Santa Cru,. and extend services to many of the urban poor, support
the establishment of sound tariffs that would enable SAGUAPAC to become
financially independent, ard provide technical assistance and training to
make its operation and administration more efficient.
2.2 Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.2.1    The Project was prepared by SAGUAPAC staff. The sewerage part was
based on the first stage of a master plan prepared by a consultant. The
detailed engineering and bidding documents were done also by SAGUAPAC
staff. However, to review the final design SAGUAPAC proposed to the
Association the use of consultants, which the Association accepted to
finance from the Credit proceeds (para. 2.2.4).
2.2.2    Based on the work of the June 1978 supervision mission for Loan
1324-BO (para 2.1.1), the Association decided to send the appraisal mission
in December 1978. The main issues raised by the mission were the need to:
a) assure the contributions of SAGUAPAC and CORDECRUZ to the Project of
approximately US$3.9 and US$2.5 million,l respectively; b) undertake
institutional improvement and hire technical and management consultants for
the implementation of the Project, and c) solve the problem produced by the
high cost of household plumbing (connection to the system and the interior
plumbing), which often resulted in delays in achieving project objectives
because many low-income households could not connect to the system because
of the capital costs of the installation. 2 To deal with these issues the
Association requested SAGUAPAC and the Government, before Credit
negotiations, to approve tariff increases and assure the contributions of
CORDECRUZ to the Project (para. 2.3.1), and as conditions of
effectiveness, to put into effect the tariff increases, to create a
planning and an engineering unit and to enter into an agreement with
CORDECRUZ by which the latter would provide funds for the Project (para.
2.3.4). To solve the problem of high costs of house plumbing, the Credit
Agreement included a provision for the creation of a revolving fund to
I/ Excluding US$0.6 million of contributions of land, materials and
equipment made by CORDECRUZ at the beginning of Project implementation.
2/ At the time of appraisal it was estimated that the cost of labor and
materials for the interior installation (basin, toilet and shower), and
water and sewer pipelines to the street main pipes was about US$450.

finance connections of low-income households (para. 2.3.3). The fund would
permit SAGUAPAC to finance the users' installation of their plumbing and
lot lines for the water and sewer system. The loans would be made to low-
income families at a minimum of 10 years term and a rate of interest of 9Z.
The works would be done by local plumbers, contracted by the owner, and
inspected by SAGUAPAC. During Project implementation, the fund would be
financed by an initial contribution of US$50,000 from SAGUAPAC, the
periodic reimbursements from the Credit of the amounts spent by SAGUAPAC
for groups of small contracts, and the repayments of the users, which would
be used as a revolving fund to finance additional similar facilities. After
the grace period of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, another source of
financing for the fund would be the amounts withheld by SAGUAPAC on each
payment of interest as a grant from the Government (para.2.3.2).
2.2.3    As defined in the credit agreements, the Santa Cruz Water Supply
and Sewerage Project consisted of the following components:
A- Water Supply System:
1) Completion of the Northeast well field. This included
installation of a deep well pump, pipelines, a ground storage
tank, a pumping station of 300 hp, chlorinator and power
SUPt-*;
2) construction of two reinforced concrete storage tanks with a
combined capacity of 8,000 m3 and
3) installation of about 200 km of distribution lines and about
20,000 metered connections.
B- Sanitary Sewer Systems
1) purchase of land for the North sewage treatment plan;
2) construction of the North sewage treatment plant with about 25
ha of oxidation ponds;
3) construction of the North sewage pumping station with a
capacity of about 200 hp power supply and bypass to the Rio
Pirai;
4) construction of the North Emissary of reinforced concrete about
855 m in length and 1.5 m in diameter;
5) construction of a trunk sewer of plain or reinforced concrete
600 mm and 800 mm in diameter and about 4,450 m in length; and
6) installation of sewer lines and laterals of about 60 km in
length 150 to 600 mm in diameter of clay andlor plain concrete
pipe and about 10,000 new house connections.
C- In-house Plumbin8 and Lot Lines
1) setting up of a revolving fund to finance the installation of
water and sewer lot lines and in-house plumbing facilities.



D- Administration and Operation
1) purchase of data processing equipment;
2) purchase and installation of laboratory and communications
equipment; and
3) purch - of vehicles for operation and maintenance.
E- Tech   -1b Assistance
1) hiring of consultants to study and determine the next source of
water after 1986;
2) hiring of consultants to assist SAGUAPAC to improve its
organization and management, develop its engineering and
planning divisions;
4) training and upgrading of personnel, and
5) hiring of consulting engineers for the supervision of the
Project.
2.2.4    The appraisal mission estimated that both the water supply and the
sewerage components of the Project were the least-cost solutions. The
proposed ground water solutions were the closest ones to Santa Cruz and
required no treatment other than chlorination. Thus, both capital and
recurrent ^osts were lower than other feasible alternatives. In the same
way, the technical solution proposed for the treatment of sewage effluents
(oxidation ponds) was the most economical one, since it required simple
construction techniques and lower operating costs. The appraisal mission
estimated the cost of the Project at US$ 16.0 million (excluding interest
during construction), with foreign and local costs estimated at US$6.25
million and US$9.75 million, respectively. The Project was estimated to be
financed as follows Association's Credit, US$9.0 million; SAGUAPAC, US$3.9
million and CORDECRUZ, US$3.1 million. The Project included a retroactive
financing of US$ 300,000 for consultant services for the review of th-
final Project design (US$50,000) and for the purchase of a computer (US$
250,000).
2.3      Negotiations, Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1    It was agx?ed that before negotiations SAGUAPAC woulds a) approve
a revenue package wPich included a gradual increase in tariffs per cubic
meter of water billed from $b3.50 as of mid-1979 to 0b5.00 by June 30,
1980; b) provide the Bank with a draft financing agreement whereby
CORDECRUZ would commit itself to support the Project through the provision
of not less than US$600,000 per annum, up to a total of US$2.5 million;3
c) confirmed that CORDECRUZ would continue serving the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) loan, that was contracted by the former institution
in charge of the water supply and sewerage service in Santa Cruz, and that
was used to finance part of the facilities that SAGUAPAC now operates.
After all these conditions were fulfilled, the Association invited the
31 See footnote 1/ on page 3.



-6-
Government and SAGUAPAC for negotiations, which took place May 7-11, 1979.
2.3.2    During negotiation some changes were introduced to the draft
Credit Agreement, includings a) a change in the relending terms of the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement, adding one year to the grace period (up to 5
years), establishing an interest charge of 0.75% per annum during the grace
period and 7.92 thereafter; providing, however, that SAGUAPAC would
withhold 372 of each payment of interest as a grant from the Government in
order to capitalize the fund for in-house plumbing after the grace period;
and b) a reduction in the interest rate on the revolving fund for in-house
plumbing from 12Z to 9% on the unpaid balance and also to denominate the
loans from the fund in US dollars instead of bolivian pesos.
2.3.3    Negotiations were substantially completed during the meeting held
in Washington; however there was one issue that required more time to be
resolved. This was related to the terms and conditions of the revolving
fund for in-house plumbing (para 2.3.2), and was stirred by the concern of
the senior administration of the Association that the agreement made during
negotiations, that the beneficiaries of the revolving fund would bear the
exchange risk, would defeat the intention that the funds be used by low-
income households. Due to this concern, it was necessary to renegotiate the
corresponding section of the Credit Agreement with the Government and
SAGUAPAC, which agreed with the Association's proposition that the fund be
denominated in bolivian pesos and earn an interest rate of 12X per annum.
The rate of interest would be revised from time to time to maintain in
constant terms the US-dollar value of the proceeds of the Credit used by
the fund. Once this point was solved, the Board approved the Credit of US$9
million to the Republic of Bolivia. The term was 50 years including 10
years of grace and a service charge of 0.752 per annum. June 30, 1983 was
established as Credit Closing Date.
2.3.4    Conditions of effectiveness includedt a) to hire satisfactory
consultants to supervise the Project and to develop modern management
systems and procedures; b) to put into effect tariffs to obtain an average
revenue for water and sewerage services not less than $3.50 (US$0.175) per
m3 billed, c) to create a planning and an engineering unit with functions
satisfactory to the Association and, d) to sign an agreement by which
CORDECRUZ would provide SAGUAPAC funds for the Project in an amount
equivalent to no less than US$2,500,0004 . The Credit became effective on
October 29, 1979, one month later than estimated at appraisal.
2.4      Major Covenants of the Credit and Project Agreements
2.4.1    Annex 1 includes the major covenants of the Credit and Project
Agreements. The Government and SAGUAPAC generally complied with the
covenants, except regarding the rate of return, level of accounts
receivable and losses. This was basically due to the hyperinflation that
Bolivia suffered from 1982 to 1985 (Annex 11). But even under these
circumstances, SAGUAPAC made considerable efforts to comply with the
covenants to the extent possible, and to continue with Project execution.
4/ See footnote 1/ on page 3.

III - PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1      Timetable and Changes in the Project
3.1.1    Implementation of the Project started in October 1979 and ended in
September 1987, or five years later than the original completion date.
Annex 2 compares actual and forecast completion dates by principal Project
components.
3.1.2    The main reason for late Project completion was hyperinflation.
This situation seriously affected the finances of SAGUAPAC and limited its
capacity to provide counterpart funds for the Project. Likewise, due to the
country economic problems, Bolivia failed to service its debt with the Bank
and the Association, and for this reason they suspended disbursements of
all loans to the country on two occasions (para. 3.1.5), and consequently
the execution of the Project was slow during these periods.
3.1.3    The first two years of Project execution (1980-1981) were quite
normal. SAGUAPAC undertook in a satisfactory manner the final design and
bidding process for the majority of the materials, equipment and civil
works and initiated the construction process. As of December 1981, 57.3 kms
of the water pipelines had been installed in 38 neighborhoods or 292 of the
estimated target. The revolving fund for in-house connections was operating
relatively well and a total of 1,255 connections of water and sewerage had
been made.
3.1.4     The period 1982-1985 was characterized by hyperinflation. In May
1982, the Government, through Decree No. 18948, established a monthly
adjustment of costs for construction works in line with inflation. The
application of this adjustment increased the costs of the works by 10 times
as of December 1983 and 312 times as of December 1984, both increments
compared to the costs existing in May 1982. There were also technical
problems that hindered the development of the Project. One was the sewerage
works in three neighborhoods (Unidad Vecinal --UV--30,31 and 33). There
were soil stabilization difficulties because of the high water table. This
required work to stop from January to June 1983 to make adjustment in the
design, which increased the costs. The other problem was that in March
1983, the Pirai River flooded part of the city of Santa Cruz. The flood
also caused damage to the partially completed sewerage treatment pond. The
works were approximately 582 completed as of March 1983, and the damage
represented about 252 of the completed works. Due to these events, the
implementation of the Project continued at a slow pace, and in some cases,
it stopped.
3.1.5    In addition to the problems mentioned above, SAGUAPAC faced the
suspension of disbursements from the Association's Credit on two occasions.
The first was from January to August of 1984, and the second one, from July
to December of 1985. The suspension was applied to all the lending
operations of the Bank and the Association to Bolivia and it was mainly due
to failure by the Government to service the debt. It has to be mentioned
that, even under these difficult circumstances, SAGUAPAC continued with the
implementation of the Project, due to imaginative actions of its staff and
an increase in CORDECRUZ's contribution to the Project, which reached US$ 6
million compared to US$ 3.1 million estimated at appraisal (para. 3.2.2).



- 8 -
3.1.6    On its part, the Association was flexible and agreed to the
SAGUAPAC's request to create a Special Account to expedite the
disbursements of the Credit and counteract the problem created by the fact
that, because the rate of devaluation was accelerated, and there was a time
lag of two to three months between the payments to the contractors of civil
works and the disbursements from the Credit account, SAGUAPAC lost money on
these transactions.5 The Association also agreed to increase the
disbursement percentage for civil work from 352 to 602, retroactive to
January 1, 1986, on the grounds that the indirect foreign exchange
expenditures for civil works exceeded the 352 estimated at appraisal due to
accelerated increases in foreign costs and drastic devaluation of the peso.
3.1.7    At the end of 1987. the majority of the Project components had
been finished and the facilities were operating satisfactorily. The
principal components not finished were: a concrete storage tank with
capacity of 4,000 m3, which was eliminated from the Project; a treatment
plant, which was reduced in area from 25 ha to 9 ha; and the in-house
connections financed with the revolving fund, which was reduced to assist
only 2,734 households, instead of 8,000 estimated at appraisal. The main
reason for not finishing these components was that SAGUAPAC identified,
with the Association's agreement, other works of high priority not included
in the original Project (para.3.1.8). In the case of the revolving fund for
in-house connections, it has to be pointed out that because of the
Association's recommendation (para.3.2.3), the loans to the customers were
established in pesos with the conditions to adjust the rate of interest
periodically. This was a reasonable arrangement for normal circumstances,
but with the hyperinflation, this mechanism did not work, as the funds lent
by SAGUAPAC lost practically all their value. SAGUAPAC stopped the
functioning of the fund in 1984. However, in 1988, SAGUAPAC created a
mechanism for financing household connections through short-term loans
denominated in US dollar. This has been functioning adequately, except that
the short term of the loans deters some low-income users from installing
water and sewerage service. It is expected that this situation will improve
when the fund for in-house connections starts to receive the grant from the
Government derived from the 372 of the interest on the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement that SAGUAPAC would withhold (para. 2.3.2) beginning 1989.
3.1.8    With the elimination or reduction of some of the Project
components and an increase in counterpart funds from CORDECRUZ, it was
possible to add the acquisition of equipment and the construction of two
wells not included in the original Project. The construction of these wells
was included in the master plan study carried out as part of the technical
component and was consistent with the appraised objectives of the Project.
There were also some quantities added to the original Project components,
the main ones being the following: acquisition of 58 kms of water pipes,
10,000 water meters, and materials and accessories for about 5,100
residential connections. The reason for these additions was that SAGUAPAC
considered, and the Association agreed, that the increment in the
production of water and the acquisition and installation of distribution
lines for water supply had a high priority, due to the accelerated growth
of population experienced during Project implementation (para. 1.3.2).
5/ The Association's mission carried out in December 1985, estimated that
through 1985, SAGUAPAC lost about US$400,000 due to this factor.



3.1.9    As part of the technical assistance component, SAGUAPAC, with the
help of consultants, completed the following studiest a) a revised master
plan to define the next water supply project, which the Association found
satisfactory; b) a study of the utility's organization, with the
description of the functions and procedures of the different departments
(this study also gave the basis for strengthening the internal auditing,
data processing and for creating the planning unit); c) a study of
accounting, internal control and budgeting that helped SAGUAPAC
significantly improve the keeping accounting records and preparing of
timely reports for financial management; d) a study to develop a system
and methodology for calculating fixed charges to recover part of the
investments, which led to the creation of the 202 surcharge on water and
sewerage monthly bills that SAGUAPAC now applies, and e) preparation of
manuals and design of procedures for customer services, meter reading,
ratification and distribution of bills, installation of new connections,
determination of connection fees, handling of customers' complaints, and
preparation of bidding and contract documents. SAGUAPAC also carried out a
training program, under which eight of its staff attended degree
program/courses/seminars/visits in urban planning, marketing, losses
control, engineering economics, and business administration. The
Association's staff who supervised the Project did not present an opinion
about the result of this program, but it seems that it was not completely
successful, because all the eight staff who received the training, except
one, left SAGUAPAC. This did not affect the operation of the Company
because the staff who left were substituted by staff with equivalent
qualifications. The main reason for this high turn-over can be attributed
to the low salaries that prevailed in most of the implementation period, a
situation that has improved in recent years. As this seems to be a common
problem in training programs, the Association should continue paying
attention to it in order to find ways that can be recommended to the
borrowers to minimize it.6
3.2      Project Costs
3.2.1    The total cost of the Project, including additional works
undertaken, amounted to US$ 20.4 million (Annex 3), as compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$ 16 million. However, because of changes in the
Project (para. 3.1.8), the actual cost of the Project components, defiped
at appraisal and implemented, amounted to US$ 13.5 million compared to an
appraisal estimate of US$11.9 million (13.4t cost overrun). The increase in
costs seems reasonable taken into account the longer construction period
and the hyperinflation.
3.2.2    The detailed sources of financing are presented below:
6/ Periodical revision of salaries and conditions of work, and
authorization to the staff to have some short-term consultant
assignments outside the firm, are some of the options that could be
explored.

30, 1986, and upon the request of SAGUAPAC, the Association agreed to a
final disbursement date at December 31, 1986, in order to allow time to
settle the pending bills related to civil works of the sewerage components.
Annexes 4 and 5 compare actual and forecast accumulated disbursements and
allocation of Credit proceeds by categories.
IV - PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1      Achievement of Project Objectives
4.1.1    The Project aimed to: a) provide water to an additional 108,000
inhabitants by 1983, increasing the population served from 82Z in 1978 to
85Z in 1983; b) provide sanitary sewer services for an additional 66,100
inhabitants by 1983, t-aus increasing the population served from 33Z in 1978
to 40Z in 1983; c) assure a more even water distribution and pressure, and
d) improve the management efficiency and financial position of SAGUAPAC.
4.1.2    The Project was partially successful in meeting its objectives.
Even though at the end of 1987 the population with water and sewerage
services had increased by 128,000 and 60,000 inhabitants, respectively
(both figures close to the number of inhabitants to be served established
in the SAR), these targets were only achieved by the end of 1987, i.e. with
a delay of about four years. By that time, the percentage of population
with access to water had declined to about 712, and with access to
sewerage, to 291; both percentages were lower than the targets of the SAR.
This decline in service coverage was due to the high increase in population
experienced by Santa Cruz in the period (about 8.62) and lower number of
connections accomplished as of the end of 1987 (paras. 1.3.2 and 4.2.1).
The other objectives of the Project achieved were the following: the water
pressure has improved, water service is provided around the clock,
management efficiency has improved substantially and the financial position
of SAGUAPAC has started to improve since 1986.



- 11 -
4.2      Rate of Return on Investment
4.2.1    Annex 6 shows a reestimation of the rate of return on investment
of 4.92, compared with 122 at appraisal. 7 The reason for this difference
can be attributed to higher project costs (para. 3.2.1). lower sales and
higher operating costs than estimated at appraisal. The lower number of
connections is one of the major factors for explaining the low rate of
return. The number of water and sewerage connections in 1987 were 51,000
and 21,000, respectively. These data on connections have been used to
estimate the benefits during the life of the Project, and they seem to be
low, if it is taken into account that the targets of the SAR for 1987 were
higher than these figures.8 SAGUAPAC's staff believe that the Project
allowed the construction of all the basic facilities and that with
relatively small investment in distribution lines, about 10,000 new
connections could be installed in a short term. This undoubtedly would
increase the rate of return of the Project. There was no information
readily available to calculate the rate of return with this scenario. It
also has to be borne in mind that the rate of return has been estimated
using the tariffs as a proxy of economic benefits of the Project. Since all
benefits due to improved sanitation and nutrition are not fully reflected
in tariffs, the resulting rates of return understate the economic benefits
of the Project.
V - FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      Comparison of Forecast and Actual Data
5.1.1    Annexes 7 through 10 compare the appraisal and actual forecast
income statements, sources and applications of funds, balance sheets and
performance indicators of SAGUAPAC for the period 1980-1987. SAGUAPAC's
financial performance during the period was inadequate, mainly due to
hyperinflation and the high pace of devaluation of that period. The key
financial indicators deteriorated (Annex 10). The rate of return on fixed
revalued assets in service was negative during all the construction period
(1980-1987), except in 1987, which seems to have been a turning point in
the financial performance of the utility. The operating ratio was over 1002
during 1980-85, higher than the appraisal estimate. This ratio was 97Z in
1986 and 762 in 1987. This last value was close to the level estimated in
the SAR for 1983.
5.1.2    SAGUAPAC's average combined revenues from water a..d sewerage
charges, at mid-1979 prices, remained at about the same level of Sb3-1 per
m3 billed from 1980 to 1983. Thereafter, it began to increase, reaching
$b6.0 per m3 billed in 1987. This represented an average annual increase of
102 in real terms for 1980-87. However, average operating costs were higher
that average revenues, and also increased at a high rate (7.4Z p.a), from
$b4.5 per m3 billed in 1980 to $b7.4 per m3 billed in 1987. This structural
71 It was not possible to estimate the rate of return following the exact
methodology employed in the appraisal report, because some of the
assumptions utilized were not explicitly stated. Nonetheless, an effort
has been made to follow to the extent possible an equivalent
methodology.
8I The connections estimated in the SAR for 1987, weret 65,527 for water
and 30,031 for sewerage.



- 12 -
imbalance gave SAGUAPAC a negative operating income throughout 1980-87.
with revenues insufficient to cover operating costs. In recent years the
utility has been improving its financial performance by continuing to
increase the tariffs in real terms while adjusting the operating costs at a
rate slightly lower than inflation. In 1986 and 1987, for instance,
SAGUAPAC was able to cover its cash operating costs with its operating
revenues. SAGUAPAC's income statements for past selected years are
summarized below:

5.1.3    Two other factors that contributed to the financial constraints of
SAGUAPAC were the high level of accounts receivable and somewhat high level
of system losses.  The accounts receivable were high throughout the Project
implementation period, increasing from 133 days of sales in 1980 to 259
days in 1984, thereafter beginning a declining trend reaching 97 days at
the end of 1987. This was a result of the extreme dedication that SAGUAPAC
has devoted to improve its operating efficiency. However, the level of
accounts receivable of 1987 was still higher than the SAR's target of 60
days. The system losses kept an average level of about 302 during the
period and were generally above the estimated target of the SAR. In 1987
the losses were 27Z, similar to the target established in the SAR for 1986,
which was the last year of the financial forecast.
5.2      Assets Revaluation
5.2.1    Section 4.03 of the Project Agreement required SAGUAPAC  to
revalue its assets by the end of each fiscal year, beginning from 1979. The
Association was generally unsatisfied with the assets revaluation made by
SAGUAPAC, because it was normally lower than the rate of inflation.
However, this situation improved in 1985 when the revaluation was based on
9/ Ratio of cash operating expenses to total revenues (definition used in
SAR). Some differences that appear when calculating this ratio are due
to rounding off.



- 13 -
a technical assessment prepared by consultants. In 1986 and 1987, the
assets revaluation was done using the index of variation in the exchange
rate at the beginning and at the end of the year. which the Association
considered satisfactory.
5.3.     Need to Improve Future Financial Performance
5.3.1    The need to continue improving SAGUAPAC's financial performance is
greater than in the past, because the population has increased
substantially in the recent years and service coverage has declined. For
these reasons, SAGUAPAC needs to expand the water and sewerage service,
which will demand a large amount of resources as counterpart funds to the
external loans that SAGUAPAC is seeking. It is also necessary to begin
amortizing the Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Government in October
1989. The original grace period of this loan ended in July 1984, but the
Government, with the Association's agreement, extended it to August 1,
1987. The extension of the grace period was done because the Government
wanted to compensate SAGUAPAC for various external problems, such as
hyperinflation and the suspension in the Credit disbursements, which
delayed the Project execution and affected SAGUAPAC's finances. For the
same reasons, a second extension in the grace period to April 1, 1988, was
agreed in July 1987. SAGUAPAC has asked the Government for a third
extension of the grace period to allow it to begin repaying the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement in October 1989. The Government is studying this request.
5.3.2    According to recent Bank reports, SAGUAPAC's present water and
sewerage tariffs do reflect long-run marginal cost, and are affordable by
the urban poorl with minimum cross-subsidy. Therefore, future improvement
in SAGUAPAC's finances will most likely come from increases in efficiency
and the volume of sales.
VI - INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 SAGUAPAC
6.1.1    Throughout the Project's implementation SAGUAPAC made substantial
improvement in its organization and has evolved into a well-managed utility
with high-quality staff. It operates the water supply and sewerage system
of Santa Cruz, which in 1987 had a population of about 577,000 inhabitants,
with modern technical standards. But there is still room for improving its
operating efficiency.
6.1.2    As noted (para. 3.1.9), SAGUAPAC carried out studies under the
project to improve its organization, the accounting and internal control
system, the procedures for billing, connections, handling of customers'
complaints and bidding procedures. These studies were implemented, and the
Association and SAGUAPAC agreed that they were important elements for
improving its operating and financial efficiency.
101 The bill for 15 m3lmonth of water with surcharge for sewerage service
represents less than 1Z of the household income prevailing among the
lowest-income segment in the Santa Cruz area. This low percentage
reflects the high incomes prevailing in Santa Cruz compared to the
national average.



-  14  -
6.1.3    Though the Project suffered from financial problems, basically
caused by hyperinflation, that delayed its commissioning by about five
years, SAGUAPAC acted satisfactorily under the circumstances in carrying
out the Project. The efforts of SAGUAPAC's management and staff were
important factors in successfully completing the Project. The betterment in
SAGUAPAC's management can be noticed in the improvement that has occurred
in 1986 and 1987 in key indicators like accounts receivable. energy losses,
operating ratio and in the timely preparation of accounting, operational
and budget reports to management.
6.2      Government and CORDECRUZ
6.2.1    The Government's performance was satisfactory, except regarding
the approval of SAGUAPAC's ta-4ffs, which was done with delay. However, the
Government was flexible in extending the grace period of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement to help SAGUAPAC with for the external problems that it
suffered with the hyperinflation and the suspension of Credit
disbursements. CORDECRUZ's performance was satisfactory, its contributions
to the Project were timely and above the amount estimated in the SAR (para.
3.2.2). It also cooperated from its own resources with a US$1.5 million
loan to SAGUAPAC for the Project financing.
6.3      The Association
6.3.1    The performance of the Association can also be judged as
satisfactory. It was flexible and timely in accepting changes in the
project scope and in assessing compliance with covenants when SAGUAPAC
encountered difficult problems due to the hyperinflation and the suspension
of disbursements. The decision to continue sending supervision missions,
even though the disbursements were suspended, can be regarded as positive,
because the Association's staff continued advising the utility on different
aspects of the Project's implementation, such as the revision of bidding
documents, as well as encouraging efficiency in SAGUAPAC's management and
staff, who were receptive to all the Association's advice.
VII - LESSON TO BE LEARNED
7.1      The commitment of SAGMtPAC to the Project and the skills of its
staff were the driving forces to complete the Project and to achieve, to a
great extent, its objectives, in spite of the difficult economic conditions
faced by Bolivia during part of the implementation period, coupled with the
suspension of the Credit disbursements (on country grounds), from January
to August 1984, and from July to December, 1985. The problems were overcome
due to the skill and dedication of SAGUAPAC's management and staff who
worked tenaciously to solve the difficulties produced by hyperinflation.
which brought along staggering increases in construction expenditures and
operating costs, the shortage of cash and the high level of accounts
receivable.
7.2      Due to the same causes explained above, the Government and
SAGUAPAC failed to meet some of the covenants of the Credit Agreement. The
Association was flexible in assessing the compliance with covenants and
continued sending supervision missions, even in the period when the
disbursements from the Credit were suspended. This can be regarded as
positive, because the Association continued advising the utility in



- 15 -
different aspects of the Project implementation as well as encouraging
efficiency in SAGUAPAC's management and staff, which at the end, were
important elements that helped to complete the Project satisfactorily.
7.3      In the worst period of hyperinflation (1983-85), due to the
drastic and accelerated devaluation of the Bolivian peso and the lag of two
or three months between the payments made to the contractors of civil works
and the disbursements from the Credit account, the value of the peso
equivalent received by SAGUAPAC was significantly reduced. To counteract
this problem the Association agreed to create a Special Account to expedite
the disbursements of the Credit, which proved to be very useful.
7.4      Seven of the eight SAGUAPAC staff members who received training
financed with the Credit proceeds are no longer working in the utility. The
cause for this high turn-over was not analyzed by the Bank's staff who
supervised the Project. It was most likely due to the low salaries existing
in the period, a situation that has improved in recent years. As this seems
to be a common problem in training programs, it shouid be studied carefully
by the Bank and the Association, in order to find ways that can be
recommended to the borrowers to minimize this problem.

REF : Loan 948-BO: Project Completion Report
We wish to inform you that we are basically in agreement with the Project
Completion Report for the "Santa Cruz Water Supply and Sewerage Project" prepared
by the World Bank's OED Department. Certain differences on points of fact have
already been clarified with the staff of OED, and it has been agreed that the
necessary corrections will be made to the text. For our part, we wish to draw
special attention to and express our thanks for the assistance extended to
SAGUAPAC by Bank officials during execution of the project; this was undoubtedly
an important factor in the project's having been brought to such a satisfactory
conclusion, to the benefit of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
Regards,
Ing. Carlos Medrano Viruez
General Manager, SAGUAPAC
Note: References to OED in the text above are erroneous; these references
should actually be to the Infrastructure and Energy Division, Country
Department III, of the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office.

COOPERATIVA DE SERVICIOS PUBLICOS SANTA CRUZ LTDA "SAGUAPAC"
ATTN: Mr. George Maniatis
Acting Chief, OEDD2
Operations Evaluation Department
FROM:  Ing. Carlos Medrano V.
General Manager, SAGUAPAC
SUBJECT:    Proiect ComDletion Reiort (Credit 948-BO) - Your Telex of April 24.
In response to the above telex and further to our earlier communication of April
20, 1990, we reiterate our agreement with the aforementioned Project Completion
Report for the "Santa Cruz Water Supply and Sewerage Project."   Our comments
relate to the following points:
1.    Page (iii) - Note 3
The Boliviano was created in January 1987.
2.    Page (iv) - Para. 1 - second (a)
The sewerage works included 30 km of lateral sewers in addition to 67 km
of collectors.
3.    Page (2) - Para. 1.3.2
The urban area of the city of Santa Cruz was redefined at 14,338 ha
following the 1983 floods. The figure quoted in the report -- 17,000 ha
-- was correct up until 1982.
4.    Pa&e (7) - Para. 3.1.4
The adjustment factor for costs of construction between May 1982 and
December 1984 resulted in a 312-fold increase in costs. In terms of the
official dollar, the increase was calculated at 6 times for the same
period, from beginning to end. It must be noted that this escalation
clause did not have as pronounced an effect on the project's costs in
dollars as a whole, but only on the percentage indicated in the report.
5.    Page (11) - Para. 4.2.1
The number of water and sewerage connections in 1987 was 51,300 and 20,800,
respectively.
6.    General Comment
As a general comment, we should like the report to indicate that the costs
in local currency, both capital costs and financing costs, have been
converted into dollars at the official rate of exchange.
Regards,
Ing. Carlos Medrano Viruez
General Manager
