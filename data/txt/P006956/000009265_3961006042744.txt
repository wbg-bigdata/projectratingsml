MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE DIRECTOR
OF THE LAC COUNTRY DEPARTMENT III
TO THE REGIONAL VICE PRESIDENT
ON A GRANT FROM THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT TRUST FUND
TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARMIIME ORGANIZATION
FOR A WIDER CARIBBEAN INMATIVE FOR SHIP-GENERATED WASTE PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed Global Environment Trust Fund (GET) grant to the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) of US$5.5 million (equivalent to SDR 3.9 million), to help finance a
technical assistance project called "Wider Caribbean Initiative For Ship-Generated Waste
(WCISW)" to support the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships (commonly referred to as MARPOL 73/78) in the Developing Countries of the Wider
Caribbean Region (DCWCR).
2.    Background. Almost all ship generated garbage is discharged at sea, polluting
international waters and coastal zones, and in some areas threatening the tourist trade. To
improve the quality of the world's oceans and coastlines and to protect international waters,
the international community adopted MARPOL 73/78 Convention, which regulates
operational discharges from ships. Specifically regulated by the Convention are: oil (Annex
1); noxious liquid substances (Annex II); harmful substances in packaged form (Annex III);
sewage (Annex IV); and garbage (Annex V). With the exception of Annex IV, all other
annexes have entered into force. For a country to become a Contracting Party to the
Convention, it must ratify Annexes I and II. A country may also elect to ratify any one or all
of the optional annexes III, IV and V. Thus far, as of June 1993, 71 countries have ratified
MARPOL 73/78.
3.    In October 1990, the "Regional Workshop for the Wider Caribbean on Oil Spill
Preparedness and Response and "Special Area" Status under Annex V of MARPOL 73/78"
was held in Caracas, Venezuela. After much discussion, the Caracas Workshop determined
that the threat to the Wider Caribbean sea from garbage was significant enough to seek
special protection under the "Special Area" provisions of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. An
appropriate resolution was drafted and submitted to IMO's Marine Environment Protection
Committee in July 1991. As a result, the WCR was designated as a "Special Area" under
Annex V. Under the terms of Annex V relating to "special areas", ships of all sizes are
prohibited from the discharge of all waste materials except food waste, which may be
discharged 12 nautical miles (3 nautical miles in the Wider Caribbean) from land. The
"Special Area" designation for the Wider Caribbean entered into force on April 4, 1993.
4.    While most developed countries have ratified MARPOL 73/78, the record for
ratification by the DCWCR is relatively incomplete. Among the 22 DCWCR only 9 countries
have ratified the mandatory annexes and 6 have ratified Annex V. Moreover, among the 29
countries of the WCR only 14 have ratified the mandatory annexes, and 12 have ratified
Annex V. The status of ratification of Annexes III and IV is less significant since Annex IV



- 2 -
has not yet entered into force and Annex III is relatively simple to implement (i.e. adherence
to the labelling, stowage and manifesting of dangerous goods according to an IMO code).
The incomplete record of ratification is directly attributed to the requirements under
MARPOL 73/78 for countries to provide adequate port reception facilities for receiving ship-
generated waste, and the need to implement national legislation to enable enforcement of the
Convention. For DCWCR, without the assistance of the international community, the
economic burden is significant and the technical expertise to deal with associated legislative,
institutional, waste management and enforcement issues is often lacking.
5.    Project Objectives. The Project is conceived as the first phase of a longer term
process of cleaning up and protecting the Caribbean Sea. The objective of this first phase
program is to provide the basis for ratification and implementation of the MARPOL 73/78
Convention by the DCWCR. Project activities would contribute to this objective by providing
governments with: (i) information on legal, technical, and institutional measures needed on a
regional and national basis to implement MARPOL 73/78; and (ii) a forum for considering
options and for reaching a regional consensus on the actions to be taken. Assuming that the
members of the DCWCR decide to ratify and implement MARPOL 73/78 building on this
project's outputs, a second phase program could be agreed with international donor
community support, consisting of investments in port reception facilities, waste management
infrastructure, and institutional training programs, that would contribute to the longer term
goal of ending the discharge of all ship-generated waste into international and territorial
waters of the Caribbean Sea and thereby protecting the environmental integrity of Caribbean
coastal and marine systems.
6.    Project Description. Over the three year period, the Project would provide technical
assistance to carry out studies and support coordination activities (Annex I) with the objective
of producing a regional strategy to implement MARPOL 73/78. The strategy would include a
regional legal framework, regional waste management programs, a regional public awareness
programs, training and identification of national projects for reception and disposal facilities.
The Project would finance consultant services and their logistical support to:
-     assess existing legislation and regulations of the DCWCR affecting Annex I, II
and V wastes;
-     identify legal remedies available under international agreements such as
MARPOL 73/78 or appropriate alternative strategies for promoting compliance
with the 'Special Area" designation in the WCR;
-     assess existing waste management systems in the DCWCR, including the
institutional setup;
-     formulate regional engineering criteria for waste reception facilities at the
ports;



- 3 -
coordinate discussions with shipping and cruise lines on reducing waste at the
source and recycling Annex I, II and V wastes;
develop integrated regional waste management alternatives, including
identification and evaluation of specific proposals;
develop strategies for the integration of collection, treatment and disposal of
Annexes I, II and V ship-generated wastes with associated existing national
collection, treatment and disposal systems in DCWCR;
assist ports in the DCWCR in defining the appropriate tariffs for receiving
Annex 1, II and V wastes, including cost recovery for waste management
systems;
develop proposals to ensure that DCWCR achieves full cost recovery of the
collection, treatment and disposal costs associated with the reception of
Annexes I, II and V wastes;
assist DCWCR in implementing new waste management alternatives, including
training local staff;
.develop strategies for public awareness programs in DCWCR in support of the
project on a national as well as regional basis;
- brief potential donors, financing institutions, and NGOs on the status of
MARPOL 73/78 in the WCR; and
- based on the foregoing, develop a strategy for dealing with Annex I, II and V
ship-generated waste in the WCR, including investment proposals that could be
supported by WCR governments and the international donor community.
7.    Project activities would be carried out by consultants engaged by IMO and supervised
by both IMO and the Bank. Consultants would work closely with national and regional
organizations, and a special effort would be made to involve all the targeted countries in the
process. It is envisaged that a team of three long term consultants consisting of a Project
Coordinator, Technical, and Legal experts (terms of reference are attached as Annex III)
would be engaged for about three years (estimated cost US$1.2 million). Each consultant will
have a specified work program, developed on a rolling annual basis according to agreed time
limits specified in "Implementation Schedule" of key project activities, (Annex I), which they
individually manage. Each consultant's work program includes a series of studies, monitoring
activities, public relations, training and regional meetings aimed at providing the basis for
ratification and implementation of MARPOL 73/78 Convention by the DCWCR. The public
awareness strategy will be developed and implemented by a public awareness firm procured
under LIB. To facilitate their work programs, the three long term consultants are expected to



- 4 -
identify and incorporate, as necessary, the services of local consultants and NGO's from the
DCWCR (estimated cost $2.8 million). These consultants would be selected by IMO, in
accordance with terms of reference agreed by the Bank, for tasks included in the respective
consultant's approved work program. Estimated completion date is August 31, 1997 and the
closing date is January 31, 1998.
8.    Project Execution. IMO, with headquarters in London, is the United Nations
organization responsible for promoting and monitoring MARPOL 73/78 implementation and
for formulating technical regulations of shipping engaged in international trade. IMO's
mission is to encourage and facilitate the global adoption of the highest practicable standards
in matters concerning maritime safety, the efficiency of navigation and prevention and
control of marine pollution from ships. Thus the IMO, as an international organization to
which most countries of WCR are members, is the most suitable choice as an umbrella
executing agency for the Project as indicated in the Resolution (Annex II). IMO would rely
on the participation of national ministries of environment (MOE) and finance (MOF), law
enforcement authorities, maritime and port authorities as well as public health authorities in
the DCWCR to implement the project. To the extent possible, regional and national NGO's
would also be called upon to assist the long term consultants in the implementation of the
project (para. 7). To facilitate project execution, a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU),
managed by the Project Coordinator and staffed with Administrative Support, will be
established for the duration of the project in Trinidad and Tobago. Discussions are underway
to house the PCU at the UNDP office in Port of Spain.
9.    Project Cost and Financing. The total cost of the project amounts to approximately
US$5.5 million which represent all expenditures required for project execution, including
costs associated with the PCU (office space, office supplies and equipment, communications
and secretarial support). The project will be financed by a grant from the Global
Environmental Facility Trust Fund (GET) equivalent to SDR 3.9 million. The Grant would
finance 100% of the cost of the services provided by consultants selected in accordance with
Bank guidelines, as well as all expenditures related to planned workshops and the
development of public awareness programs. IMO would be reimbursed for its incremental
costs directly related to its role as executing agency, estimated at US$357,000, equivalent to
6.5% of GET grant (Schedule A). For the purpose of facilitating the financing of the Project,
IMO would open a Special Account in a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The initial
deposit in the Special Account would be US$250,000. The accounts of the Project, including
the Special Account, would be audited on a semi-annual basis by IMO internal auditors and
on an annual basis by independent auditors, satisfactory to the Bank. Copies of the audited
statements would be sent to the Bank within one month of the end of each audited period.
Administrative expenditure and workshop costs will be disbursed against statements of
expenditure (SOEs) for which detail documentation evidencing expenditures would be
reviewed by IMO and made available for required audit as well as Bank supervision
missions.



10.   Project Sustainability. By addressing the legal and institutional framework in addition
to the issues of enforcement and coordination of user fees or cost recovery across countries,
the project would help ensure adequate permanent financing for receiving and disposing of
ship-generated waste.
11.   Lessons from previous Bank/IDA Experience. There is no previous Bank experience
with an intemational waters project benefiting a large number of countries. However,
experience in preparing the GEF/World Bank financed Waste Management project for the six
member countries of the Organization of Eastem Caribbean States (OECS) identified the
need for strong project coordination, public awareness programs, and contracting local
consultants to ensure effective project planning and coordination. These lessons have been
integrated in the design of the WCISW project.
12.   Rationale for GEF Funding. The project, the preparation of which was financed by a
PPA, is designed to redress and prevent further pollution of an international waterway in an
area of the world which depends heavily on its coastal zone, now and in the future, for
income and employment. Currently tourism and fishing revenues and public health are
threatened by pollution of coastal zones, from both land and marine sources. To be effective,
port reception and waste facilities need to be established throughout the WCR and a
regulatory framework must be in effect throughout the region, otherwise pollution will travel
with the currents. Therefore a regional approach is required under which simultaneous and
coordinated efforts are initiated throughout the coastal countries and territories of the WCR.
Protection of the coastal zone depends on the minimization of marine waste to the extent
possible, proper land-based waste disposal and the effective management of land-based
sources of pollution. The GEF funded project would lay the basis for reducing marine
pollution as well as land-based sources of coastal zone pollution. This effort could provide a
model for undertaking similar initiatives elsewhere in the world where multi-national
cooperation on marine pollution initiatives is required, but where designation of "Special
Area" status has yet to be specified. The objectives of the project would not be achieved
without GEF involvement.
13.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The Project Coordinator will include in the annual
progress reports information on each participating country's performance against key
indicators deemed to be influenced by the Project. Indicators would include the number of
developing countries in the WCR adopting the following actions: (a) plans in support of
waste minimization, recovery, recycling and improvement of the overall management of
waste; (b) ratification of MARPOL 73/78 Convention; (c) legislation for the implementation
and enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 Convention; and (d) dissemination of the Public
Awareness Programs aimed at increased sensitivity to issues related to the MARPOL 73/78
Convention (Schedule C). Once the Project is declared effective, an annual set of activities
and targets as per "Implementation Program" for key activities (Annex I) will be agreed upon
between the Project Coordinator and the Consultants. This plan will include all activities to
be undertaken for the next twelve months by each of the consultants and will be monitored



- 6 -
by the Project Coordinator through quarterly progress reports to be submitted by each of the
consultants. The plan will be revisited every nine months and extended for another year.
14.   Agreements Reached.
(a)   With the countries of the WCR. As set forth in the Resolution (Annex II)
drawn at the end of a WCISW Workshop held at IMO's headquarters from
October 11 to 13, 1993, all countries in the WCR have agreed on the project
objectives, role of IMO as a recipient and executing agency of the GET grant,
costs, financing and organizational arrangements.
(b)   With IMO.
(i)    All consultancies are to be selected on the basis of the "Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants by Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981;
(ii)   Public awareness programs to be procured under LIB (para. 9);
(iii)   The Project is to be implemented according to the Terms of Reference
shown at Annex III and the "Implementation Program" for key project
activities as shown at Annex I;
(iv)   Progress reports will be furnished to the Bank, the first one 4 months
after the effective date, and every 3 months thereafter; on an annual
basis, these reports are to include information on each participating
country's performance against key indicators deemed to be influenced
by the project (para. 13);
(v)   The accounts of the Project, including the Special Account, to be
audited on a semi annual basis by IMO auditors and on an annual basis
by independent auditors, satisfactory to the Bank (para. 9);
(vi)   Copies of the audited statements to be sent to the Bank within one
month of the end of each audited period (para. 9); and
(vii)  Rolling action plans describing the Project activities to be carried out
during the following 12 months, will be fumished to the Bank 30 days
after the effective date and every 9 months thereafter.
15.   Conditions of Effectiveness.
(a)   Selection of the Project Coordinator; and



- 7 -
(b)   Submission of audit report covering all expenditures financed by the
PPA in accordance with Bank guidelines.
16.   Environmental Aspects. Technical advice provided under the Project would include
the specification of Environmental Impact Assessment guidelines (World Bank guidelines) to
be used for pre-feasibility studies of possible port reception facilities and waste disposal
infrastructure in the DCWCR. The project could have significant environmental benefits
over the long term, if countries of the WCR decide to ratify MARPOL 73/78 and implement
the regional strategy developed under the WCISW. These benefits would include:
minimizing discharge of MARPOL 73/78 waste into the intemational and territorial waters of
the Wider Caribbean sea, protecting the environmental integrity of coastal and marine
systems, and reducing public health threats by strengthening national waste management
systems throughout the WCR.
17.   Project Benefits. The Project would provide the basis for member governments of the
WCR to agree on a regional strategy for dealing with ship wastes and to move towards
ratification of MARPOL 73/78. Such actions would, over the longer term, reap not only
significant environmental and health benefits, but would also generate important economic
benefits by reducing the threat to the tourist industry in the WCR caused by environmental
degradation.
18.   Project Risks. The project's main risks are associated with the need for many
countries to act in a coordinated manner and to enter into timely agreements among
themselves on regional waste management policy and international waste disposal programs.
The Project Coordinator will be responsible for closely monitoring developments and for
proposing to IMO mitigating actions. The risks can be kept at an acceptable level through the
public awareness programs, use of NGO's whenever possible, contracting local consultants
and through interactions among government representatives at the workshops.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed GET grant would comply with the
provisions of IBRD Resolution No. 91-5 of the Executive Directors relating to the
establishment of the Global Environment Facility and recommend that the Regional Vice
President, Latin America and Caribbean Region, approve it.

The MARPOL Convention
1.    Growing international concern for protection of the environment generally, including
the marine environment in particular, led to the convening of the United Nations Conference
on the Human Environment in 1972 which drew attention, amongst other things, to the need
to protect the oceans from vessel-source pollution. A series of tanker casualties, the
increasing amount of wastes dumped in the ocean and chronic pollution of beaches and
coastal waters had drawn global attention to this problem.
2.    The international community's response to the above concerns was the adoption,
under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) of the International
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1973) and a Protocol to that
Convention (1978), together normally referred to as MARPOL 73/78 with the aim of
reducing and, if required, eliminating the long-standing practice of discharging wastes from
ships into the marine environment.
3.    MARPOL 73/78 requires both that ships retain their wastes on board, discharging
them only at their first port of call, and that ports provide adequate reception facilities to
receive these wastes.
4.    Different types of substances or cargo carried by ships are addressed in the five
Annexes of MARPOL 73/78 as follows:
Annex I, oil;
Annex II, noxious liquid substances in bulk;
Annex III, harmful substances in packaged forms;
Annex IV, sewage; and
Annex V, garbage.
Ratification of MARPOL 73/78 by a State does not necessarily have to include all Annexes.
Annexes III, IV and V are referred to as optional Annexes that need not be accepted by a
State when it ratifies or accedes to MARPOL 73/78 (including its Annexes I and II).
However, the optional Annexes cannot be ratified separately; these can only be ratified in
combination with or after ratification of MARPOL 73/78 (including its Annexes I and II).
5.    MARPOL 73/78 and its Annexes provide specific discharge standards for different
substances. For some substances (e.g. plastics in Annex V) MARPOL 73/78 introduces a
complete ban on their discharge. It also provides for the option of designating specific sea
areas as 'special areas' under Annex 1, II or V (or under a combination of these Annexes).
Stricter discharge regulations apply to these special areas.



6.    Following an IMO/UNEP sponsored workshop in Caracas, October 1990, and also
the 30th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the IMO,
November 1990, several Governments in the Wider Caribbean Region (WCR) sought from
the MEPC a 'Special Area' designation for the WCR's sea area under Annex V of MARPOL
73/78. Under this arrangement, ships are prohibited from discharging garbage at sea within
the Gulf of Mexico and WCR. A proposal was presented to MEPC's 31st session where it
was formally adopted on 4 July 1991 (MEPC Res. 48(31)). The amendment entered into
force on 4 April 1993.
7.    The States and Territories of the WCR were invited to examine in detail the
implications of the 'Special Area' designation and to endeavor to provide adequate and
acceptable reception facilities for Annex V wastes throughout the region. The 'Special Area'
designation for the Wider Caribbean Region will only become effective one year after the
required reception facilities are established and made operational in the ports of the region.
8.    The provision of reception facilities is a major instrument in MARPOL 73/78's efforts
to reduce or end the discharge of ship-generated wastes into the marine environment.
Annexes I, II and V contain regulations with regard to the reception facilities that must be
provided in ports, respectively for oily wastes, noxious liquid substances, and garbage.
MARPOL 73/78's effectiveness in combating marine pollution from ships is as much
determined by the effectiveness of its regulations regarding the provision of reception
facilities as it is by the effectiveness of implementation and enforcement of its requirements
concerning port inspection and reporting.
9.    There are, however, other important elements that determine the effectiveness of
MARPOL 73/78 worldwide and also in the WCR and more specifically, in the States and
Territories of the WCR. These include that:
the relevant national primary and secondary maritime legislation has to be in
place and up to date and many of the important IMO Conventions other than
MARPOL 73/78 are also ratified and implemented by adoption of national
legislation;
MARPOL 73/78, including its optional Annexes (in particular Annex V) be
ratified;
MARPOL 73/78's provisions are implemented by adoption of appropriate
national legislation and that there exists an effective institutional framework
both for the legislative processes for the drafting and adoption of the necessary
laws and an effective maritime administration for the overview,
implementation and enforcement thereof;
MARPOL 73/78's provisions are actively enforced by the States and
Territories in the WCR to ensure full compliance with its regulations;



- 3 -
other relevant international instruments (e.g. the Cartagena Convention, the
London Convention, the Vina del Mar Agreement, and the Basel Convention)
should also be ratified and implemented; and
reception facilities for ship-generated wastes be provided, the institutional
arrangements for the effective operation of these facilities be in place, and
strategies and infrastructure for the effective management (e.g. treatment,
disposal) of these wastes also be developed.
10.  In the WCR (and in other regions of the world for that matter), MARPOL 73/78 is
not yet as effective as it could and should be. Whilst it is not possible precisely to analyze
the causes within the framework of this document, it is possible to give some indications of
the current situation.
11.   National primary and secondary maritime legislation in many developing countries of
the WCR needs to be further developed or updated. In some cases, there is not even
legislation covering the main institutions of law, which is the necessary foundation of a
maritime legal regime. In others general enabling and primary maritime legislation may be in
place, but the necessary regulations and other measures necessary to give the enabling
legislation practical effect have either not been developed or may not be up to date or
effective. Some progress has been made in some countries in this area in respect of
enactment of shipping legislation or updating outdated legislation, or both, as a result of,
among other developments, bi-lateral projects, the appointment of a Regional Maritime
Safety Adviser for the Caribbean by the IMO, and the appointment of a Regional Consultant
on Marine Pollution, Port Safety and Security for the Wider Caribbean. Another important
initiative is the LEGISMAR project in 5 Central American States established under UN
auspices with the IMO as executing agency to promote adoption and implementation of
comprehensive maritime legislation. In spite of the efforts through these and other projects,
however, much remains to be done.
12.   Many States and Territories in the Wider Caribbean have not ratified a substantial
number of important safety related IMO Conventions. The Annex to this document provides
an overview of the present status of ratification of such Conventions.
13.   MARPOL 73/78 has not been ratified by a substantial number of States and
Territories in the WCR. The Annex to this document also provides an overview of the
present status of ratification of MARPOL 73/78.
14.   The lack of national maritime legislation is especially great in relation to
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 despite the excellent initiatives that have already been
launched by the various IMO resident experts and numerous ad hoc consultants employed by
the IMO and concerned States and international organizations in this area. In addition,
coordination of legislation is lacking in the area as a whole and in most of its sub-regions.
There is virtually a tabula rasa for development and enactment of the necessary primary and



- 4 -
secondary legislation, to encourage and enable ratification of MARPOL 73/78, etc.. This
situation presents a unique opportunity to develop legislation in the region on a harmonized
and a coordinated basis, which is vital to the successful operation of MARPOL 73/78 and
especially its Annexes 1, II and V.
15.   Information with regard to the availability of the various types of reception facilities
for the reception of wastes in the ports and harbors of the WCR is incomplete. A number of
publications (Lloyd's Ports of the World 1993, a document by the International Chamber of
Shipping submitted to the MEPC in 1990, and the MEPC Circular 234 containing
information provided by Contracting Parties about reception facilities for oily wastes) provide
information about the situation with regard to the availability of such facilities in ports in the
WCR, but this information is in some cases several years old, and in all cases incomplete. A
special survey reviewing port reception and disposal facilities for garbage in the Wider
Caribbean was carried out in 1991 by Environmental Resources Ltd. for the IMO and the
World Bank. It indicates that it is more than likely that facilities for the reception of ship-
generated wastes are not available in many of the ports and harbors of the WCR.
16.   It is generally recognized that the most important problem of ship-generated wastes
may not be the reception of such wastes in ports, but the management and disposal or
treatment of these wastes once they have been brought into ports. This issue was also
addressed in the Environmental Resources Ltd. study of 1991.
Objectives
17.         Project activities are conceived as the first phase of a longer term process of
cleaning up and protecting the Wider Caribbean Seas. The objective of this first phase
program is to provide the basis for ratification and implementation of the MARPOL 73/78
convention by the developing countries of the WCR. Project activities would contribute to
this objective by providing governments with (i) information on legal, technical, and
institutional measures needed on a regional and national basis to implement MARPOL 73/78;
and (ii) a forum for considering options and for reaching a regional consensus on the actions
to be taken. Assuming that the States and Territories of the WCR decide to ratify and
implement MARPOL 73/78 building on this project's outputs, a second phase program could
be agreed with international donor community support, consisting of investments in port
reception facilities, waste management infrastructure, and institutional training programs, that
would contribute to the longer term goal of ending the discharge of all ship-generated waste
into international waters, exclusive economic zones and territorial seas of the Wider
Caribbean, and thereby protecting the environmental integrity of Caribbean coastal and
marine systems.

Action Program
The Technical Consultant's Task
1.    The services to be provided under the Terms of Reference of the Wider Caribbean
Initiative for Ship-Generated Wastes (WCISW) involve the completion of the following tasks
to be carried out in conjunction with other international, regional and national organizations
under the management of the Technical Consultant, in cooperation with the Project
Coordinator based at the IMO, the Legal Consultant and the World Bank. The Technical
Consultant's responsibilities are divided into three stages, of which stages 2 and 3 can to
some extent be carried out concurrently.
2.    Stage 1. Project Preparation
(a)   To develop cooperation with IMO's regional advisers including national,
regional and international institutions involved in the issues addressed by the
WCISW and to coordinate activities with the relevant ongoing activities of
IMO's regional advisers as well as national and regional institutions in order to
achieve optimal effectiveness of the various activities and initiatives, and to
avoid duplication and/or incompatibility of efforts.
(b)   To carry out introductory and fact-finding visits relating to ongoing projects
and other work of persons and other organizations involved therein, relevant to
technical infrastructure for the implementation of MARPOL 73/78 including
the land-based management of solid and liquid wastes as it affects ports. To
identify local technical experts in this field.
(c)   In discussion with concerned government and regional agencies, to determine
which commercial ports, harbors and anchorages in the developing countries of
the WCR should ensure that port reception facilities are provided for Annex I,
II and V wastes respectively.
(d)   To develop a complete and up-to-date inventory (and quality assessment) of
port reception facilities for all types of wastes (including technical and
operational details) available in commercial ports, harbors and anchorages in
the WCR.
(e)   To develop a complete and up-to-date inventory (and quality assessment) of
port reception facilities for waste (including technical and operational details)
available in marinas in the WCR.
(f)   To review and evaluate existing waste management (collection, treatment and
disposal) systems in each of the developing countries of the WCR, including
the institutional set-up for these systems.



3.    Stage 2. Activities Aimed at the Wider Caribbean Region
(g)   To identify specific technical requirements for the development of an effective
system of enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 regulation in the WCR to ensure
full compliance by all parties involved.
(h)   To promote the reduction of wastes at source in coordination with shipping
and cruise lines, non-governmental organizations and any other entities that
might be able to provide a useful contribution, and to develop outline
proposals for the operationalization of region-wide recycling and waste
recovery initiatives.
(i)   To develop awareness programs in close cooperation with relevant
international and non-governmental organizations at the regional and sub-
regional level to promote the objectives of the WCISW and the success of the
activities carried out within the framework of the WCISW, in particular to
ensure that the public in all the countries concerned understand the need and
reasons for the measures to be taken, the need to ensure and, as appropriate,
to participate in compliance therewith, and are fully aware of the benefits that
they will derive therefrom.
4.    Stage 3. Activities Aimed at Individual States and Territories
(j)    To develop integrated national and/or regional waste management strategies.
Typical strategy blueprints would be developed for groups of countries and/or
territories with similar characteristics and conditions (e.g. small island states,
large mainland ports etc.)
(k)   To formulate detailed acceptable technical criteria that can be applied in the
WCR and further refined for specific local conditions for waste reception
facilities at ports for Annexes I, II and V wastes from ships, including
collection, transport, treatment and disposal procedures, and taking into
account the need for cost minimization, technical appropriateness,
environmental considerations, etc.
(1)    To develop methods, and provide guidelines, for the assessment and evaluation
of the economic and environmental impact of reception facilities and associated
waste management systems, and to develop tariffs for the use of these facilities
including proposals for viable cost recovery systems.
(m)   To develop and define the mechanisms for providing assistance and technical
support to national and/or local Governments or port authorities in the
operation of reception facilities and associated waste management systems as
required by MARPOL 73/78 and in developing and implementing new waste
management strategies. This effort should be closely coordinated with the
World Bank and other potential donors.



(n)   With the assistance of governments, regional agencies, NGOs and consultants
as necessary, identify the key deficiencies in physical infrastructure and
institutional arrangements which constitute constraints in the implementation of
MARPOL 73/78 convention in each of the developing countries of the WCR.
Attention must also be given to the organizational aspects of reception and
management of wastes, including the financial and institutional aspects and the
requirements for training of local staff. Identify actions and interventions
required to address these deficiencies.
Scope of Work
5.    The activities to be carried out by the consultants, coordinated closely with IMO and
the World Bank, involved in the WCISW, will include the preparation of data inventories
and reports, drafting of agreements and legislation, the convening of legal and technical
workshops, and visits and high level missions to all the developing countries of the WCR
when possible.
Six workshops are envisaged in the WCISW:
two legal workshops, the first focusing on national legislation necessary for the
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 and the second focusing on enforcement of
MARPOL 73/78;
three technical workshops, the first focusing on the reduction at source of
wastes and the existing provision for port reception of wastes in the region, the
second focusing on the strategy blueprints for reception and associated waste
management systems and technical criteria for reception facilities, and the third
on the country-specific key deficiencies identified, and possible mechanisms
for addressing these deficiencies; and
a final workshop to discuss the outcome of the WCISW, to discuss the actions
required to bring about full effectiveness of the special area designation of the
Caribbean under MARPOL, and to present these findings to the international
funding agencies.
6.   In recent years a considerable amount of work has already been undertaken on the
review and assessment of maritime legislation in the WCR (though mostly in relation to ship
safety) and of solid waste management systems by a variety of agencies including the IMO
and regional bodies and Governments. It is important that any consultants involved in the
WCISW avoid duplication of effort by reviewing in detail all studies carried out to date, by
making full use of the results of the work that has already been carried out, and by
coordinating their activities with others already active in similar fields of activity in the
WCR, including the IMO Regional Maritime Safety Adviser for the Caribbean and the
Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution (as indicated in the following paragraph).



7.    The following list of persons, initiatives and activities is not exhaustive and provides
an indication of other initiatives and activities with which some form of coordination or
cooperation might be useful for the WCISW:
-     Caribbean Action Plan and the Cartagena Convention;
-     the IMO/Norway Cooperation Program's Regional Maritime Safety Adviser
for the Caribbean;
-     the Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution, Port Safety and Security (Wider
Caribbean) financed by the US Coast Guard;
-     IMO regional Coordinator on Marine Environment Protection for Latin
America;
-     ROCRAM, ROCRAM/CA;
-     LEGISMAR project executed by the IMO and UNCTAD;
-     The GECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) Waste Management
Project; and
-     the efforts by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to
develop a Manual on Reception Facilities.
Furthermore, several regional and sub-regional organizations in the WCR may be active in
areas that are relevant to the objectives of the Wider Caribbean Initiative for Ship-Generated
Wastes.
8.    The scope of work of the various activities of the Technical Consultant outlined in the
previous chapter will be as follows:
9.    Technical Consultant.
(a)   Cooperation and Coordination. A small technical steering committee
composed by the Project Coordinator and the Technical Consultant, composed
of high level representatives from among the developing countries of the WCR
will be established to ensure progress of the WCISW, its Action Program and
coordination with other initiatives. The representatives should total only five or
six persons drawn from Government departments involved in providing for the
technical infrastructure for the reception and management of wastes from ships
(e.g. the Departments of Transport, Finance, Economic Affairs, Public Health,
Environment, as appropriate, etc).



- 10-
(b)   Fact-finding regarding technical infrastructure. The Technical Consultant will
assist in the establishment of teams of technical experts in each developing
country of the WCR (or combinations of countries) as task forces for
managing the preparation of the development of reception facilities and related
waste management systems. As in the case of the Steering Committee, these
national task forces will include representatives both skilled and involved in
developing such facilities drawn from Government departments involved in this
process such as, possibly, Maritime Transport Departments, Port Authorities,
Environment and Public Health Authorities as required. It should also be
considered whether companies involved in the construction and operation of
such facilities and systems can be involved in these task forces.
(c)   Identification of ports that require reception facilities. The Technical
Consultant will determine which port reception facilities are required in the
ports and harbors in the developing countries of the WCR in order to comply
with the relevant Regulations of MARPOL 73/78. Criteria to be used are
given in MARPOL 73/78:
In Annex I, Regulation 12(2) provides guidance as to which ports need Annex
I reception facilities:
(i) all ports and terminals in which crude oil is loaded into oil tankers
where such tankers have immediately prior to arrival completed a
ballast voyage of not more than 72 hours or not more than 1,200
nautical miles;
(ii) all ports and terminals in which oil other than crude oil in bulk is
loaded at an average quantity of more than 1,000 metric tons per day;
(iii) all ports having ship repair yards or tank cleaning facilities;
(iv) all ports and terminals which handle ships provided with the sludge
tank(s) required by Regulation 17 of this Annex;
(v) all ports in respect of oily bilge waters and other residues, which
cannot be discharged in accordance with Regulation 9 of this Annex;
and
(vi) all loading ports for bulk cargoes in respect of oil residues from
combination carriers which cannot be discharged in accordance with
regulation 9 of this Annex.
In Annex II, Regulation 7(1) provides guidance as to which ports need
Annex II reception facilities:



- 11 -
(i) cargo loading and unloading ports and terminals shall have facilities for
reception without undue delay to ships of such residues and mixtures
containing noxious liquid substances as would remain for disposal from
ships carrying them as a consequence of the application of this Annex;
and
(ii) ship repair ports undertaking repairs to chemical tankers shall have
facilities adequate for the reception of residues and mixtures containing
noxious liquid substances.
In Annex V, Regulation 7(1) provides guidance as to which ports need
Annex V reception facilities. These are the most straightforward in this
respect: all ports and terminals (including marinas) should have reception
facilities for garbage.
(d)   Inventory of reception facilities in commercial ports, harbors and anchorages.
The Technical Consultant will be responsible for compiling a detailed
inventory of existing reception facilities in ports and harbors in the Region.
This inventory will indicate which facilities are available in which ports and
will also indicate which facilities still have to be developed. All commercial
ports, harbors and anchorages in the developing countries of the WCR will be
included in the inventory.
(e)   Inventory of reception facilities in marinas. The Technical Consultant will be
responsible for compiling a detailed inventory of existing reception facilities in
marinas in the developing countries of the WCR. The inventory should focus
its attention on reception facilities for oily wastes and garbage.
(f)    Waste management systems assessment. The Technical Consultant will be
responsible for compiling a detailed inventory of existing waste management
facilities in the developing countries of the WCR as these relate to ports,
harbors and marinas. Details of shore-based waste collection, treatment and
disposal systems as they currently relate to or are likely to relate to port
reception of MARPOL Annex I,JI and V wastes will be collected and
analyzed. Assessment will be made as to the adequacy of current
arrangements. The Technical Consultant will collect any information
available on the issue, including the information available as a result of the
OECS Waste Management Project.
(g)   Technical requirements for enforcement. The results of the review of specific
technical requirements for the development of an effective system of
enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 regulations will be incorporated in the



- 12 -
enforcement strategy developed by the Legal Consultant for discussion at the
second legal workshop.
(h)   Waste reduction at source. The options for waste reduction at source, waste
recovery and recycling will be investigated by the Technical Consultant and
proposals made to encourage such initiatives. In collaboration with the Project
Coordinator, the Technical Consultant will organize the first technical
workshop for and in cooperation with the industry involved (e.g. packaging
industry, shipping and cruise lines, non-governmental organizations) to discuss
options for the reduction of wastes at source (in particular with regard to
limiting the amounts of packaging used for supplies). This first workshop will
also discuss the coverage and adequacy of existing reception facilities in the
Region.
(i)    Awareness Programs. Strategies will be developed by the Technical
Consultant in close coordination with the Project Coordinator, the Legal
Consultant and the IMO for developing public awareness programs to
appreciate the need for and benefits to be derived from the adoption of
legislation required to implement MARPOL 73/78, from compliance therewith
and participation therein, and from the provision of reception facilities.
'i)    Development of National or Regional Waste Management Strategies. The
Technical Consultant will be responsible for the development of waste
management strategies at a national and regional level where appropriate. It is
anticipated that generic strategies can be developed which will provide a
blueprint for the development of individual country strategies (e.g one for
small island states, one for large mainland ports etc.). The opportunities for
regional co-operation will have to be determined based on the experience of,
and in close co-operation with the OECS Waste Management Project. Options
for regional cooperation and the establishment of regional waste management
(e.g. by strategic treatment centers) need to be considered, taking into account
legal issues related to the export of wastes if wastes are to be treated at centers
servicing more than one port and more than one country.
(k)   Technical Criteria for Reception Facilities. All three relevant Annexes of
MARPOL 73/78 (1, II & V) provide guidance as to certain technical
requirements and necessary capacity for the different types of reception
facilities. The Technical Consultant will use these guidelines, the assessment
of existing reception facilities and discussions with national governments in the
region to develop technical criteria and guidelines for port reception facilities
in the region, and for the associated waste management systems. At the
second technical workshop the consultant would present for discussion the
typical waste management strategies and the proposed technical criteria for
reception facilities and associated waste management systems. Part of the
workshop would focus on the work currently undertaken by the IMO to



- 13 -
develop a manual on reception facilities and would involve companies active in
the field of constructing and operating such facilities. The objective would be
to discuss and further develop technical criteria for use in the developing
countries of the WCR. It could be useful to organize different sessions within
the workshop for the three different Annexes of MARPOL 73/78; priority
could then be given to reception facilities and waste management strategies for
Annex V wastes.
(1)    Economic and environmental impact. costs and cost-recovery of reception
facilities. The Technical Consultant, in collaboration with the Project
Coordinator, the Legal Consultant, an economist and NGO's would establish
guidelines for the evaluation of proposed port reception facilities and
associated systems for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastes in terms
of economic (and financial) feasibility, and environmental impact. The
guidelines would focus on methods for evaluating economic benefits, potential
cost recovery mechanisms,and the methodology for undertaking Environmental
Impact Assessments (EIAs) for the facilities and systems. The EIA guidelines
should focus in particular on the treatment and final disposal methods adopted
for MARPOL Annex 1, II and V wastes.
(m)   Assistance in the Operation of Reception Facilities and Waste Management
Systems.    The Technical Consultant, in discussion with regional and
international organizations, NGOs and national governments, will develop
mechanisms for assisting governments with the management, operation and
maintenance of their port reception facilities and associated waste management
systems. Inter alia, operational guidelines will be developed, and training
and problem solving seminars will be organized for operators of reception
facilities. These training sessions will also provide an opportunity to encourage
and promote regional harmonization in the operation of such facilities and
systems.
(n)   Identification of Key System Deficiencies and Potential Projects to Address
These Deficiencies. The Technical Consultant will, with the assistance of
governments, regional agencies, NGOs and consultants as necessary, identify
the key deficiencies in physical infrastructure and institutional arrangements
which constitute constraints to the provision of adequate port reception
facilities and associated waste management systems in each of the Wider
Caribbean countries. Attention will particularly be given to the organizational
aspects of reception and management of wastes, including the financial,
environmental and institutional elements of the systems and the requirements
for training of local staff. The Technical Consultant, in discussion with all
concerned parties, will then go on to identify actions and interventions
required to address these deficiencies. The third technical seminar to be
arranged by the Technical Consultant, in collaboration withJIMQ, the Project
Coordinator and the , will discuss national and regional deficiencies and the



- 14 -
potential projects and programs required to address these deficiencies. It is
anticipated that the potential projects and programs emerging from these
discussions would constitute Phase II of the project and will be carried forward
for presentation at the final WCISW Project Workshop.

evaluation of the economic and environmental impact of such facilities, waste
management (disposal, treatment, etc.) and other relevant issues.



- 16 -
X.   Second Technical Workshop (to be undertaken after 12 months after the first
workshop)
The Second Technical Workshop will discuss technical and economic issues
related to the operation of port reception facilities and waste management
systems, and associated requirements for economic and environmental
assessment and evaluation. The Technical Consultant will prepare a report on
the proceedings of this workshop focusing on agreed actions.
XI.   System deficiencies and potential remedial projects and programs
Based on the earlier review of existing reception facilities and associated waste
management systems (outputs III and IV), and on the outcome of the second
technical workshop, the Technical Consultant will co-ordinate efforts in the
developing countries of the WCR to develop projects and programs to address
these deficiencies.
XII.  Third Technical Workshop (to be undertaken within 6 months after the second
workshop)
The Third Technical Workshop will discuss the national and regional programs
and projects developed to enable the developing countries of the WCR to
comply with the requirements of MARPOL 73/78 under Annexes I, II and V.
The Technical Consultant will prepare a report on the proceedings of the
workshop identifying and defining potential "hardware" and "software" project
packages at the national and regional level. This report will be submitted to
the Project Coordinator who will consolidate it with a similar final report from
the Legal Consultant for distribution prior to the final workshop.
13.   All the work to be covered under the WCISW initiative is expected to conclude within
three years from the date of finalization of the contractual agreements with the
consultants. Following the third technical workshop and the second legal workshop,
the Project Coordinator, assisted by the two consultants, is expected to produce the
final WCISW document that defines all the activities and investments proposed for
Phase II of the initiative to be funded by donors, international and regional institutions
and national governments. This document will be tabled at the final workshop.

Wider Caribbean Initiative for
Ship-Generated Waste
Terms of Reference Legal Consultant



- 18 -
Action Program
The Legal Consultant's Task
1.   It is envisaged that the services of both legal and technical consultants will be required to
execute the Wider Caribbean Initiative for Ship-Generated Wastes (WCISW), supported by a
Project Coordinator based at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and that the legal and
technical services will be carried out, to the extent possible, in parallel. The legal consultant will
have to take cognizance of the fact that there is a variety of legal systems in the area, including
civil and common law systems, and that legislation will need, as appropriate, to be drafted in the
relevant languages (English, French, Dutch, Spanish).
2.    The services to be provided under the Terms of Reference of the Wider Caribbean Initiative
for Ship-Generated Wastes (WCISW) involve the completion of the following tasks to be carried
out by the Legal Consultant in cooperation with the Project Coordinator based at the IMO and the
Technical Consultant and the .
3.    Stage 1. Project Preparation
(a)   To identify the legal requirements available under MARPOL 73/78 and its Protocols
and any national laws for achieving its objectives and promoting compliance
available under other instruments, such as the London, Cartagena and Basel
Conventions and the Vina del Mar Agreement on Port State Control, paying
particular attention to their usefulness in achieving the Special Areas status accorded
to the WCR under Annex V of MARPOL 73/78.
(b)   To develop cooperation with IMO's regional advisers including national, regional
and international institutions involved in the issues addressed by the WCISW and to
coordinate activities with the relevant ongoing activities of IMO's regional advisers
as well as national and regional institutions in order to achieve optimal effectiveness
of the various activities and initiatives and to avoid duplication or incompatibility of
efforts or both.
(c)   To carry out studies and introductory fact-finding visits in order:
(i)  to identify and assess ongoing projects and the work of individuals and
organizations involved therein insofar as this is relevant to drafting and
implementation and enforcement of related legislation;
(ii)  to identify local lawyers and other experts who could be built into teams (task
forces) for drafting legislation taking into account the need to include, as
appropriate, technical and economic experts drawn from concerned
Government departments, shipping and port authorities, public health and
marine environment protection agencies;



- 19 -
(iii)  to evaluate the documentation provided by the developing countries of the
WCR to the Workshop held at the IMO from 11-13 October 1993 on existing
legislation and related matters, to identify gaps therein and to investigate the
reasons therefore during the fact-finding visits.
(d)   To carry out introductory and fact-finding visits relating to ongoing projects and
other work of persons and other organizations involved therein relevant to existing
legislation.
(e)   To make an inventory of and to review and evaluate existing legislation and policy
for the implementation of MARPOL 73/78 in the developing countries of the Wider
Caribbean Region, including related collection, treatment and disposal of ship-
generated waste and legislation relevant to promoting the "Special Area" status of the
WCR.
(f)   To analyze the reasons why several developing countries of the WCR have not
ratified MARPOL 73/78 and its optional Annexes.
(g)   To develop model legislation for the implementation and enforcement of MARPOL
73/78 that can be used by the developing countries of the WCR for the development
of national legislation, taking into account, to the extent appropriate, the "Guidelines
for the Drafting of Maritime Legislation" produced the United Nation's Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the diversity of
languages, legal systems and special requirements for some of the developing
countries of the WCR such as the preservation of the "fruit fly free" status of
Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines vis-a-vis the United States of America.
(h)   To develop a strategy to increase the level of ratification of MARPOL 73/78 and its
optional Annexes on the basis of the analysis indicated under f, in consultation with
other concerned resident advisers in the region and various concerned regional and
sub-regional organizations such as the CARICOM, and for development of the
necessary legislation to remedy the deficiencies of the State, as required.
4.    Stage 2. Activities Aimed at the Wider Caribbean Region
(a)   To make an inventory of and to assess current efforts for the enforcement of the
discharge provisions of MARPOL 73/78 (through port State control and monitoring,
surveillance and enforcement at sea in conformity with the requirements of
international law) by countries in the WCR, whether by means of administrative
measures or use of naval or air forces, non-military vessels or aircraft on official
Government duties.
(b)   To prepare a strategy to improve and coordinate efforts for the enforcement of the
discharge provisions of MARPOL 73/78 (through port State control and at sea) and



- 20 -
other means of compliance therewith by the developing countries of the WCR
individually or through cooperative efforts by all or several States based on the
analysis developed under (a), taking account of developments concerning the
conclusion of a Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control for the WCR
following the models of the Paris and Vina del Mar agreements.
(c)   To assist the Technical Consultant in the development of public awareness in the
need for and benefits to be derived from full compliance with MARPOL 73/78
Convention
5.    Stage 3. Activities Aimed at Individual States and Territories
(a)   To actively assist those States in the WCR which the evaluations have shown to have
no (adequate) national legislation for the implementation of MARPOL 73/78 and its
optional Annexes in the development or improvement of such legislation and the
building or improving of the required institutional arrangements for drafting of such
legislation and providing an effective maritime administrative administration for its
implementation, including by relevant Government departments, agencies and port
authorities.
(b)   To plan and assist in cooperation with the IMO, and other concemed international
and regional institutions, training sessions for legal draftsmen and others involved in
the drafting of legislation and technical regulations for the implementation of
MARPOL 73/78.
(c)   Similarly, to plan and assist training sessions for those involved in the enforcement
of MARPOL 73/78.
Scope of Work
6.    The activities to be carried out by the consultants, coordinated closely with IMO and the,
involved in the WCISW will include the preparation of data inventories and reports, drafting of
agreements and legislation, the convening of legal and technical workshops, visits and high level
missions to all developing countries of the WCR as and when possible.
Six workshops are envisaged in the WCISW:
two legal workshops, the first focusing on national legislation necessary for the
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 and the second focusing on enforcement of
MARPOL 73/78;
three technical workshops, the first focusing on the source reduction of wastes and
the existing provision for port reception of wastes in the region, the second focusing
on the strategy blueprints for reception and associated waste management systems



- 21 -
and technical criteria for reception facilities, and the third on the country-specific
key deficiencies identified, and possible mechanisms for addressing these
deficiencies; and
-     a final workshop to discuss the outcome of the WCISW, to discuss the actions
required to bring about full effectiveness of the special area designation of the
Caribbean under MARPOL, and to present these findings to the international funding
agencies.
7.   In recent years a considerable amount of work has already been undertaken on the review
and assessment of maritime legislation in the WCR (though mostly in relation to ship safety) and of
solid waste management systems by a variety of agencies including the IMO and regional bodies
and Governments. It is important that any consultants involved in the WCISW avoid duplication of
effort by reviewing in detail all studies carried out to date, by making full use of the results of the
work that has already been carried out and by coordinating their activities with others already
active in similar fields of activity in the WCR, including the IMO Regional Maritime Safety
Adviser for the Caribbean and the Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution (as indicated in the
following paragraph).
8.    The following list of persons, initiatives and activities is not exhaustive and provides an
indication of other initiatives and activities with which some form of coordination or cooperation
might be useful for the WCISW:
-     Caribbean Action Plan and the Cartagena Convention;
-     the IMO/Norway Cooperation Program's Regional Maritime Safety Adviser for the
Caribbean;
-     the Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution, Port Safety and Security (Wider
Caribbean) financed by the US Coast Guard;
-     IMO regional Coordinator on Marine Environment Protection for Latin America;
-     ROCRAM, ROCRAM/CA;
-     LEGISMAR project executed by the IMO and UNCTAD;
-     The OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) Waste Management Project;
and
-     the efforts by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to develop
a Manual on Reception Facilities.



- 22 -
Furthermore, several regional and sub-regional organizations in the WCR may be active in areas
that are relevant to the objectives of the WCISW.
9.    The scope of work of the various activities of the Legal Consultant outlined in the previous
chapter will be as follows:
10.   Legal Consultant
(a)   Identification of legal requirements and remedies. This effort is aimed at promoting
an appropriate national/regional legal and institutional framework to facilitate
compliance with MARPOL 73/78 throughout the WCR.
(b)   Cooperation and coordination. A small legal steering committee composed by the
Project Coordinator and the Legal Consultant, comprising high level representatives
from the WCR's Spanish, English, Dutch and French speaking countries will be
established to ensure progress of the WCISW, its Action Program and coordination
with other initiatives. The representatives should total as a maximum only five or six
persons drawn from Government Departments involved in drafting maritime
legislation (e.g. the Attorney General's Office, Departments of Transport, Finance,
Economic Affairs, Public Health, Environment. as appropriate), CARICOM, etc.
(c)   Studies and fact-finding regarding legislation and local expertise. Teams of legal and
other experts will be established in each country (or in combinations of countries) as
task forces for drafting legislation. As in the case of the steering committee, these
national task forces will include representatives skilled in and involved in drafting of
maritime legislation drawn from Government departments involved in this process
such as possibly Attorney General Offices, Maritime Transport Departments, Port
Authorities, Environment and Public Health Authorities as required for the particular
laws and regulations in issue.
(d)   Inventory of existing national legislation. The inventory and analysis will address
and take account of the following issues:
availability and adequacy of primary legislation that is relevant to maritime
legislation in general and to legislation for the implementation and
enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 in particular, taking due account of the
differences in the legal systems in the region,
current status of national legislation with respect to the prevention of marine
pollution from ships,



- 23 -
availability and adequacy of institutional and other administrative
arrangements in the maritime field in general and for the prevention of
marine pollution from ships in particular,
ongoing efforts to improve or develop maritime legislation in general and
legislation for the implementation and enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 in
particular, and
identification of developing countries of the WCR that will require assistance
or further assistance in improving or developing maritime legislation in
general and legislation for the implementation and enforcement of MARPOL
73/78 in particular including secondary legislation for implementation of its
Annexes and regulations.  A first legal workshop will be organized at a
later date to discuss such proposals or requests as have been made concerning
countries that require assistance in order to develop the necessary national
legislation and the form such assistance should take. The Legal Consultant
may him/herself offer assistance with drafting or arrange for a suitably
qualified (i.e. in respect of language and legal systems and maritime
expertise) expert to provide assistance. This workshop should also discuss
such strategies as have been proposed for increasing the level of ratification
of MARPOL 73/78. If the number of countries requiring assistance is high,
the workshop should consider identifying countries or groups of countries, or
both, for which pilot projects will be developed. The possibilities of model
legislation or guidelines for drafting maritime legislation should also be
considered at this stage and any drafts developed should be put before the
workshop.
(e)   Analysis of reasons why MARPOL 73/78 has not been ratified by some of the
developing countries of the WCR. By the time of the first legal workshop the
consultant, having reviewed the information available, including the information on
their national legislation made available to IMO by the delegates to the London
Workshop and appraised him/herself of deficiencies in the region concerning
legislation, will report his/her analysis of the reasons for this, which will be
discussed by the workshop with a view to developing and implementing a strategy to
overcome these.
(f)   Model legislation. Model legislation should be developed. The ESCAP Guidelines
for Maritime Legislation might form a basis for this but more specific and detailed
models are likely to be required which will take account of the differences in legal
systems and languages and the special requirements of particular countries. The
model legislation that is to be developed should provide a basis for harmonization on
a regional basis of the laws developed within each of legal systems (i.e. in each of
the different language and legal system areas) such as to enable an effective regime
for implementation and enforcement of MARPOL 73/78 throughout the region so



- 24 -
that no safe havens are created where otherwise illegal discharges may legally take
place.
(g)   MARPOL ratification strategy. The first legal workshop should discuss the strategy
to increase the level of ratification of MARPOL 73/78 as well as proposals
concerning which developing countries in the WCR should be given assistance for
the development of the necessary national legislation (as indicated under (c)).
(h)   Analysis of efforts to enforce and ensure compliance. An analysis of
enforcement/compliance efforts will be carried out after the necessary data have first
been gathered. A report thereon will be presented to the second legal workshop. The
analysis will relate to the types and number of vessels and aircraft used in
surveillance and enforcement, the number and nature of violations reported to flag
States concerned, the most cost-effective methods, the economic and practical
benefits of joint enforcement schemes, and identification of possible models for this.
Alternative methods of enforcement by inspections in port and reports to flag States
and IMO will also be analyzed as well as the possible harmonization of such
inspections as addressed in ongoing efforts by the IMO based on models such as the
Paris and Vina del Mar agreements.
(i)    Strategy to improve enforcement/compliance efforts. The second legal workshop
will discuss the strategy for the enforcement of the discharge provisions of
MARPOL 73/78 and decide on specific activities to be undertaken to that effect and
any other further institution building that may be required. The need for harmonized
criteria or guidelines for port inspections will be considered as will the
harmonization of fines and other penalties and sanctions throughout the WCR as a
whole.
(j)    Development of national legislation (including legal institution building). The first
legal workshop, if necessary divided in different sessions for the different language
and legal system areas, will discuss what laws need to be developed and, if possible,
where efforts should be directed in developing specific legal action programs for the
various countries and what special needs have to be provided for such as e.g.
Grenada's 'fruit fly free' status with the United States of America. Task forces will
be established nationally in each country, in consultation with the Legal Consultant,
consisting of local lawyers, technical and economic experts for the purpose of
drafting legislation to implement MARPOL 73/78, including the required
regulations. The likely need of outside assistance for these task forces will be
evaluated and discussed at the first legal workshop.
(k)   Training sessions for drafting of legislation. Training programs and/or problem
solving seminars, as and when appropriate, will be organized on a sub-regional basis
to assist legal draftsmen and others concerned in the enactment of legislation to solve



- 25 -
any problems they may encounter in developing this legislation for their respective
countries. To the extent possible, experts from the countries within the sub-regions
will be encouraged to assist each other by organizing such training and problem-
solving sessions or exchanging experts within the different language and legal system
areas. Such training sessions may be organized either in conjunction with the first
and second workshops or separately, according to which is determined to be the
most cost-effective option.
(1)    Training sessions for enforcement efforts. Training programs will be developed for
legal draftsmen, enforcement officers, port officials and others involved in the
enforcement processes, including surveyors and others operating the port State
inspection system introduced by MARPOL 73/78.OutpUtS
11.   The Legal Consultant will provide brief (2 to 3 pages) quarterly reports on the progress of
all activities relating to his/her scope of work based on a pre-agreed schedule of activities. These
will be submitted to the project Coordinator for consolidation with other progress reports to be
submitted to the IMO/.
Other specific outputs will be as follows:
12.   Stage 1.
i.    Legal Inventory.
A report will be published before the first legal workshop containing the following
elements:
-     an inventory and analysis of existing legislation for the implementation of
MARPOL 73/78 in all the developing countries in the WCR;
-     proposals for model legislation as appropriate for the different language and
legal system areas (French, English, Dutch and Spanish) in the developing
countries of the WCR;
-     an analysis of reasons why MARPOL 73/78 and/or its optional Annexes have
not been ratified (where appropriate);
-     a strategy to increase ratification of MARPOL 73/78 and its optional
Annexes.



- 26 -
II.   First Legal Workshop.
The first Legal Workshop will be held at the end of the first year after the
commencement of the contract. This workshop will discuss the Legal Inventory (see
I) and should result in:
the identification of countries that require assistance in order to develop the
necessary national legislation,
a strategy to increase the level of ratification of MARPOL 73/78, and
a strategy for the enforcement of and compliance with the provisions of
MARPOL 73/78.
13.   The Legal Consultant will prepare a report on the proceedings of the workshop identifying
all agreements reached.
14.   Stage 2 and 3.
III.   Enforcement and Compliance Report.
A report will be published before the second Legal Workshop containing an
evaluation of current enforcement efforts and a strategy to improve enforcement of
MARPOL 73/78.
IV.   Second Legal Workshop
The second Legal Workshop (to be held 1 year after the first workshop) will discuss
the Enforcement and Compliance Report and the status of MARPOL 73/78
ratification (status of activities agreed during the first workshop) and should result
in:
an agreed strategy to improve the enforcement and ratification of MARPOL
73/78 in the WCR, and
proposals for the harmonization of enforcement efforts and of fines and other
penalties and sanctions throughout the WCR.
The Legal Consultant will prepare a report on the proceedings of the workshop
identifying the follow up plan of action.
15.   All the work to be covered under the WCISW initiative is expected to conclude within three
years from the date of finalization of the contractual agreements with the consultants.
Following the third technical workshop and the second legal workshop, the Project



- 27 -
Coordinator, assisted by the two consultants, is expected to produce the final WCISW
document that defines all the activities and investments proposed for Phase II of the
initiative to be funded by donors, international and regional institutions and national
governments. This document will be tabled at the final workshop.

Program and provision of support to the legal and technical consultants.
(g)   To facilitate the execution of workshops, seminars and training sessions to be
undertaken as part of the WCISW.

(i)   Produce the final WCISW document, assisted by the Technical as well as the Legal
Consultant, that defines all the activities and investment proposed for Phase II of the
initiative to be funded by donors, international and regional institutions and national
governments. This document will be tabled at the final workshop.
Scope of Work
3.    The activities to be carried out by the consultants, coordinated closely with IMO and the,
will include the preparation of data inventories and reports, drafting of agreements and legislation,
the convening of legal and technical workshops, visits and high level missions to all the developing
countries of the WCR as and when possible.
Six workshops are envisaged in the WCISW:
two legal workshops, the first focusing on national legislation necessary for the
implementation of MARPOL 73/78 and the second focusing on enforcement of and
compliance with MARPOL 73/78;
three technical workshops, the first focusing on the source reduction of wastes and
the existing provision for port reception of wastes in the region, the second focusing
on the strategy blueprints for reception and associated waste management systems
and technical criteria for reception facilities , and the third on the country specific
key deficiencies identified, and possible mechanisms for addressing these
deficiencies; and
the sixth and final workshop to discuss the outcome of the WCISW, to discuss the
actions required to bring about full effectiveness of the special area designation of
the Caribbean under MARPOL, and to present these findings to the international
funding agencies.
4.   In recent years a considerable amount of work has already been undertaken on the review
and assessment of maritime legislation in the WCR (mostly in relation to ship safety) and of solid
waste management systems by a variety of agencies including the IMO and regional bodies and
Governments. It is important that any consultants involved in the WCISW avoid duplication of
effort by reviewing in detail all studies carried out to date and by making full use of the results of
the work that has already been carried out and by coordinating their activities with others already
active in similar fields of activity in the WCR, including the IMO Regional Maritime Safety
Adviser for the Caribbean and the Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution as indicated in the
following paragraph.

5.    The following list of persons, initiatives and activities is not exhaustive and provides an
indication of other initiatives and activities with which some form of coordination or cooperation
might be useful for the WCISW:
-     Caribbean Action Plan and the Cartagena Convention;
-     the IMO/Norway Cooperation Program's Regional Maritime Safety Adviser for the
Caribbean;
-     the Regional Consultant on Marine Pollution, Port Safety and Security (Wider
Caribbean) financed by USAID in conjunction with the US Coast Guard;
-     IMO Regional Coordinator on Marine Environment Protection for Latin America;
-     ROCRAM, ROCRAM/CA;
-     LEGISMAR project executed by the IMO and UNCTAD;
-     The OECS (Organization of Eastern Caribbean States) Waste Management Project;
and
-     the efforts by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to develop
a Manual on Reception Facilities.
Furthermore, several regional and sub-regional organizations in the WCR may be active in areas
that are relevant to the objectives of the WCISW.
6.    The scope of work of the various activities of the Project Coordinator outlined in the
previous chapter will be as follows.
7.    Project Coordinator
(a)   Selection of consultants. The Project Coordinator will, in cooperation with the
IMO, assist in the selection of the other long term consultants, one Legal Consultant
and one Technical Consultant
(b)   Cooperation and coordination with States and Territories. Two small steering
committees, one legal and one technical, composed by the Project Coordinator and
the appropriate Consultant, composed of high level representatives from the countries
of the WCR's Spanish, English, Dutch, and French speaking countries will be
established to ensure progress of the WCISW, its Action Program and coordination
with other initiatives. The representatives should total as a maximum only five or six
persons. The Project Coordinator will also assist the Legal and Technical
Consultants in collecting data from Caribbean States and Territories with regard to



- 32 -
the present situation regarding legislation, reception facilities and waste management
systems.
(c)   Cooperation and coordination with others involved. The two small steering
committees indicated under (b). will also be important to ensure coordination with
others such as international and regional organizations. The Project Coordinator will
be responsible for fostering regional cooperation through the project. It will be the
duty of the Project Coordinator to use the WCISW to encourage closer coordination
and the establishment of as many common approaches and standards as possible. The
Project Coordinator, supported by the steering committee (or steering committees),
will liaise closely with international and regional organizations and others involved in
work that might be relevant to the WCISW to ensure complementarily of WCISW
activities with those of others.
(d)   Development of necessary institutional arrangements. The Project coordinator will
set up the coordinative and support mechanisms necessary to ensure that the
consultants are able to complete the project tasks in an efficient manner. In
particular, the Project Coordinator will assist in setting up a system of contact points
in each country which will enable the consultants to organize their activities in each
of these countries effectively.
(e)   Overall administration of the project. The Project Coordinator will be responsible
for all administrative and monitoring of project progress including financial
allocations and disbursements, to be reported on a quarterly based as part of the
Quarterly Reports.
(f)    Organization of workshops. The Project Coordinator will, in discussion with the
legal and technical consultants (as appropriate), assist as necessary in the
development and organization of workshops and training sessions.
(g)   Progress reporting and final evaluation of the WCISW project. The Project
Coordinator will provide a quarterly report to WB and IMO describing progress and
achievement information on his own tasks and incorporating consolidated information
taken from the reports submitted quarterly by the Technical and Legal Consultants.
The Coordinator will also prepare a report evaluating project achievement on the
completion of the Study.
